00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2we have a new one now that is supposed to be better
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and use fallback instead of just switching to another font when CJK language is selected
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Why test servers are 6 people max?
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> we banned saavik @Pepe join now
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> :kek:
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Hello I would like to report a bug, on my version of DDrace network the textures won't load and all I see is white squares, can I ask how I can fix this error to be able to play?
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Could be related to my computer but still
04:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think I saw this error some days ago reported by someone else
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 are there any news on that one?
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (didnt follow that bug)
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Lancer James Wolvern we don't know yet if we are able to fix it, because it seems its only a bug for GPUs that only support OpenGL 1.4 and lower
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can use an very old DDNet version, DDNet 9.3, which can be found on ddnet.tw
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Sorry I don't use open gl, is there a setting to open the game with OLD OPENGL on it? My computer is older than 2010
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> And doesn't use open gl
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we use SDL2 which defaults to OpenGL 2.1, even tho setting older GL didn't gave any good results, atleast not for the other guy that tested it
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but you can ofc try if you want
04:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> > https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win32.zip
04:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in f1 you can then set gfx_opengl_major 1; gfx_opengl_minor 4;
04:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then restart
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nice updateðŸ‘Œ
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> we can have so many more special characters now
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Sooo it will fix?
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> have u tried
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> AHHHHH
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Ohh
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe its GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i really wonder what is the first version of ddnet that does not work @Lancer James Wolvern
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs there were basically never changes in the old renderer except 2-3 small ones
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Okay, I'll see if it worked
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Wait do I download that version? I got it on steam
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you dont need steam to run this game
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> here you can try basically any version existed
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. 9.2
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.2-win32.zip
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> might work
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Okay but what do I do? Why major open gl 4?
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> minor 4, major 1
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs opengl 1.4
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but nvm that, i probs wont work anyway
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Oh, okay. Lemmie try that
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ty
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if it doesnt work test 9.2
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and if that works we can slowly increase the version and see what does not work
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the easiest method
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Okay
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Sounds good, thanks
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> So what do a type?
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gfx_opengl_major 1; gfx_opengl_minor 4;
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Oh crap! I can't press F1 on my computer
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Is there another way to open the thing?
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why cant u
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can click on config_directory.bat
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can bind another key to toggle_local_console
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> And it's due to it being a system key instead
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> And okay
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u have a `fn` key?
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Function key?
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Yeah
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do fn+f1
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> ???? Why?
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because thats what the fn key is for xd
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Oh okay got it
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> using f1 key
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Thanks
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :happy:
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> No such command
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what version did u download
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 9.2?
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Idk
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win32.zip
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this one?
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> I'll just get help tomorrow
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well as you like, but easiest would be just test 9.2
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if that works test ddnet 10, and if that works too its probs the texture create
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Margineanu65 hey, would it be possible to test ddnet 9.2 and ddnet 10 and see if they both work?
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> I could give it a shot
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lancer James Wolvern> Later through
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah maybe the other guy will help me that would be ok too, he has the same problem ðŸ˜„
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> sad,and ok
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if thats just mipmap problem ez fix xd
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually i just need a proper way to identify what context is created, i hope glGetString(GL_VERSION) will work for these drivers
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @Learath2 I think I found out what was causing the bug that blocked the update on the client (I had it a long time ago and u helped me with it)
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> When I open ddnet from Windows search bar, I can't update
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> When I open it directly from the app, I can
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> 
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> It's probably some path thingy so I thought it might be the reason why Steam updates don't work sometimes for ppl
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, that could actually be possible
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Korean improved, Japanese improved -- this is good so far, but it's hard to call Japanese typing 'functional' :(
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> When I type press space for suggestions, there should be a pop up -- visual UI doesn't show up though it works, but can't see anything
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> 
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> When I press return to select the suggestion, it shouldn't trigger the 'chat all' hotkey -- temporary for me is just to rebind the chat all key to something else
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> When I type press space for suggestions in Japanese, there should be a pop up -- visual UI doesn't show up though it works, but can't see anything
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> 
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> When I press return to select the suggestion, it shouldn't trigger the 'chat all' hotkey -- temporary for me is just to rebind the chat all key to something else
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japanese is completely broken on macOS
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pinyin for chinese works
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Korean works
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Korean improved, Japanese improved -- this is good so far, but it's hard to call Japanese typing 'functional' and Korean is still pretty difficult because of no previews :(
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Korean improved, Japanese improved -- this is good so far, but it's hard to call Japanese typing 'functional' and Korean is still pretty difficult because of no 'preview typing' :(
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some asked for Pinyin tab completion though
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @Learath2 wow pretty crazy that Korean works on Mac
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Surprisingly Chinese Handwriting is the best one so far ðŸ˜„
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japanese is completely broken though and idk why. The completion boxes are all over the place too, SDL2 just has shit support for macOS IME
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> And honestly, the new font is far, far better -- whoever updated the font knows what they're doing
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pathos you can thank @TsFreddie
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah we should be using SDL_SetTextInputRect to get the IME in the correct plae
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah we should be using SDL_SetTextInputRect to get the IME in the correct place
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 that should be easy then
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was trying to fix the whole IME thing a couple weeks ago and it's actually a kinda interesting problem
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont even know how it looks
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are many odd corner cases you'd never think of
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Things like pressing f1 while chatting rules out any naive approach
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to make sure SDL is in text editing mode as long as there is a text editing field active
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But if you forget to get out of it, the input breaks
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i've done that before
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but created some problems
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @deen what's that for?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> one pinyin may correspond to hundreds of unicode characters, plus unihan database is far from complete.
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ so you can write "bei" and tab will match åŒ—äº¬ assuming there is a player with that name. Someone requested it
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> then do unicode to pinyin, not the other way around.
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I have my own dataset for my own input method
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> https://github.com/xkjd27/rime_jd27c/blob/master/Lambda/ZiDB/%E9%80%9A%E5%B8%B8.txt
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> you can grep out the pinyin.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> There should be a max ping in server filter by default, something like 150 maybe
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> actually. I can make a stripped version. so a pinyin only correspond to the common ones.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323> > There should be a max ping in server filter by default, something like 150 maybe
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323> @Ravie maybe dynamic, depending on how many servers you'll find
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I would just go with the highest one that can still be considered playable
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Well, I played dummy map on CHN server with ping 300 and finished the map w/o problems some time ago, so... "considered playable" is not so easily definable, especially with damn good antiping
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> https://pastebin.com/VU3gv12B
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yes, I understand
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> well it'd be better if you create two buffers for every names, one for displaying, one for searching.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but that's too much work i suppose.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is this supposed to be?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> also this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/530/commits
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it is reverted because it is incredibly broken. but it shows how we usually deal with editing states with cursors and stuff.
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> also SDL_SetTextInputRect doesn't work in fullscreen mode iirc.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that's disappointing
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> You hack sdl2
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> also sdl2 doesn't set ImmSetCandidateWindow. which is pretty useless
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> expose this, then you can render candidates in-game: https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/6b6170caf69b4189c9a9d14fca96e97f09bbcc41/src/video/windows/SDL_windowsvideo.h#L158
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> still, too much work.
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IME support in SDL seems rather weak
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the more I look at it the less appealing it looks
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> valve went pretty far with their IME supports for all their games
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but still many IME doesn't work under their game
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I really would like to help, but i'm crunching my thesis.
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :EeveeShy:
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so many chinese players but they dont come to this discord
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its blocked
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> you can login sometimes
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> not like they have a dedicated chinese server.
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do most of them know english?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i'd say less than 2%
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_mainland_China
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> ;)
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this ime stuff and chinese characters looks like a pain, lucky to not be a programmer in a asian country
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> abc best
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> +1
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :watermeron:
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> well, we can ignore other languages for the most part.
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wikipedia blocked haha
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> chinese developer doesn't usually do i10n anyway
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At least on macOS IME SDL_SetTextInputRect seems to work in fullscreen
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> The Discord app is completely blocked by the "GFW" Great Firewall (of China)
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> sad :c
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arent u in danger for chatting here
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki Take one look at rendering arabic text and you'll love all asian IME
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> watch out ur kidney
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> > Wikipedia blocked haha
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @Ryozuki if a service is popular and allows user content (comments/articles) then it is blocked
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > @Ryozuki Take one look at rendering arabic text and you'll love all asian IME
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 yea reverse text rendering or weird stuff i dont want to see that in my life
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but pretty much every services in existence have a chinese clone. so don't worry about it.
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :watermeron: they are doing "just fine"
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the discord counterpart
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe someone can create a community there
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with resources and stuff
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> WeChat?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> YY and QQ i guess. but those are way before discord tho.
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u use instead of youtube?=
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> QQ was more of an ICQ clone I think
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> > @Ryozuki if a service is popular and allows user content (comments/articles) then it is blocked

16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bilibili?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> 5 years ago, youku, today, bilibili
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ true, teeworlds has a chat :justatest:
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddracenetwork
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> so?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it's not popular nor well known
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> lol
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> ._.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> :FeelsBadMan:
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting stuff
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How big do we need to get before they send us a mail to inform us that we need to hook a proprietary blob to our chat feature to ensure "peace"?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> they don't send you anything
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> you're just gone
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> see ya
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ is it true you cannot display human related bones in video games
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess with DPI they don't even need a blob
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should not display a human skull tee
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but i'd say you should have at least a million users for the ppl "higher up" to notice
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> unless a screenshot of some "sensitive topic" is getting shared by thousands
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> someone make a racist map
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> more like you saying "free hongkong" in teeworlds, screenshot it, post it, get about a thousand "retweets" on some chinese socials.
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't get us banned in china please
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> you'd be gone by the next day
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's nice to see new players
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even tho I can't communicate with them at all
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but usually one persons "tweet" won't get noticed, so usually only the popular services gets banned
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is this a controversial screenshot?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/746377551689023498/unknown.png
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> lol
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> I have talked to a few Chinese players, most of them use WeChat.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> yes
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but wechat is more like messenger than discord..
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its good there is lots but sad u cant chat
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> Other services are blocked directly but since Wechat is apparently "safe" the government can't do anything about it
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to make a deep learning translator
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> well some of them are really stupid
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> builtin in ddnet
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i'd rather not seeing them chat
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was considering learning some chinese, it really is the hardest language I've ever encountered
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> we can't easily pick up any latin languages too
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> don't feel too bad.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Korean and Japanese weren't this tough
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> +1
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046> we can read japanese if there's like a lot of kanji.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> well a little bit
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> don't even need to learn anything
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tones are extraordinarily difficult for a westerner
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> I can read it a bit, but that's all I can do. After 5 minutes I always get a headache. xD
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ha
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In korean and japanese worst case you sound like a foreigner. Tone actually changes meaning in chinese
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> Chinese always sounds so evil compared to Japanese ._.
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> korean cool language :poggies:
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> > Tones are extraordinarily difficult for a westerner
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @Learath2 I think the "tone" language feature in chinese is significantly holding back music / poetry .
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but any lyrics or poetry done extremely right sounds like magic in chinese.
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> japanese AYAYA
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> so harry potter is an artist in china
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I imagine it'd be extremely hard to sing when you have to both use the correct tone and match the song tone
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it's really hard to get a rhyme that doesn't sound like trash while still being coherent
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> <a:PepeHmm:474852026140983306>
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> > I imagine it'd be extremely hard to sing when you have to both use the correct tone and match the song tone
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @Learath2 well that's the thing. we can only default to the first tone when singing
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is chinese rap a thing I wonder
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> @Learath2  yes its about how great china is XD
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> unless you incorporate the tone with your melody
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> that's like, hard af
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> > Is chinese rap a thing I wonder
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @Learath2 it is, some liked it, i hated it cuz it sounds so rough.
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> hiphop was a big thing for the past two years i think. i'm not a fan tho.
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I don't like chinese songs anyway
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but i just played to much games to enjoy "real music", i only listen to soundtracks and stuff, but that's just me
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :EeveeShy:
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like listening to music in languages I don't understand at all
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't understand anything, it can't distract you from work ðŸ˜„
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> well me too
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> then i learned English and lots of songs are ruined.
