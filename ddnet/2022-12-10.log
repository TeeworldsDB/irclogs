00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Please do not update to newest version (master) on ddnet server, until https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6107 is fixed: updating existing teamranks doesn't work
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 maybe you know a way to swap out a map but keep all player positions
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We are considering splitting Adrenachill 5 into 2 parts, but people are already nearly at 50%
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For team they can just save and load, but team 0 not
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think the best will be to set a few tiles as finish live with debugger
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try that on an empty server now
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 any idea how to access the right memory? 😄 First time I'm trying something like this
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have debugging symbols?
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can execute C++ with the print command
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> print (Server()->Map()->…)
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, need the coordinate next
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me open the map in the editor
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> x:915 y:268-272
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> game layer width is 1950
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it should be 1950 * 268 + 915, 1950 * 269 + 915, 1950 * 270 + 915, 1950 * 271 + 915, 1950 * 272 + 915
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these indices in the game layer
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> finish line index?
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pipou what number is finish line? 😄
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 34
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/5290193f1fe3f9fb91345fb95d4b35a027acbd13/src/game/mapitems.h#L137
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> print m_pTiles[1950 * 268 + 915].m_Index = 34
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> print m_pTiles[1950 * 268 + 916].m_Index = 34
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> print m_pTiles[1950 * 268 + 917].m_Index = 34
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> print m_pTiles[1950 * 268 + 918].m_Index = 34
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait, these are different x y than I told you
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> @deen index 34

01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what did not work?
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the finish
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Pipou is standing on the tile
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and he should get a time?
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I'm in practice
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. he's in race, hasn't cheated etc.?
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, did you get a message?
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that you would have finished?
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Nope, will try again
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Still nope
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😦
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and this is the game layer's tiles you're modifying?
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, I hope

04:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Someone deal with this idiot
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> I applied https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6111 yesterday evening 🙂
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Ah sorry, this one https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6110
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @nori so i am on wayland now. there is also a "allow tearing options" as expected
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> starting with xwayland vulkan also does not warn that there is no immediate mode 
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fps were good, around 13k
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but wayland clamped my FPS to around 1k and also vulkan warned that immediate not available
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i build mesa from source now its completely broken xD
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xwayland: it shows 1k fps for few seconds then 10k fps then 1k agian etc.
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wayland: basically like before
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i assume some packages are not ready yet. i dunno if the wayland protocol is only for the compositor, or under the hood also is a direct kernel call and i need to wait for a kernel update
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for now i cannot really test it yet, im not really sure if there is tearing with xwayland, but on 240hz with good fps tearing is hard to notice anyway :/
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'll try again next year xD
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but pure wayland there should be no tearing bcs vk falls back to mailbox
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i do not understand your comment here :( https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949#discussion_r1001743270 The inheritance is needed so it can be passed as a cnetbase pointer to the connection and the connection then can call netbase functions such as SendControlMsg like here
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/engine/shared/network_conn.cpp#L166
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> not sure how that relates to the ``m_aRequestTokenBuf`` variable the way i understood it is more about the method calling not a variable. Also what is so bad about the inheritance? I just implemented the changes from the upstream

14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no good to know 😄
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> there are also xwayland merge requests too so
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> not complete yet i guess :D
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we are close ^^

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The efficacy of layer 3 filtering of traffic in online games
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Wouldn't it be easy to write a server plugin that detects griefing attempts by players on other players?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> bruh what
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> what am I supposed to reply to that? that a player that applies force to another player which results in them going into the freeze and ending up respawning isn't a factor you could go after?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> what am I supposed to reply to that? that a player that applies force to another player which results in them going into the freeze and ending up respawning isn't a factor you could go after? If such a player doesn't get reported manually, a specific threshold could be reached within a specific time.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> what am I supposed to reply to that? that a player that applies force to another player which results in them going into the freeze and ending up respawning isn't a factor you could go after? If such a player doesn't get reported manually, a set threshold could be reached within a specific time. that eliminated false positives as well.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> what am I supposed to reply to that? that a player that applies force to another player which results in them going into the freeze and ending up respawning isn't a factor you could go after? If such a player doesn't get reported manually, a set threshold could be reached within a specific time. that eliminates false positives as well.
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> what about people joking, people playing in playground, people respawning for other reasons
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> people joking wouldn't keep them in the freeze, would they? also when in team 0, and you are surrounded by other players, "joking around" is basically blocking. could be applied to a specific area. people respawning for another reason won't have force applied to them by griefer A.
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I think what you are asking for would be hard to implement and could give many false positives for various reasons
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I mean that's what you got smart minds for to think out very specific logic that would only apply to people grieving people. a threshold is what should prevent legits from getting banned. the aimbot detection got a threshold as well. you will get warned, not banned on the first offense.
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> 
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> it could also be used to not punish people first hand, but letting it inform humans to check it out.
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as soon as a human has to check it, its not an improvement
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and fully automated is hard bcs it depends also on where in the map you are
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if someone trolls during hammer hits its basically impossible to detect
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also some noobs might not even block but are simply too bad
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> train a AI that studies behavior of bad and good players
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> it's not about blocking persé, but about a single person killing half of the server. getting banned multiple times by vote, etc.
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u have a slight chance it would work out
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> by all means if you think that you have the knowledge to program what you want then go ahead
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> might check out the server code for that. but I focus more on the client-side atm.
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean it would definitely work on that one multeasy spot
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you tell apart a genuine fail from a block though?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are many faily parts where a tee can hook another tee into freeze and that the other tee has to reset because of a fail
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Indeed
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea but we are talking about something reoccurring
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> say, some guy on Kobra for example, that keeps killing people at the start of the map
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea but we are talking about something reoccurring. not a single "kill".
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If his name is Learath2 then we know its a block. Ez prediction. 😌
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ^
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Just needs an if statement to do the job.
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Start of the map makes sense to you and me. Computers, not so much
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I mean if it was that easy then it would already be implemented
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also I see a lot of novices failing on the second part of kobra trying to help eachother
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> But I think that's in the nature of the game. One needs to invest time to increase skill. I remember how bad I was, still am!
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> nah that doesn't contribute to the discussion
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> you basically are saying: get good or get banned by some new anti-grief system
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it's not very very easy to write an algorithm to catch this. The best I can think of is just keeping track of how many times someone killed after being put in freeze by a player and mods can use that counter as more information
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast, I can't imagine an algorithm consistent enough to be trusted to ban people
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Love to chat but gtg ice skating. Cheers!
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> you would have to test one first to say that
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> i believe it should be pretty clear with a big enough threshold
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> legit people get flagged rarely for aimbotting as well
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> so less accurate systems are already in place
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> so less accurate systems are already in place that CAN punish people
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> so less accurate systems are already in place that CAN punish people. but you haven't heard of any complaints. because the system currently in place for that is so good that this false-positive happens too rare to bother. and you won't get banned if you get triggerbot flagged once in 10 minutes or something.
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> nor should such a grief system check be active on players that haven't been tried to get kicked by the others, eliminating legit "accidents" or how you would want to call it.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean, how am I supposed to test one if I can't come up with one?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unless you are suggesting you'll implement it, in which case I wouldn't mind doing a trial run of it

20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> off to industry or doing a postdoc now?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> 1. maybe keeping track of how many hammers / hooks there is between 2 players? That's usually how fights are (even tho players you are just "playing around" would also be here).
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> 2. If a player gets hooked into freeze, there are players alive close the him, but he stays in freeze for X (a lot) of seconds, that would be blocking?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> 
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> Anyways, I feel like any "blocking algorythm" would still a human vote (with less votes to be successful) to confirm if a player is really blocking. Unless it's a really good trained ai xD.
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> But yeah, as long as we have mods... it not too much of an issue?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: if you move that variable out of the class and inside the function, the methods don't have to be class methods anymore and can be static instead
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So you'd just teach blockers to hide their behavior better. I prefer blockers who just stand around start and block everyone over those who play map normally and kill everyone 1 part before finish
