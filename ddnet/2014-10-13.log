14:40 <+pause> Hello
14:40 <@deen> hi
14:42 <@EastByte> hello there
14:44 <+pause> Is everything going well ?
14:46 <@EastByte> like always
14:46 <+pause> I mean, no more constant DoS threat ? =P
14:46 <@EastByte> currently not but the new hoster of fra has had pretty much downtime the last days
14:47 <@EastByte> one hour after the tournament yesterday it was unreachable^^
14:48 <@EastByte> but there seem to be no attacks at all
14:48 <+laxadedi> pause: I am coming next sunday ?
14:48 <+laxadedi> pause: address + time of arrival you want
14:50 <+laxadedi> EastByte: see ? This pause is a guy and is way less complicated than Anqel !
14:50 <+pause> EastByte: Good news then =)
14:50 <@EastByte> laxadedi: so it's gonna be a romantic date?
14:50 <+pause> laxadedi: Who's anqel ?
14:50 <+laxadedi> No xD
14:50 <+laxadedi> anqel is a german female 
14:50 <+pause> laxadedi: Is that a girl laxa ? Wow !
14:50 <@EastByte> pause: I girl I'm flirting with and laxa seems to be jealous
14:50 <+laxadedi> Who currently don't wanna meet me
14:50 <+laxadedi> EastByte: xD, go on man !
14:50 <+pause> laxadedi: s/currently//
14:51 <+laxadedi> ...
14:51 <@EastByte> deen: hmm ovh should build up datacenters in germany :)
14:51 <+pause> laxadedi: Pics ?
14:51 <+laxadedi> I am at work
14:51 <+pause> Or you know it did not happen
14:51 <+laxadedi> no pics right now
14:52 <+pause> EastByte: You don't know how much dirt-digging i had to do in order to get a picture of laxadedi's siter
14:52 <+laxadedi> I am not even sure I have pics of her, only face picture at least
14:52 <+pause> But there she was, playing with paint and all
14:55 <@deen> EastByte: yes, in frankfurt please
15:19 <@EastByte> deen: does a vps provider give a shit about how much ram you are using?
15:20 <@EastByte> I mean someone could just keep reserved all memory from the moment it's possible
15:21 <@EastByte> so the virtualizer can't take it away anymore
15:21 <@deen> i guess internally they give a shit
15:21 <@deen> well, in iran they can take it away anyway
15:21 <@deen> and our memory just gets swapped then
15:21 <@EastByte> okay swapping is bad
15:21 <@deen> we tried disabling swap and using all memory and then the OOM killer just takes us down^^
15:22 <@EastByte> meh :/

17:04 <+pause> Wrong terminal
17:14 <+pause> laxadedi: laxatoorrrr ! Working today ?
17:15 <+pause> laxadedi: I sent you the location on privmsg
17:57 < laxa> pause: always :p
18:00 < laxa> I have a great idea of plugin for nimda !
18:01 < laxa> !sms num text
18:01 < laxa> But need to find a public api to send sms yet xD
18:07 <+pause> laxa: Good luck with that...
18:07 <+pause> laxa: Just think about potential abuse
18:07 < laxa> if there is a public API, then there is no more abuse with nimda than with the API I guess
18:07 <+pause> That's why those APIs do not exist
18:08 < laxa> http://textbelt.com/
18:08 < laxa> sure thing :p
18:09 <+pause> laxa: Well this guy is going to have a bad surprise when the likes of vali hear of him
18:10 < laxa> French cellphone supported apparently
18:12 <+pause> laxa: Well try to use it, but don't expect it to last forever, or even a long time
18:12 < laxa> I'll spam you xD
18:13 < laxa> https://github.com/typpo/textbelt
18:14 < laxa> their api is in Javascript
18:17 < laxa> Hum, sent 2 messages, none received :(
18:20 <+pause> Surprising !
18:20 < laxa> free isn't suppose to be supported
18:37 <+pause> laxa: Would you come to my orchestra representations ?
18:37 < laxa> No thanks xD
18:37 <+pause> laxa: idiot -_-
18:37 <+pause> Try to listen to good stuff once in your life !
18:38 < laxa> xD
18:38 <+pause> And there's women playing, and even singing !
18:38 <+pause> Maybe you could talk to them about teeworlds, they like that kind of stuff
18:38 < laxa> You told me they are 50 or something xD
18:38 <+pause> Not all of them
18:40 <+pause> laxa: You don't even want to see me play ? =(
18:40 < laxa> Maybe
18:41 <@EastByte> you play an instrument?
18:41 < laxa> just tell me a date and I'll see
18:41 <+pause> EastByte: Yes, i play Oboe =)
18:41 < laxa> he plays with his dick
18:41 <+pause> laxa:And the instrument is your sister i presume ?
18:41 <@EastByte> cool
18:41 <+pause> laxa: Sorry for this one but you almost asked for it !
18:42 <+pause> laxa: We're playing this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVPYEyVqUAI
18:42 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: W. A. Mozart - KV 65 (61a) - Missa brevis in D minor | Rating: 5.00/5.00 | Views: 8,535
18:42 <+pause> And another Mozart piece
18:44 < laxa> EastByte: what's your operator ?
18:44 < laxa> phone operator
18:45 <+pause> laxa: I hope you're listening to what i've linked, it's still possible to save your soul
18:45 < laxa> pause: yes I am... Stop spamming me xD
18:46 < laxa> Apparently this API doesn't send real text messages
18:46 < laxa> Or I am misunderstanding the concept of it
18:46 <+pause> laxa: No, it's sending mails to operators APIs
18:46 < laxa> Anqel received a message that asked to send a message to get a mail xD
18:46 < laxa> So, it's not what I am looking for right ?
18:46 <+pause> laxa: It's even sending mails to EVERY operator mail API
18:46 < laxa> xd
18:46 <+pause> Which is a rather bizzare implementation, maybe because he does not know which operator to pick ?
18:47 <+pause> Also, it's spawning a sendmail process for every mail sent
18:47 <+pause> SMS * OPERATORS = too much processes
18:51 < laxa> pause: so date of your fucking annoying shit ?
18:52 <+pause> laxa: I'll tell you, but it's in january
18:52 < laxa> Oh...
18:52 <+pause> laxa: And it's not annoying
18:52 <+pause> laxa: You should play music, it's relaxing
18:52 < laxa> I do handjobs, it's relaxing too
18:53 <+pause> Wow, wtf ?
18:53 < laxa> on myself only xD
18:55 < laxa> I found something that looks promising https://www.nexmo.com/tour/two-way-sms.html
18:56 <+pause> laxa: Looks also non-free
18:56 < laxa> "try it for free" ?
18:58 <+pause> "Sign up and we'll give you FREE credits to test first."
18:58 <+pause> You'll be able to send some, then no more
18:58 <+pause> Not really useful for a constant service
18:58 < laxa> Yeah :(.
18:59 < laxa> wow ! 5 cents for each sms
18:59 < laxa> not that free :p
19:01 <+pause> laxa: Try to see if you can get free credits if you give them handjobs
19:01 < laxa> <_<
19:04 < laxa> http://blog.mashape.com/list-of-50-sms-apis/
19:09 < laxa> I really was having thinking we could do that in the future
19:09 < laxa> !sms vali "Deen is greeting you, have a nice day"
19:12 < laxa> I found a website that finally works, but there is a captcha xD
19:21 < laxa> Well, I guess I have to forget this idea, this won't work for free at least :(.
19:45 <@heinrich5991> laxa: what are you searching for? a way to send texts for free? a way to receive them for free?
19:45 < laxa> send them for free, without captcha

20:13 < laxa> oh
20:13 < laxa> I'll look into that later

20:51 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
20:58 <@deen> GER down
20:58 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
20:59 <@deen> ok, wasn't a ddos i think
20:59 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
21:00 <@deen> laxa: if you want to improve nimda even more, print the last network activity before the server went down
21:04 < laxa> wut, how ?
21:04 <@deen> the json file includes the info
21:04 < laxa> oh
21:04 <@deen> you could store it, and once it goes down print the last value
21:04 <@deen> then we could immediately see if it was a ddos or not
21:04 < laxa> well, the last value would be 60 seconds before
21:04 < laxa> not sure that's relevant
21:05 <@deen> ah, that's too long ago, ok
21:05 <@deen> i thought you poll every second :P
21:05 < laxa> lol
21:05 < laxa> you would be even more spammed I guess
21:05 <@deen> website even polls every 2 seconds
21:09 < laxa> Oh god...
21:09 < laxa> I'll have to modify my regex for the map release :(
21:09 <@deen> just leave out the mapper name? :P
21:09 < laxa> Not !
21:09 < laxa> I won't cheat :p
21:10 < laxa> $regex = '#(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}).+href="(\/ranks\/(moderate|novice|solo|brutal|oldschool)\/\#map-[^"]+)"><span title[^>]+>([^<]+)(.+mappers[^>]+>([^<]+))?#';
21:10 < laxa> :)
21:10 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
21:10 <@deen> you could also capitalize moderate/novice and so on
21:11 <@deen> Moderate would read nicer :P
21:11 < laxa> I can do that, it's easier
21:12 < laxa> well no
21:12 < laxa> you say that cause you are german :)
21:12 < laxa> I'll try to keep text as english as possible
21:12 <@deen> Moderate is English!
21:13 < laxa> Not in the middle of a phrase :)
21:13 <@deen> "Moderate" is a proper name
21:13 < laxa> I think it's better without capitalization :)
21:16 <@deen> no.
21:16 <@deen> :P
21:16 < laxa> <_<
21:18 < laxa> Done :(
21:44 < laxa> deen: can you make a test release with at least 2 mappers please ? :)
21:47 < laxa> nevermind, I am going to test locally

22:15 < laxa> I get another problem now
22:16 < laxa> The UTF-8 chars are fucked when I get the page, they are like this : -60-B-181-mM-62-
22:16 <@heinrich5991> laxa: have you checked the http headers?
22:16 <@EastByte> laxa: just let deen return some nice json
22:17 < laxa> EastByte: I guess that won't change anything.
22:17 < laxa> heinrich5991: nice idea, thanks.
22:17 <@EastByte> it's not like you have to work against him
