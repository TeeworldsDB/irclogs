00:51 <@deen> laxa: how does it need mysql?!
00:52 <@deen> if it does, i probably made a mistake somewhere
00:52 < laxa> well, for release, seems quite accurate, but for client_release
00:52 <@deen> how do you know it needs mysql?
00:52 < laxa> will, it tries to import the file
00:52 < laxa> can't find it
00:52 <@deen> what file? what's the message?
00:53 < laxa> about the import
00:53 <@deen> ?
00:53 < laxa> wait ^^
00:54 < laxa> downloading sources to get the message again
00:54 <@deen> you could also tell me what to do to get the message
00:55 < laxa> I am getting a small portion of the sources, cause it's too heavy to get all dll
00:55 < laxa> that's probably why it doesn't work I guess
00:55 < laxa> import mysql.lua fails
00:55 <@deen> yeah, not really supported to build ddnet with half the directories missing
00:56 < laxa> Well, size with mysql.dll is doubled
00:56 <@deen> you also can't build the server if you remove the client libraries
00:56 <@deen> and it was like that forever in TW
00:56 < laxa> Well okay :(
00:57 < laxa> Is there anything to do to compile x64 on windows for ddnet client also ?
00:57 <@deen> don't understand
00:57 <@deen> just run "bam client_release"
00:58 <@deen> if you have a 64bit compiler, it will be a 64bit binary
00:58 < laxa> I need 64bit library for that right ?
00:58 <@deen> what 64bit library?
00:58 <@deen> they should all be bundled, DDNet is built for 64bit windows after all
00:59 < laxa> Hum
01:00 < laxa> Maybe it's my compiler
01:00 <@deen> what compiler?
01:00 < laxa> VS2010
01:00 <@deen> no idea, only tried mingw =/
01:01 < laxa> What change do you have switching to x64 ?
01:01 <@deen> none, i just use a 64bit mingw

02:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: Hm, I think I said that we shouldn't have a server settings editor inside the editor
02:18 <@deen> and these maps are no longer compatible with other mods, are they?
02:34 <@deen> maps are written into an actual file? i thought you said they would be in memory only
02:35 <@deen> hm, this adds a lot of complexity, will increase traffic on servers. not sure
02:39 <@deen> since people will then edit configs in the editor, i can't get them out anymore and just edit them on the server
08:39 <@EastByte> deen: still, I think this is the proper way of having map specific configs
08:40 <@EastByte> and editing the configs on server just requires a little tool
10:04 <@deen> EastByte: =/
10:05 <@deen> i never liked that you have to open the editor to edit a map, and now we're moving more into the editor even
10:06 < Learath2> well how would you edit a map without an editor ?
10:07 <@deen> with a text editor and file system tools
10:08 < Learath2> we wouldnt have many mappers left i guess
10:08 <@deen> and a map would just be a zip file with a text file for each layer, the images, the sounds and config
10:09 <@deen> that would solve quite a few problems mappers have all the time
10:10 <@deen> can easily check if images are dilated, can extract images easily, config file can be edited with copy&paste function instead of typing inside the editor
10:11 < Learath2> that actually sounds nice
10:14 < Learath2> could be done even if a way of converting between the old and new maptype is found
10:14 <@EastByte> yes, storing all elements of a mapfile in an archiv indeed sounds nice
10:15 <@deen> that would also fit well with the idea of sending only the parts of a map that the client doesn't have yet
10:15 < Learath2> huh just sending half the zip or what ?
10:16 <@EastByte> not sending the zip but sending it's elements
10:16 <@deen> right, and the client knows which of those elements it has already and skips those
10:19 <@deen> oh, and vim can edit the files inside zips automatically, so i could use that on the server easily
10:20 < Learath2> aaaand im back at circular dependency
10:20 < Learath2> me and oop dont seem to get along too well
10:21 <@deen> i don't like oop either 
10:49 <@EastByte> Learath2: just avoid modules importing each other circularly :p
10:49 <@EastByte> I don't see how this has to do with oop

23:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: the maps are still compatible with other mods
23:18 <@heinrich5991> the maps are written into actual files because that required less change of the CDatafileWriter/Reader interface
23:19 <@heinrich5991> should probably make a tool to extract the server cfg
23:19 <@heinrich5991> deen: or I could extract the map config into the relevant cfg on map load, if that's better
23:20 <@heinrich5991> (I think the complexity introduced is inherent in the backward-compatiblity with placing map configs next to the maps)
23:21 <@deen> hmmm
23:22 <@deen> i guess I should pull after all
23:23 <@deen> not every server operator will be nice enough to upload the configs somewhere and it's much easier if it's bundled with the map
23:26 <@heinrich5991> (that would be awesome!)
