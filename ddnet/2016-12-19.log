20:25 < feklka> heeleleloo
20:25 <@heinrich5991> hi :)
20:25 < feklka> hey henrich
20:26 < feklka> Do you guys know how to get the soruce for DDRace server
20:26 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
20:26 <@heinrich5991> you can download it using git there
20:26 <@heinrich5991> or from https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
20:27 < feklka> i love you
20:36 < feklka> anyone know how to get test commands  with gametype seen as DDrace?
20:36 < Henningstone> hack it!
20:37 < Henningstone> just kidding. Can be changed here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/98a2f459b6bf0a1df55a081e750e3678844b524b/src/game/server/gamemodes/gamemode.h#L7
20:37 < feklka> xD
20:37 < feklka> haha ur the best bro
20:39 <@heinrich5991> feklka: you should call your gamemode different then
20:41 <@EastByte> ^ the ddnet client does not recognise ddnet then, or was that fixed, yet?
21:28 < feklka> Thanks for that, I have now got test cmds with server type DDrace
21:49 <@deen> feklka: That's illegal!!!
21:52 <@EastByte> by greyfox's law not ours ;)
22:53 < eeeee> so unethical.. if only we had some masters to ban him from :(
22:56 < Henningstone> well who cares, nobody besides him is gonna play on his server anyway I guess…
22:58 <@EastByte> funny '…' requires 3 bytes utf8 encoded and represents 3 characters in one :o
22:59 < Henningstone> oh it does? never checked that actually, although I often use it :D
22:59 < Henningstone> just like øıŋĸ, wonder how many bytes that are :P
