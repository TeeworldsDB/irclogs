13:56 < necropotame> I think there is a bug when the 10.4.1 was released. The version needed for the new racetick was set to 10.4.2, probably to disable it. But the effect is that nobody got the correct version and so the broadcast fallback is used
13:57 < necropotame> ^ deen heinrich5991 EastByte
15:49 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: care to make a PR that fixes it?
16:17 < CookieMichal> Hello, why did someone decide to broadcast time?
16:17 < CookieMichal> It was good where it was
16:17 <@EastByte> it's a bug
16:18 < CookieMichal> And you release bugged version of client/server?
16:23 <@EastByte> yup, and it was introduced by the release number 10.4.1 (which should have been 10.4.2 if I understand correctly)
16:25 < necropotame> heinrich5991, I'm not at home :/ You just have to bump the version so it will fit the version requirement for racetick. That's what I've understood from the code
16:26 <@heinrich5991> and I'm learning for an exam :P I'll do it tomorrow
16:26 <@EastByte> and I'm learning for two exams
16:30 < CookieMichal> u can bump it on github? like open new tab and change ;-;
16:31 <@EastByte> the main problem is that the fix requires a gameserver restart
16:34 <@EastByte> necropotame: actually I don't understand it, the gametimer seems to be enabled when the version is >= 10041 which should be the case on an up-to-date client?
16:48 < CookieMichal> isn't there a script that restarts server when it's empty?
16:53 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:53 <@EastByte> yes, sure but some servers only get empty once per 12 hours
16:54 <@heinrich5991> and apparantly the root cause of the bug hasn't been found/identified/looked for, if I read EastByte's message correctly
17:03 < redix> The commit was added after the 10.4.1 tag. So is the code even in the client release? 
17:04 <@EastByte> oh it was?
17:05 < redix> And ob the other hand... Why is the code already running on the server? 
17:06 < redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commits/10.4.1
17:06 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/b841fdc203462d3089a2b8a254be9f4f81c485e5
17:06 <@EastByte> what's about this?
17:07 <@EastByte> well it makes sense now
17:07 <@heinrich5991> ok, so the problem is that there isn't a client release yet? ^^
17:07 <@EastByte> we should have some sort of policy on what version is supposed to run on the official servers^^
17:07 < redix> If the code is not in the release the commit is completely correct. But the server is running on newer code 
17:08 <@EastByte> yes, it is
17:09 <@EastByte> I could just step back a few commits on the servers but I also don't know why acb1ada28c22919ee63b37c75675636cc2bd15e3 is running in production
17:10 < Ryozuki> yep, i changed game version to .2 and it doesn't show the timer
17:12 < Ryozuki> usually projects have a "master" branch (production) and a dev branch
17:12 < Ryozuki> mb we should do same?
18:59 <@deen> EastByte: official servers always run git HEAD, that's the policy
19:38 <@EastByte> deen: so, in order to fix this issue we either quick release the next version or we change that policy (I can't think of anything else)
19:41 <@heinrich5991> it's not really breaking anything. let's do a release soon and be done
19:41 <@heinrich5991> you can disable the race timer if it annoys you too much btw
20:04 <@deen> so i just need to release?
20:04 <@deen> or anything missing?
20:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: no, should be good. the next version should be >= 10042, but I guess there's no way around that :)
20:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vylSM
20:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master de7587b def: Version 10.4.2
20:23 <@EastByte> works for me
