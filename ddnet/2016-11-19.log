01:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 49127a2 def: Initialize int to fix compiler warning
01:42 < laxa> Your welcome
01:43 < laxa> Shouldn't CI block this kind of errors ?
01:43 < laxa> well, warning
01:43 <@deen> only if we elevated these warnings to errors
01:43 <@deen> which is not such a great idea. update compiler and suddenly 500 new warnings
01:44 <@deen> gcc 7 warns about mixing tabs and spaces i think
01:44 < laxa> wow
01:45 <@deen> because that leads to confusable indentation which was the cause of actual security vulnerabilities
01:45 < laxa> really ?
01:45 < laxa> there was a recent vulnerability found ?
01:46 <@deen> dunno, i was thinking about stuff like apple's goto fail
01:47 < laxa> I am into security things on my free time
01:47 < laxa> haven't paid enough attention to that
01:47 <@deen> security is such a fuzzy topic
01:47 < laxa> Yes indeed
01:48 <@deen> always new attack vectors no one thought about yet
01:48 < laxa> there will always be exploits as long as we use C/C++ anyway
01:48 <@deen> like when timing attacks first appeared, or suddenly unix commands were accessible over the internet
01:48 < laxa> Race conditions are really hard to find and trigger
01:49 <@deen> well, you can use a memory secure language, but you always have to pay a price for it, be it performance or more complicated development
01:51 < laxa> that's the thing yeah
