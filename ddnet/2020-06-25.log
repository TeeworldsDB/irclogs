00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen another bug, hook is still fully rendered if spec tee is specced on ground while hooking
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725478504036171866/screenshot_2020-06-24_17-32-17.png
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> lol it's possible to move while in spec
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @louis thats Definitely not a bug
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> cuz ur hook is still alive when u get back
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @ᶰ°Konͧsti it should be transparent
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Can someone tell me why this isnt work or do something ? :x
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> ```     if (m_TileIndex == TILE_EMOTE_SPAM || m_TileFIndex == TILE_EMOTE_SPAM)
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f>     {
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f>         if (Server()->Tick() % 40 == 0)
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f>             GameServer()->SendEmoticon(m_pPlayer->GetCID(), 1);
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f>     } ```
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i put that in the mapitems too, and i put the tile in the map
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Np i fixed it
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> How can i help with translation on the game?
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> oh that makes sense
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> map sounds don't work in 0.7?
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also since when was there a swear filter for /save :justatest:
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, they don't
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there isn't
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725603755290001418/screenshot_2020-06-25_01-50-05.png

08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when i try "/save shit" or "/save fuck" it turns into 3 random words lol
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lol
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that means the save code already exists, i think
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that's a leak
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's fine since the possibilities are still too many
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well good luck figuring out the name associated to it
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> xd
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> IIRC the last time I used /save it simply informed that the passcode was already taken, though obviously not by who
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so it was easier to just add like one character than remember 3 random words xd
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also fixed that u wouldnt see hook
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u connected and he was in spec
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki syltoox reported a couple issues, apparently spectee doesnt care about teams and solo at all
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also funny consequence of us waiting for it to stop before killing off the character entity, the outlined spec tee can be seen moving around :D
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also happens if you go on top of the head of a tee and spec
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you should check that the character is not active before rendering spectee
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, I think the server should only send the spectee if the tee is not there
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the client should only display the spectee if the server sends it
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would make the code more complicated
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a simple fix right now
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2361/commits/2922b4b6720a787d97f026bc085ea0903621dc5b
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 " syltoox reported a couple issues, apparently spectee doesnt care about teams and solo at all" what does this mean? u dont want to see spectee of other teams?
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki can spectees even hook?
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spectees can have a hook
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can spec while hooking someone or the ground
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> spectee should care about showothers like any other tee, no? you probably shouldn't see spectees of teams that you don't see
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> Why cant two names have the same save pw?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the database column differentiating saves is only the PW
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Probably to keep the queries simple
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki got a map where /spec is active?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just go to my server
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk one rn
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also on ddnet u wont see the hook cuz its not fixed there
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the code kinda takes into account otherteam
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u sure syltoox is not using a bot client :troll:
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis can you tell me a map with /spec enabled?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```[11:24 AM] Syltoox: - If im in another team, I can still see other people in /spec
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [11:24 AM] Syltoox: - Can see tee's outline which are in /spec in a solopart```

10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ty
10:46 <+ChillerDragon> i actually didnt know that i thought everyone uses 123 or asd as save password
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725633111404183552/unknown.png
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's with showothers off, I wonder what's going on for him
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is fng server open source?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki also, apparently the spectee is moving up and down slightly for some reason
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> @nori there are multiple open source versions of fng thats also why it was named openfng at some point i guess. But the currently most played onbgy fng is closed src
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been encouraging @onby to move to the antibot blob like ddnet is using
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm @Ryozuki I don't see the circle at all
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make sure u are on a 14.0 server
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently I do, the background of lockdown just makes it impossible to see
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😤
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might want to add a bright outline?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 not moving

11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to reproduce
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see u there
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see u correctly
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just jumped high, hit spec and waited
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it happens to Nooback too and I can see it
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I built the latest master
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u need to update server too
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a master
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt have the pr anyway
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol look at u
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725643797991784448/Screenshot_2020-06-25_at_12.29.04.png
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why it bugs for u
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt bug for me at all
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725643910575292437/unknown.png
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur still here
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe the new patch fixes that too unintentionally?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not on new patch
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe my shitty internet is messing with it? but I don't see how, we don't evolve the spectee, so no prediction
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how could it be rendering at two different places for us?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you also wait for me to take a look at the spec char patch, I don't think we have to send all this extra state
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, that would be even better
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The theory I have is that going into spec puts the hook in a known state, so we shouldn't need to send it
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but need to check
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 take into account endless hook and stuff
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but still, when you go into spec your hook is cut off, in CCharacter::Pause
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i guess
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, issue with that is the hook is only cut off if you hook someone, not if you are hooking the ground
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we can avoid sending it if we don't want to see the hooks of spec'd tees
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> otherwise it's going to have to be sent
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should sent it i think
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't have to send hookedplayer though, atleast we can drop that
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also prefer not displaying it
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idc about sending or not
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if we don't want to display it we don't need to change the spec-char object
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also true
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also if we send the spec-char only when the character itself isn't being snapped we can save a couple edge cases
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently trying to work out a less hacky way of rendering the spec char
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what is hacky about it right now?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> can you advice me how to check the value of boolean which in the gamecontroller.h (public) and i'm in pickup.cpp
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, you know what fixes these? *insert C++20 concepts praise here*
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Arseniy Zarche all entities have a pointer to the gameworld which has a pointer to the gameserver which has a pointer to the gamecontroller
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there is even a convenience function `GameServer()->m_pController`
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> doesn't work :(
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> already tried this
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "doesn't work" isn't helpful
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the error?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok wait
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen can you give us a while to mess around with the spec-char stuff?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> if this boolean declarated in gamecontroller.h, can i type something like this in pickup.cpp?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ```GameServer()->m_pController->NeedtoHide = false;```
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not if `NeedtoHide` is private
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> show us the error message that happens when you do this
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> `NeedtoHide` is public
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> show the error
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725657037882523679/unknown.png
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried compiling it?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to make sure it's not only an IDE error
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> nope
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok, i'll try
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if it's an actual error, you need to `#include <game/server/gamecontroller.h>`
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> )
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725657228597657670/unknown.png
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> xD
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I saw you had a change to add a ddnet PKGBUILD to gentoo. Nothing happened with it?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, `#include <game/server/gamecontroller.h>`
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen oh, just haven't used gentoo in a while because I've been testing out arch, I was going to migrate back when I'm in italy but that never happened
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for arch we are just missing 1 vote for the soft 10 vote boundary in AUR so that a Trusted User can pick up DDNet and make an official package
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can write the ebuild and submit it if you want, I maintain 2 ebuilds already
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it would be nice, but your choice if you want to maintain it
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are Trusted User active? would they release ddnet the same night?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> quickly, but same night would be hard, except if they're active ddnet players
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know the best solution, Ryozuki should apply as Trusted User 😄
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that an actual boundary? I thought TUs could pick up any package they use to put it into the repos
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think ucannot be a trusted user and work on 1 package only xD
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not an actual boundary, but if a package has >= 10 the TU can decide on their own
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is teeworlds an official package? maybe we can interest that guy 😄
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it's < 10 votes, then the TU needs approval from 2 (or 3?) other TUs
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe the teeworlds guy hates ddnet
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> inb4 it's stitch
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i actually have some chances
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725659173601280101/unknown.png
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk if i should take that responsability
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm should we be sending `EXPLAYERFLAG_SPEC` even when the tee hasn't paused yet?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> our voting ring got us the tenth vote already
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "voting ring" :poggers:
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how about putting the information inside `CNetObj_SpecChar` inside a `CNetObj_Character` and passing that to the render functions? That should get rid of all the special cases inside the render functions themselves
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doing something similar to that rn
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to sue RenderTee directly though
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *use
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sue
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh wtf
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I'm in the src/game/client/animstate.{cpp,h} for the first time
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I saw it for the first time today aswell
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> luckily it has a function that I can use to not care about it anymore
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `\CAnimState::GetIdle()`
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `CAnimState::GetIdle()`
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks matricks (probably)
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we shouldn't display the hook either, first of all it's not really common to be hooked on while in spec, second it's not really useful information for anyone
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> third, no ugly `spec-char-2` 😄
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no one will ever see that
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yeah
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we will 🙂
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really. it's only one line in network.py
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't carry over to the structs
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah true
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, sweet array out of bounds in RenderPlayer
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uhm, call me naive, but where are the bounds checks in the `CGameClient::OnNewSnapshot` function? @Learath2
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. in the `if(Item.m_Type == NETOBJTYPE_CLIENTINFO)` for `int ClientID;`
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think there are any
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are there supposed to be any? 😄
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this might be an actual security vulnerability with bad impacts
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a nice arbitrary write gadget in a convenient location
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "kinda arbitrary"
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can't write at an arbitrary location
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think IDs can only be 0-65535
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, you can control IDs though yeah
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably in tw, too 😦
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are a couple of pointers after the data, but you'd need an info leak to exploit that
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but still a serious security vulnerability
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anything we use as an index, we should probably be clamping
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not only clamping but probably even `dbg_assert`
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not `dbg_assert` here, it's network input
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ignore or disconnect from server
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah yep, no need to let the server crash the client
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> disconnect sounds sane
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vanilla 0.7 has a fix
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/a3500d1c0288998eacb206b95e0b0ad4757d713f?w=1
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > Apparently I do, the background of lockdown just makes it impossible to see
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 That's why some ppl wanted spectee visible on all backgrounds, preferably black & white dashed skin instead of "if the outline isn't visible in very dark areas, the nickname definitely will be."
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Useless vote for community aside...
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 here's my WIP PR, in case you want to take a look at it
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will eat lunch now (I think you wanted more feedback between devs during the development of features?)
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen of so simple solution on the settings&commands I didn't even thought 😅
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> also feedback from players not also from devs would be nice if something is changed affecting the users
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> much english sentence
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> s/also/only
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ChillerDragon like vote in #announcements ? :p
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> idk would be a good start votes and discussions discord seems to be the place where players hang out
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> maybe also the github issue could be linked so cursious players can easily find out where to find the details
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there was such a vote in #announcements, for spec tee skin
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> thats nice
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 5:59 PM] Learath2: We are looking to display players in /spec and testing out 4 different looks. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2309#issuecomment-647612108
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Let us know which one you like the most
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> ok cool awesome
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> so thats execatly what i suggested but i didnt see it because i stopped using discord
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is however an issue, we presented 4 options, there was clear consensus for one of them, so we went with a 5th option 😄
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2368 done @Learath2 @Ryozuki
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I tested it and looked fine™
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks good
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt test it tho
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now we have 3 passes :greenthing:
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> :greenthing:
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 Kinda sad end-result though
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...yet I'm not much surprised xd
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast we have the feature in, the way it's rendered can always be changed
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yup
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the 4th option would be the only way that renders equally well in all backgrounds
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> The longer the feature will be in there, the more ideas to improve it will arise, so
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that was the plan xd
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725712997598625872/unknown.png
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or colorbody and it's inverse
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not 2 if people want it
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but colorbody + inverse would require code I think
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the way I intended the skin was for the full opacity image to be the default
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it needs any transparency either, it's already mostly transparent
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you take for example 30% of that it's not very visible
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean that it wasn't supposed to be more transparent than the image itself
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I can make a fully visible one to be better adjustable
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the one with feet was good idk why ppl removed it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the one with feet was good idk why it wasnt used
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725715208596881419/x_spec.png
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this one
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> because feet look messy and the body outline can be done cleaner
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> messy feet > no feet but ok
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing > messy anything
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> a circle perfectly represents a tee and speced tees don't need to walk anywhere so why would they have feet
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not like they take off their feet and put it in their pockets when they spec 😐
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but the circle is not a tee, it shows the lack of a tee
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe they do take out their feet when going to spec? you never know
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> they for sure hide their hands, since most ppl don't even realise tees have actual hands xd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> this should work better with the adjustable transparency in game
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725718041375277126/x_spec.png
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > its not like they take off their feet and put it in their pockets when they spec 😐
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis lmao
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the earlier one was at 40% which was already adjusted to look best in game
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ain't it 100% for same team, and custom-set by showothers alpha for other teams?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the transparency of the skin is connected to the showothers alpha slider, I didn't know that before
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > its not like they take off their feet and put it in their pockets when they spec 😐
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I thought that got changed, maybe it was just part of conversation and not actual code change 🤔
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well having it connected is inconvenient
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 is the skin gonna be replaced with this new opaque one?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725725465217859655/Screenshot_20200625-165332.jpg
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Or use this
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> what does "manual 00:00:00" mean?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> what does "manual %3d:%02d" mean?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> "manual" scares me woah
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Rather than what does, you should ask what it stands for / where it is used, since it's from translations files
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> How to close lan server if no terminal created and not knowing Rcon on Linux??
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but looks like that part is not translated in like half of the languages
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ᶰ°Konͧsti pkill -f DDNet ?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Thx
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I cant join lan server
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Not even per localhost
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because u just closed it
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> :kek:
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Before already
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And now again
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe u are banned
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> U
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :troll:
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> :troll:
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> bruh
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how are u launching it
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there needs to be an autoexec.cfg or autoexec_server.cfg
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> IK
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> EVERYTHING THERE
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ᶰ°Konͧsti Do you even see it in lan tab?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Yes
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what happens when u try to join
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> "You are banned" xd
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The same thing like on noby fng
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Like
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> nothing
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Connecting forever
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :danAmazing:
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ask the admin for unban then
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It's just a plain roulette guess, but maybe your router blocks the port or UDP (?) packets, even though you can see it in lan
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ᶰ°Konͧsti any errors in the terminal maybe?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if he connects to localhost then it should never even go thru the router
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> well, yea, but we're talking about Konsti, so... xd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :troll:
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so, im waiting xd
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its the DDNet 14 server Which is bugged
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I opened old server and no problems
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im not that retarded so no u
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh the new version comes with konsti protection
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> damn @onby  😂
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Clearly The biggest troll
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> How about fixing DDNet server 14
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> fix yourself :kek:  (sry bro)
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> what the "wait before try for" heck
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> when you can't connect to server and have to wait x seconds before trying again IIRC
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> ah ok
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> it will be more informative
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> guuuys... where the hell is code for, let's say this https://ddnet.tw/ranks/novice/ page? I'm quite sure it's not anywhere in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web (or I'm dumb) but I neither see it anywhere in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts ... what am I missing?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu you're not stupid
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet-web is only for the static part
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The ranks pages are created here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ranks.py
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I wouldn't recomment you to change anything in there
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I know
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ;D
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Tried to undestand the code like 20 times in last umm... 5 years? Never was good idea xD
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you can find a nice mockup of where best to show the release time I can add it
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This code is super-unclean
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i could rework it with https://www.yattag.org/
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would look super pythonic
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> more importantly, I think we should split up the ranks pages, but I'm not sure how to  best do that
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> First of all, I guess there are still several static pages generated by dynamic code, since that's what I found out... long ago, and doubt it'd change
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because at the moment the ranks pages get slow on even modern mobile devices
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need pagination
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> the settings & commands page sometimes hangs my phone too xD
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that wold be an easy fix
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wasn't sure whether to paginate or put each map's rank into a separate page
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> There are better solutions, and more user-friendly, but the ones I know of require quite the rewrite of page... page made with code I can't even understand, not mentioning testing it locally somehow
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but since we're on it...
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Let's say I'd like to test ddnet-web locally...
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://uniqueclan.net/maps
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet-web is easy to test locally. just need jekyll and some jekyll plugins and run "jekyll serve"
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> aside from ofc needing XAMPP or whatever to be able to run php code, how to have the ddnet-scripts part working or.. idk
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> except for the php bit
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XAMPP :cammostripes:
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows :cammostripes:
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but well, generate jekyll to dir read by XAMPP seems like... possible... solution...
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @deen any idea why i cant join DDNet server 14 on lan?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nono, jekyll brings its own web server
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no need for xampp
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ᶰ°Konͧsti with vanilla client?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> with DDNet 14
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xD
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> eeeh
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i know we have a bug in vanilla antispoofing
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Well, have to test it then, but I'm still quite sure it won't even run index.php since I'm on windows
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always wondered how far would u accept a web change
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess not much
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> show me a mockup first
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> http://v2.ddnet.tw/WIP/ xD
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> damn, still running <3
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or explain what you want to change, before you change everything and have it not accepted :/
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also mean the backend
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and btw, that v2 is literally a mockup that I wouldn't prefer today, it can be done way cleaner & nicer xd
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be fine for me, as long as it's as performant as the old one and readable
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> the performant part is hard here, since current page is nearly "bare" which could be interrupted even by relatively simple framework
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki btw, kinda missing the old times of doing remake with you :D
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well yeah
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know way more now tho
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye its hard to go against dynamic content thats statically generated every x mins
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a ugly aproach that works
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it has constant load on the server independent of how many people access it, which is great
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how perfomant caching is against that
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ᶰ°Konͧsti Some firewall problem? I can't reproduce it with Linux and Win64
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also ddnet.tw has only 2gb or ram xd
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which is plenty
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if u use file based caching like here yes
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it keeps me connecting forever
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725739520812908635/Bildschirmfoto.png
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that 2GB of ram should be far more than enough
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its windows stuff
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh but ur on linux
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ofc
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r u sure ur using legit client
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> U

17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah from page
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never use that
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ur right 2gb is enough

18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [10:56 AM] deen: Someone else here can confirm that joining LAN server with DDNet 14 (client + server) doesn't work?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen i tried on osx and it doesnt work for me either
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it is also not the client because i tried with old lclient too
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried on osx and it works just fine for me
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Ye couldnt join with 12.9
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> So DDNet 14 server bugged
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes i think it rules out firewall issues since 1. its lan server and 2. it works fine with old ddnet server on lan on this same computer
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was testing ddnet 10.62 server on lan a couple hrs ago
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Joining via localhost also not working

18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> downloaded from ddnet.tw?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did a git reset, removed my build folder, built the server and the client, launch server, connect

19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen k, got it working with mixing XAMPP & Jekyll build directory (damn windows). But now... is there a chance to also generate the pages from ddnet-scripts? :f
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> absolutely not
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> though so, not mentioning I wouldn't even guess which script to use xd
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> k
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Guys i'm making a trainning server but right now my "bots-dummies" are showed in server-browser and i dont wanna do that bcoz i know is banneable so.. someone can help me?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen https://ddnet.tw/news/ if you click on the newest one, `2020-06-24 » DDNet 14.0` the browser tries to download file `ddnet-14.0` instead of opening the news page. My guess is that the permalink is missing `/` at the very end
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Learath2 common translate for 1.14+, but the problem is that  i cannot translate "Connect Dummy" and "Disconnect Dummy" with the fact that this version (and somehow the older once too) won't come with those two, or if there's one, then all of them combined. Please look up for what might cause this to happen.

21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 how can i filter by head branch, i cant figure out what the correct one is
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao yeah I had the same issue
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess prs have a a branch name in them that you can use, but just random refs idk
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of checking whether a ref is a branch and using that
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu nah, that's a problem with file endings for directories. works fine in nginx
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://ddnet.tw/news/ddnet7-server-0.9/ works though, while https://ddnet.tw/news/ddnet-14.0 doesn't
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, you're right
22:00 < Obito634> Hello
22:00 <+Obito634> Guys i sorry for disturb
22:00 <+Obito634> But now i found my faker
22:00 <+Obito634> Somebody knows who giving master bans?
22:00 <+Obito634> I heard its noby
22:00 <+Obito634> I will thank for help
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> someone in teeworlds?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what master bans?
22:01 <+Obito634> ye
22:01 <+Obito634> someone
22:01 <+Obito634> and still faking
22:02 <+Obito634> while 2 weeks
22:02 <+Obito634> I can share screenshot
22:02 <+Obito634> If need
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't understand. What's a master ban?
22:02 <+Obito634> i know about master bans
22:02 <+Obito634> from status/tw
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, those have nothing to do with ddnet
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are about banning servers from mastersrv
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because the servers are doing something bad, like misreporting player number
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> this also has nothing to do with banning players
22:04 <+Obito634> but there have alternative vac ban kind?
22:04 <+Obito634> Like ban for ip or id of motherboard
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Even if there was such things, both are easy to avoid
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen Am I right with the feeling that theme switcher isn't just plain script, since the `href="/css-halloween.css"` actually points to `/css/css-empty.css` ? :F
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> not sure if it has been reported yet but if someone specs while being dragged they are invisible
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki did you already fix it to show dashed skin when the tee actually disappears, or not yet? xD
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its fixed
22:12 <+Obito634> Soo, there no bans
22:12 <+Obito634> Only for ip from 1 server?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/725805860257005639/Flux_2020-06-25_22-09-15.demo
22:13 <+Obito634> Yes or nope?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu it's implemented in nginx
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> uhh
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no global id bans
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, each server has their own ip bans
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://hookrace.net/blog/theme-switcher-nginx/
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://tenor.com/view/dance-dancing-hearts-happy-kiss-gif-9942838
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yeey, you mentioned me on Your blog
22:16 <+Obito634> global id, how it works?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not with teeworlds/ddnet
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in other games the client gets it from the os and sends it to the server
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then the server bans you
22:17 <+Obito634> On example people can be banned on all ddnet servers?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet needs global ban system
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but doesnt have, no
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and yeah that type of hardware ban system would be impossible in an open source game like this i think
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the biggest reason those kinds of ban systems work is that there is a cost of getting banned
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's either financial or time
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> get banned on league and there goes your account you played for years on, get banned on CoD and there goes 40$
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also i think those two games dont let u just edit the client to make it send a different id
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> get banned in dota, there goes ur 2k$
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby well you could
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wouldnt u have to dissect how the network protocol works and edit packets as theyre sent out
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you assign the player a unique id, he gets banned, he needs a new id,
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for which he'll have to pay, or lose all progress
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do u associate the id with the player tho
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you could do it like the older games like diablo2 where you don't care who uses the key
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you could do it the newer way like nintendo
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they now ship certificates signed by nintendo with their cartridges, which you can use to prove you own the game and go online
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they can also revoke certificates, so you get banned with a game cartridge, it's never going online again
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> "lose all progress" is more of an incentive for some gametypes than others
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3ds encrypts the roms
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet i played on a 3ds emulator
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The DRM stuff is a lost cause, it's always getting broken
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if ur a nameless tee who just wants to aimbot on servers that dont even keep track of anything then that wont really discourage u
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but they can with a 100% certainty prevent you from going online with it
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> noby
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby exactly, so you don't have to pay for a key, nor is there any lost time in getting banned, thus we can't have good bans
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not as good as that kindof hardware ban yeah
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but ip (range) bans are still pretty effective when theres anti vpn
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hardware bans don't work and have never worked
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not close to 100% but still pretty good
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the hardware is yours, the OS is yours, you get to show the game whatever you want
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol, true
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> microsoft has been doing a sort of HWID for a while, call them up tell them you need to reactivate your key and they won't ask any questions
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even they know they can't rely on it
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The perfect banning system exists, and it's asking for a national id card
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> koreans have been doing it for 2 decades now, works fine for them
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u dont mind losing over half the players sure
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> phone numbers are also used pretty commonly
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> steam did it for csgo and prime matchmaking
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well valve not steam
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, you need a unique identifier and it should be something that's not easy to get
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess it goes back to the whole idea that theres always a tradeoff between convienence and security
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also privacy in this case
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think croatian eOI cards have an anonymous certificate aswell
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a remnant of a failed online voting scheme 😄
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that doesnt sound like a good idea
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it's possible to have online voting
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we discussed this before, but to give someone the right to vote, you need to know who they are, and when you give them the "ballot" there is nothing to stop you from marking it per each person
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't want the government to know how I vote
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs> relevant
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh the red shirt guy
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 you want to review my changes so I can release 14.0.1?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh sure
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Feels like I should include the 3 remaining fixes at least
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks!
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> red shirt guy :D
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I watched a few of his videos and never noticed that he's always wearing red shirts 😄
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this chat parsing is like incredibly fragile
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, sorry about that
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as Zwelf said, a net msg would be cleaner
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I didn't read everything these 2 days, but you guys know that //spec midair is a thing now?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> I donated to DDnet 🙂 How do I get my name to appear on donars list 😄
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> xd
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ImJustANobody  just wait, deen checks it regularly and updates the website
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @n000b  How does he know which name to put on based on my email ? Since it's not related :
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Forum account? Dunno normally it isn't a problem
