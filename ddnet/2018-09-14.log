01:04 <@heinrich5991> I use it while debugging, all the time :)
13:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] CreeperGo closed pull request #1181: try to fix issue #1180 (master...master) https://git.io/f4Ao1
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 11.4.2 to 11.4.3 from 2.8kb to 3.3kb
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it isnt in debug mode right?

19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think debug mode is around 7 or  8MB
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> depends
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but seems suspicious @deen
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember one release being made on debug mode
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> omfg redis and python are abandoning master/slave terms too
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> k so far we have:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - drupal: primary/secondary/duplica
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - python: parent/children/helper/worker
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - django : leader/follower
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> let's just all take something else instead of the generally understood master/slave term and wonder why people are upset lol
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro where and what did you change for DDNet++ to have working rcon for newer clients?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because of that whisper isnt working anymore (it doesnt send whispered messages to the dummy and its not in color)
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @fokkonaut  i was wondering if you were going to fix /modhelp
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats wrong with it
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> or someone else ofcourse
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> well, it doesn't work right?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> turned off mb
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> /modhelp would ping mods on discord, they removed that bridge. but now u can write it still and it looks like you call for a mod.
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> it could be usefull to write, go to ddnet discord and ping a moderator with @Moderators
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> it could be usefull to write, go to ddnet discord and ping a moderator with @ moderator
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> disabled because it was abused a lot
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> abuse
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> HAHAHAHAH
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> omg
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what da fag
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> jao
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> admin
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?!
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I know
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think the only way to "fix" it would be accounts
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> True
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> In the meantime we could remove it or sent them to ddnet discord with the hope an moderator response.
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> @fokkonaut I thought its a cool feature. Reconnect until a slot is free so you don't need to do it manually.
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but giving feedback what the client is doing would be nice
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like just print "Server is full, trying to reconnect"
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Yes and maybe slow down
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Like try to reconnect every 5-10seconds not immediately
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, immediately is good
23:16 <+Learath2> don't we already have that?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 something seems to be broken in 11.4.3
23:16 <+Learath2> immediately floods the server
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh right
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he isnt even trying to reconnect
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Immediately is kinda useless imo
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @-Twist°~
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the client just isnt giving feedback about server is full or shit like that, just stays in the connecting to phase
23:17 <+Learath2> also the ui for the reconnect has been broken since forever, it tries reconnecting before the timer hits 0 :D
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> After like 5seconds this message appears, it would be more usefull to do it like fokkonaut: Edit the message in somthing like " The server is full, trying to reconnect in [ 5..4...3.. coundtown]" so it doesnt spam recconect for 5 seconds and ends up with this message ^
