15:37 <+ChillerDragon> nice :)
15:37 <+ChillerDragon> welcome back 
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> i think we never really meet since you were active before my aware time but i red in books about you
15:41 <+Tsin> and I watched your YT channel =]
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> o.O
15:41 <+Tsin> however not sure if you have two diffrent channels
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> so we are basically family
15:42 <+Tsin> or someone wanted to be cool as you :P :D
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> i stopped counting my yt channels but its over 2 for sure
15:42 <+Tsin> ahhh =]
15:42 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon dont u have yt channel with lot of subs
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> well define lot of subs
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> u probably mean Prudrugtiq
15:43 <+Ryozuki> more than 1k
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:43 <+Ryozuki> by tw standards
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> its subs sponosred by lego tho
15:43 <+Ryozuki> at
15:43 <+Ryozuki> wat
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> majority of subs are 6yo american lego fans
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> so claiming to have the biggest tw yt channel is kinda wrong
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R74LtLWDGRQ that video hit 3.5mil views and a few ppl subbed for more lego content and never unsubbed or passed away before they realized its a tw channel

15:46 <+ChillerDragon> gotta be lucky w yt algo
15:53 <+Tsin> just realised that noothers nimda is used here =] good old nimda ^^
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @ChillerDragon, here are most common mistakes with login:
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> 1. Password is more then 10 chars.
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> 2. Player enter /login username pass instead of /login pass.
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Check, maybe one of them is the reason
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> but why is it possible to change the password to more than 10 chars and get a success message?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> We have a plans to completely rework login system anyway
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> oof only 10 characters
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> but all letters are allowed? even spaces?
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> or non ascii characters
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> or how ever these |@±Ω±° are called
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> arent @and | ascii characters
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> yea probably
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> idk what ascii even includes
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> but i tend to sometimes include funky chars in my pw
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> •äΓí≈╕╜╩
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Assuming qshar limited the password size in the naive way and the db is actually utf8 you should be able to use any valid 10 byte utf8 string ;P
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> yea hard to test with 1 try a day
20:38 <+ChillerDragon> why does "rework login system" sound like it requires a discord acc :D
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> @qshar 10 is very short any reason its not at least 128?
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> yay i logged in :)
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found a ghost bug
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Why does my ddnet client delete / add skins without updating?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u add them on the wrong place
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe the download from database stuff
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> dang, 32 bits crash also on artic frost...
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do i use opengl 1.x?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> opengl 3.3 is not ticked already
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> gfx_opengl_major found
