03:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat I did not get my C lib into a usuable state yet -.- https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/tree/chiller_sans_io_netcode
04:41 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
04:41 < bridge> <woidless> Maybe I'll translate something else
05:22 < bridge> <woidless> @jxsl13 Can you help me?
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> Hey developers, I remember we talked about correcting the written Arabic in game chat will take huge space (or idk what was the problem)
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> So if its really hard to make it written correct by making the letter connected like ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß and written from right to left.. 
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> At least just make it written in the chat from right to left like
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> ŸÖ ÿ± ÿ≠ ÿ® ÿß
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> Rather than 
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> ÿß ÿ® ÿ≠ ÿ± ŸÖ
05:35 < bridge> <ms.warroir> So arabic players can read easier than flipping ur head or ur brain
05:36 < bridge> <ms.warroir> Its like olleh rather than hello !!!!
05:36 < bridge> <ms.warroir> .
06:02 < bridge> <Ewan> this sounds like a huge oversight tbh
06:03 < bridge> <Ewan> all that IME work but rtl doesn't work
07:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless nice
07:50 < bridge> <woidless> Go ,  I want to translate
08:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> with what?
08:19 < bridge> <ms.warroir> @learath2 is that possible?

08:34 < bridge> <woidless> I want to send commands in a separate discord server, and for them to be executed in rcon on the server
08:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconDiscordModerationBot
08:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can use this one for that, tho it's a little bit old
08:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> and you probably don't need the chat features
09:28 < bridge> <woidless> @chillerdragon.9502 We need to translate this

10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
10:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless looks a bit like you are trying to copy the TS servers -.- you even set the gametype to S-DDR thats a bit weird bro
10:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea for the translations put them here in the format i used. So I have the full english and russian text (as text) not images. And I can see if i find time to do it. https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues/new
10:53 < bridge> <woidless> This is still such a map on the server, soon I will add a new author's map Copy Love box

11:09 < bridge> <avolicious> ? xd
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Do you mind please following the general rule to either: translate your message to English, especially in topic related channels such as #developer or go to #off-topic ?
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> We enforce this rule so everyone is able to understand what someone is saying. - deepl is really good and then everyone is able to immediately help if capable then.
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Oh and ofc: ü§ìüçà
11:26 < bridge> <woidless> Sry

13:51 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:51 < bridge> <learath2> Row counts are surprisingly expensive
13:54 < bridge> <avolicious> You can use EXPLAIN `EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM record_race;`
13:54 < bridge> <avolicious> What does it tell you?
13:55 < bridge> <learath2> or more directly: `SELECT table_rows FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'record_race';`
13:55 < bridge> <avolicious> But then its not 100% accurate, no?
13:55 < bridge> <learath2> yeah
13:55 < bridge> <learath2> Oh you were wondering what explain says to see why so slow?
13:55 < bridge> <learath2> It's 100% going to be a full scan
13:56 < bridge> <avolicious> Mhmm, but there are some indexes, right?
13:56 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah but you still need to scan the entire index iirc
13:56 < bridge> <avolicious> but 44 mio not "that big"
13:56 < bridge> <learath2> let me check, now I'm curious what it does üòÑ
13:57 < bridge> <learath2> ```

13:57 < bridge> <avolicious> mhmmm
13:58 < bridge> <avolicious> I am bit surprised. InnoDB?
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> I thought you wanted me to check the rows number there, it's from information schema
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
13:58 < bridge> <avolicious> NVMe?
13:59 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, we've been changing around db servers a lot lately, idk what this one is tbh
13:59 < bridge> <avolicious> I see üòÑ
14:00 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah nvme, checked
14:01 < bridge> <learath2> Actually, querying on the db server directly is much faster, I forgot we had a replica on the main server
14:01 < bridge> <learath2> ```

14:52 < bridge> <zaer1n> is `sudo apt update` a bad command to run in a github action?
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> kinda yes
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u shouldnt need it
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but depends
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u doing?
15:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> I want to test my rust workflow locally so I use https://github.com/nektos/act
15:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> the ffmpeg-sys-next crate needs some dependencies to build but act doesnt install them unless I run apt update first
15:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> ```yml
15:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> - name: Install dependencies
15:09 < bridge> <zaer1n>       run: sudo apt update && sudo apt install libavutil-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev
15:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> ```
15:11 < bridge> <zaer1n> I want to test my rust workflow locally so I use https://github.com/nektos/act
15:11 < bridge> <zaer1n> the ffmpeg-sys-next crate needs some dependencies to build but act doesnt install them unless I run apt update first

15:11 < bridge> <zaer1n> ```
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah then do
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> @zaer1n iirc there is a cache action for apt
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/actions/cache
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache-apt-packages
15:14 < bridge> <zaer1n> But apt update  wil still take time even if I cache the dependencies no?
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @zaer1n im fairly sure the action runs apt update by itself
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> use this one
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it caches that too
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway its definitly a time save
15:20 < bridge> <zaer1n> it didnt üò≠
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless the server browser colors are client side

17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks
17:21 < bridge> <ms.warroir> @learath2 sadly u didn't answer and the post goes up
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> What didn't I answer? I may have missed a ping
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> Ah this one, hm
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> hmm, this is not very easy still, we need to add support for ALM/RLM or bidi in general because we need something to mark the region in which we reverse the text
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks && @robyt3 you two know the text rendering better, do you think this would be possible? The client would need to start inserting the correct markers in stuff like chat messages (idk what this would be based on, maybe unicode prescribes when to emit these), and the text rendering code would (I presume) need a bool on text containers to keep track of which direction to render them in
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> The bidi algorithm in general is annoying enough to implement that we probably should use fribidi for it
18:14 < bridge> <01000111g> $demos
18:14 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
18:14 < bridge> <robyt3> It's not impossible, but it seems rather challenging. I guess using a combination of harfbuzz+fribidi would make sense, then we don't need to manually insert markers as far as I understand it. Implementing this without it having a major performance impact on all text rendering would especially be my concern. I found this example https://github.com/UnickSoft/ex-sdl-freetype-harfbuzz-fribidi/blob/24e7bdeb08ca50100a03864db6829c193d40fa90/ex-sdl-freetyp
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> If we use harfbuzz, then we'd get full proper shaping anyway. I was hoping we just use fribidi to get us a properly reordered string array and just render that
20:05 < bridge> <-StormAx> I manage to put full screen images in console

20:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> you havent seen what i have
20:07 < bridge> <-StormAx> go for it
20:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> no i rather forget
20:07 < bridge> <-StormAx> tell me at dm at least
20:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think it's more that they're trying to avoid reliving the trauma

20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> it sounds like a job for pango tbh
20:32 < bridge> <aegisub> fribidi is not that hard to use
20:32 < bridge> <aegisub> harfbuzz is more tricky
20:32 < bridge> <robyt3> > Pango depends on 2.x series of the GLib library
20:33 < bridge> <robyt3> We probably don't want to add a dependency on GLib for this.
