01:57 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 378a713 def: No antiping in demo player
15:24 < laxa> deen: EastByte: heinrich5991: I got something to propose
15:24 < laxa> I am just playing casually teeworlds today
15:24 < laxa> and I think there is a little problem
15:24 < laxa> it's hard to get an empty server sometimes
15:24 < laxa> like during weekend
15:25 < laxa> I was playing a solo map and people come to change the map
15:25 < laxa> so my idea is to make bash scripts or anything else
15:25 < laxa> that would automatically create new servers if every server have players on them
15:25 < laxa> that script would also remove them if they are empty afterward
15:26 < laxa> I am not the only one being annoyed by this
15:26 < laxa> or you can propose dynamic creation of servers directly from the forum with low slots numbers
15:33 < WolfAlex> ^ laxa +1
15:43 <@EastByte> laxa: hard to integrate into the current environment, also having a dynamic number of servers would rise load/security problems
15:44 < laxa> I agree that there is a security risk
15:44 < laxa> just make a hardlimit of servers
15:44 < laxa> or check loads before creating new servers I guess
15:46 <@EastByte> instead of a hardlimit we could just constantly run more servers
15:48 <@EastByte> and if we would want to adjust the number of servers to the load, we probably will also need to shutdown servers
15:48 <@EastByte> also it's hard to decide whether there is more space for additional servers
15:49 < laxa> totally agree, haven't really thought of that
15:49 < laxa> that's why, maybe those dynamic servers could be low slots
15:49 < laxa> 5 to 10 slots
15:52 <@EastByte> it's getting more and more difficult :p
15:52 <@EastByte> but otherwise yes, would work somehow
15:53 <@EastByte> anyways, I personally would agree with a dynamic server creation process, would definitely be fun to implement
18:19 <@deen> laxa: well, the hard limit is that we already have as many servers as we can^
18:19 < laxa> that's sad ^^
18:19 <@deen> and no, making servers with 5 slots is a terrible idea
18:19 <@deen> what if more and more people come? they can't play with 64 there
18:19 <@deen> so yeah, maybe we could run a few more servers on GER
18:20 <@deen> also, when you're 20 min on a server you get a veto right, so no one can change map without your approval
18:21 <@EastByte> *20 min in a race
18:21 <@deen> no
18:21 <@deen> i changed that
18:21 <@EastByte> oh
18:22 <@deen> even when you kill, you keep your veto
18:22 <@deen> because some people speedrun short maps, was bad for them
18:22 <@EastByte> good for short solo maps I guess
18:22 <@deen> also, i implemented some simple alerts now based on the rrdtool data
18:23 <@deen> have to check if they work, then i can add your email addresses if you want to get spammed with server problems
18:23 <@EastByte> I love getting spammed with server problems :D
18:23 <@deen> only 4 very simple alerts for now:
18:23 <@deen> 1. server unreachable for 1 hour
18:23 <@deen> 2. CPU over 90% for 20 min
18:24 <@deen> 3. memory and swap over 90% for 3 min
18:24 <@deen> 4. network traffic over 2 MB/s for 3 min
18:24 <@EastByte> sounds good
19:14 < Voltex> help
19:14 < Voltex> hello all
19:36 <@heinrich5991> hello Voltex
19:38 <@EastByte> am I the only one here who does not filter out leave/part messages ? :p
19:40 <@heinrich5991> I don't filter them
19:40 <@heinrich5991> I still want to emphasize Voltex's short stay time :P
20:06 <@EastByte> deen: all servers are unreachable for an hour, noooooooo
20:07 < pikou> hello
20:07 <@EastByte> hi
20:08 < pikou> u play tw?
20:08 <@EastByte> currently not, no
20:08 < pikou> why are you there? xD
20:09 <@EastByte> to chat with visitors like you
20:09 <@EastByte> pikou: bye
20:12 <@deen> EastByte: haha, i expected this. I'm still fiddling with how to get the rrd data properly
