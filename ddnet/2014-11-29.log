21:53 < xrothx> Hello deen 
21:53 <@deen> hi
21:53 < xrothx> Problems with Chile I see?
21:53 <@deen> as expected
21:53 <@deen> bandwidth ran out
21:54 <@deen> trying to get in touch with them but i guess they don't work on weekend
21:54 < xrothx> Alright :s
21:55 <@deen> GER2 is still making problems. We definitely need to keep GER
22:11 <@deen> just terminated GER2
22:19 < xrothx> okay
22:19 < xrothx> Well, the phpcoder asked me why I didn't put the webinterface on the nfo server
22:20 < xrothx> but I guess that will not be good enough anymore then for ddnet? deen 
22:20 < xrothx> I ll just order another one, seems the best option for me :)
22:20 < xrothx> and for ddnet aswell
22:29 <@deen> It's your server so you can do it as you want
22:30 <@deen> I'd be afraid of attacks and that our main servers would be affected
22:35 < xrothx> I ll just order a second one
22:36 <@deen> i don't think a php webinterface would need much performance
22:37 < xrothx> deen
22:37 < xrothx> I uploaded a map
22:38 < xrothx> blmapcandys
22:38 < xrothx> can you check it? 
22:38 < xrothx> and open a testserver for me and some friends
22:38 < xrothx> so they do not need the rcon & the sv password of ddnet
22:38 <@deen> sorry, i don't test maps
22:38 < xrothx> I will test
22:39 <@deen> i can change the PW of a testserver
22:39 < xrothx> ohh 
22:39 < xrothx> ok
22:39 < xrothx> also good
22:39 <@deen> the one you're on
22:55 <@deen> oh god i'm dying
22:55 <@deen> New video by Zikkie, I hope it will be on youtube^^
23:01 < coffee> can we watch it ?
23:02 <@deen> I'm trying to find out when it will be on youtube =/
23:02 <@deen> not sure if the link I got is supposed to be public
23:04 < coffee> nevermind
23:05 < coffee> I saw my mod in youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfzokOXu0nU
23:05 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Teeworlds epic actions BLOCKZ | Rating: 0.00/5.00 | Views: 8
23:05 < coffee> I don't believe it lol
23:06 <@deen> Ah, by NICO
23:32 < eeeee> i don't understand that mod
23:32 < eeeee> why hammer freezes sometimes
23:32 < eeeee> and what is the objective?
23:46 < coffee> This is a blocker mod with an infection element
23:46 < coffee> it's kinda popular
23:48 < coffee> (I just forked ddnet and I added zombies, that's all)
23:51 < coffee> When a zombie infects a human, he becomes human himself
23:53 < eeeee> uh not sure that's how zombies work, but whatever :D
23:55 < coffee> lol you're right
23:57 < coffee> Everything is falling now that you told me that
