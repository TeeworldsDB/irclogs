08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is this variant
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice, perfect IDE to do some rust coding for ddnet ;9
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ddnet-rs
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Still not an ide
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks a lot like an IDE to me
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u code and compile in that tool its an IDE
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does ur text editor provide syntax checking? or pure text editor?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> An IDE comes with pre-installed tools to build, debug etc.., same for vscode it's not an IDE, but you can still achieve the same if you pass 30min configuring it
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes and as soon as you done that its an ide
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> No
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what disqualifies it as an IDE then?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> As I said
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> An IDE is: install and it works
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Vscode for example you have to take forever to config
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont compile in nvim
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he installed and it works
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> It's a code editor, that's all
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvim comes with lsp support tho
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and lsp checks errors
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such as syntax
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and provides autocomplete
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think you are too focused about splitting IDE from text editor
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u code, have code syntax etc. its an IDE
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> No
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its an enviroment
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> environment
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can achieve as you want to
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it*
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> But well ig many people has different approach about that, It is never mentioned that vscode is an ide but a code editor etc.., same for sublime, same for vim, etc..
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> vscode is a text editor
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> pure vscode != ide
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> configured vscode == ide
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and vscode with c++ extensions gives me everything an IDE gives
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Still not an IDE, but it is similar, an IDE still is different as you install it with all the tools required, that's all, it's integrated
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the problem is, its simply not well defined
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> You press the install button
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Everything is already set
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wikipedia:
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "One aim of the IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities."
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now does VSCode provide you that?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I'd say yes, u install c++ extension and give it a go
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except you call installing a simple extension a configuration
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Your point of view, for me it is still not, for Microsoft too
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing about these vscode or nvim setups are well integrated enough to be called an IDE. Sure it got better but these are all plugins made by different authors. They break they can be misconfigured in a way that they dont interact properly
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast imo, you are free to define IDE however you like I suppose. If for you having a build button makes it an IDE, so be it ðŸ˜›
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well the c++ extensions from microsoft are automatically activated
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd call it an IDE yes
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> But does it come with a compiler?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does eclipse come with one?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Yes
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in fact setting up eclipse is harder imo
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eclipse for java does iirc
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Eclipse is all plugins, so it's not an IDE :troll:
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i see ^^
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CLion doesn't come with a compiler either but I'd still call it an IDE. It's an out of the box experience, integrated by a company to be a certain way
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my points is really more about complexity than if its important if its an IDE or text editor
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if i need 5 clicks to have a great debugging/coding etc. experience with vscode (clangd e.g. installs the clang server itself if not found in path)
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i'd not call it a text editor anymore
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sure the base is an highly extensible text editor
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, never been that easy for me. Some part of that setup just keeps breaking for me, never really got the debugging working at all
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i had this experience more with eclipse actually
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> which didnt have a good cmake plugin
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> couldnt do outer source build
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I personally don't care. But if I'm told something is an IDE I really just expect to click build or debug and it just works
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I'd agree if a compiler would be a must have
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw everything I would classify as an IDE does bundle a compiler in some way. Just not all as integrated as eclipse
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think CLion installs a compiler to use
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so visual studio is the only real IDE? ðŸ˜„
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> comes with everything preinstalled
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just takes 20 years to install
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well eclipse also bundles a java compiler in some way
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i bet vscode bundles lot of javascript tools too
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs thats their main target group still
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt come with nodejs
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eclipse, Netbeans, VS, CLion, DevC++
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These are what I'd call ide's. Highly integrated out of the box experiences
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> XCode

11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks do u use kate?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only as text editor, but yeah sometimes ðŸ˜„
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this might be the future: https://lapce.dev/
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like vscode but it uses rust
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its rly fast
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it doesnt compile to webasm
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i've already used it
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its native
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Native GUI with GPU acceleration in Rust, no more waiting on launching the editor, and any lag on your keystroke will be treated as a bug and get fixed.
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its fast, but still too unfinished
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I gueess maybe you could argue that what Ryozuki ended up configuring became an IDE. As he took the time to make it a robust experience
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway for me its also really not about the word
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but more how he uses it
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont want to call it text editor
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs then i think of notepad
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur a linux user
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> say "leafpad"
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or stallman will bonk u
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You must know by now that I don't believe in appeals to authority. If a definition is not concrete, it's up to debate

11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Language for generating ddnet automapper rules that is very nested ;D
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not just a better automapper language
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or a GUI for automapping

11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh wait
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is not a automapper for the rules on ddnet
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a map generator language
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rules++ is a simple language written in C++, which allows you to create the most complex automappers.
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so yeah
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok got confused
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "an executable, which translates rules++ code to rules"
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess it should say most complex automapper rules

16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at the bottom var
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bar
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> much wow
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got a tux
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz LF line endings
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i get warnings too
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1033753274429485117/unknown.png
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know if its possible to show warnings always when e.g rerunning ninja
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it often only shows warnings from clean builds
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and afterwards not
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i prefer the behaviour where it shows the warns always
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like cargo does
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes what do u want to tell me ?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my neovim is ide like
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ðŸ˜„
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doubt it, incremental builds donâ€™t ever touch the same files. Idk if there is an option to pretend warned files changed
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ninja should save the warnings
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and output them again if the file didnt change
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are you using pipeware on gentoo?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or pulse
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i went with pulse for now
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pulse, I wanted pipewire but didnâ€™t really feel like messing around with it while I was setting up
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same

17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1 minute not bad
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't think this functionality exists. you could compile with `-Werror` to make it stop on warnings
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord is much more snappier on my self compiled firefox
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than running the app
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also for some reason  the app is locked to low fps
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can scroll smoothly 144hz here
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only problem is sometimes typing fast on discord web kinda freezes it for some reason
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> r u using a stable firefox build?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the dev build is often pretty buggy for me. sometimes the complete instance just hangs
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 105.0.2 (64-bit) rn, but i know 106 is out im just not updating yet
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```bash
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>  mysql -u teeworlds -p'PW2' teeworlds < ddnet-sql/record_*.sql
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bash: ddnet-sql/record_*.sql: ambiguous redirect
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> guess the readme was not made for bash
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen uses zsh
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would i fix this?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cat ddnet-sql/record_*.sql | mysql -u â€¦`
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can PR it if you want ðŸ™‚
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what was the progress pipe program called
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz this will take a while and im curious
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pv
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can also use `progress`
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it works on programs that use files as input (it doesn't do anything with pipes)
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1033781711089180745/unknown.png
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wanna try making a fancy data oriented stats page
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i have the willpower to finish another project
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> funny, this should work
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I use bash and I do it this way too
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm idk why
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid single core import
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it runs at 300kb
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 33 mins in
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> still going
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ill surrender
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/stats/ddnet.sqlite.zip
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does this has the same?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and is it updated xD
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i had to do some projects and exercises right now, yes i used my cheatsheet for some, but most of it was lightwork.. the only thing i struggled with was "rename multiple columns" because i've never done it before, but now i know :)
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dev7z | Mandalina> tf did you guys do to ddax
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dev7z | Mandalina> tf did you guys do to ddmax
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> they nerfed them :trollge:
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> to be honest, i think it's less intuitive now for new comers
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> because of this change, everybody will be confused, but we'll get used to it as usual
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :clueless:
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> FROM fake_apps
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> WHERE downloads < 10000
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> GROUP by category;
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> why does it show downloads greater than 10000?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> even tho the clause is "less than" ?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> because of your sum ig
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you have to do
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> SUM(downloads) < 10000
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> The computer is dumb
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or you can just rename SUM(downloads) as blabla
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig, kinda forgot how to use sql
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But that's actually a good thing
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it is not dumb
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this is logical
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It totally is logical
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> meh this doesnt work
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i mean it's just an exercise for myself if im being honest. i've already done the part the course is asking for but i was like... "what if i wanna see only download BELOW 10000" and group them by the category
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What you are looking for is a having clause. If you do `HAVING SUM(downloads) < 10000` at the end it should work. Problem you are having is that WHERE clauses always happen before GROUP BY. At that point SUM(downloads) doesnâ€™t even make sense
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ok well, i'm not at "having" clauses yet so i guess i'll wait for that :D
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but i dont know why SUM(downloads) doesnt make sense when i use WHERE and GROUP BY
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because WHEN happens at the very start of execution. When you do a query, the SQL engine comes up with an execution plan. A series of steps (very specific, down to the specific method used to filter stuff) to perform on the rows to get you your results. WHEN is step 1 where everything gets filtered
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> WHERE*
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So when you are at the start of execution. How is the sql engine supposed to know the SUM of downloads? It hasnâ€™t done anything yet
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> so i cant use SUM() and WHERE in the same execution?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You canâ€™t use any aggregate function in WHERE. No SUM, No AVG etc.
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your WHERE clause can not involve an aggregate
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i'm writing that down lol
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> HAVING is the opposite. It happens at the end of execution. So we already have our rows and weâ€™ve calculated our aggregates for the groups. Now we can filter using the aggregates
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hope that makes some sort of sense, I tried to keep it accurate enough while keeping it simple. There is ofc more to it, but thinking like this should have no harm
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea i get that, WHERE is bad to aggregate and HAVING is good for them :YEP:
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> for now, that is more than enough to know
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> thank you
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea i get that, WHERE is bad for aggregations and HAVING is good for them :YEP:
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I gave a little more context because it might matter later on in your journey. So itâ€™s good to know why aswell, even just in the corner of your mind
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> it's weird that they haven't mentioned it in the course
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> or maybe it's just simple and you should know that
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if you are just learning GROUP BY. HAVING is probably next ðŸ˜„
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should have read the manga guide to databases. It has a good teaching order ðŸ˜›
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i'm at GROUP BY 2 now and i can't wrap my head around it :LUL:
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> manga guide? :PauseChamp:
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://oberstar.eu.org/share/Documents/The-Manga-guide-to-databases.pdf ðŸ˜›
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is surprisingly decent for what looks like a meme
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i will look into it tomorrow :D
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> thanks
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Donâ€™t confuse yourself if you are already following sth
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> maybe ill check it after i'm done with my course, i'm at 28%
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but....the hardest modules are infront of me lol
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw, most of the time you use a small subset of SQL. But there are some complex things in there incase you need them
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yeaaa, one of the exercises i took..it was only WHERE and BETWEEN and some LIKE, OR and AND even tho i learned DISTINCT, LIKE, IS NOT NULL etc.
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> nvm.
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> lmao HAVING was right after GROUP BY 2 <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz>     When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING.
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ^there is the explanation
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Well, HAVING have no sense without GROUP BY, so it makes sense ðŸ¤“
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Well, HAVING has no sense without GROUP BY, so it makes sense ðŸ¤“
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> SELECT first_name, COUNT(*) AS 'count'
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> FROM users
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> GROUP BY first_name
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ORDER BY 2 DESC; 
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> to what exactly is the 2 referring to?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Each number represents a position in the field list
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> those are the collumns, so 2 should be "first_name" right?

23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> No
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Its referencing you selected fields
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> (maybe)?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Never saw that syntax before
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Tbh
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but with COUNT(*) i selected all columns
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Its referencing your selected fields
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> You selected number of all rows :justatest:
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea i meant rows
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but with COUNT(*) i selected all rows
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i'm still unsure what the fucking "2" is referring to
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> OHHH is it referring to the second column in my SELECT statement so to the "COUNT(*) AS 'count'?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Yes
