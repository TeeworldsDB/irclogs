00:09 < bridge> <kebscs> master server isnt in the client, cxx bridge is useless until network protocel get implemented which i suspect not in the near future
00:16 < bridge> <whitekitty> Hey where can I find the code with the message: **'player' joined team ?**
00:20 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3d1c090b61ec8a17fa388c3ccf78ac8cfa6ae7e6/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L745>
00:40 < bridge> <whitekitty> Is there another function like this somewhere because I removed it for testing and the same message appears?
00:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> ctrl + shift + f
00:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> in vs code
00:42 < bridge> <whitekitty> i try but didnt found it
00:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> search for join
00:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> case sensitive
00:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> recompile the code, restart server
03:50 < bridge> <louis> is it intended that pressing run server wont open up a console window with the password?
03:50 < bridge> <louis> steam gnome fedora
04:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I guess the goal is passwordless automatic authentication on servers launched from the client
06:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless before we do any 128 player debugging could you update your server? I pushed an update to the feature_128 branch
06:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen btw while at it i also sent you the solved conflicts for the 128 pr in case you want to save 5 minutes https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/3
06:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> somehow gh forced me to create a merge commit to be able to pr a force pushed branch ._.
06:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but you can also ``git reset --hard HEAD^`` to pop off the merge commit and then force push that your self that should be a clean rebase
06:29 < bridge> <totar> better antiping smoothing algorithm I'm working on, the first 20 seconds is the old version for comparison.
06:29 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318812272981704794/2024-12-17_23-24-40.mp4?ex=6763af24&is=67625da4&hm=ba8427e1d35645433814a47f98d13df066443999b30be71d796728b1a9a1889f&
06:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ChillerDragon: i remember you stating ddnet or 0.6 clamps NetIntRange instead of dropping like in 0.7, do you remember how sure were you when you found that out?
06:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> YES
06:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> please we need a better antiping algo
06:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh, i remember doing something similar when i was working on that ddnet clone for a chinese company. i found it extremely helpful to interp or smooth separate axises instead of a single vector on 2d characters given that jump is often quite violent. not sure if it is worth doing on ddnet given how often the character is in the air, but might be worth a try. we also did stuff on 3d characters where we smooth xz and y separately in our VR game, sim
06:41 < bridge> <totar> that's basically what I'm doing but I decompose the prediction vector into based on a certainty vector so it's not biased by any axis
06:41 < bridge> <totar> that's basically what I'm doing but I decompose the prediction vector based on a certainty vector so it's not biased by any axis
06:42 < bridge> <totar> it generalizes to infinite dimensions in theory
06:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> jump and gravity usually just work on y only which where that system comes from since it behave differently than x.
06:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> might only work how i was doing it tho, just sharing.
06:44 < bridge> <totar> I actually haven't added the "smoothing" part yet, this is just designed to give a more accurate position a higher % of the time. It still has instantaneous movements so I'll need to add another layer to smooth those.
06:44 < bridge> <totar> the smoothing reduces accuracy for smoothness
06:46 < bridge> <totar> I was thinking about doing a special case for jumping but there's too many types of actions that behave the same way as jumping so I don't feel it's worth it.
06:49 < bridge> <totar> wait you said it's a ddnet clone but you have 3d charecters?
06:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's a different game
06:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i worked on like 3 different projects that has similar gameplays in 3 years
06:50 < bridge> <totar> so how did your 2d smoothing algorithm work?
06:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
06:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gather some input changes and state changes from past few ticks and get a "entropy" value, it's just how often it changes, and slowly decrease the delay as the movement gets more predictable. and that looks too floaty and we just run it twice on x and y separately and it looks better
06:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gather some input changes and state changes from past few ticks and get a "entropy" value, it's just how often it changes, and slowly decrease the delay as the movement gets more predictable (as in decreasing that magic entropy value). and that looks too floaty and we just run it twice on x and y separately and it looks better
06:57 < bridge> <totar> yeah that's very similar to what I did
06:57 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet/blob/6382bfc13e2f9ebb5b9652cd4f67fa4e9193b945/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L2507-L2697
06:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm just saying doing whatever that we were doing and just run it twice 1-d might look better
06:59 < bridge> <totar> idk what you mean by twice 1-d
06:59 < bridge> <totar> this is once 2d
07:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if you are detecting changes in vel, detect changes in velx and vely separately and do the posx and posy prediction separately using the two changes info you gathered instead of treating the velocity as a 2d vector.
07:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like whatever you are doing, break it in to x and y and do it separately, maintain two states, and if you are doing inputs, map direction to x's changes and jump to y's changes and hooks to both.
07:02 < bridge> <totar> I used angle between prediction vectors to detect changes insead of velocity because it doesn't need any tuning
07:02 < bridge> <totar> I used angle between prediction vectors to detect changes instead of velocity because it doesn't need any tuning
07:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that is quite different from how i imagined it, but you could just run the angle as a 2d vector and detect changes in x and y separately. but again, just sharing. do whatever you feel like is best.
07:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like replace the dot with just distance delta of x and y or something, but value is definitely different.
07:06 < bridge> <totar> but if you have 2 axis then you can't measure instability along a 45 degree
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> > not sure if it is worth doing on ddnet given how often the character is in the air, but might be worth a try.
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't have any more info to share
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm just saying i observed that
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't have mathamatical proof
07:08 < bridge> <totar> like in this case the 1d*2 system will see this as instability in all axis and won't find the stable axis
07:08 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318822082850848819/image.png?ex=6763b847&is=676266c7&hm=c660dbf910a727c7a7f355d42cd6e4dd5040b8b4c5fffc176eb18a58520602fd&
07:09 < bridge> <totar> we can safely put the tee at the end of the red line, but if you do 1D twice it will have to place it at the server position
07:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> our entropy is more input driven, again, do whatever you believe is the best
07:09 < bridge> <totar> hmm
07:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i really don't have any proof
07:09 < bridge> <totar> well
07:09 < bridge> <totar> neither do I
07:09 < bridge> <totar> Idk what you mean by proof
07:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like i can't proof the thing i did is mathematically closer to ground truth
07:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> than the way you are doing
07:10 < bridge> <totar> that's not really important
07:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i basically means ignores me if you don't believe that could work
07:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kek:
07:11 < bridge> <totar> well idk
07:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i could try to implement one after i'm done with this fucking fever
07:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> although tbh i probably won't lol
07:12 < bridge> <totar> are you talking about a system that smooths movements between prediction positions or finding a more accurate prediction position?
07:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh the first. wait, does our prediction doesn't do gravity?
07:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh the first. wait, does our prediction not do gravity?
07:13 < bridge> <totar> ?
07:14 < bridge> <totar> the prediction is just the physics code, nothing about the prediction code itself knows what gravity is
07:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok let me rephrase, we are only doing smoothing and interp separately, because we assume without any influence and states are not changing the prediction is the truth because we can't fake reality.
07:15 < bridge> <totar> you answered my question with a completely different question
07:15 < bridge> <totar> oh
07:15 < bridge> <totar> you said the first nvm
07:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we are only doing smoothing and interp on separate axise
07:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we are only doing smoothing and interp on separate axis
07:15 < bridge> <totar> wdym smoothing and interp, aren't those the same thing?
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> smoothing or interp
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> jeez
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> english
07:16 < bridge> <totar> I still don't understand lol
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's the same thing
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
07:16 < bridge> <totar> ok
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we just call it both
07:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
07:16 < bridge> <totar> I thought you meant you have a seperate system for smoothing and interp
07:17 < bridge> <totar> I thought you meant you seperate systems for smoothing and interp
07:17 < bridge> <totar> I thought you meant you have separate systems for smoothing and interp
07:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i am talking about a system that smooths movements between prediction where we only do (smoothing/interp) on separate axis, because we assume without any influence and states are not changing the prediction is the truth because we can't fake reality.
07:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i am talking about a system that smooths movements between prediction where we only do (smoothing/interp) on separate axis, because we assume without any influence and states are not changing the prediction is the truth because we can't fake reality in our game
07:18 < bridge> <totar> I'm faking reality then
07:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> understood, i go back and address my change requests then
07:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
07:18 < bridge> <totar> the positions I display are not guaranteed to physically possible
07:19 < bridge> <totar> it can be in the wall
07:19 < bridge> <totar> but that's rare
07:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~also our game is the infamous "trust the client" way, where we just send the hook target and a position and verify in server that it indeed not too crazy and just allow it to work even though it is a bit out of the range~~
07:22 < bridge> <totar> interesting
07:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so we kinda focus more on looking right than actively trying to make hooking align with server physics, just a choice that we made
07:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also cheaper on developer
07:22 < bridge> <totar> what happens if tees do hammer fly
07:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> since i only had 3 months to make the whole game from zero base code
07:23 < bridge> <totar> wouldn't that be weird with client authoritative positions
07:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what hammer fly, we don't have that, we sell items that plays and animation of that and just move you up
07:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's a freaking mobile game
07:23 < bridge> <totar> ok... xd
07:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i have 0 care for it
07:24 < bridge> <totar> Idk how prediction can work in that scheme so I'm gonna stop talking about this
07:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can tell you how it can work
07:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we don't care
07:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> our boss love jank
07:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he thinks jank has streamer values
07:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he make sure we don't fix random clipping and flying out of screen because physX decided to do so
07:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~i still did anyway cuz there is no way level testers can work like that~~
07:26 < bridge> <totar> physX???
07:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> unity
07:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is just physX
07:26 < bridge> <totar> for spheres? :cat_tired:
07:26 < bridge> <totar> for circles? :cat_tired:
07:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh, might be box2d then
07:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait let me think
07:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did we actually use a sphere instead of circles
07:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> right 2d, whatever unity is using for 2d then
07:27 < bridge> <totar> unity doesn't use physx by default afaik
07:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> might just be me working on 3d for the past two years so i just have physX PTSDed into my brain
07:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe but i still remember they updated PhysX version in the middle of a LTS version and screwed us with new bugs
07:28 < bridge> <totar> oh I guess unity does use PhysX for 3d
07:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we had the thing where raycast will stop working entirely randomly and player just fall through the ground from beta to ***2 month after release*** until one day we updated our player collision model
07:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we
07:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we've known the bug before a month before release but they keep telling me to stop debugging it and just add more features so we can release it on time
07:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and we did release it on time, with the bug fully unresolved, with 75% of the matchmaking cancelled because the bug
07:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i should stop ranting or my fever might kill me
07:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie i was pretty sure about ddnet clamping and teeworlds dropping because I did check the code. But not 100% sure because I did not run and test the code.
09:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's exactly what i needed, thanks

09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> setting ``m_pObjFailedOn`` causes a fatal error and drops but the ClampInt only sets ``m_pObjCorrectedOn``
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here u can see teeworlds setting the error https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c56fa9e6a20cfc9d7d16502e18c7d7633acdf492/datasrc/compile.py#L185-L190
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here the bottom of ddnets generated code of the function SecureUnpackObj https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734510900.png
09:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``pUnpacker->Error()`` is only packer related stuff so wrongly packed varints or strings not looking at values being in the range only if ``m_pObjFailedOn`` is set the message is dropped

10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so what do you want to tell me with that?
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you have any issue, just state the issue. rn you just try to build something up.
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 crazy you contributed more commits to ddnet in 3 years than i did to ddnet and ddnet++ in 8 years

10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or difficulty of problem guy xd
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github removed loc
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so only think that counts is commits now
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they didnt remove it, it's gone bcs we have over 10000 commits
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> difficulty is hard to grind rank by
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess they algo is simply too shitty xD
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> git gets slow with big numbers
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can host a local gitea instance
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and have the latest data
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i managed to 500 gitlab with the right commits making use of git under the hood getting really slow

10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the algo is some crazy ass C code which i understood nothing about at least for gitlab idk what github does but i assume they also just launch git commands 
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess it's missing the email mapping stuff
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but generally it looks ok.

10:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yes he is
10:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 7/10 germans in the top 10
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet development is still sponsored by giga liga live
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i found teeworlds on chip.de "best free to play games"
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> somewhere top 17 or smth was teeworlds xD
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well i through gamestar
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> actually not sure if any ddnet contributor other than hi leute fround it through giga
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but chip and gamestar are also german gaming media interesting
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im now curious about how everyone found out about the game
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> one of my friends told me about the game
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am interested how learath with 6 years already found the game
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ has to be tiktok
12:00 < bridge> <Dreamless> Steam release
12:19 < bridge> <0xdeen> Saw the Gentoo ebuild being added in 2008 I think
12:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Very recent for me but I had it recommended by a friend who saw the game on Steam
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everytime i do ui work i just notice how much work robyte put into ddnet xd
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just never ending work
12:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: googled game you can play in ubuntu in 2009
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂 and that was like the only result
12:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
12:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> when it was 0.5 and i don't know how to translate it with bitmap fonts so i didn't actually play it, i just downloaded it and opened up a local sever and hooked around a bit and then closed it.
12:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I played Teeworlds for a few minutes a few years ago but it didn't run very well on my potato
12:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> and yes, i did use linux when i was like 13 or 14
12:43 < bridge> <kingmeysam> i want bind deep triple fly
12:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not anymore
12:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And I couldn't use my Wacom tablet to aim so I got mad
12:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Same
12:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> But I was a bit older than that when I first discovered TW
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's probably around the same time when i transitioned into using colemak layout and weird chinese input methods
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> couldn't do any of that after college cuz i was just tired of doing random tinkering with my setup and how i type lol
12:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I still can't use my Wacom tablet to aim but idk if that would be a good idea
13:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> well i used linux when i was 4
13:19 < bridge> <teero777> I saw it at a lan party xd
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> I installed ubuntu and teeworlds was the only game that was in the package manager and worked
13:58 < bridge> <Solly> :D
14:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> Omg same!, my first PC was a Linux one and the game store only had teeworlds and this Mario tux penguin fake
14:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> And teeworlds was the only multiplayer game that would function properly on Linux at that time
14:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> > Mario tux penguin fake
14:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sounds fun
14:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> It was!
14:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> SuperTux was the name
14:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> googling
14:22 < bridge> <patiga> tuxkart is also a banger

14:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i couldn't even tell if you don't tell me
14:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
14:30 < bridge> <patiga> i dunno the red one
14:30 < bridge> <patiga> behind krita
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> also dunno some of the others
14:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> dude this lineup is so funny
14:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> linux cinematic universe
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> but some new maps actually have impreasive graphics
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where is the tee?
14:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> some one pr tees in it, aren't we open source linux game too
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> e.g. that one aquarium map
14:32 < bridge> <patiga> maybe we could get a tee merged :D
14:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i hoped it was not blender, and after googling that blender character, thankfully not
14:33 < bridge> <patiga> huh what even is blenders mascot
14:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't think they have one but they have animation shorts
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> biggest problem of super tux kart is.
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It has super bad default controls on keyboard
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has super annoying music
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is simply not as fun as real mario kart, like not even the old games xD
14:34 < bridge> <patiga> doesnt have one I suppose
14:34 < bridge> <patiga> haven't played in a while, and I never really played mario kart ^^
14:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i wanted to like dr.robotnik's ring racers, but it was so hard to get the control, maybe it's just too hardcore for me. seems like a common problem of kart racers
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> Apparently the red girl is the mascot of the Pepper&Carrot project an open source webcomic
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> they butchered our girl

14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> I had a lot of fun but I just didn't get better so I race quitted
14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> I had a lot of fun but I just didn't get better so I ragequitted
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i did have one and i didn't learn anything when i had it
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> The red/pink in the eyes is making her look like a druggie
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> stop hobby creeping
14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @gerdoe what do you say, isn't she one for you?
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> Quit your job, draw fulltime until you get better
14:59 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> :justatest:
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> What is your opinion about a new tuning allowing for wind in ddnet?
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> so a tuning, which constantly pushes you right or left
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> basically the same as gravity, but in x direction
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so basically speedups
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> yes but without bugs and you don't need to paint it over everything
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> IMO it would be only cool if it has some proper logic and not a tune zone.
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. wind every 10 seconds or similar.
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno if you know these super mario games where there is wind
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> I know exactly what you mean
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> like "swooshing" from left to right
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah 😄
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> hmm is there any other physics related stuff linked to envelops?
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> afaik sadly no
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> tune_envelope <command> <envelope_id>
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> tune_zone_envelope <zone> <command> <envlope_id>
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> 
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> commands: gravity, wind, ...
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> hmm could be a cool idea
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> and the timing in envelops can already be synced
15:16 < bridge> <Assa> I already hear the voices, "what about backwards compatability, what about prediction ... "
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> backwards compatibility you can probably get away with, but I doubt you can ship a feature predictionless in 2024
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i already hear the voices: "dd-pg would solve these issues"
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> dd-pg? does pg stand for patiga?
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet-@patiga
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it's just a random bad name, but the pg stands for playground
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs the idea first was to play around with breaking random stuff
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> I already believe in our great lord and savior @patiga
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> until it become a full rewrite
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> I wrote to heinrich already, all features I am missing are breaking something existing
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sadly we also lack tests etc. my monthly _please contribute to twgame to change it_ is done with that too.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tests for the ddnet mod makes sense to allow easier additions for other physics.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the question is whether ddnet should hosts some kind of alternate physics seasons.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> keep the whole ddnet as is,
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and but allow different physics in a separate game mode with other maps etc.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or if it should be simply completely new servers unrelated to ddnet
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> Is there ever a reason to "break" old physics while adding new stuff?
15:26 < bridge> <learath2> Most of the things we really want to break are just badly coded legacy stuff that should realistically be fixed once
15:26 < bridge> <Assa> ^this
15:26 < bridge> <Assa> also, these things would mostly break with teeworlds, not ddnet necessarily
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you have any example?
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then we wouldn't need to talk so theoretically
15:27 < bridge> <Assa> I have an example for both cases:
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> The skipping behaviours I would unify, the stoppers I'd also remove all the edgecases from, you shouldn't be able to get into a stopper ever
15:27 < bridge> <Assa> The Post-Tick-Tile-Hit calculations, which I already made a workaround PR. This is 20 years old legacy code which is just "wrong"
15:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> imagine pulling a cs2
15:30 < bridge> <Assa> The materials layer, in the end, break on two-material interactions. Standing with one leg on ice and with another on sand can have some interesting physics, but this breaks prediction of older clients, even if emulated with tunings
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> A lot of stuff, that is calculated in a tick, should be actually put into a subtick, you can skip tune zones by being too fast, because your tick ends on the ground or after the tune zone
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes is defs cool if done properly
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean we should not forget that the ddnet 2.0 hype was pretty real
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's always a question of how much you break physics.
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. what learath said, that stoppers will behave different (better) would maybe break current maps, but would defs not break the game
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the core physics + the freeze physics of ddnet are basically unchangeable
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that already includes most interesting gameplay
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> I would if I could
15:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> Had to clean CNC for 8 hours, and It might take another 8 tomorrow
15:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> yet another thing I'd change: edgejumps are also tick dependend, but not subtick, this should be a well though of mechanik, currently it's a "side-effect" or bug
15:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Discussions about changing behaviour of these things usually get closed down pretty quickly :cat_woah:
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> yet other things i can think of: slopes, rounded corners, other shapes of hitbox
15:36 < bridge> <Assa> ^this would break everything
15:37 < bridge> <Assa> also Patiga implemented water at some point, with harpoons and floating projectiles, bending lasers and stuff
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh that was patiga?
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didnt know
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> no, looked it up, it was Stiopa
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wish rendering wouldn't be so unsafe
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i'd also allow the server to host rendering modules
15:39 < bridge> <Assa> That's at least an interesting read: <https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2950>
15:42 < bridge> <woidless> And what's the point of a pointer if the link can immediately take the address as a variable, and I can change the value of the variable directly through the link
15:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i also found out we have dyncam settings when dyncam was off which is kinda weird
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i even use them xD
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's the legacy variables
15:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> they also have different bounds and different naming scheme
15:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
15:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> he's probably talking about reference
15:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> for the same settings for dyncam when dyncam is off oof
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja
15:46 < bridge> <Assa> you often don't want to copy an object, as this can be very expensive and maybe want to have multiple pointers to the same object, also proper deletion, also take a look at smart pointers
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 屑
15:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~i wouldn't mind if we just start to collect things to adjust before new features and just start working on 2.0 in a branch or something at some point :greenthing: ~~
15:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> now that im unemployed
15:47 < bridge> <Assa> you often don't want to copy an object, as this can be very expensive and maybe want to have multiple pointers to the same object, also proper deletion, also take a look at smart pointers, dynamic_cast, reinterprete_cast, ...
15:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i also just learned that reinterprete_cast is mostly ub :justatest:
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> Don't you teach? Order the students to clean the machine
15:51 < bridge> <Assa> me who worked with `void*` ... :justatest:
15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is kinda weird but i do wonder if it is just a non protable thing or is it truly a that compiler might just decides to stop giving you the representation
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Webgpu but for ddnet
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah it's almost always ub
15:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like i can accept it is ub because different machine behave differently. not nessaserily a compiler thing that might just do random conversions
15:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> he's probably talking about references
15:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think it's just a machine thing
15:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is also why i kinda feel like the youtube videos that just tells you never c style cast because it is ub is misleading a bit
15:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ive seen one last night that just says it is ub but not giving any more explanations
15:54 < bridge> <Assa> but is it defined in the compiler standard? If all compilers you are working with define this, it may be ub by the language, but not in practice
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> I'm officially CEO of dd-pg now 😎
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think any compilers try to tame reinterpret cast
15:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think it is defined by c++ as ub with a few exception (which are basically just recasting them back or to a similar representation, which screams portablility)
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> We have bit_cast that has better semantics for most things
15:57 < bridge> <Assa> I have so bad experiences with bit_cast, with little/big endian
15:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> mass layoff time
15:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> its the hot trend
15:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> every CEO and their mothers are doing it
15:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> I need to mostly clean with the machine running
15:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> Can't have a student be crushed by a spindle
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> I don't see the issue. The next stusent can clean up the crushed one
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> I don't see the issue. The next student can clean up the crushed one
15:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what's a spindle
16:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also why does it sound like it has happened before
16:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> Lmao
16:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> Not at my firm but yes it happened
16:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think almost every cautionary step is build upon experience
16:03 < bridge> <Assa> Murphys Law is strong with this one
16:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> guangzhou metro has this, and ive heard they switch to a screen that loops the warning because it is too long to fit on a sticker now

16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Spindle is the rotatey piece
16:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let me guess, a spinning handle
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, you don't hold it though. It holds either your tool (in a cnc machine, or a mill or a drill) or it holds your work piece (in a lathe)
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> https://tenor.com/view/accident-workplace-workplace-accident-gif-13655676427118804708
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> Here is what happens if you let students do it
16:11 < bridge> <Assa> this is unrealistic, not gorey enough 💀
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> Actually technically spindle is what you attach the chuck to which does the holding, but whatever
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> I had a student wear gloves at a lathe
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> First time I screamed at someone
16:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> First time I screamed at someone - like properly
16:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> if a glove gets caught in a lathe, you're lucky if you only loose your hand
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah no gloves with rotary tools

17:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 can one eightbyte have three different classes?
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> Not really. You go two by two, you coalesce into one class
17:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I mean three fields of different classes which fit into one eightbyte
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> You go recursively. Initially the eightbyte has no class, then you analyze the first fields class, after you determine that, you use the rules you wrote above to reduce to one class. Then repeat
17:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ah ok
17:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I read

19:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734545451.png
19:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> him?
19:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok tbh that one is a bit random but i actually watched that like decades ago https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734545485.png
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i know both xD
19:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pro
19:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but did you know all 3 are teeworlds gamers?
19:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZTWRf_KpKo
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah wow, 11 years ago
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is also basically when i knew them
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how did u find that video btw
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has pretty few views
19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was it before they were fame? XD
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so where did you meet mrtrashpack
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in your holidays?
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is he chillin on the same beach
19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he was in munich
19:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> back when he was relevant
19:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk who they are but pog
19:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ its 2am for me rn i am so confused
19:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have no idea how i found that video
19:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i checked my browsing history..
19:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734545773.png
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> considering teeworlds had so many famous players it's impressive that it was never as fame as ddnet is today
19:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was atching some amv and then searched for "applewarpictures teeworlds" thats how you find it <:greenthing:623706333677617203>
19:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf just happend?
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
19:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what made me search that?
19:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ yea teeworlds actually had a lot of exposure but its mostly shallow and casual
19:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the game really shines when you go tryhard and that stuff was never really shown to the public
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks look at this https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/pull/2021#issuecomment-2546627586
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Thanks for the contribution here and appreciate your attention to detail. We have decided to keep as-is.. part of that decision is that more and more folks are using AI chat to access guidance and tables don't always translate well in that context.

19:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> LLMs are the new internte search
19:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so LLM friendly is the new SEO
19:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki windows user confirmed browsing WSL repo
19:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ??!?
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't understand
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> 1:531 is crazy
19:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont use winshit
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ve never seen such a ratio pn github
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ve never seen such a ratio on github
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> my company SSO denies windows btw
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> Based
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> indeed
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.alopex.li/SurveyOfSystemLanguages2024
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chatgpt is better in tables than me 😂
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i have never heard of jai before
19:27 < bridge> <Ewan> Jonathan blow is a legend tho
19:27 < bridge> <Ewan> C++: nah
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://readyset.io/blog/bounds-checks
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear the new nvidia driver webpage is also the worst shit ever
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> select a driver for gtx 1060
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and don't go mad
19:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvidia lost me at the cookie popup
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Jai stands out from the pack by kinda being significant before it was cool, mainly because it is the pet project of game dev Jonathan Blow. Apparently he made Braid and The Witness, made a shitload of money in 2016 at the peak of the indie game renaissance, and proceeded to spend the next eight years dicking around with programming language development. I could try to criticize that, but it would only be out of jealousy ’cause he’s basically 
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> so true
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats my dream
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> get rich to do more programming in stuff that doesnt matter
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear, how can a driver lookup not be done in under 1 second
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> silicon valley
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only AIs developing there at this point
20:01 < bridge> <aegisub> so I should start using more tables huh
20:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> Temporal safety: 10/10 – This is the real good shit, here. This is what the borrow checker gets you. You know what, forget about preventing use-after-free or any of that basic shit; none of the other languages in this list even come remotely close to Rust’s ability to save you from fucking up multithreading. In safe Rust, you simply can’t access multithreaded data without some sort of mutex or other synchronization; it’s a compile-time erro

20:28 < bridge> <Solly> Lmao it's like such a small change
20:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> when humans become second rate citizens
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am team AI
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not the ones we have today xd
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> first thing i'll ask an AGI is, which programming language invented by humans is the best
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> why ask wen answer is rust
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> deep in our hearts, we know.. true 😏
21:26 < bridge> <zhn> ah krita
