00:05 < Savander> deen, 
00:05 < Savander> We need to change one config. sv_last_standing_players 5 to sv_last_standing_players10
00:06 < Savander> It means, we need minimum 10 playesr
00:06 < Savander> to finish the game
00:07 <@deen> 10 is a lot maybe
00:07 <@deen> dunno
00:08 < Savander> me too
00:08 < Savander> zio said that
00:08 < Savander> ^^>
00:08 <@deen> done
00:08 < Savander> ;)
00:08 < Savander> btw i pushed something
00:08 < Savander> not really important
00:08 < Savander> but for others
00:39 < Savander> deen,  could you compile latest version? Admins asked me for it
00:39 < Savander> (more often bot detection messages)
00:39 < Savander> now was only one time
00:41 < Savander> It could be bad detected, now it's more truly
00:41 <@deen> yeah, i'm doing that right now
00:41 < Savander> you mean, compiling?
00:44 <@deen> compiling, setting up fifo, restarting all zcatch servers
00:44 <@deen> and then i never have to do that by hand again!
00:44 < Savander> nice!
00:44 < Savander> :)
00:44 < Savander> HHaha, good feature
00:45 < Savander> but not working with windows :(
00:45 <@deen> well, are there fifos on windows?
00:47 < Savander> probably not
00:48 < Savander> ugh 
00:48 < Savander> i did something wrong
00:48 < Savander> now im on server with my friend
00:48 < Savander> and it works, yes but
00:48 < Savander> always the same data
00:48 < Savander> hmm
00:48 <@deen> data?
00:48 < Savander> same informations
00:48 < Savander> about cheater ^^.
00:51 < Savander> i fixed !
00:53 < Savander> okay sorry deen  for trouble, now all works ;)
01:23 <@deen> np
02:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v3SpY
02:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 2670bd9 def: Clean up autoexec a bit
03:10 <@deen> Someone needs help with PHP and server view: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2041
03:11 <@deen> My GPU just died, guess I'll find out how good the ati driver is by now
03:22 <@deen> oh well, the cheaper amd/ati card with open source driver now runs better than the nvidia one with proprietary driver
03:22 <@deen> for TW and 2d at least
03:22 <@deen> and it's cooler
09:36 < Hamid_Jigool> hello evrybody again
09:36 < Hamid_Jigool> anybody here?
09:36 <@EastByte> hi
09:36 < Hamid_Jigool> hi
09:36 < Hamid_Jigool> i have an question
09:37 <@EastByte> Go on
09:37 < Hamid_Jigool> im running a tee server on linux but when i close the putty server has been shut down!
09:37 < Hamid_Jigool> what can i do?
09:38 <@EastByte> you can use a software like screen or tmux
09:38 <@EastByte> or run the server like "nohup ./teeworlds_srv &"
09:39 < Hamid_Jigool> can you give me a tutorial link? thanks
09:39 <@EastByte> just google for it
09:39 < Hamid_Jigool> now im using this code "nohup ./teeworlds_srv &"
09:39 < Hamid_Jigool> waitt...
09:40 <@EastByte> the & will cause the process to run in background
09:48 < Hamid_Jigool> ow this code is usefull
09:48 < Hamid_Jigool> thank to u EastByte
10:51 < Sadale> I use something like "nohup ./teeworlds_srv >> logfile &" :)
10:51 < Sadale> remember: everything on my server is logged. I'm watching you :)
10:54 <@EastByte> Sadale: wouldn't it be sad if suddenly your log files grow by some gigabytes? :P
10:55 < Sadale> lol
10:55 < Sadale> EastByte, true. I have thought about that.
10:55 < Sadale> EastByte, don't worry. It won't happen \o/
10:55 < Sadale> EastByte, maybe deflate it then.
10:56 <@EastByte> teeworlds also need some fixes for better logging
10:56 <@EastByte> deflation is a good idea, yes
10:57 < Sadale> true. I'm not interested in logging the pickups :<
10:59 <@EastByte> deen: I didn't know pull requests are updated automatically
10:59 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/ddnet/commit/e9a1c3ef9296677036757a0004f7c7c7253a39a3
10:59 <@EastByte> ^ support for 0.6.4
11:03 <@EastByte> afk
12:24 < Nimda> Verification 3.1 by Silex just released on Solo at 2015-08-15 12:17
13:13 <@EastByte> oh, tw 0.6.4 breaks map download on half of the mods
13:46 < Sadale> wat? :o
13:52 <@EastByte> Sadale: an update in teeworlds 0.6.4 forces most system messages to be flagged VITAL
13:53 <@EastByte> but server mod features like fast dl don't use this flag
13:53 <@EastByte> so downloading maps isn't possible
13:53 < Sadale> oh crap
13:53 < Sadale> That's stupid :<
13:53 <@EastByte> well the update indeed prevents some ip spoofing issues
13:54 <@EastByte> but Oy doesn't care about mods of course
13:54 < Sadale> but fastdownload is very important for us :(
13:54 <@EastByte> it's fixable, you can just add the flag there
13:54 < Sadale> You know, I'm living in Asia. Ping are hell high everywhere.
13:54 <@EastByte> but most modifications need updates..
13:56 < Sadale> Totally irrelevant. I've made pinch zoom work in my game :p
13:56 <@EastByte> pinch zoom?
13:56 < Sadale> Well, it spent me a few hours to figure out how to make it work. I hate transformation matrix :<
13:56 < Sadale> android game :p
13:56 < Sadale> a.k.a. two fingers zoom
13:56 <@EastByte> ah
13:57 <@EastByte> hm that's something you usually would use an android lib for (I guess)
13:57 < Sadale> yep. I use libgdx. The game library.
13:57 < Sadale> But well, screw it. It seems that it doesn't have pinch zoom ootb :<
13:58 < Sadale> At least I couldn't find it
14:00 < Sadale> BTW, you ever work with transformation matrix?
14:00 < Sadale> I'm not sure whether I'm alone. But I hate it much :<
15:52 <@deen> 13 DDoS attacks in 24 hours, nice
15:54 <@deen> i gave EastByte access to release maps. If anyone is curious about the process: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/map-release
15:57 < Savander> you shouldn't hide port or something?
15:57 < Savander> 6546
15:57 <@deen> trivial to find out
15:57 <@deen> basically you connect to each port, and one will respond with "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4+deb7u2"
15:57 <@deen> and that's the ssh port :P
15:58 <@deen> i only moved it away from 22 because on 22 I get bruteforce attacks every day
15:58 <@deen> and that fills up the logs
15:58 < Savander> okay ^^>
15:58 < Savander> chine has 22 still!
15:58 < Sadale> port knocking sounds interesting.
15:58 < Savander> i changed port too, for ssh
16:00 < Savander> this public key, is something like https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
16:00 < Savander> ?
16:06 <@deen> yes
16:06 <@deen> the .pub part of it
16:06 <@deen> you shouldn't send other people the private part
16:06 < Savander> ^^
16:07 < Savander> in AWS i used
16:07 < Savander> pkk
16:07 <@EastByte> deen: ssh works
16:07 <@deen> EastByte: ok, great
16:56 <@deen> didn't someone have an API for requesting tw server players? http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2041&p=21736#p21736
16:58 <@EastByte> me for example
16:59 <@EastByte> I didn't make a documentation though ^.^
17:00 <@EastByte> I will respond
17:10 <@deen> thanks
18:25 < Chairn> oO
18:25 < Chairn> i got a segfault using CMap::Load
18:26 < Chairn> stack=[frame={level="0",addr="0x005321c1",func="IKernel::RequestInterface<IStorage>",file="src/engine/kernel.h",fullname="E:\\Teeworlds_DDNet\\src\\engine\\kernel.h",line="64"}
19:18 <@deen> sure, there are thousands of segfaults with map loading
19:28 < BeaR_> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=21&p=21747#p21725 hm ddnet dank meme
19:28 <@deen> ...
19:28 <@deen> tired of that joke after reading it 500 times
19:28 <@deen> BeaR_: EastByte is releasing a ddnet map for the first time right now :P
19:29 < BeaR_> :D
19:29 < BeaR_> also started mapping today btw
19:29 <@deen> nice
19:29 < BeaR_> already found so much stuff which annoys me in the editor :D
19:30 <@deen> improve it!
19:31 < BeaR_> maybe later
19:31 <@deen> fun map releasing process: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/map-release
19:34 < BeaR_> hm might could add a rule to force the mapper to make a screen?
19:34 < BeaR_> -could
19:35 < BeaR_> - iMTG maps are in secret2/maps, race maps are in secret/maps  haha
19:37 <@deen> well yeah, that's not a secret since their servers are the Nuclear #1 and #2 servers :P
19:38  * BeaR_ wonders how to improve the editor /:
19:38 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v37tj
19:38 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 8d7cd79 def: Update Goo! map
19:39 < BeaR_> huh?
19:40 <@deen> eh, the map is shipped as a default map :P
19:40 <@deen> for our cool new autoexec_server.cfg: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/master/autoexec_server.cfg
19:41 < BeaR_> nice
19:42 < BeaR_> heh https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/279
19:42 <@deen> BeaR_: result of people saying that in this channel :P
19:49 < Nimda> Goo! by TyxpekCZ just released on Novice at 2015-08-15 19:43
19:58 < BeaR_> wondering if there can be done anything concerning the banding in the background
19:58 < BeaR_> (not only in Goo!)
20:02 <@deen> banding?
20:02 <@deen> the line from top left to bottom right?
20:02 <@deen> or the small lines where colors change?
20:03 < BeaR_> the color changes
20:08 <@deen> set your bitrate higher?
20:08 <@deen> gfx_color_depth 24
20:08 <@deen> instead of 16
20:09 <@deen> or in windows settings
20:10 < BeaR_> already have 24bit
20:10 < BeaR_> well probably only dithering would solve this
20:16 <@deen> weird, i see no color changes
20:16 <@deen> but i remember seeing it on other people's computers
20:17 <@deen> and it always annoys me, like tearing without vsync^^
20:17 < BeaR_> can't play with vsync, that input delay is enormous :D
20:24 <@deen> woo, ddos number 20 in 24 hours
20:24 <@deen> BeaR_: only on windows?
20:24 <@deen> BeaR_: i've never noticed any on linux
20:26 <@EastByte> I did :p
20:43 < BeaR_> deen: dunno, never played teeworlds on linux ^^
21:07 < Savander> hi
21:11 <@EastByte> hi
21:13 < Savander> network problems onger
21:13 < Savander> ddos?
21:16 <@EastByte> no idea
21:19 <@deen> Savander: yes, 26th ddos in 24 hours
21:19 <@deen> with many small, undetected DoS attacks inbetween
21:22 < Savander> fuckers :/
