00:57 < bridge> <kdaniel> but it counts the player if you donwload the thing on the bottom of the page (byMod, byCountry) you just have the date and playercount.. but i wanted to create a graph for players over the years
00:58 < bridge> <kdaniel> especially for me üò¶  like im playing since 2013-2014 and want to know how many k hours i spent in this lovely game (im not ready to install it on steam because i know the hours will never match the truth)
01:59 < bridge> <patiga> In Rust, which crate would you suggest me to create a thread pool, that limits the amount of pending tasks?
01:59 < bridge> <patiga> creating a new task when the task-list if full should block or smth
02:01 < bridge> <patiga> I have a non-parallel producer, that produces work faster than the worker-threads can keep up with
02:02 < bridge> <patiga> and the memory usage per-task is relatively high
02:39 < bridge> <olokreaz.> hi‚úåÔ∏è, can you please tell me if this functionality is considered legal?
02:39 < bridge> <olokreaz.> I press the button
02:40 < bridge> <olokreaz.> and my dummy hooks me.
02:40 < bridge> <olokreaz.> /* something similar to how DummyHammer works, only with something like DummyHooK, so to speak for hookfly, or you can use only hook for dummy without auto-aiming (only for dummy) as is done with the standard one
02:40 < bridge> <olokreaz.> DummyHook */

02:56 < bridge> <Ewan> just by googling threadpool crate seems to have a job limit
03:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks @matrosel_i !
03:43 < bridge> <vappy19> @matrosel_i ouo
04:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Patiga here u go xd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAaucUvmIuc
04:36 < bridge> <Ewan> Sometimes I feel like I want to do code streams
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen did you even sleep tonight? xd
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u want to ping me?
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah the video even says
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried to ping Patiga because he requested a stream xd
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw the Bob guy that created the issue asked on discord
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> before he created the issue
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who sent him to gh?
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller: defs 11/10 video
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lovin it
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u talk about speedrunning it in 10 seconds and take like 10 minutes to find a config variable
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
10:06 < bridge> <farvelle> https://tenor.com/jCU9ajMUkE0.gif
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fakof jopsti -.-
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> dw chiller it prob takes him 15
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but we will never know cuz jopsti too scared to do stream hehe
10:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can do a stream, but something in dd-pg
10:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
10:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some useful feature
10:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning to rust devs
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> does anyone of you ever had a deja vu where you enter a specific room and you feel like the room is so fucking familiar and also the following times you enter that room it still makes you feel weird about it ?
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you see a black cat?
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No, but during the past say 1-2 weeks i got to know a person whose flat is weirdly familiar
10:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds more like nostalgia
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Possibly, but I've never been her
10:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you never where there before?
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> here*
10:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes jopsti go strim ddpg
10:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes when i eat stuff i also connect it to completely random things that have nothing to do with eating.. i guess our brain simply connects experiences that way
10:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon, now or what?
10:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And it's funny, when I first got into the flat I was already feeling that it's very familiar, but when I saw the bathroom I was really concerned as the shape of the bathroom including a little staircase is something I've never seen before I think but it feels like I did
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i go to the beach now
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> make sure to keep it online after the stream so i can watch it when i have time
10:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Beach in Bayern ?
10:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Bavaria
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was told that smelling something is pretty op at reviving memories
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak
10:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yes
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no proper beach in bali
10:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But nothing here smells "familiar"
10:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm currently in that flat haha
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller i can stream some day when u have nothing better to do than me struggeling
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you want me to watch live?
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> walking around and finding trying to find out why its this way haha
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you gotta stream 24/7 and at some point ima tune in
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller i dunno, u said stream.. if u dont want it live, i can also just record it lmao
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also ok
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but stream is more fun even if missed
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok beach time fr now
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robsti dont forget to merge 0.7 pr
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i would tune into jopsti stream
10:30 < bridge> <Peakies> like it it's funny üòÑ
10:30 < bridge> <Peakies> `chatgpt or chatcpp` üòÖ
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want to view it live or what
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt stream often in my live, especially not in english
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i can try lmao
10:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 2024 year of programming streams? :poggers:
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i have a topic i could try
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lez go
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://youtu.be/RX5kmyOoXBA
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> oh shit
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i was about to do one but now i will watch yours
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj such a cool repo
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> ü§£
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://youtu.be/D7ZHQOM8ty4
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt know that if i mute in one scene it also mutes in another
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quickly delete evidence
12:03 < bridge> <Ewan> afternoon robsti
12:18 < bridge> <robyt3> good day
12:21 < bridge> <Peakies> oh he working on he's rust version of TW
12:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> @jupeyy_keks hehe, nice
12:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236624073107308684/image.png?ex=6638af6a&is=66375dea&hm=6bdb4810bafde244038b34cda407c65344df6287e8f9828a9f335094d31ec299&
12:22 < bridge> <Peakies> oh 69 üòç
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I love how #8303 is an epic issue discussing problems affecting future decades. Good timing robsti. So should we slap some C++20 label on that issue?
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti nononono
12:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> Char abuf(2048) ez fix
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I said i am at the beach for a sec and i want to watch it later in case i missed it
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1714905969.png
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ._.
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yessss jopsti this is why i wanted live stream! I caught you in action 
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Patiga started epic trend 
12:49 < bridge> <Peakies> üòÑ
13:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> hyprland is such a hate-loving relationship
13:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> i love flashy colors, but i also hate having to open the config every 5 seconds lol
13:42 < bridge> <teero777> also hate wayland lmao
13:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D - how many custom keybinds are you using btw? - i was in awe seeing how fast you navigated through vsc, that speed is something i only ever get when using nvim
13:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> and you used your mouse!
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh hard to say, sometimes i use many sometimes i don't use them at all.
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what i often use is `ctrl + p` to open files quickly & `ctrl + space`  & `tab`/`enter` to try to let rust analyzer do stuff
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mouse is best
13:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you use an AI assistant for code completion? or was that solely rust-analyzer
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that was rust-analyzer only
13:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> damn
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti is average windows enjoyer using da mouse
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> When i boot ddnet and check the local console it says `2024-05-05 20:02:13 D stun/4: got address: ` followed by some ip
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whose ip is that?
14:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh, thats just my ip grabber i PR'd without them noticing
14:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont worry about it
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> backdoor moment
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If i look mine up it reveals my location. I would have leaked that on stream. Which could have been a problem if my location wasn't publicly known already.
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Imo opening the local console should not reveal your location.
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it's just faster
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mouse haters just have skill issue :lol:
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i for sure have mouse aim issues
14:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> true my aim sucks
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopstis rust auto completion looks pog
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti teach me how to not lose chat window in the vod xd
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have no idea. it was always there for me
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye same for me on other yt accs
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but this time it got lost on stream end xd
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so jopsti daily 2h streams now?
14:47 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks I now did some multithreading for the encoder, it uses most of the cpu now :)
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc. have you looked into if you can use VAAPI/hardware acceleration easily too?
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd be really interested in how fast that would be üòÑ
14:48 < bridge> <patiga> hm are those ffmpeg configurations? I was hoping the ffmpeg would already choose the best method of encoding ^^
14:50 < bridge> <patiga> thanks :)
14:50 < bridge> <patiga> I found that `rayon` offers an API to turn non-parallel iterators into parallel ones, that works out nicely https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelBridge.html#tymethod.par_bridge
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it is configuration, but at least working with the c ffmpeg it was very hard to do xD
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not like "yo use GPU"
14:50 < bridge> <patiga> hmm, I'll take a look
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Really? I thought ffmpeg did have an abstraction so you wouldn‚Äôt have to know anything about vaapi/nvenc
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has an abstraction, but it was still hard to enable it
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well hard enough that i lost interest at least
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .. try even to find source code examples lmao
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> fn main() -> u32 {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   let x: A = A {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     a: 2
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   };
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   let y: u32 = x.hello(4);
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   return y;
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> struct A {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   a: u32,
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> impl A {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   pub fn hello(self: &A, x: u32) -> u32 {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return self.a + x;
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>   }
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> edlang now supports struct methods
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have specialized self syntax but its nice
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> still havent added strings xd
15:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> :brownbear:
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks is training in aimlabs for vscode lmao
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you want to tell me you all don't use mouse when coding?
15:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nop
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> just turn your mouse on its back to prevent habits
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i actually think working with mouse is better xD
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's often much faster than doing it over keyboard
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> keybinds are kinda better xd
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> imgine you wanna go down a few lines. how you would do it is either spam Down or you swith to mouse, move down and click and then switch back to keyboard xd
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> with keybinds you can just like 16j and youre down 16 lines
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and how do you count the lines? xd
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> relative line numbers xd
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236673165753585734/image.png?ex=6638dd22&is=66378ba2&hm=eb0a33258bc4dde6d79ddbf4587de718e81002aa7635e66baab6ed7a841e0c95&
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well but with your key bind you have to trigger the bind + input a number
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that doesnt sound faster
15:39 < bridge> <teero777> its if i want to go 15 lines down its 3 keys lmao
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but with mouse i can also directly click where in the line i want to go
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can share coding if you want. i'd like to see if it's worth it
15:40 < bridge> <teero777> maybe in a few years when im actually good and fast at vim motions xdd
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @teero777 btw apparently you asked how the code diff looked like:
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `28 files changed, 557 insertions(+), 248 deletions(-)`
15:46 < bridge> <teero777> code diff of what? Xd
15:47 < bridge> <teero777> i asked about cloc in your src dir xd
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounded like u wanted the code diff from the stream
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah of all source code?

15:57 < bridge> <learath2> but that takes one of your hands off of the keyboard, location within the line is the harder part, but you get used to it
15:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> the only thing nvim is faster is in line movement, actual navigation "can!" be faster, but i usually just do /Whateveriwanttojumpto
15:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> the only thing nvim is faster is in line movement imho, actual navigation "can!" be faster, but i usually just do /Whateveriwanttojumpto
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> I use $,^, W/E, w/e a lot
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is line movement
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> lets say you have this line:
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> rofi -show combi -combi-modi "window,drun,ssh" -modi combi
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> if you want to jump to the third , (for example editing out ssh)
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> you'd say: 3f,
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 3 jumps to the character ,
16:01 < bridge> <learath2> I find myself using `va{` and `ci(` a lot aswell, and I have treesitter based ones too
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> lets say you have this line:
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> rofi -show combi -combi-modi "window,drun,ssh" -modi combi

16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> if you want to jump to the third , (for example editing out ssh)
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> you'd say: `3f,`
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> 3 jumps to the character `,`
16:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> i should use visual mode more tbh, im wasting a lot of potential lmao
16:04 < bridge> <learath2> I very rarely yank without visuals, idk it's just a habit
16:04 < bridge> <learath2> even things like `v10jy`
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 show how you coding pls
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blaiszephyr u too
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no excuses
16:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> my arch setup? because i've sent my windows one already
16:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> lol
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not very impressive yet, I'm still warming up to my new setup after years of vscode
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> really, when?
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> right
16:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> here
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what AI is that?
16:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> copilot
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that autofulfills the macro
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
16:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> but
16:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> its autofill was ass
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> stop aiing  code :pepeW:
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> i realized its aiing wasnt aiing enough, so i didnt even autocomplete >:c
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> we'll all be replaced by the robots soon enough, let us enjoy the few remaining years of our craft
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> i dumped it again tho, i wanted to try it out and its writing unsafe code to a point where im questioning from where this AI fetches its data
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> It's probably much better at C/C++ or JS

18:14 < bridge> <Tyrone> ive tried looking in controls.cpp and around im probably bein dumb
18:14 < bridge> <Tyrone> but it seems like controls.cpp is just for the dummy
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> <a:alarm:774780596731904032>

18:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> like
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> it's mostly all in controls.cpp
18:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> oh
18:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> so maybe i am being dumb
18:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> i wanna basically check to see if a key is pressed
