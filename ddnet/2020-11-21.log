01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> When I try to compile DDNet on the WSL (Version 1) with gcc it will compile fine and start. However, it cannot initialize SDL2 then because I'm on the subsystem. Is there a known way around this somehow? 
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```log
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> [2020-11-21 01:11:30][sdl]: SDL version 2.0.10 (compiled = 2.0.10)

01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> This are the last 5 lines printed to the log
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> How can I quickly compile DDNet? I change a string and it takes 1 minute to compile
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 you could copy the whole config directory and try on Linux or send to us
08:37 <+ChillerDragon> @Spyry how many threads do you use for compiling? How bad is your hardware? And which file are you editing? If you edit a deeply rooted file that everyone depends on then it has to recompile a lot.
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @stnwtr does WSL support graphical applications at all?
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because this error message sounds like not
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and what is your goal? If it's just to get a Windows executable, you should use mingw or Visual Studio
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/779617195135074304/unknown.png
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª it was a clean config
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Just use the most recent github version.
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Ravie write shorter messages
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I really love the new chat layout. Especially that it has miniature of a player skin. It's easier to tell if that's a zombie or a human. Players tend to trick others a lot telling "he is on right side of a map, catch him" while being on the other one ðŸ˜„
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I was tricked by that every time and it was annoying ðŸ˜…
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie how does it break readability? it improves it actually
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> what do you mean hole on the left side
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> idk about you, but I read who said the message, and then my eyes naturally go to the *left side* of the next line
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the text is always align next to the name
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie write the exact same text with old chat
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and send a pic and then rate again
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you read chat as a continuous text, this does break the flow
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh ok, i disagree on that
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also more often that not it leaves a single word in the next line which looks extra stupid with the huge hole next to it
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it should have been like that before
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we didnt change that algorithm
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but it would be kinda tucked under the name and not look dumb
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well the best would be if the name is above the message always like here on discord
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the chat is too small for that
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> cozy mode :justatest:
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also most games with chat that I'm familiar with also wrap chat like old tw
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> @deen 
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I am trying to keep my Windows Environment clean and install most of the Toolchains on the WSL. So my question would be if it is possible to compile for Windows with gcc/g++.
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> However, I also tried installing VS Community 2019 but keep getting errors compiling the Client.
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I am pretty new to DDNet-Sources and Compiling and only got basic knowledge in C/C++.
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> The warnings I get compiling with Visual Studio:
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```warnings
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> cl : Command line warning D9025 : overriding '/MDd' with '/MTd'
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> cl : Command line warning D9025 : overriding '/W3' with '/W0'
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> The error I get compiling with VS:
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```error
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\include\10.0.18362.0\um\winnt.h(2482): error C2338: Windows headers require the default packing option. Changing this can lead to memory corruption. This diagnostic can be disabled by building with WINDOWS_IGNORE_PACKING_MISMATCH defined.
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I read on some sites that this error occurs because of the `Zp (structure packing)` Flag. However, I cannot really find where to change it in Clion
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @stnwtr Probably you need to use mingw and cross-compile then.
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not a Visual Studio expert, but there were some tutorials that should work: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=5765
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ~~Or just install Linux, fix that and ruin your life in every other aspect~~
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo using cmake-gui makes it really ezt
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo using cmake-gui makes it really ez
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just define the source and dest directory generate VS .sln project and open it normally in VS
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> VS2019 should be able to open CMake project directly
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> finally ðŸ˜„
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @noby have u exported your fng 0.7 map without a "data" directory
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs it looks broken with 0.7 client
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i sometimes get huge fps drops right now, with no apparent reason
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even on older versions?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> how can i figure out where they come from?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> good point, gonna check
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i didnt have them earlier tho and my computer setup hasnt changed, no problems in other games
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the biggest problem with laggs is using a old client after using a new client, bcs that can reset alot of default config vairables
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, also between the closer versions?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i switch between the steam (non-nightly) and the one from the aur all the time
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that should be fine
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> okay, im gonna check on an old client
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade VS's cmake support is god awful
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your best bet on windows is to avoid VS, just use mingw or msvc from the command line with whatever make you want
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nmake, ninja, msys make all work just fine
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but cmakes vs support is good xd
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª about the map optimizer, do I just run it after map_convert_07?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes but be aware that it always outputs maps into "out"
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, that's a bit annoying, but ok
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but you could do ./map_optimize "m.map" "../m.map"
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok not the same name
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else it reads and writes the same file xD
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that is very unintuitive
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ../m.map should be from your CWD, not from out
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the default can be out/m.map, ok
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes but i said that in the pr
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its to be sure its not overwritting old files ever
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I forgot about that stuff already, too long ago ðŸ˜„
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but feel free to change this parameter things ðŸ˜„
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just want to use it for 0.7 maps for now, not improve it
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> alright
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen do you understand what that guy on steam tried to say?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure which
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª if you only want to build yeah the vs project generation works, it's hardly any good for development
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/eventcomments/2988663148728603286
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nor is it "good" for building, the generated project will not have launch targets correctly set
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some graphics bugs, maybe ask him to provide screenshots
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well it sounded like he fixed it, but not sure xD
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you asked me if i can help him, but i dont understand him xd
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 it updates if the cmake file changes
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> map_optimize takes a while, but 50% size is nice
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> map_convert was slower for me xD
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> killed my whole pc xD
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, but I had map_convert finsihed already
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and now need to map_optimize all maps ðŸ˜„
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> out of memory probably?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nah i have 32gb, it was just that KDE thought my pc crashed or smth, atleast i had to replace it with a new isntance
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i triggered all maps at once xD
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> map_optimize takes around 5minutes with all my cores
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that sounds dangerous
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª want to look into it? Got to go afk a bit
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise I'll check in the evening
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i've no idea for the network code, but if its easy i can look into it

13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Slayer> cant find it
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> weird
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Slayer> so i have to download from website?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe idk
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> update manualy
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Slayer> @Boti. nice to move all your stuff in the new folder...
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> yup
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Slayzn its better to replace and store all stuff into your config directory anyway
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the config directory is just like a data directory, u can do the same thing there
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Slayer> i will do^^

14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_OmgMask:
16:26 <+Learath2> Riddle me this, I'm too sleepy to study I'll just fall asleep, I'm too sleepy to code, I can't really think when sleepy and I can't sleep because then I won't be sleepy at night
16:26 <+Learath2> Wtf am I supposed to do then? I'm just standing up and walking around the house so I don't just fall asleep
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sleep
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or play teeworlds :greenthing:
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> play teeworlds
16:39 <+Learath2> everyone knows I only play tw at 2am
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I think we explicitly wanted ot not run Jupeey's optimize map tool on all maps
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what does that tool do?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> removes unused tiles from tilesets
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that sounds pretty useful tho
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, you're only talking about autogenerated 0.7 maps, I see (@ deen)
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen is showall now on and cant be disabled?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (for teams)
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Slayzn yes, the last few versions had a broken autoupdater unfortunately
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª no, but client sends the distance and server sends as far you can see
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 yeah, only autogenerated ones. especially important because 0.7 download is so slow
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> got a crash
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But you can still manually enable /showall to get a demo where you can see all
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the auto demo of my friend it was exactly when someone joined
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you can reproduce it with demo?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then should be easy to debug
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nope
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/779751125472641054/Planet_Mercury___.demo
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (spec the other tee "lume")
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the timing is just too perfect
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> exactly crashed when someone joined, or the skindownloader)
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> :/
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sadly no output nothing ðŸ˜¦
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen fwiw download on 0.7 should be at old fastdownload speeds now
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, that's still relatively slow for me when I'm far away
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is still nowhere near what we get with http yeah
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The releases on the website are completely broken for me, doesn't happen if I build it myself, I can't debug it either
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (it's rather impossible to debug something when you have no debug symbols)
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh damn. could it be related to the shared library versions on your system?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> could be, do you know of a ldd equivalent I could use to check which libraries are being loaded?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, it's on mac?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on windows
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think windows should always prefer the local directory
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macOS might be completely insane, but atleast it comes with the tools to sort out the insanity
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's weird that you're the only one reporting it. many should use windows
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well we have ppl who record instant crash dont we?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in steam
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and in #bugs
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> smells like it crashes in the nvidia driver
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no...
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> since I never installed the driver by hand I assume windows update shipped it to me
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, but u said it showed strange outputs, didnt u?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah could u test 14.6 or earlier
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah could u test 14.5 or earlier
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wanna know if old renderer works atleast
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't understand anything about this, if I launch it from a command line it works just fine. If I launch it under a debugger it instantly crashes, if I launch it by double clicking it just dies around when we initialize gfx
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ohh  ok
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> confusing af
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe timing tho
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in windbg it says it crashed deep inside the nvidia driver, in VS it says it crashed in ntkernel, in cdb it says it didn't crash at all
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now that we have timing crashes with intel and nvidia driver this is really bad :/
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but this one is completly different
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> intel crashes inside a map
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also its not confirmed yet, its just possible
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> How do I switch from Time to Score?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SDL2 calls into some opengl thing, which calls into nvoglv64.dll which calls into KernelBase.dll!GetFileType() which fails and raises an exception
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `0xC0000008: An invalid handle was specified.`
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the best I can do without symbols for SDL2.dll
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 do u know our caller?=
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have symbols for our code either
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can try to reverse it ðŸ˜›
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah right u said that ðŸ˜„
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but own builds work fine @Learath2 ?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, if I build it myself it works fine
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe its a mingw bug xd
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no idk what sdl it links to if I build myself
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, ghidra figured out what SDL function it's calling
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I forget that disassemblers use more than just debug symbols ðŸ˜›
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's SDL_CreateWindow
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well u could just replace the SDL2.dll
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which explains why it crashes before I ever see any graphics
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How silly is it that windows doesn't let me know it crashed? it seems like it exits gracefully but it raises an exception all the way in the kernel...
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i probs would as soon as the windows would be created
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but without any kind of window it just closes it
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if there is a console attached it launches fine btw
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats a really strange bug xD
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> have u tried 32bit?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait I'm almost there ðŸ˜›
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if this has something to do with the debugging support we added
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `GDI32.DLL::ChoosePixelFormat`
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `opengl32.dll!pgldrvLoadAndAllocDriverInfo()`
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its default off
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but this should be the normal process of creating a opengl window
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> doesnt sound weird to me
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay for some reason my computer is running AppVerifier
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which I don't get because I don't even have it running?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, seems VS injects this to break on exceptions
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't work like this, why is it injecting things into my environment?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what did u expect xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to debug a volatile bug when the environment is actively being manipulated by the debugger itself?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get how this tool is "industry standard" and how people swear by it. How can you do any serious work with this?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> have u tried to disable highdpi flag?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay found why verifier.dll is getting injected. Did you know about IFEO on windows? turns out VS sometimes sets a global flag on an image file
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but forgets to remove it when it's done debugging
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> never heard of it xd
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Windows and it's mishmash of a thousand year old systems is really so, sooo, sooooooo annoying
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How in the world can a process with TrustedInstaller privileges fail to write to registry?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, removing the stupid registry key using some arcane black magic to launch regedit with TrustedInstaller privileges finally fixed this most annoying issue
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen can you lookup where finishes are made, on what exact server?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> from database no
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> from teehistorian yes, I think
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just still wonder about my crash, maybe asan server side would have shown something
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> asan only runs on ger2
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah thats why i wanted to know ðŸ˜„
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and ger2 showed nothing special in the last days except what I opened the bug for
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess i have to play with asan then xd
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even if the perf is really annoying
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess there is no timing bug, there is a bug in sdl though which causes this exception when a console is not attached
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing some winapi function takes a handle to an existing window before allowing you to create a new one, but we nuke our console too early
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but does using a different SDL.dll fix it?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well let me give it a try to just complete this mess of an experiment
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope even with the newest SDL the exception is raised
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing somewhere along the 5 different libraries this call traverses, someone catches this exception and drops it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (instead of not passing an invalid handle to winapi in the first place)
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh if you ever want to give Application Verifier a try on windows, it's also completely broken unless you launch it with TrustedInstaller privileges
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and windbg might or might not accidentally add your application to the wrong application verifier list causing it to be run under 32bit, a native 64bit binary running under 32bit is veeery fun to debug
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And application verifier requiring kernel support is a testimony to how horrible an ecosystem windows is
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will go have a drink, this experience really depressed me
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> How do I switch from Time to Score?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in client? cl_ddrace_scoreboard 0
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in server: there's probably some flag or it depends on servertype
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try to change name to something not containing ddnet/race
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck you probably know ^
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen in which file can I change this?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gamemode.h
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> does anyone know what default flags are set by gcc ? how can I check that
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like -Wall
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `gcc -Q --help=warnings|grep enabled`
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen i changed the names and not worked
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't set GAMEINFOFLAG_TIMESCORE in gamecontroller.cpp
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try to figure out such things on your own. In this case it was rather easy. I told you about cl_ddrace_scoreboard already, when you grep for that, you find its in-code name `ClDDRaceScoreBoard`. When you grep for that, you find `m_TimeScore` in `scoreboard.cpp`. When you grep for that, you find `GAMEINFOFLAG_TIMESCORE` in `gameclient.cpp`. So the final grep for that delivers you to the source in the server: `gamecontroller.cpp`
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Spyry I've just made this
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/779800406435299328/Screenshot_from_2020-11-21_23-07-56.png
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> As none of DDRace gameinfo flags were relevant to my mod.
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And yes, TIMESCORE is the thing.
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Btw you will bump into many more fixes after that. As there is no separate score for points, it's still seconds.
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And you will need to remove all logic that will load and save time.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And maybe you will need to negate score for 0.7 clients before giving it them.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean giving them negative value.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And you will need to add adding score for kills off course.
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And you will need to add incrementing score for kills off course.
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```src/game/server/player.cpp
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> void CPlayer::ProcessScoreResult(CScorePlayerResult &Result)```
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> comment out all here
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ah and you will need to reset score after match end
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and make matches ðŸ˜„ as there are none
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @deen ty
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> negative score logic is here
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> src/game/server/player.cpp
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```void CPlayer::Snap(int SnappingClient)
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ...
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> -       int Score = abs(m_Score) * -1;
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> +       int Score = m_Score;
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> +       if (Server()->IsSixup(SnappingClient))
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> +               Score = m_Score * -1;
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> not sure if you really need it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```src/game/server/player.cpp
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> void CPlayer::Snap(int SnappingClient)
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ...
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> -               pPlayerInfo->m_Score = Score == -9999 ? -1 : -Score * 1000;
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> +               pPlayerInfo->m_Score = Score == -9999 ? -1 : -Score; // TBD: removed multiplication
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> +               //pPlayerInfo->m_Score = Score == -9999 ? -1 : -Score * 1000;
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as time score was in milliseconds and you reuse score variable, so you don't need multiplication
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Spyry @stnwtr ^ about scoring
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen unfortunately there is no simple switch as DDNet is tailored to scoring in time, not points.
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> Oh
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also to show score to all players on "match end" you need to set server flag to paused = true for 3-5 seconds.
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That was a hard trick to find.
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There is no documentation and I've spent about day searching for that.
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There is no documentation and I've spent about a day/ searching for that.
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But we can write one ofc
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh it's rather awful to work with ddnet as a mod base :/
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> too much spaghetti
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> ```go
