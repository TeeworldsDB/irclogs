00:20 < bridge> <01000111g> I mean, there are other controversial flags aswell. For instance Palestinian flag, which is not a true country according to UN. Or EU flag, which also isnt a country. Or a flag that looks like Reichskriegsflagge, but is also a flag of a true country.
00:23 < bridge> <kebscs> most are from the 3166-1  standard
00:23 < bridge> <kebscs> except eu and few british ones
00:24 < bridge> <kebscs> most are from the iso 3166-1  standard
00:25 < bridge> <01000111g> Yeah, I mean idc that much, we can keep it as solely these countries, bit I think more flags arent bad either. I'd like a pirate flag and some others aswell.
01:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> o my shit i would love a pirate flag
01:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> idk why i feel so strongly abt that
01:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> this is a veyr slippery slope
01:02 < bridge> <oxyzo.> the finnish flag üèÅ
01:02 < bridge> <sollybunny> i want that one too
01:02 < bridge> <sollybunny> /:
01:02 < bridge> <sollybunny> how about add all the flags in unicode
01:03 < bridge> <sollybunny> then we defer the choice to unicode and get more flags
01:03 < bridge> <oxyzo.> üá®üá≠The medkit flag
01:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> das switzerland
01:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> british flag not in a standard for flags?
01:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> damn someone had a vendetta
01:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh u mean enlgnad scotland and wales
01:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> why does it use the numeric codes tho
01:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats interstying th uk is reserved by .. the uk
01:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> even tho they have gb
01:17 < bridge> <kebscs> yes the ones with `-`
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> idk but when i have a controller plugged in and use steam controller input my mouse input deltas are mapped to relative movements from the center as if it was receiving joystick inputs lol
01:27 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> even in the worst case scenario
01:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> that sentance doesnt make... much sense
01:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> im not sure what youre agreeing with
01:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> wdym in the worse case??
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i agree with the sentiment behind it
01:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> whats the sentiment?
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> that i find it more agreeable when people are vocal about their culture than their sexual orientation
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> imo even the most obnoxious nationalist is not as bad as the most obnoxious person who is proud of their sexual orientation or gender
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> that i find it more agreeable when people are vocal about their culture than their sexual orientation and or gender
01:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> this sentance makes sense
01:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> i mean... i dont like either
01:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> idk which i would prefer
01:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> but having a flag of either isnt any of.. either
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> this depends on how the organization is configured, often times org members still won't have unregulated push access. only collaborators
01:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> but having a flag of either isnt obnoxious in any degree
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but i don't know how ddnet set it up
01:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> it shows on the people tab on the right <https://github.com/ddnet>
01:34 < bridge> <sollybunny> but having a flag of either isnt obnoxious in any degree or being voal
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> right, that shows organization members, not necessarily people with push access (i.e. to merge your pull request)
01:34 < bridge> <sollybunny> but having a flag of either isnt obnoxious in any degree or being vocal since its a flag no one really looks at either
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> is that what you're asking
01:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> wat wuld be the purpose of having members
01:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> who cant write
01:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> since its open source
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there are some very large orgs
01:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> it makes sense to permit read access to an organization if the repos are private
01:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> it doesnt if the repos are public
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> epic games has you join theirs to even develop with unreal engine, that shouldnt mean you have unregulated push access to every repo in the org
01:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> also theres 12
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> at my work im in the whole umbrella org but i only have push access to things im a collaborator on and things on my team
01:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats cuz its otherwise private, also extremley weird
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> they may want to enable push access to e.g. wiki contributors & people who contribute graphics to certain repos and not others
01:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> o true
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> they may want to enable push access for e.g. wiki contributors & people who contribute graphics to certain repos and not others
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a trust me bro moment
01:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> x-x

02:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless 1. which camera? 2. I don't speak russian so I need your help 3. I think this is already done? Did you test it?
02:49 < bridge> <woidless> 2. Use Deepl, it translates normally, but in no case Google translator
02:50 < bridge> <woidless> 1. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –Ω–µ –≤ –Ω–µ–≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –∏–¥–µ–º —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –∑–∞ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–µ–º
02:50 < bridge> <woidless> 1. When we are not in invisibility, when we walk the screen follows the character, it does not let the character leave the screen
02:51 < bridge> <woidless> And when invisibility is enabled on me, the screen does not follow the character
02:53 < bridge> <woidless> 2. For an accurate comparison, you can log in to TeeSports and write different commands
04:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I was SO confused because the Finnish flag is already in the game
04:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> took me a solid 20 seconds to realize that you're talking about the finish flag
04:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You know that's not a proper definition for the term. By your logic "racial minority" would be describing a minority of people are racial, which, just, doesn't make sense?
04:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You know that's not a proper definition for the term. By your logic "racial minority" would be describing a minority of people who are racial, which, just, doesn't make sense?
04:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you think the term is politically incorrect just tell me, don't pretend it doesn't mean what it means
04:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless fixed 1.
04:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> about translations i dont want to use deepl but rather have a native proof read it. And TS changed a few things also their language is quite offensive.
04:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> let me know which messages you need to have replaced with what
04:22 < bridge> <woidless> Let's give everything that can be used by people
04:22 < bridge> <woidless> Tell me the text in English, I'll translate it
04:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no u find the messages you need translation for :p 
05:24 < bridge> <woidless> What?
05:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless i am not going to just translate everything send me the text that you want translated
06:09 < bridge> <Ewan> why is the kog tab gone
06:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> their code not opensource i think

06:14 < bridge> <woidless> Also /pay , tournament block
06:14 < bridge> <Ewan> oh that went through
06:14 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
06:15 < bridge> <woidless> And also how to return to tab not the passage time , but the level of people
06:16 < bridge> <woidless> And also translate the block of the stream
06:16 < bridge> <woidless> Well, like when a person has 5 block of murders, he wrote in the fx chat, He scored 5 block of murders
06:16 < bridge> <woidless> And if it was taken away from him, you also need to translate it
06:16 < bridge> <woidless> And also I want the mechanics of flags
06:54 < bridge> <oxyzo.> M
07:26 < bridge> <soulyvevo> any idea why kog community tab doesnt show up?
07:26 < bridge> <soulyvevo> all servers seem to be in none category
07:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless ok now send it as text in english and russian ideally here and not on discord https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues

18:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> you "tried" to crash the kernal? its... not very hard to do so.. and also not very fun making kernal modules or when they crash
18:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> wdym reverse dummys inputs? implement a cl_dummy_mirror or something like that (if it isnt already) if u need that
18:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> what r u trying ot do anyway

18:54 < bridge> <getsaa.xyz> ||Ngl, this idea was cause a friend is currently working on a map where the freezes would look way better with the "Overlay" blend mode||
19:13 < bridge> <woidless> How to make DDNetPP so that the tab shows the level instead of the finish time.
19:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> the tab as in pressing tab?
19:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> or tab as in the window that shows up when you press tab

20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> why is it generated
20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh as a fallback
20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> im just looking at all the random things its fun xd
20:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> by removing all the random rust nonsense which idk what it even does removes a mb of the executable xD
20:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://research.google/blog/scalable-self-improvement-for-compiler-optimization/
20:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> inling would increase executable size
20:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> but interesting
20:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> wait inlining for size? how
20:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> also ai to do compiling is defaintley a no go
20:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> for compile times
20:23 < bridge> <zhn> for server to identify you
20:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @sollybunny search SSA form
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> inlining is the basis for lot of optimizations since it allows better optimization in each place
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont think its just 1 pass inlining, its inlining and then more passes
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> @sollybunny imagine you have a main function and a hello function, the hello is simply a x * y, and main has a call to hello with 2 values, the compiler is smart to inline such a function in main
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it can completly remove the hello function
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> thus decreasing code size
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> a function call has some small overhead
20:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> by a single symbol. i get function inlining
20:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> i thought that was realtivly... solved and not worth worying about
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is i think
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm is rly good at it
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust relies heavily on it
20:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> but theres inlining other than that?
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u mean
20:27 < bridge> <anxietygodd> @everyone discord.gg/B9yGaMcy8p EJNrdGvnCk
20:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @Discord Mod
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> as I read it ssa form is turning human readable code into a more machine readable code so optimization is easier as you have to handle less cases
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> 
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a = 5 + b
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a *= 3
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ->
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a = 5
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a1 = a + b
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a2 = a1 * 3
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> as I read it ssa form is turning human readable code into a more machine readable code so optimization is easier as you have to handle less cases
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> 
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a = 5 + b
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a *= 3
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ->
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a = 5
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a1 = a + b
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> a2 = a1 * 3
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
20:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> also "static" how does it achieve that
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> theres way too much dynamic stuff for **everything** to be static
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  ssa form is turning human readable code into a more machine readable code
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ssa form means a variable is only assigned once
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> specially when pointes get involved
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> well what u did there is correct
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ur wording is weird
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> pointers*
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> pointers arent rly dynamic
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> or wait maybe you can
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are a variable that points to a place in memory
20:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> \* thinking way too mcuh about this \*
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#getelementptr-instruction
20:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh okay sure
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is how llvm deals with pointers
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and load/store
20:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> but what does this have to do with inlining
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but u said pointers out of nowhere xd
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they do have relation
20:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> no sorry i tripped myself up
20:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> ignore that
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example if u know a pointer is not aliased u may do some stuff
20:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah
20:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you have a lib for parsing tw packets in C? :DD
20:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> i was like surely with all the pointer shenangins you can do. having everything static must make something break
20:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> but i cant think of a case
20:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> because its fine if everything is static
20:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> but waht does ssa have to do with inlining
20:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> and why is there a paper on it?
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> because SSA allows making the inline pass easier
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ssa makes analysis way way easier
20:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> inling a function at best saves a single symbol. and at worse increases binary size by lots
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> since it makes analyzing where a variable is used
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> inlining at best allows a shitload more optimizations to be done
20:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> we arent talking about functions
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> in some contexts if u have a place where inlining for example allows avoiding some expensive div or smth
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> or a branch
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can save a lot
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> inlining is about functions
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk what u talking about
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > LLVM basis is the LLVM IR, a Static single-assignment form (SSA) language, that looks like pseudo assembly. The main property of SSA is that each variable is assigned exactly once and defined before it is used.
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > It is what LLVM works on to apply all the optimization passes, it being SSA is one of the major enablers of the optimizations it can do (and what makes it easier to implement them), to name a few (from wikipedia):
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Constant propagation: conversion of computations from runtime to compile time, e.g. treat the instruction a=3*4+5; as if it were a=17;

20:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> ^ this isnt about inlining
20:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its what inlining can allow
20:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> does it try to inline a function see if it can do any of these
20:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> then decide whether to do it
20:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> it could
20:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> but im still not sure how it reduces size apart from dead code elimination
20:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> unless alot of dead code is generated by cpp or rust and in only detetctable thru inlining functions
20:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> unless alot of dead code is generated by cpp or rust and  only detetctable thru inlining functions
20:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i surrendeer
20:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> ):
20:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> dont
20:42 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/media/IL-Compiler-Optimization-compiler-decisions.mp4
20:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> assuming all these functions are heavy its very obvious where to inline here
20:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> where only 1 function calls it
20:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1303445002407383070/image.png?ex=672bc741&is=672a75c1&hm=40ae295d01106ba056fcddc4c3c4274e73468814a82597dba7563320c6e0d390&
20:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> if this was inlined im not suer what happens here
20:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> in the case that its dead code anyway it can be removed
20:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> but if it is dead code only with the state of the caller then inling hsould be done
20:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> done as in inlined and then subsequently removed
20:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> or partially removed
20:46 < bridge> <teero777> https://tenor.com/view/nokotan-shikanoko-nokonoko-koshitantan-kenshiro-gif-6611478418379268599
20:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> sure i can see how that would now be a hard problem to solve
20:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> other than just trying it based on some heuristic
20:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> but i dont see how ai helps
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah idk either
20:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> the inputs arent really clear
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> its google marketing
20:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> whats # bbs, # users and callsite "height"
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh all i was saying was based on llvm
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> not ai google xd
20:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> the caller graph helped alot xd
20:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> bbs are basic blocks, which are well blocks with 1 entrance and 1 exit point
20:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> but there might be 10s of those
20:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> and passing it into a relativly small ai wont do much
20:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> but ai is magic so idk
20:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> users is the callers
20:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> callsite height is the depth of the call in the state
20:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> callsite height is the depth of the call in the current state of the caller
20:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> so its recursive
20:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> or rathger like a dfs or something
20:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> why?
20:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> isnt that wat a timeout code, name, clan, flag and skin are for?
20:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> and version
21:11 < bridge> <learath2> Not always, if you inline early, subsequent optimizations that can now see through the call instruction can lead to a decrease in code size
21:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> why is sqlite used just for server browser ping cache
21:13 < bridge> <chairn> it's not ?
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> Because it is well suited to storing data and querying said data
21:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
21:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> grep "sqlite.h" -r .
21:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> ./engine/client/sqlite.cpp:#include <engine/sqlite.h>
21:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> ./engine/client/serverbrowser_ping_cache.cpp:#include <engine/sqlite.h>
21:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> In the client it's only for sqlite
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> In the client it's only for serverbrowser
21:14 < bridge> <chairn> i thought it was only server side for storing ranks
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> On server-side it's a replacement for mysql
21:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> how does ddnet store that stuff since its centralized and all?
21:14 < bridge> <chairn> honestly we coud just use a std::map, no ?
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> Then the serialization and deserialization is not a solved issue
21:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> i would think if its centralized it would go to a sql server instead of being one
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> Ranks? We use mysql. Sqlite is there as fallback
21:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> well ranks and all map completions for everyone
21:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> who is we?
21:17 < bridge> <learath2> Yes those all go to a central mysql server that is replicated
21:17 < bridge> <learath2> DDNet
21:18 < bridge> <learath2> And we can do stuff like save a couple samples of the ping, get the average, etc. Without having to think at all
21:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> is the server to go to specified in server config?
21:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> `mysql_options(&m_Mysql, MYSQL_OPT_BIND, m_Config.m_aBindaddr);`
21:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> then ddnet server use os rules to make it goto remote?
21:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> and how does auth work
21:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh no theres a password
21:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 what u say will win trump or kam
21:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> github rest api. i'll add you to the repo and it should be possible to just call an rest api with your github token. i'll pull up the doc tomorrow. it's 4am rn i just woke up from a nightmare lmao
21:33 < bridge> <learath2> Mh very hard to say. It's extremely close in polls. I'd say Kamala but not confident enough that I'd bet on it
21:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fun fact, we were missing every map that have a crc value with leading 0s in chn from the very beginning. just fixed it today. :justatest:
21:47 < bridge> <chairn> lol, how did that happen though ?

23:31 < bridge> <learath2> If you are certain you got it right you'll need to force push
23:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> dun dun dun
23:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> o it worked
23:31 < bridge> <learath2> Rebases rewrite history so you'll need a force
23:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> ty
23:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> o i guess i should name it something
23:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> normal
23:34 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, commit names need to be descriptive
23:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> it showas as
23:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> 
23:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> `merge sollybunny/... into ddnet/master`
23:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> `> the commits in that feature branch`
23:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> or just the commits in the feature branch
23:36 < bridge> <learath2> I don't get it. Is that a merge commit or sth?
23:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> that was phrased as a statement but its a question
23:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> does it show as blah blah
23:38 < bridge> <learath2> When we merge it it will show your commit plus a merge commit that would be named like what you showed above
23:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> oke
23:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> that kinda sucks
23:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> lots of commits with no changes
