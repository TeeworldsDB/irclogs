08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Guys. Currently it is extremely non-userfriendly to use http in teeworlds. As c# and Js developer I expected that I can send request and then process result in callback. Or even to use promises or "async await". 😩
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ doesn't have many of the hand holding mechanisms present in newer languages
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but what we have now is pretty great compared to what we had before 😛
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > but what we have now is pretty great compared to what we had before 😛
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Learath2 I agreed that many things became easier but it is still hard
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not that we don't want to make it easier, it's that C++ lacks the facilities to make it easier
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You create a job, you poll on the job, I think we used to have callbacks too but @heinrich5991 removed those
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> How about this protocol?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/682156663926816778/unknown.png
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> looks pretty safe. All sensitive data may be encrypted in Auth Server
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can take a look later, not really in the attacker mindset right now 😛
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I can make Auth Server in according to this protocol. And then I hope you, guys will help to implement this interactions in Teeworlds code?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if the auth server is the single thing that allows ppl to login then it better have really good ddos protection
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not really a fan of this username and password approach and I suffer from chronic lack of motivation, it would be pretty unlikely for me to help implement this
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and what @onby said, I don't quite enjoy centralised systems either
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Does it mean that you will never make authentication across the servers?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what would be the advantage of this
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Username will identify real user
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> currently username means nothing
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if people pick good password and never share account then ye
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like the idea of authentications, I don't agree with the approach
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bot players can just keep making more accounts, idk what type of behavior this is supposed to prevent
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd prefer something more decentralised
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > bot players can just keep making more accounts, idk what type of behavior this is supposed to prevent
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @onby some servers can give preferences to some player based on something. Also it will be possible to save any progress. For example we can make ranking of player based on their death. For now we can't because anybody can use any username and broke these stats.
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > I'd prefer something more decentralised
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Learath2 You mean many Auth servers?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tracking stats by player name isnt a bad approach tho?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> faking isnt very common imo and theres always mods around to ban fakers
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean no requirement for an auth server for people to verify each other
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like no single ip that, if taken down, would make everyone on all ddnet srvs unable to login
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > tracking stats by player name isnt a bad approach tho?
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @onby It is bad when we can't identify user by its username. So we need auth server.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if someone wants to cheat their account stats they can just share their pw
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> if they want
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but if someone want to make my stats worse they will not be able to connect with my username
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but on ddnet u cant make someones stats worse?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> only better
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But ddrace is not the only possible mod
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> many other mods can be made with auth
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> right but to have stats on other servers someone would have to code in the support for each mod
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have a fng stats server and it goes by name too lol
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> yes other servers will need their own stats
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but the user will have only one account for many server
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> it is great
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think a lot of people see the non centralized nature of tw as a good thing
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so even if u have problems with the rules/staff on one server u are still free to play elsewhere
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> helps to prevent abuse among other things
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> so some servers will use auth server but other will not. But the servers where user need account will easily use api to valid username
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well ye but
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i still dont get how someone can ruin another players stats on ddnet
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can only give them more points
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So DDRace have only "max" stats
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think so?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it only saves ur best time on a map afaik
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> If we had auth then it will be possible to "buy" something fun with points
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on pvp mods then accounts make sense so ppl dont ruin others' k/d and stuff
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or that
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I don't say about ddrace
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I say about teeworlds mods
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and authentication across the servers
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> across the mods
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> any mods in particular?
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> There was many mods where users had accounts but it was only for specific server. So why not to provide ability to use single account for many servers and mods?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [3:45 AM] onby: i think a lot of people see the non centralized nature of tw as a good thing
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [3:46 AM] onby: so even if u have problems with the rules/staff on one server u are still free to play elsewhere
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [3:46 AM] onby: helps to prevent abuse among other things
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> The users who don't want to play with their account can use other servers. But the users who want to have account can have single account for many servers.
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> optional accounts would be cool
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont rly agree with forcing it
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> of course optional
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> any custom server can request validation of username or not
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> depends on server
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Can someone help to implement this in teeworlds side?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> We need ability to write username, password in teeworlds client, and interaction with auth server by https
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> We need ability to write username, password in teeworlds client, and interaction with auth server by https in Client and Server
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doesnt the whole idea of a separate auth srv go out the window when untrusted hosts can just tcpdump and search for chat packets containing /login ?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > doesnt the whole idea of a separate auth srv go out the window when untrusted hosts can just tcpdump and search for chat packets containing /login ?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @onby no, the main idea is to make authentication across the servers
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and password is not sent to teeworlds server
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> only token
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh ic
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so how do u login
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/682166555705868288/unknown.png
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Connect to server then receive token from server
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Then login in Auth server by https
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean like
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats the procedure
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that a user would do
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if they wanted to play on a serv with their account
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> user write his username and password and client. After user connects teeworlds server and receive request for authentication, teeworlds client sends login and password to auth server
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> If you want you may not to store your password
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and write every time the server requires auth
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so the client auths with the auth srv when u open it
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and then recieves some token that it uses to auth on servers?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess that would solve the problem i described ye
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Yep, Here is no problem
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Do you interested in this? Help to implement?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well id have to rewrite my stats system if i wanted to implement this
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and afaik there arent many people who would care about this on my server
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its an interesting idea in general but im not sure if its personally useful to me atm yet
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> For example dota 2 has custom maps. Many of these maps has own rating which increases after wins and decreases after lose. Some of them have premium features which are bounded to steam account. All these things make community stronger and some good features in modding become real.
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> 
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So I am sad to know that you guys are not interested in this progressive improvements.
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im not the one who makes this decision lol
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> yes you are
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> you are developer
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i just own one server for one gamemode
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But you can have two servers with two gamemods?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Or you don't like to play other mods?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So why not to make together cool things to develop community
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> one of these things is accounting
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> when I played in teeworlds I want to know who I play with
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> And I want to mute some players also
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doesnt matter what i play, one person cant effectively own many servers across many modes and maintain them all well imo
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So let's do it together
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what is the incentive to do that tho
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i host the mode that i care about most
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> since i play there and can maintain it
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont say that ill never add any type of auth system i just think its not a huge priority right now
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> account systems is the main stop for me to create mods
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> because I want mods where users have progress
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So I expected that someone else understood the importance of accounts
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So I expected that someone else understand the importance of accounts
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> It is not so hard to make auth system but nobody wants it. But if every dev spent 1 hour on it, it would be implemented
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Earlier I left teeworlds community because nobody wanted to implement major good things for whole community (to make game more funny and invite new players)
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I thought that ddnet community is interested in good things. But probably it is not true
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> And I even say that I am ready to make whole Auth Server and give the source code to community. But I need community to help me with teeworlds C++ side.
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But nobody interested in it
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s too late for accounts in ddnet
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > it’s too late for accounts in ddnet
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @jao it is too late for accounts in teeworlds?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> accounts are against teeworlds core concept of just being able to start playing with any name
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and decentralization
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i doubt they will ever add accounts
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> some online games have possibility to play with guest account or registered account
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Do you think that it is not good idea to have accounts across the servers?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> those games were probably created with that option at the beginning
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the problem in tw is that people have been collecting stats without accounts for years
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and dont want to lose this
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes i think it’s a bad idea to add accounts now
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the only way it could work is if there is a good solution to the problem i just described
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> As I say before accounts will be optional
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> noone wants to lose all of their progress
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> depending on servers
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> some servers already have accounts
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and theyre optional
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> look at blockworlds
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye it wont change anything for servers that can make use of accounts
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So you mean every server should have their own account system and it is the best way?
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because they already have their own account system
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but the reason it works on blockworlds is because (afaik) the server was started with that system at the beginning
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and they probably wouldn’t switch it
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so people who care about stats and stuff have been using acct since the beginning
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So you mean if I want my own server I should make my own account system?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and only for my servers?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i wouldnt trust the account system of another server
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if they randomly decide to shut it down
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or to fuck with your accounts
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i would only trust it if it comes with tw itself
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but that will never happen
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but why ddnet can give it?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s too late to add accounts in ddnet
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> ddnet can start parallel servers with authentication
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and these accounts will provide preferences
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> it could be the store with points
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> or something
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> will be little used because no one will want to lose their ranks/points
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so way too much effort
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> also splitting the community isnt a great idea
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> ok, I understand your position
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Somehow I feel the opposite to what I have to read every damn time there is topic about accounts. Almost any damn game has accounts. Never wondered for what reason you have to create account and login to play or what? Yes, people would lose their points, but on the other side it would finally be THEIR points and not his & 30 other guys all around the world who for few days thought of what nick to play with, and changed it several times. And t
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> For fucks sake, how it is that the question about finally creating accounts reappear every several months, and when there is finally a dude motivated to even do it all by himself barely anyone wants it? Is complainig all that's left in this community?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Get over it finally, call all what's happening right now a beta, and let's start properly even if I'd have to be for v0.7+ only...
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And the so great "there are mods around to ban fakers"... it's a roulette, you can never be sure whether it's the faker or the real person unless you ask him i.e. here, where EVERYONE HAS ACCOUNT to be verified, but even then, what if person who registered here did it while faking the person you thought it was?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do u not make it then
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> instead of raging about people with different opinions
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I would fucking long time ago, but in opposite to  @3da who's willing to do it, I don't have the skills, and don't even try to start with the "so go learn coding"
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> go learn coding
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he doesnt seem to have the skills either
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you have to accept that other people have a different opinion than you
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we have to accept your opinion too
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s pointless to rage about that
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think the problem is a lack of people who can code, its that noones found a solution to the fact that people have been accumulating stats without accounts for years and no one wants to lose their progress
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so if an account system is added, it has to save this progress somehow in a way that doesnt allow people to steal others' accounts
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> also there are other games without accounts
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so that argument is moot
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> which cool games with progress are without accounts?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> are you mean that teeworlds should never have progress?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> every big mmo game has accounts
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mmo sucks
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> because people need to know who they play with
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> lol
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tw is no mmo
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wait no
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> anyways that works without accounts already
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I agree, teeworlds is not mmo
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> has worked for the last 10 years
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> look at counter strike or dota 2
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> for example
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but teeworlds dies slowly
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but CS and dota 2 not yet
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not because lack of accounts
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> this is one reason
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in cs and dota u need accounts to invite people to games
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that concept doesn’t exist in tw
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Accounts -> Clans -> Account stats-> Clan stats -> Global raiting -> etc
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol i never cared about stats in cs
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> dunno if that’s important to many
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> The fact that teeworlds doesn't provide any account is a big mistake
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> stats as in global stats
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> It is the problem
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do u know
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> besides ur own opinion
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> you like that only 10 players are in teeworlds
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are things killing teeworlds way faster than lack of accounts
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but teeworlds needs some improvements to make it mor popular
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> look at 0.7 splitting the community in half
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fix that before adding more features that are split too
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> You guys prefer to have clear code, no accounts, decentralization, etc.
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But game popularity is the most important thing
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i dont think u can claim that lack of accounts is the reason tw isnt more popular
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tw isnt made to be popular
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> And to be contributor in game with 10 players is much worse than if game has 1 000 000 players
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tw is a nieche game
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe because its an old game, its hard to learn/not newb friendly, it gets ddosed, its split in half now due to 0.7, and other reasons like this
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> accounts are low priority
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> yeah
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tw is a niche game
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is it worse to contrib if it has less users
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> because community of teeworlds developers have no ambitions to make game popular
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you should contrib for fun
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> will it not funnier if you had 1 000 000 players?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> of course yes
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> lol
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and what is ur plan for magically generating more players
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> more preassure if at all lol
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> adding accounts?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> so go make games for yourself
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> 😄
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u already get flamed for doing changes with the few users we have
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> imagine with 100 times as much
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> My plan is to see on popular games and make proper changes
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tw will never be popular
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u like
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u play teeworlds
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I like teeworlds
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But I don't like that here is no users
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> only devs
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what do u play
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> who make game for themselves
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> 😄
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wat
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u want the accounts for urself too
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s normal that people make what they like
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [6:10 AM] 3da: But I don't like that here is no users
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i own one small server and theres this many players on it
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/682197968954458172/Screen_Shot_2020-02-26_at_6.10.54_AM.png
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk what ure talking about
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> more popular mods have way more players than this
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I want accounts to make cool mods playable with many cool new users
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mods are playable without accounts...
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> omg
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> as I said before some mods need to save progress
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and some mods have found ways to save progress without using accounts
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you want accounts for other mods, why do u complain about ddnet not adding it tho
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Because I wanted to join your community to make cool mods with you
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> noones stopping u from making mods
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> You are big community which can change major things in teewolrds
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Can you make poll to check if players needed accounts?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but why would we work on accounts that aren’t feasible for ddnet instead of something that works
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if ur talking to me, i have 0 power on what happens on ddnet lol
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> players want accounts, but they want them while keeping their ranks
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> which isn’t doable
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u need to find a way for players to 'claim' their accounts
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and if u havent been saving ips then idk how this could be possible
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> even then it wouldnt be possible
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it would be hard but possible
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> at least for some players
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about shared names
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cant be claimed
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye for some only
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but u could set a limit
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what to do with these ranks then
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like, if one player under a certain ip/range has gotten more than say 90% of the points on one name then they can claim it
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if there are a lot points and a lot players
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but since ddnet doesnt save ips nearly long enough, even this is impossible i guess
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well shared names cant be claimed
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is what i do on my srv, if someonne and their ips match most of the stats on a name then they can have it
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if its a shared name then noone gets it
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well ok
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i save ips a bit longer than ddnet
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk how u could do it here lol
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about dynamic ips
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have iprange lookup command
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about changing ips
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then i guess cant detect xd
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for most players where this has been a concern
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its been obvious who the true owner of the name was
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> k
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i cant claim that it would go as smoothly on such a large server network like ddnet
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but for a smaller srv its fine
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we dont have ips anyways
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> right lol
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i dont have permanent ips either
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> maybe you can edit your own client for server and use mac id as base of accounts
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can spoof mac addres easily
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how does that solve the claiming names problem
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i think mac is better than ip
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> worse
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> our create login and register on client
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if you changed computers
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> yeah you right
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> u baited me in
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> but i want accs too ngl
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> yeah
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> accs is great
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> <https://www.howtogeek.com/192173/how-and-why-to-change-your-mac-address-on-windows-linux-and-mac/>
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what problem will accs solve xd
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> aint nobody got time for that
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> accounts would be nice but it’s impossible to add them while keeping existing records
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/682202155226234917/Screenshot_from_2020-02-26_15-57-27.png
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> lol why
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> just save old records
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/682202199115169796/Screenshot_from_2020-02-26_15-57-47.png
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wouldnt say impossible  just hard
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and save new records to real accounts
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because ddnet doesnt save ips
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do u know who the true owner is
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how would it be possible
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> are u sure @onby
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> mark old records as "unverified"
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and that's all
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well maybe every admin is lying, im not sure 100%
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea that’s basically losing ur ranks
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> because old records is really unverified
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> oh we talking about ddnet accs?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but even if thats the case
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> lmao
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then they wont use those ips
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye that is what they were talking about
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i cant think of a way to verify who owns which account on servers with years of history and 2 days of ips
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> i thought we are talking about teeworlds wide accs
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they were at first i guess? but starting on ddnet
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> the easiest way is that ddnet reset all records and start a fresh run with account system 😄
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> we are talking about account system across the servers based on ddnet community
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but how many people do u think really want a full reset ..
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> teeworlds wide accs wouldnt hurt records
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> reseting records is the only way
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but then you will lose majority of users
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> like you can still change ign
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and not improve anything
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> The full reset is not requires
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> just save old records as UNVERIFIED
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> under what name
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> omg
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> just make column in db
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and make value false
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> that's the problem some peoples are not agree with reset their points and records
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> obviously
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not just some
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> yeah you right all of them 😄
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hey i wanna suggest this change
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the only problem is that literally everyone wont like it
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> duhh
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> genius
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> 😄
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> points and records are not belong to real people
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> it only belongs to username
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but the thing is
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 99% players can be identified through a username
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most usernames probably belong to only one person, at least 90%+ of their points
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> faking is a thing but its nowhere near common enough to warrant reseting everything
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> This is sad that you didn't make accounts in the beginning of ddnet
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :zzzz:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well if you want to make new mods, you can start them with accounts
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But instead of solving somehow you offer to do nothing
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you offer no solution
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think there is any tho
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they offer the solution of complaining at jao
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doesnt fix anything but maybe feels satisfying idk
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont get his problem anyways if he wants the accounts for new mods
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why does ddnet need accounts then
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I wanted to develop whole teeworlds through ddnet community
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but probably it is not possible
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> No it's possible for your private mods and servers
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats so vague
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what are u actually trying to accomplish
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> decentralization isnt bad
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ddnet shouldnt control everything imo
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i doubt accounts are ur end goal
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> only a possible solution to whatever problem u see on tw currrently
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and yes
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> decentralization is one of the things that makes tw good
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is vexar an alt account of 3da
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if ddnet would own the account system, you would be less flexible and it would require us to maintain it
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> 😄
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> of course not
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> while we wouldnt even be able to use it for ourselves lol
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why of course
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> why 'is vexar an alt account of 3da' ?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bcause ive never seen either one of u before on dc or ingame until u both started asking in this channel for accounts lol
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> lol
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> my in game name is ✟Տ℣ʒN✟
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> that's because accounts is interesting topic
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> and i never play in ddnet official server
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> because of ping problem
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> I just reading developer chats for fun
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do u want ddnet accounts then xd
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i don't want
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i already do that for my servers
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who even are u
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who is 3da
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i don't know 3da
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want to register to play a game
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i find it rly stupid u put a first and last name field

13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is under the mit license, you can fork and make ur ddnet
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur probably not even willing to code anything
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate ppl like you
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> make people send their drivers licence to jao for verification before playing ddnet
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> thank you
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u complain that others dont do anything
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if u are a kid
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats not an excuse
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was coding dumb shit wehn i was a kid
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its ilegal to have info about kids younger than 13
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> 😄
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohhh
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i mean u have no driver’s license
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then no ddnet for u
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> @jao me ?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i started when i was 14
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone who says he cannot code is cuz he lazy
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or low iq
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> schools should tech programming by default
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u dont have to be smart to code
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like maths

14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [6:52 AM] Vexar: why you want to report me ?

14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its you
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i'm not bot
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 🤣
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> is it a question about i'm not bot check it to continue ?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes this is a captcha
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> then am i passed ?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u failed
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> oh God kill me please
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i hate captcha
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> more proof of being a bot
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bumm> noby is the biggest troll
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bumm is the biggest bum
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> what proof
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [7:14 AM] Vexar: i hate captcha
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> proof
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> oh sh*t
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> actually, some bots are able to compete the captcha ^^
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> really ?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not his apparently
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> actually, some bots are able to complete the captcha ^^
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> you got me
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> 😄
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> i.e. the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) enabled bots
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> isnt the whole point of captcha to be unreadable for ocr but readable by humans
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats why its always warped and squiggly and has wierd noise added
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that's most likely since Google released reCaptcha 3, but still many sites use older versions, and I'm sure the ones with noise etc will also be broken someday

14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> 😄
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> oh God are you serously ?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Soreu recaptcha has more than just the images you click
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> Scam
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Is https://ddnet.tw/maps/ using just https://github.com/ddnet/tw-webgl or edited version of it?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao I think it's bad that you discourage people from trying new things
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have a pretty dismissive, seemingly know-it-all attitude here
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think attitudes like that hold ddnet back
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that I'm not arguing about accounts
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm arguing about the attitude
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> feel free to prove me wrong if i said something false
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not what I was talking about
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wasn't talking about the content. I talked about the attitude
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you basically said to 3da "go away, we don't like you here"
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with every developer you send away like this, ddnet dies a little
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i didnt say that
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i said that i don’t think accounts can be added to ddnet and why
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you didn't say that in a factual tone
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or tried constructively thinking about it
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🙂 jao you had to smile!
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> symbolic conversation (jao to soreu):
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [12:55 PM]  jao: why do u not make it then
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [12:55 PM]  jao: instead of raging about people with different opinions
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> after literally discouraging 3da to do the same
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just bollocks
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and where is the context?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> soreu wanting accounts
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i said that after he raged about my opinion
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "raging" is the non-neutral tone here
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s what he did
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fuck you
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think this is part of ddnet's problem
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (represented by you in this case)
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg heinrich said the f word!
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bumm> woah
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the politically correct all-the-time guy said it
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he had an aggressive opinion too
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :feelssurprisedman:
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you want me to constructively think about it but they are the ones who ignore all negative they about it
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🥳
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you want me to constructively think about it but they are the ones who ignore all negative things about it
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all those guys that say do account probably will never even do it even if someone encouraged them
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> That's why I mentioned eventually doing it only on 0.7+ though, but whatever. I indeed raged which was unnecessary
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its pointless to do it so late
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Soreu ranks are not lost on 0.7
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its the same base
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but 0.7 is already splitting players anyway, as it's not compatible with 0.6 etc
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see how that is relevant
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Sure the ranks / database is shared right now, but players know that this is new major version, and those happen to break some stuff, so it could as well not be shared. Those who want to stay on 0.6 will do it anyway, same as those who want to go forward with 0.7
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i dont think jao would send away a developer who wanted to do a feature that was actually feasible, accounts has been discussed a lot of times and we always end up with it not being possible
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur generalizing imo
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and if u have the will to do it u wouldnt care less about a guy saying this
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like when i made telegun, it had lot of haters
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> prob still has
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u heinrich were skeptical too
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> y, but that's also mainly to the fact that this community loves to complain - we can't actually deny that
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > u already get flamed for doing changes with the few users we have
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > imagine with 100 times as much
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> as jao said...
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Also, we could say "it's too late to do that" with a lot of things, but yet DDNet brought a lot of new features over the years. Some changes may indeed break stuff, as it happened to many new introduced things - from fixing rocket that was actually exploding twice, to the lately changed hammer-in-the-freeze thing, to yet-to-come fixing exploding bullet tiles affecting only one player at a time - yet those changes were made for a reason, even 
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> In my opinion there's never too late for some things, and accounts are one of these, but it's true that finding a right solution to handling already recorded rankings won't be a piece of cake...
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Especially since having to "register & login to play" can be optional - yet, we're figting about why to even create accounts system instead of figuring out good way to handle eventual problems that might come with it...
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And DDNet doesn't even have to use those, but since it's one of bigger modifications in TW, we as community, or you guys as developers kind of take responsibility of what path that game or just the DDRace will go forward
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and if I'm alone in that opinion, then that's fine, since I can do nothing about it without any real coding knowledge...
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> \*that's end of my thoughts*
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I just wanted to make authentication system which will be acceptable by most users and devs. Instead of this you say make your fork with your own community.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > and if I'm alone in that opinion, then that's fine, since I can do nothing about it without any real coding knowledge...
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Soreu People who love to play teeworlds are doing not less than devs. Users and devs are two important parts which must exist together
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happened here even?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu yes, should be it
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen I guess that's answer to the `tw-webgl`?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> k, thx
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't read the whole convo, but I'd be ok with accounts as long as they're implemented carefully.
