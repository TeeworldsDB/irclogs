00:12 <+Learath2> phpstorm might be the most overreaching ide that i've ever used, and it's done amazingly well
00:13 <+Learath2> apparently you can do bloated right
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro how do you hide the finish message in unique race?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race/blob/master/src/game/server/teams.cpp#L474-L493
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i append the format recognized by the client after 256 bytes which is not rendered anymore
17:42 <@deen> haha
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it needs to be after "finished in:" but the additional spaces dont seems to matter
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i then write the 3 digits time in a second message
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> lol
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hey, i created a grenade (toggle via chat cmd) whcih allows you to shoot straight. however the grenade explodes where it supposed to but the animation is still in a curve, also for other players. is it fixable or not?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess bcs its like a tunezone youre not in (for other players) its not fixable, am i right?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @fokkonaut you can send a tuning which affects the grenade curvature to each player, one player at a time sees all grenades either falling or flying straight, you have to work with that
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hmm
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so you cant say player x's curvature animation is straight and player b's is falling?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> that works, but you cant distinguish between two grenade projectiles
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so it will affect every player's grenade when one guy wants a straight animation? lol im dumb sorry xd
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah, then all other grenades look glitched
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mehj
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> D:
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you can send the players their current "state" so their own grenades dont look glitched for them but thats not perfect ofc
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cant i say that if this chat cmd has turned on, the grenade from only the guy who turned it on has no animation? then i could work with another animarion i guess, like you did with atom, just straight. would that work? some workaround to get it perfect?
