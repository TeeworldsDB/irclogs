06:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> would be nice to change it and test, as I said I haven't seen any weird behaviour, but maybe I'm just not using something, that could be bugged because of it
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen if u can check discord dm
10:41 <+ChillerDragon> hrhrhrhr zCatch community ddosing https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1648201293.png
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You dont need that for the masks tho
11:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have a very simple Mask128 header
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen do you think 128 player is worth it, maybe not on all servers/maps but like back in time, simple down etc
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am unsure about the network traffic/clientside hardware issues with 128 players. On my server only 64 are sent, so its equally for the client
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In an official ddnet client for 128 players that would change
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :franzj_kek:
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <a:yeee:631547536288514051>
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> plz no ddos Chillerdragon
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi rei
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yo
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> send 200 bucks
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no u
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> waiting that heinrich comes back, ig vacation was good for him, he worked too much
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Rentner Lifestyle
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you need from heinrich @ReiTW
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nothing special, just want to discuss about that proxy thingy he talked about & also the https master ban
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good things
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> for now I feel better with the new thing I've set up, but still that guy hosting vali's private BW server & lying, saying he doesn't know him, idk
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is 90% vali. He just talks the same way
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vali is too stupid xd
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No he is a genius
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> stupid ag
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> af
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Martin is a new name. How would we ever figure it out?
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik wym
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Never
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he is frustrated
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since he cant ddos me anymore :feelsamazingman:
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm surprised he is still interested in this game. A lot of old players disappeared and he is still here
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When real life is sad i guess
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't even engage with the guy so I have this feeling u and rei keep poking him back to life
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You know that this fact is simply false
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> even when not talking to this guy for over a year he comes at least for the tournaments
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, i think its useless just "ignoring" him or avoiding to even talk about him or whatever
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this guy has major brain damage and does this even when he doesnt get attention, so this is completel, irrelevant imo
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this guy has major brain damage and does this even when he doesnt get attention, so this is completely irrelevant imo
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Martin is an old iF|City player
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's the problem
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I doubt this is vali, but he didn't get vali's binary like this
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he would talk to you if he hosted those servers
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk bro sometimes nothing happens & suddently we receive attacks
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> we don't even need to trigger vali lol
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc it's vali. He names his servers like vali, he has valis source, he talks like vali
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well I wouldn't say it's him directly but feel free to think it
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is him
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably just took the old if city players name to fool people
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but discord account is 2 years old & Insanity (from my team) knows this player
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ReiTW the way he talks identifies him so often
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe vali has multiple personality disorder?
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he also came with a 8 month discord acc on my Server
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That would explain a lot you know
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no clue, but I'm fine since I've implemented a website for whitelisting, sad that I have to get that far just for a game
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ReiTW also: i wouldnt focus on the discord acc age that much
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know at least 3 accs of him anyways
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but my server + XDP, when vali attacks a protected port, my server is just laughing at him
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wouldnt be surprised if he had more
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well dunno
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye same
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bruh and that guy on teeworlds discord saying i'm against competition
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> how many people were hosting pepe or v3 & had some players, didn't care at all
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> even more I was playing on those servers & not bombay
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after battling with docker for 3 hours i think the wiki works perfect again
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> JustArtur? That guys speech pattern and behaviour is exactly vali's imo
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_Sweat:525603859830407168>
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <a:yeee:631547536288514051>
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :Celebrate:
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> JustArthur is Martin
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> JustArtur is Martin
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'm talking about MeowTime
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 when ddnet serverless docker distributed across amazon
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :hisnail:
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, yep he was weird too. It's just another vali orbiter
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be webscale
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes it needs to webscale
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should use mongodb
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I dont like docker for some points
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it web scales
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> each time I restart my stack I have to clear conntrack udp table
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> overwise I have shitty entries
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> overwise I have shitty entries & people can't connect anymore etc..
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> pretty annoying, solution would be to use host network, but dman
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> pretty annoying, solution would be to use host network, but damn
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm idk
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i used docker cuz now i can easily update mediawiki
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have the config files on volumes etc
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> simple stuff
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> JustArtur has his steam acc linked to discord btw
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this youtuber needs to make a video about rust
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly i think he is gone
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah well for me it's not him, but as I said if he has BW binary or source, then vali is definetly behind all of that once again
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/956870877302128670/unknown.png
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good stuff
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm a little on the fence about docker. It's a good idea but it has that weird corporate air to it
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proprietary but not of sorts
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ik that vali loves now to host through someone else as he knows if his name or his clan (exec) gets a server heinrich will masterban him
12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/containers/youki
12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based container runtime
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling you'd be very annoyed if he made one :D
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i saw a stupid youtuber claim golang was faster
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he later edited it
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it was false
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the guy was rly assertive it was the case
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> laughed my ass off
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cEunr8hPE0>
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at the description
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > People are now writing formal academic papers debunking Rust's lies about safety and the rest. The more I learn about how shitty and dishonest Rust is (and its community)  the more motivated I am to look at C and C++ (again) and the more I'm not just ambivalent about Rust, I'm actively advocating against it. Rust is fucking bad for the world. There are still *zero* significant projects in Rust while there are now hundreds in Go including
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  [Update: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/ confirms Rust, C and C++ have the fastest web servers period. I was wrong about that (having remembered another study that only compared, PHP, Java, Erlang, Node, and Go). Go is next, but Go is the clear leader from the dozens of enterprise case studies porting from non-compiled web frameworks. In fact, I have yet to read a single case study of *anyone* using Rust for any web services in 
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is a little overpassionate :D
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> die die die
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust community is um spicy, I'm never surprised when they end up creating people like this
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i rarely see rust ppl being rude, i only see hn ppl annoyed that rust gets mentioned a lot
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but what can we do, when ppl create way better tools in rust and they get on top of hn
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are not rude, they are very passionate
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 http://www.cookingforengineers.com/
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> UNSAFE WEBSITE
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've seen this before, it's quite nice
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://based.cooking/
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this website looks amazing
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most recipe websites have lot of filler
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Based cooking? Do they do racist cooking or sth?
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/956874231856107540/unknown.png
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based doesnt mean racist
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a based opinion
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Funny condition that is never true, because 5 lines before the condition is negated: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2beb2b0c709678d15402e3fa91db7f44542184ce/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L626
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> True, but we dont want this sound in ddnet anyways, i have the feeling
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least it wasnt there for years already
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think its not a big issue, we could also add the sound back in again. i dont think there was a reason to "remove" it
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably accident
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> was probably originally at the beginning of the function 😄 (because the function is triggered again and again when you stand on the pickup) Wanted to share it also just to have something to laugh 🙂 I'll test it, how it sounds like when it is at the beginning of the function.
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xdd
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> lol I think I have never heard that sound xD
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/956877928908607508/sfx_pickup_ninja.wv
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its vanilla
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just tested a vanilla server, there is indeed the sound. no idea if we want it, it sounds not bad.
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait, the ninja pickup sound *doesnt* play in ddrace maps?
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it was already like this since 2011, so no idea
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> since this commit https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/832bad08e66124abeaab05da8c2b102ca7e2836c
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Just like I thought 😄 It was at the beginning of the function
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/956881249329360906/unknown.png
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> i just downloaded and built the latest master branch and it does not happen anymore 🙂
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> i just downloaded and built the latest master branch and it does not happen anymore 🙂
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Btw, i am learning some webdev, is there anything that i could do for ddnet that would benefit ddnet net in any way? I mean... is there something in that direction what could be made 🤔
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Btw, i am learning some webdev, is there anything that i could do for ddnet that would benefit ddnet net in any way? I mean... is there something in that direction what could be made 🤔?
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> skin database that allows multiple modes:
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> community
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> community hd
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> official
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> official hd
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and maybe a json containing all skins per mode
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I mean... I will be learning mongo in few months 🥴
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ryozuki is a big mongo fan
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs of its shards
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki help this guy
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Noo, dont help me
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I am too much beginnee to do anything
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol im not a mongo fan
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Exposed
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i post the vid
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats why i tagged u
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @RadziSzop no but seriously, else i dunno what is really needed
14:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Idk, i like mongo/supa/fireb because they looks simpler and smaller than typical bug ass sql dbs. Tho i dont have experience with any XD
14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Not even sure if that makes any sense
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think the community would appreciate it. But some effort, huge scoreboard etc
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I could do it, but only the serverside i guess
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> So we'd keep 64 players in client for now and see how community likes it?
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But I'm worried about CPU usage
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> some servers have 50% CPU usage with a single 64 player server, so they could start lagging with 128
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> So I might have to restrict some, similar to what I'm doing on CHN servers already
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for example
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> doubt 128p is useful
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> one problem I can imagine is that 128 players allows some skips 64 players does not, and then we can't turn it off again 😄
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should be a map setting maybe, so that maps like those big t0 maps can activate it
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because i dont see any reason for "easy" maps to have it
15:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But whats the use-case for that?
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum, i haven't found any exception (try/catch) in the source code, are they forbidden? I know that threads and exception usually don't mix well together
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> exceptions bad
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno if we decided on that, but generally exceptions aren't nice in most cases
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> perf overhead
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks do you intend to fix https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4891 ?
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> depends
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :justatest: 📸
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if modern OS would also fail, then yes
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but if its only ubuntu 18 then no xd
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> fix vulkan jumpi
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :justatest:
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> is there any statistics on OS versions and hardware that ddnet players use? I guess steam players have this information, but not the other one
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> also on windows, it's perfectly fine
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 98% windows
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> update ur ubuntu bro
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's work computer, i'll update when im done with my manuscript
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> remember that software obsolescence will repel new players with old pc
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds good
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> less support
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> man ... !(
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> man ... :(
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> man ... 😦
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hardware obsolescence is smth different
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> if that's the case, you could just add a note on the log: update ubuntu lmao
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but srsly, nobody has to use win7 nowadays
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i haven't tried rc on win7 yet
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok, i'll see but SDL defs requests supported vulkan extensions
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> already looked in their code
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ppl using win 7 would see a perf increase using linux
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they would have modern software
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and good software
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> Is there a way to create a png with our code?
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, see map_extract.cpp
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> danke 🙂
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah, that's rather easy, now i just have to find a way to extract data from render tool into the png
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> didn't think to look into video rendering, but i think i found
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> demo & map renderer 😄 (loads slow, bcs slow vps, so just wait 10 seconds xddd)

21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> is this warning normal?
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> windows 64 bit
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mailbox
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it me or the sound in the RC is lower?
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> usually means u have forced vsync
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i disabled it in both nvidia panel and application setting
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs in ur nvidia settings, or not exclusive fullscreen?
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> still got themessage
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> exclusive full screen
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway it is what it is, you dont have immidiate mode, dunno why
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> alt-tabbing when client start crashes
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> swapchain failed: run out of memory
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh, well nothing i can fix actually, the loading screen blocks all thraeds
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh, well nothing i can fix actually, the loading screen blocks all threads
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it probs misses the SDL events
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that would be required
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would generally be nicer to poll SDL2 events during startup probably
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Chairn btw since ur GPU is old, can u try video rendering and screenshots?
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wanna know if that works correctly
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> key to screenshot works
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957011381507489832/unknown.png
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> this doesnt
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957011527276322866/screenshot_2022-03-25_21-21-06.png
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> in game screenshot
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest in peace xD
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but kinda looks cool
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so print screen works?
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's probs another proof that the windows compositor is active actually xD and not exclusive fullscreen
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, the imp. scr key on keyboard works for me
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> in game menu shows exclusive full screen
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i've heard that in windows, this doesn't mean that in reality
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do you compile by source?
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> actually can also just look into GPUInfo.org
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> uh no? i took the client from my pr with the default switch
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> that i rebased just before
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> any idea why the sound might be lower?
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it was changed
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok your GPU doest have linear dst blitting for RGBA textures
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe i can simulate and see if screenshots are broken bcs of that
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> wow, emotes are really more smooth now
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> did anything change?
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but long time ago
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh weird, for me even then screenshots work
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i got the mailbox/fifo message regularly, it's normal?
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> everytime u alt tab
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or resize
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup, everytime i alt tab
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> has nobody  intel uhd 630 and is on linux xd
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then we could just see what the validation layers say about screenshoting
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but probs intel driver on linux are better anyway, why even bother xd
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i wonder what i have on the work laptop
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> its intel 100%, no GPU, but dunno the version
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> should i test anything else?
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> any idea on the sound level changing?
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it because of the widening of the sound slider?
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Wild idea: can we make proof of work part of the handshake in the protocol? Maybe not always, but once we (somehow) detect a DDoS?
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Of course this only makes sense if the attacks on the servers mainly target the handshake, rather than overloading then networking stack in general
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> which handshake
21:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> when the client connects to a TW server
21:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you mean that TKEN handshake? Didn't secured.gg already try & failed?
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it just simply reduced, bcs new players complained it was too load
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> No idea, I sadly don't follow development much, just an idea that sprung to mind while i was waiting for help after failing because of a DDoS
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well if everything except screenshot works, thats already a win ^^
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i didn't find anything suspicious 🙂
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> strangly enough on a intel hd 550 graphics tablet everything worked without problems
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think secured.gg did try
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok thanks for testing
