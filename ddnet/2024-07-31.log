07:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> gm
07:24 < bridge> <sans._.> good morning :)
07:25 < bridge> <sans._.> I have a question, how are skin requests done?
07:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you mean this? -> #üìçinfo
07:31 < bridge> <sans._.> no
07:31 < bridge> <sans._.> it's related to the recent convo in #questions
07:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh so technically
07:31 < bridge> <sans._.> <a:nod:604500081114087434>
07:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> pretty sure it is just a url prefix with `<skinname>.png` at the end. not sure how technically detailed were you expecting
07:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if you have a server or cdn that serves files like this it'll work
07:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> So just simple http get request?
07:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i would thought so
07:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> haven't looked into it. but it probably just starts with a http get request. decoding and uploading to vram comes later and automatically i would imagine
07:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also requests are cached i guess.
07:35 < bridge> <sans._.> so the client builds the request using the url from `cl_skin_community_download_url` like this then?
07:35 < bridge> <sans._.> 
07:35 < bridge> <sans._.> > {url}/{skin name}.png
07:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
07:35 < bridge> <sans._.> ah neat
07:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> might even be `{url}{skin name}.png`
07:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or both
07:36 < bridge> <sans._.> depends how the client handles the slash
07:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not 100% sure, but it is easy to find out and test i think
07:36 < bridge> <sans._.> if it doesnt, then the ending slash is needed
07:39 < bridge> <sans._.> if this is how it works then i dont see why there couldnt be some indicator for skins that were not found, like [this issue](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8595>) suggests
07:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it should be easy, but i think it is just designed like that. you probably don't want a fullscreen worth of purple blobs on your screen
07:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lots of players uses local skins and never intend to upload them anywhere, at least they should show up at normal tees.
08:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> #8602 was introduced to do that.
08:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also your console will Tell you If it couldnt find skin X, thus showing you its Name
08:19 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8602
08:22 < bridge> <sans._.> oh that's neat
08:30 < bridge> <mirfay123> Cool phone version, but u could alao make throwing a tee possible :/
08:30 < bridge> <mirfay123> Also*
08:31 < bridge> <mirfay123> Why do i everytime type a instead of s
08:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> love you
08:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Hi, I have skill issues in rust, send help. I make `CodeGen` struct by passing generic myself, see https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/59a823d5c2a8f5b0314d7bbf9b4698ce47bdf01d/src/main.rs#L49-L51 but how can I make it work so that I can dynamically pass it xd(i want to make a cli option to choose architecture to generate code for)
09:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> teach me rust
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds like a skill issue lmao
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that version is not by me btw
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you want to contribute do it in #8359
09:15 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8359
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i don't know it myself xddd
10:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> big sad
10:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ask ddpg creator
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here i teach you rust
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```rust
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let chunks = self.demo_chunks.split_off(&key);
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>                 // bit overcomplicated but split_off :/
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>                 let chunks = std::mem::replace(&mut self.demo_chunks, chunks);
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hope that didn't help you
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here i teach you rust
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```rust
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>   let chunks = self.demo_chunks.split_off(&key);
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>   // bit overcomplicated but split_off :/
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>   let chunks = std::mem::replace(&mut self.demo_chunks, chunks);
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
10:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks @heinrich5991 obviously you wanted to help me but just missed the message
10:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> based
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont understand what your problem is, sry xd
10:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oke
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you have a struct and want to dynamically pass it?
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where exactly here is your issue
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is dynamically passing xd
10:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> see Amd64 there?
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so based on your input option you want a different generic?
10:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and now is the question if lets say you do:
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> match arch { "amd64" =>  CodeGen::<Amd64>::new(scope)
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             .compile(stmts, &args.output)
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             .unwrap_or_else(|e| giveup(Box::new(e)));,
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "x86" =>  CodeGen::<X86>::new(scope)
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             .compile(stmts, &args.output)
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             .unwrap_or_else(|e| giveup(Box::new(e)));
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> }
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be too complicated?
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or too much code?
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is CodeGen created more often than this?
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can move your whole loop into a new function that takes a generic argument for example
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you dont have double code here
11:07 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @ryozuki help
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ooooor, i could use `dyn` and do this ```rust
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> let _: Box<dyn Architecture> = match str {
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     "amd64" => Box::new(Amd64::new()),
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     "x86" => Box::new(X86::new()),
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> };
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ``` and pass a parameter :\
11:09 < bridge> <zhn> you dont really need boxing this :justatest:
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can do that, but then you also _need_ a trait
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what exactly you need, but IMHO reducing traits isn't something bad
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> traits are _kinda_ code duplication too üòÑ
11:10 < bridge> <zhn> jupstars solution W
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i can't use with Box but if I add `&` the value will be dropped
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how exactly do you pass that to codegen btw?
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah the way you do it needs box indeed
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in you case you ofc need a trait for your architecture anyway
11:12 < bridge> <zhn> i meant if youd use jupjopjaps solution
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just wonder how you pass that Box<dyn > now
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but anyway Box<dyn ..> always gives up a bit of context for a compiler i guess
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since it doesn't know the original type
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it will not be a generic anymore and i would need to store it in struct as ```rust
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pub struct CodeGen {
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     arch: Box<dyn Architecture>,
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     scope: Scope,
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> idk how to make it the best ;p
11:15 < bridge> <zhn> just use the snippet jupstar gave u xd
11:15 < bridge> <zhn> easy and not overwhelming solution
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah let's say it like that:
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's a matter of taste for sure. Other ppl will say your solution is nicer bcs it doesn't create yet another generic argument.
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd say from the code i saw in your repo, doing it as generic as possible is nicer
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Box<dyn ..> must be object safe, so you cannot extend it later easily
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. if you want to add serialization support or whatever
12:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can't dynamically pass type parameters. you can list all cases
12:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @milkeeycat btw, you can either make your `fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>` or change your current main to a different function with the above signature, so you can handle the errors in one place
12:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok, thanks
12:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (in the first case, rust will handle printing the error and exiting with a nonzero status)
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @milkeeycat LMAO: `"Achtung:"` such a mlikeey moment
12:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> tja
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> german in one word:
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hallo,
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hallo?,
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> HALLOOOO!?
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Haaaaaaaaaaalloooooooooo?
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is all you need to communicate
12:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i know only "jaja, sehr gut" in german
12:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was learning it before but i forgor everything
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> jaja is often considered negativly
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> jaja nerv nischt
12:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
12:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh and I remember from Cendren's stream "du dummkopf" xd
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see, when u learn russian, you only learn the hardcore insults.
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when you learn german you learn kiddie insults xdd
12:56 < bridge> <zaerin__> @jupeyy_keks Hello is there a way to add mapres, gameskin etc to the data/ddnet folder on mobile?
12:56 < bridge> <zaerin__> I can see it using 3rd party programs but none of them lets me modify the content
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can modify `interal_storage/Android/data/org.ddnet.client/files/user` like a normal data directory
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if your file manager doesn't let you to do that, then maybe your OS completly disallows it, dunno
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am no android expert xd, ask google
12:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you helped me to record logs on da phone, u phone expert xd
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally, never modify ddnet's data dir that is shipped by the client directly.
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not even on pc
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is read-only
12:59 < bridge> <zaerin__> i meant the user dir, mb
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it is in this path
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could modify files there
12:59 < bridge> <zaerin__> 1    /storage/emulated/0/‚Ä™Android/data/org.ddnet.client/files/user/maps/Syre.map: open failed: EACCES (Permission denied)
12:59 < bridge> <zaerin__> 
12:59 < bridge> <zaerin__> ZArchiver gives this error on android 14
13:00 < bridge> <zaerin__> When i try to paste a map file
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does the "maps" directory already exist?
13:00 < bridge> <zaerin__> Yes, there is even an auto folder insidd
13:00 < bridge> <zaerin__> Yes, there is even an "auto" folder inside
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does your phone not offer a internal file manager?
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno wtf ZArchiver is, but maybe u didnt give it enough permission
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or try with USB cable on pc
13:02 < bridge> <zaerin__> The internal one doesnt even let me see the com.ddnet.org folder or any other stuff inside data
13:03 < bridge> <zaerin__> that works but im 800km away from home ü•≤
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do it in a public library xd
13:08 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to explicitly give file manager apps permission to access each other apps' storage
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can someone explain me why discord is full about complaints that people get banned for vpn? What about the people that did not find the discord and just started another game instead?
14:02 < bridge> <teero777> what?
14:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks i asked for advice and did the exact opposite https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/commit/a538a63db31730ddf5d3605696dc44d47ec7a9bc :lol:
14:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean... it's not like we have a explicit motivation to improve player retention.
14:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> not that different than joining the game, get thrown somewhere random, can't move, quit and delete
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's totally fine, if you like that version more then it maybe fits your coding style better
14:15 < bridge> <0xdeen> yeah, it‚Äòs pretty sad. reliable vpn detection seems expensive
14:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if I had three version of CodeGen with different arch, rust would generate code for each version, ye?
14:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if I had three version of CodeGen with different archs, rust would generate code for each version, ye?
14:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if I had three versions of CodeGen with different archs, rust would generate code for each version, ye?
14:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> It can, doesnt mean it will afaik
14:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> It can, doesnt mean it will afair
14:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
14:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> match arch { "amd64" =>  CodeGen::<Amd64>::new(scope)

14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it doesn'

14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> in this case it will generate for X86 and Amd64

14:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
14:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> in this case it will generate for X86 and Amd64?
14:19 < bridge> <avolicious> VPN detection without intel is a wild guess and ip range updates are announced every second, so ip intel is super hard tho
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it will probably not write your whole compiler again
14:19 < bridge> <avolicious> There are several techniques to "guess" if its likely that this IP is a vpn/proxy whatsoever, but its always a guess
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but this match will likely go in
14:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> Yes because match
14:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> :owo:  i Type so slow on Phone gg
14:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> üò†
14:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But it suddenly good really bad? Something must have happened. And are the amount of false positives really worth it? How many servers have it on?
14:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But it suddenly got really bad? Something must have happened. And are the amount of false positives really worth it? How many servers have it on?
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> I love how the users in #8283 are always magically crippled in just the right ways that would make any proposal except the original PR usable
14:36 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8283
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> We enabled it on all servers again, that's the increase.
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> 
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> No we don't really think it's worth it, we do have a couple ideas to make it less impactful/disable it again.
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> 
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> Most if not all servers should have it on.
14:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> time to merge the original pr!
14:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> users can use html for sure, your point stands in a one dimensional conparison
14:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> added a second dimension, text length, broadcast length
14:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> where html is worse
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> hex colors allow more colors than 10^3, there you go another dimension
15:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm for extending it to hex
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> an xml subset allows composing multiple future effects like bold and italic and even text size
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> there you go another dimension
15:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> complexity and mainainability of a nieche feature
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> nieche was rly a thinker
15:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> where the initial proposal was just color
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> Nietzsche kek
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> ditto, I don't think this feature will be used, thus can be discarded for maintainability reasons all the same
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> this is getting seemingly nowhere.
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> you said yourself that you don't want a xml dependency
15:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> now you did a 180 gedree
15:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> degree
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> I don't want a full xml parser in there, I don't mind a small recursive descent parser
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> And unlike you I seem to be able to be convinced by good arguments
15:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> which one did you deem good?
15:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> time to write one more parser :justatest:
15:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> serious question
15:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> catto woke when someone said parser haha
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Milkeey be writing C++ parsers on weekends
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> composability and not having to use the long span tag from html
15:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i get pings on words: assembly, lexer, parser like Tsin on ddmax
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Based
15:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's for sure a good point, I mean it's also good to easily define where color actually ends
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rly does tsin have that? Xd
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> and it can also be used in a future server pushed ui extension we are also planning
15:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> idk but i never seen someone mention ddmax without Tsin message after it

15:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> how is coloration currently reset? just set to white?
15:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think it‚Äôs cool Tsin is still playing after all this time
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> The broadcaster sets it back to white

15:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> good points
15:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> wonder whether it makes sense to start thinking now about dynamic ui elements already and whether ddnet is moving towards becoming a library in the end, super flexible in all directions, kind of like a modding toolkit, or whether it's a straight forward implementation towards some goal that is not a library in the end.
15:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> or maybe the goal might be to jast have more interesting options for mappers
15:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> just
15:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> with ui elements

17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, editor works for me on android. for forgottencat it seemed to have crashed once
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on a non-rooted phone i also don't get it to work xd
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `If the application is debuggable you can use the run-as command in adb shell`
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i should try that out
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe we can ship ddnet with debuggable on
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> I need to write a script that auto suspends my laptop
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently this file manager can do that:

17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont find any open source alternative
17:51 < bridge> <robyt3> The default Files app should work to access apps' internal storage on newer Android versions. It's also seems possible to enable the legacy storage behavior with adb, so all other apps can access an app's files. https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-storage-access-framework-scoped-storage/
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can read them
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not move files into them
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i find a media dir only when moving files:

17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if we can use that dir instead üòÑ
18:00 < bridge> <zhn> but in the end
18:00 < bridge> <zhn> it doesn't even matter
18:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, maybe we should use the external storage as config dir if available, I don't know how common it is for the external storage to be not available
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we already do that
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's this emulated storage that can combine sdcards and normal storage
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> ah, true, we already do, so it should be possible to write there as well
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> > These directories include both a dedicated location for storing persistent files, and another location for storing cache data. Although it's possible for another app to access these directories if that app has the proper permissions, the files stored in these directories are meant for use only by your app. If you specifically intend to create files that other apps should be able to access, your app should store these files in the shared storage pa

18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> > If you specifically intend to create files that other apps should be able to access, your app should store these files in the shared storage part of external storage instead.
18:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't seem like the shared storage is meant for this though, mostly for media that the app creates
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do we care about that?
18:04 < bridge> <robyt3> more like, it simply doesn't work that way because config files are not media etc.
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but how does nextcloud do it then?
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can see all my files there
18:04 < bridge> <robyt3> unpack the apk and check the manifest
18:05 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe there is a way to specify that other apps can access the files
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can i unbinary the manifest?
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but they store everything in Android/media
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i feel like it doesnt work from NDK. which is already annoying
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hate this trash OS üò¨
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, using that might be the best option to make it accessible to users
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> but yeah, probably not easy with SDL+NDK
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> porting ddpg to android was pretty easy, rust makes it very easy.
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But i use a native activity currently and cant disable navigation it seems xD
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but _even_ with rust it was too annoying xD
18:15 < bridge> <robyt3> When JupstarOS written in Rust? üòè
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am in

18:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> jupsti please collab with milkeey and create a new OS with your own GFX backend
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> pls don't try to make another os, you'll have to implement cpp exceptions in kernel :troll:
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have an idea about a dream os, but i think it would at least take like 20 years as solo dev
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so dunno if i want to risk it üò¨
18:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> will it be in C :owo:
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> end of year i worked ~2 years on ddpg (-1 month corona infection)
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that thing still sucks hard
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's insane how time consuming dev is xd
18:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i thought you wrote it all in 6 months xd
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wish xd
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that was like my goal time
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i started somewhere januar 2022
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i think except for the corona infection i didnt have huge breaks from it

19:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 DDPer took F-DDrace, named it Block, and advertises it in DDNet master without being able to connect
19:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Same with other servers (SunnyLand)
19:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Why do we even support those, when they are not compatible?
19:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> They should host their own masters if they don't want any vanilla(ddnet) to join
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he already plans to remove them
19:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Good, and it's also weird they call themselves DDNet
19:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wtf, just checking their site with a vpn, so weird, and u can buy all amounts of extras
19:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yup, they use F-DDrace ü§£
19:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1268257821087109220/image.png?ex=66abc4a3&is=66aa7323&hm=c1986c564d9a2856324fd158685333a8ba465f1a4a716e7c3b1efcf17fb06e12&
19:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dunno about that one
19:25 < bridge> <zaerin__> @jupeyy_keks is there anyway to not use android/data for usr files?
19:25 < bridge> <zaerin__> the other directories are fully accesible as im aware
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not that i am aware of
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we could add a file downloader to the client, then u could download anything into that path :lol:
19:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I wouldn't even plan it, or give them the ability register without being able to join with ddnet
19:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> We are not here so they can use DDNet's list if we can't join, imo
19:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Code is public, they can set up their own master if they want to make their own game
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
19:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> oh, they dont use f-ddrace appearently
19:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> seems like ddnet based
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I was also opposed to helping them much because of this
19:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just drop it ?
19:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Why are carrying this around
19:32 < bridge> <zaerin__> that would be cool, android 11 > has this issue so its wide i guess
19:33 < bridge> <Peakies> yes it's ddnet base not f-ddrace cuz their server are 0.6 base
19:33 < bridge> <learath2> Heinrich will drop it soon
19:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 at this point, if you wanna be really nice, you can tell them they have like a week to set up their own master, then they're removed
19:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
19:33 < bridge> <Peakies> and the reason they use ddnet master cuz they use it to advertising their server and filter it in their client to show only their own server
19:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> LOL, so why don't do just allow all clients and apply for a community?
19:34 < bridge> <Peakies> to prevent bots and other cheats
19:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah, so people have to download some thirf party (maybe) virus just to play?
19:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Seems weird
19:35 < bridge> <Peakies> it was my way to prevent cheats but that register to master is they own way you know I don't work with them anymore so don't know exactly what's their plan
19:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh didnt know u worked for them, but i see
19:35 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah something like that but it's just a default ddnet client with a few changes in client id and etc
19:36 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah about 6 or 7 years ago i think
19:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> useless af
19:36 < bridge> <Peakies> I was work with ddnet persian that time I was just a 17 or 18 yo kid that I copy and wrote a few things
19:37 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I already create a client that can bypass their anti bot system or anything they call it don't know
19:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think that's everything they do, i dont see anything special, interesting or new things. Only copied stuff
19:37 < bridge> <Peakies> but they modifed their crc too I don't know what's that so I can load map just can send chat by using f1 console
19:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> who even owns this
19:38 < bridge> <Peakies> well in our country we have about 200 players that playing ddper and my server have ~40 or something and we both use custom client
19:38 < bridge> <Peakies> someone named Quick
19:38 < bridge> <Peakies> or Sj
19:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But why?
19:38 < bridge> <Peakies> something like that
19:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This sash guy ?
19:38 < bridge> <Peakies> my client cuz it's acount base
19:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> bot client?
19:38 < bridge> <Peakies> i don't know their reason
19:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> why do you need a custom client for accounts
19:39 < bridge> <Peakies> no no he's not Sash
19:40 < bridge> <Peakies> well it's using nodejs API for authentication and it's have some features like able to type in persian language and a few more features so I had to create my own client to maybe I be able to beat ddper and have players in my servers
19:40 < bridge> <Peakies> but players love their points on ddrace more than features on servers
19:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ahh, okay i see
19:41 < bridge> <Peakies> I'm working on ddnet for 10 years I think maybe more and I worked with all  three biggest servers as perian pro, ddper and my current server as iranddnet
19:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Is your server in ddnet's master?
19:45 < bridge> <Peakies> no it's not
19:45 < bridge> <teero777> haha wtf is `g?` in vim xDD
19:45 < bridge> <Peakies> I think it's not right to register it in case that you have to download my client to play
19:45 < bridge> <teero777> i love random bs
19:46 < bridge> <Peakies> I think it's not right to register it on ddnet masters in case that you have to download my client to play
19:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh, so your servers aren't registered at all, and your client provides a list of servers? Or how can I imagine it?
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Rot13 not random bs
19:46 < bridge> <teero777> xdddd
19:46 < bridge> <teero777> what do you need it for lmao
19:46 < bridge> <Peakies> do you remember old way of ddnet serverlist it's directly send request to servers with ip and port
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Idl for random bs
19:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah yes, i thought so
19:47 < bridge> <Peakies> so I change ddnet to it's old version for loading browser but I have plan to edit mastersrv and run my own master server
19:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Nice!
19:47 < bridge> <Peakies> so it's better and more optimize than my current serverbrowser
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> Discord truly is an engineering marvel

19:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Sounds good
19:50 < bridge> <Peakies> Yep
19:52 < bridge> <Peakies> and I love your F-DDRace, you really spend time for it, I didn't use it but as I see on your github I really loved what you have done there ü§ü
19:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Thank you! Appreciate it :heartw:
19:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> A lot of hours spent there....
19:53 < bridge> <Peakies> Yeah i'm sure you spend too much time to make it
19:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lot of fixes, finetuning, hours of debugging, optimizing... Sleepless nighs ü§£
19:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nights*
19:54 < bridge> <Peakies> I can imagine that situation specially sleepless nights üòÑ
19:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Anyways I'm really proud of the result, even after more than 6 years I still like to work on it
19:54 < bridge> <Peakies> I've been there for months
19:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Haha :D
19:55 < bridge> <Peakies> you should it's still unique and have everything that a Block server ned to have
19:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just recently I have added a voting menu and the tavern, so you can drink Grog to increase your permille lvl
19:55 < bridge> <Peakies> even more than what's it's need to have
19:55 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I check your discord mentions üòÑ
19:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Not everything, a really proper account system implementation using SQL would be nice
19:56 < bridge> <Peakies> I've done that before it's just need time to do it's not hard just take too much time
19:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But my filebased system works great aswell, handling many special cases tho...
19:56 < bridge> <Peakies> and for your server it's multiple to 10 maybe cuz have too much things to implement and etc
19:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, it's not specifcally hard and ddnet has a good implementation, but I am too lazy, might create 100 new bugs...
19:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ü§£
19:57 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah in that case you better to not work on same branch maybe it's better start a test server and work on that cuz mysql always gonna be buggy as I remember
19:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, and the codebase is not as perfect as I wished it to be, but it's fine and I can work with it good enough
19:58 < bridge> <Peakies> for first time I spend 3 or 4 days to add login, register, logout to ddnet üòÑ
19:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Especially in the beginning it can take a lot of time, you need a lot of base stuff to work with until you can create actual things quickly
19:58 < bridge> <Peakies> old version of ddnet's mysql was better to implement of account system in latest changes it's a bit hard and tricky maybe
19:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What has changed?
19:58 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah exactly
19:59 < bridge> <Peakies> let me see
19:59 < bridge> <Peakies> before we get scoreworker and etc
20:00 < bridge> <Peakies> when we had game/server/score folder everything was way easier at least for me
20:01 < bridge> <Peakies> that `sql_score` file were epic to add our own implementation
20:01 < bridge> <Peakies> that `sql_score` file were epic to add your own implementation
20:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you have in your book collection something about operating systems? Xd
20:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think I can grasp what you mean
20:03 < bridge> <Peakies> @fokkonaut and it's my client that I said before about it
20:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> LOL
20:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1268268067348156508/image.png?ex=66abce2e&is=66aa7cae&hm=434faba84ec03ad59a1053762fa014e9f071fd01375b89ade64bce6a9a02f28b&
20:04 < bridge> <Peakies> in new version of mysql that not work on Windows üòí  is possible to add new things but I little required more work to do
20:04 < bridge> <Peakies> haha üòÑ
20:05 < bridge> <Peakies> in new version of mysql that not work on Windows üòí  is possible to add new things but a little required more work to do
20:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I see, client must have been a lot of work, but too much imo LOL
20:08 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I really agree with you on that  üòÇ
20:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But that looks a lot like DDPer, with Block, SunnyLand, etc
20:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> So DDPer is yours?
20:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Or you share the same client? How does it work?
20:13 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, what sort of information are you looking for? Making an OS?
20:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what os consist of, how the parts are connected with each other and ye how to make an os xd
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> Hm. I don‚Äôt remember if I do, let me check

20:16 < bridge> <learath2> https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/ I have this bookmarked but I didn‚Äôt read much of it yet. I did refer to it a couple times though
20:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
20:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @diariesvexar
20:20 < bridge> <learath2> The only other OS book I‚Äôve heard good things about is the Dinosaur book, but I literally read none of it, can‚Äôt give any opinion
20:31 < bridge> <Peakies> Yeah server list is like ddper but that sunnyland servers cuz our players really love that map don't know why üòê so I run 2 ports of that single map üòÑ
20:31 < bridge> <Peakies> no it's not mine I have no control on ddper servers
20:31 < bridge> <Peakies> mod's base is mine kind of
20:32 < bridge> <Peakies> no we don't share anything I have my own server and client they have their own
20:32 < bridge> <Peakies> sorry was eating my dinner üò¶
20:33 < bridge> <Peakies> but anyway this days I just busy with learning UE and spend less time on ddnet for now
20:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I see
20:40 < bridge> <Peakies> yep
20:41 < bridge> <Peakies> maybe someday I realase my own game hahahaha üòÑ
20:41 < bridge> <Peakies> maybe someday I release my own game hahahaha üòÑ
20:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks, ill check üòÑ

23:55 < bridge> <tsin666> also I don't reply when someone writes an opinion (good or bad one)
23:55 < bridge> <tsin666> I only reply when someone writes it intentionaly to discredit something or someone related to me =] especialy when someone does it only for attention and its not related to any topic (just to make it clear your mentioning now I don't see as offending or to seek attention xD I see it just as your observation nothing more =] )
23:55 < bridge> <tsin666> oh and btw its easier to notice when I reply to things related to me because I don't rly write that much on ddnet discord - but when I do then I leave a wall of text muahahahaahaha evil me ^^)
