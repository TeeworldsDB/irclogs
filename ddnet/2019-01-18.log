07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> wtf, I have those spacing issue in rcon as well :OðŸ‘º
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Shelzy Madara they get small DoS attacks all the time and the hoster's reaction is to nullroute us for a few hours/days
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't have a better hoster in Brazil, but if you do let the admins know
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shelzy Madara> unfortunately I can not because I'm from Argentina, thanks for your answer

20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Shelzy Madara  adding an Argentina server wouldn't be so bad for Brazilians (and nearby countries) as it probably would have low latency compared to those from USA and other European countries.
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shelzy Madara> yep
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shelzy Madara> I know someone who could be a good host for the servers of brazil, argentina, etc.
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> That's awesome. Would be great to have another option in case Brazilian server is down.
22:42 <@deen> Shelzy Madera: Website of the hoster?
