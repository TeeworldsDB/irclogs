02:18 < bridge> <stormaxd> what a nice open source game
02:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is a blacklisted player o.0
02:32 < bridge> <stormaxd> Actually foes
02:32 < bridge> <stormaxd> So u don't have to write add_foe every time
02:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A
04:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I settled on stb since the tutorial also uses it :). I will try to use lodepng for future projects though ;). (<https://learnopengl.com/> is the tutorial)
04:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i would not recommend still using stb
04:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's basically abandonware
04:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the maintainer logs on about once a year to merge trivial things and other than that nothing happens to it
04:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> sadge. I guess I'll just use it for the tutorial (this chapter) and then switch to lodepng xD
04:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i do recommend lodepng
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's also not like the reference implementations for these things are super obtuse
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> you need a few functions to wrap libpng and behave exactly the same
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> same with most format/codec libraries
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes it's not worth it to use a minified version
04:39 < bridge> <Ewan> in exchange for a little bit of like overhead or dll size or whatever you get a pretty sure deal that the library you're using is going to receive support as long as the format/codec is around
04:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I see your point. Well for now I am just learning opengl. Nothing fancy *yet*
04:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Thanks for the heads up ;)
04:48 < bridge> <stormaxd> Nah we spent 40 mins for it
04:48 < bridge> <stormaxd> Im talking about blacklisted and friends color in tab
04:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> xd
05:03 < bridge> <stormaxd> Not xd
05:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> Is actually mental breakdown
05:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> But fun
07:18 < bridge> <jtbx.> Would anyone have an idea why my ddnet client is using 1280x720 instead of the maximum resolution for my monitor (1920x1080)? 1280x720 is the largest option I can select. I'm on Linux with Wayland (also tried using `SDL_BACKEND=wayland`). Using `SDL_BACKEND=x11` fixes it but then I get an error on startup saying it failed to initialise the Vulkan renderer, and the fps drops. A vanilla Teeworlds client works just fine.
07:37 < bridge> <Ewan> fullscreen right
07:38 < bridge> <Ewan> have u tried desktop fullscreen
07:38 < bridge> <Ewan> oh u know what
07:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i bet it's hi-dpi
07:39 < bridge> <Ewan> are u on a laptop with a 144dpi screen
08:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillergragon: great teeworlds coding vids :brownbear:
09:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> owo @milkeeycat
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Additionally to what ewan said, which sounds very likely. If you use Wayland u should have a very recent distro. Not like Ubuntu 20 lmao
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And also always try a self compiled ddnet
09:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait there are binary releases?
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Troll
09:54 < bridge> <deen> Anyone here want to debug an issue in CSnapshotStorage? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2677#issuecomment-1807060128
10:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3243
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i have the time but lack context
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a known trigger
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it would be reproducable it would probably be ez to fix ^^
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> not necessarily
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> causation/correlation
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> many more factors in play on a high traffic chn server than one you‚Äôre playing with in a debugger
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah wow.. every issues is reproducable then üòÇ
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it is, but u know what i mean
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the issue of issues is to issue the way an issue can be reproduced
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> why u like this xd
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> buy a stress ball or smth
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> arguing over nothing is not productive
10:26 < ChillerDragon> rude ewan
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean you started
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> less useful than partial borrowing xd
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they should concentrate on good stuff
10:40 < bridge> <learath2> LOL
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @furo321 omg your video in #announcements is epic
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we should have more of this stuff
10:51 < bridge> <steinchen99> @furo321 for Admin
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #7325 will split the community so hard :/
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if even in the pr most are already disliking it
10:52 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7325
11:03 < bridge> <furo321> Thanks! :D
11:14 < bridge> <murpi> I don't think it'll split the community, but we can expect to receive numerous complaints in the near future
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's similar IMO. it only doesn't split because there is no alternative to ddnet
11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we should introduce client k and client z
11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> similar to telegram xD
11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they need to compete against each other
11:24 < bridge> <murpi> There are already good alternatives to the ddnet client (e.g. Tater's client)
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> feature wise yes
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but still often ppl ask questions about bugs in ddnet's discord
11:25 < bridge> <murpi> We're effectively already competing with custom clients now üòÑ
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet is obviously more attractive anyway, bcs of steam support etc
11:26 < ChillerDragon> jopsti thanks for the mention of videos in announcements
11:26 < ChillerDragon> very pog video indeed @furo321
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would be cooler if smth like tater client would have a place in ddnet or smth
11:26 < ChillerDragon> if i had known deen puts my clip into a discord announcement i would probably have turned off my cring coding music while recording it xd
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i swear, i wanted to talk about that with u
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then i was like: ok no
11:27 < ChillerDragon> about what
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the music
11:27 < ChillerDragon> its in ma coding playlist
11:27 < ChillerDragon> i just didnt turn off sound cuz idc it was just for github preview
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the german in the song
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so weird xD
11:27 < ChillerDragon> its pog song, no?
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the beats are fine
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the german is cringe af
11:28 < ChillerDragon> you have to forget german to listen to it
12:16 < bridge> <.lepinpin> hey how to recompile ddnet code pls
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> make clean
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or delete build dir
12:18 < bridge> <.lepinpin> ?? i have the ddnet master code
12:18 < bridge> <.lepinpin> from stormA
12:23 < bridge> <.lepinpin> ?? i have the ddnet master code
12:23 < bridge> <.lepinpin> from stormA
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> k
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly i can only answer the question as how i understand it
12:27 < bridge> <.lepinpin> i have the ddnet decomplied from a guys named StormA and pls can you explain me how to recompli it pls
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't decompile it in first place
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume you mean, u have the source code
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and want to compile it
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> read the readme
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/README.md
12:30 < bridge> <teero777> I had the same problem when I used Wayland a while ago. I think my fix was to switch between windowed and fullscreen mode a few times but I'm not sure. Was one of the reasons I switched back to xorg ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> holly hell, what happened

12:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :tear:
12:44 < bridge> <.lepinpin> a guys can explain how to recompile the source code pls i dont understand
12:45 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Its perfectly explained in the ddnet readme on GitHub as jupstar already mentioned
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what he actually wants to say: "i am lazy"
12:45 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Same tho
12:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> How to add a custom icon?
12:45 < bridge> <.lepinpin> no im frech and i dont understand all thing
12:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> translate.google.com
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it's better exaplined than anything we can come up with
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao

12:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> derp

13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> read the error log
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant read it on ur screenshot
13:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Use a different folder for building instead of putting the build files in the source folder. Change "Where to build the binaries" to "C:/ddnet-master/build"
13:04 < bridge> <.lepinpin> ok i will try
13:06 < bridge> <.lepinpin> same

13:15 < bridge> <murpi> Does anyone know which PR implemented #3281 ?
13:15 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3281
13:15 < bridge> <robyt3> The community information and icons come from https://info.ddnet.org/info and the URL specified in there. You can try your own communities and icons locally by adding the information in your local `ddnet-info.json` and adding the icon file to the `communityicons` folder in your config directory. For testing, mark the `ddnet-info.json` file as read-only so it's not automatically overridden by the downloaded info. Information about the new json entrie
13:16 < bridge> <murpi> Ah #5148
13:16 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5148
13:16 < bridge> <.lepinpin> its a linux command so it dont work
13:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> download git
13:16 < bridge> <murpi> No wait that wasn't merged :thonk:
13:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But where do I upload the picture?
13:18 < bridge> <.lepinpin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1173235290119356476/image.png?ex=65633782&is=6550c282&hm=6cdc7434b74225189d12c8a3a9d5415438d1e7fd0848ed8cfe7a259b45e9a3ff&
13:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> >:C
13:20 < bridge> <robyt3> We haven't created a fancy process or criteria for adding/updating communities yet, I guess for now you can create an Other ticket (https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1124657351442579486) so we manually update community information. Therefore, it would be preferred that communities only do this infrequently and first ensure that their changes work locally. üôÇ
13:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I see. Thanks a lot
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is backward compability a reason (affects 50 players), but breaking usability for all ppl that play on gores and ddnet (probably more than 50 players) not?
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's just sad that all arguments in that pr and the issue were completely ignored
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> custom tabs would solve all problems
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead we go harakiri
13:25 < bridge> <robyt3> We can still consider that later, we'll see how many nightly users complain about it
13:26 < bridge> <robyt3> Using icons for the tabs and adding the largest communities as tabs seems fine to me though
13:26 < bridge> <robyt3> As long as it doesn't all have to configurable
13:26 < bridge> <robyt3> As long as it doesn't all have to be configurable
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 better join the team meetings, zwelf and patiga know more about our project then you xD
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and they are our competitors
13:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh yea i forgot u guys are doing the 2.0 stuffs
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u aswell
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u are team ryo & voxel
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and learath is teamed up with heinrich
13:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea but like    no progress has been made
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's a communication problem
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my team makes progress at least once a week
13:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i tried to talk to ryo in ddnet once but he rq insread of replying
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> who's in ur team?
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robyte. but he also ignores me xDDDDDDDDD
13:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @ryozuki lets start talking about ddnet 2.0
13:53 < bridge> <syrinok> Removing the ddnet tab seems really strange
13:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah idk why they want to do that
13:54 < bridge> <syrinok> If I can't filter out every server easily besides ddnet, then I'm not using that version
13:54 < bridge> <syrinok> Massive step backwards
13:56 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm assuming we can, if we can't, that's an actually crazy person update
13:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> #7325
13:56 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7325
13:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> that was slow af
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i blame python
13:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont think it was python
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it was not the python bot, then it was the python discord
13:57 < bridge> <syrinok> Ah, so you can filter, then it's not as bad I guess
13:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> well i still dont wanna use that new filter
13:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ppl are gonna forge the ddnet icon sha256 and make fake servers
14:01 < bridge> <Iza> the removal of the ddnet tab must be one of the worst changes i've ever seen
14:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> omfg its gonna be wild. someone with malicious intent could make a fake ddnet server and have it be multeasymap, and it'll naturally flood itself
14:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah I think the server icons/images should be set by the masterserver. (so manually)
14:09 < bridge> <chairn> why don't people use the favorite tab?
14:09 < bridge> <chairn> I add all ddnet server there and im fine with it
14:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :kek:
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use favorite tab for fng
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet for ddnet
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> kog for gores
14:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah me too
14:10 < bridge> <syrinok> Playing on other regions, usually people add servers with low ping to their favs
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> custom tabs would solve all problems.. they'd simply take a pre defined filter
14:11 < bridge> <chairn> isn't favorite tab a custom tab already? Maybe an auto add feature would be nice though because sometimes ddnet server changes. In Europe, there were NLD and FRA at some point
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes 1 tab
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need 3 xd
14:13 < bridge> <syrinok> But ya, this just makes it harder to play the game
14:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i never use the favorite tab
14:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> anyways cant wait for ddnet/kog tab to be removed and for ppl to trash up the internet tab again
14:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> imagine having whole kog tab instead of searching for kog itself in search kekw
14:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> same with ddnet tab tho
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use search mostly to search clans or players tho
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also we don't really have a space problem if we iconize tabs:
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7325#issuecomment-1752532267
14:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i feel like ppl are iconizing everything without a reason now
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i do it onyl bcs 5:4
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 16:9 i'd not iconize lot of stuff
14:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> fair
14:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw is the `Quitting. Please wait...` supposed to be fixed on nightly?
14:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It's kinda annyoing because it's easts my cursor
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly no :/
14:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah ok I force close the window then

14:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah ok that's good
14:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> too bad ryo has to be the only one coding it
14:48 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> @ryozuki we going 2p or what
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You can respawn after 2 seconds of being frozen and a dummy (server-side) takes your place.
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> There is gun and laser (gun tunned) (and ninja but no good maps for it yet).
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> There is /teamplay and when you have a kill, you and your kill are moved to a random DDRace Team.
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> There's /team <number> instead of `Join Red` or `Join Blue`. (Also in that case /teamplay instead moves you to your team so it allows teamwork).
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Most of the ddnet tiles are supported (all maybe but we haven't tested it (no maps with the ddnet tiles yet)).
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> There can also be flag-goal (goal tiles are new).
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Flag behaves like flagboal. You can throw it but you can't shoot it.
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> When using flag you need to change a custom server setting (sv_num_teams_allowed) to 2.
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> /team 1 is red team and /team 2 is blue team.
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> If you're blue you score the blue flag to the blue goal. Like-wise for reds.
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> /team 0 is neutural and can't score the flag, but can kill players in spikes.
14:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> can u tell me when ur gonna play again? i wanna hop on

16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet?
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your data dir is missing
16:03 < bridge> <furo321> LGTM
16:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh, i renamed teeworlds dir and works
16:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what a whoopsie daisy
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Somehow you have no data dir and put all your data files in your `DDNet` config directory. If you also have a `Teeworlds` config directory then this is used first, but it doesn't contain your data
16:15 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont know rust nor do i know how to build ddnet from the ground up
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> perfect
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then ryo has no other choice than to help you xd
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt need to work. it just needs to look fancy xdd

16:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Most languages don't translate it because it's hard to translate, it's used in the demo browser
16:55 < bridge> <robyt3> It's short for "Network version"
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deactivate the bloom option
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to see it without xd
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually i compiled these examples too
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @_voxeldoesart see it also looks trash without

17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might not be the fault of bloom here that this looks trash xDDD
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho it might still be low quality
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd not recommend these examples anyway
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have seen lot of validation layers in them

17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where did u download
17:29 < bridge> <patiga> I'm currently overthinking a relatively unimportant thing, which I thought I could represent/enact with rust stuff but is just not very beautiful and will just use a much easier solution ^^
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and does F1 console show an error?
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can share it if you want üòÑ
17:30 < bridge> <patiga> I thought about asking here, but concluded I should just stop and do the easy way
17:30 < bridge> <noproblem777> ddnet.org
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also put it into skins of
17:30 < bridge> <patiga> and I'm using train wifi right now, so the unstable connection might prolong `Patiga is typing`
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> $configdir
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
17:32 < bridge> <patiga> I'll keep you in the dark this time, don't wanna go into that direction again :d
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean gotta admit that offloading it to GPU makes it scale better
17:33 < bridge> <noproblem777> no such command
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> read the bot output xD

17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what about skin prefix?
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u know what
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> go into %appdata%
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and rename "DDNet" to "DDNet_old"
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> close client before doing so
17:49 < bridge> <noproblem777> Didnt help
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not sure if u trolling rn tbh
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no errors, no reinstall works
17:51 < bridge> <noproblem777> I try full delete file DDNet and client, then reinstall in steam, but it didnt help too :/
17:51 < bridge> <noproblem777> Im dont troll!
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok step by step:
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - u close client
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - you go into %appdata%
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - all folders named "DDNet" or "Teeworlds" will be renamed (u can press f2, when selecting them)
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you start client
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should say "what's your name" etc.
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like a completely new client
17:52 < bridge> <noproblem777> I didn't quite understand what kind of mistake you're talking about
17:55 < bridge> <noproblem777> It too didnt help
17:57 < bridge> <noproblem777> My English is very bad, please explain about the error in the console. What was I supposed to do?

18:59 < ChillerDragon> why?
18:59 < ChillerDragon> if i want to recreate original size of mapres that would be 1024

19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not the idea
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the idea is you put the resolution your screen has
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it automatically makes it scale up or down relative to full hd
19:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh i understood the script wrong
19:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok also then rude to ppl with smol screens
19:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why not let the people pick a mapres size?
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs skins have other res
19:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for build all yes i see
19:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am using build single right now
19:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea for build all your approach seems to be the only one that makes sense
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro i dunno, i just put random characters into the script until it worked
19:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think one reason was, that all textures are looking differently well on full hd
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like skins are further away from being sharp than tile sets
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so skins tend to scale earlier etc.
19:13 < bridge> <yekrm> I don't understand why fse don't work
20:01 < bridge> <jtbx.> Yeah, I'm using hidpi but desktop fullscreen fixed it, thanks. What does desktop fullscreen do?

21:21 < bridge> <tyenty> Heyo everyone, when someone dies in a multi view spectate, it's sad that this player got removed from the list of the spectated tees. Im sure its a feature wanted, but it would be great to have a toggle in order to enable this or not.

22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> an assert?
22:02 < bridge> <murpi> Game crashes while having another game open
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which version is that?
22:03 < bridge> <murpi> It's very consistent too
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^
22:03 < bridge> <murpi> nightly on windows 10 64bit
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and u are sure it's not in non nightly?
22:03 < bridge> <murpi> I'm always on nightly
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i check for you where it crashes
22:04 < bridge> <murpi> This crash isn't very new either, I've had this issue like pretty much always

22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have you reported this issue?
22:08 < bridge> <murpi> To whom?
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nvidia
22:08 < bridge> <murpi> No, like I said, it's very niche. Only happens with this very particular game
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i'd report it
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i always report if amd driver crashes xd
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> especially weird is, that you said it only happens if u start the game twice, right?
22:10 < bridge> <murpi> No, not ddnet twice, but an entirely different game
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a specific one?
22:11 < bridge> <murpi> Guild Wars 2
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it use vulkan?
22:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think gw2 does use directx
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> guerss no
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess no
22:12 < bridge> <murpi> They transitioned from dx11 to dx12 I think
22:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> does it crash in a specific state of gw2?
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you want, you can use a vulkan to directx 12 translation layer üòÑ
22:13 < bridge> <murpi> üò¨ Sure

22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all files from x64
22:42 < bridge> <murpi> I don't have that :thonk:
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i use the older version
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the other version works too
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just with these files
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah mb
22:43 < bridge> <murpi> Yeah, works
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u verify with f1?

22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic gamer moment
22:44 < bridge> <murpi> epic
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i try the latest version to check if screenshots still crash xD
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that kinda sucks
22:45 < bridge> <murpi> crashes for me
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw in latest version it's called
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> spirv_to_dxil.dll
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> seems like they renamed it xd
22:46 < bridge> <murpi> do people even use the in-game screenshot function?
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but latest version also crashes
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so rip
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let me quickly test with software renderer, so i can blame microsoft üòÇ
22:47 < bridge> <murpi> closing the game is also super fast now :thonk:
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhhh
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dx probably has more cheats on windows
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok with lavapipe screenshots work
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw, what confused me earlier was:
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have to close the powershell and create a new one before the setx command applied
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> very very weird behavior xD
22:49 < bridge> <murpi> using setx without prior testing isn't very good either üòÑ
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> performance is.. lala
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ALT + TAB is instant
22:49 < bridge> <murpi> using set should be enough
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro i have zero plan from windows
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in linux u put env vars in front of your command
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @murpi how is alt tab for you?
22:50 < bridge> <murpi> I don't notice much of a difference
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
22:50 < bridge> <murpi> Alt+tabbing is generally quite fast for me
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> seems like that improved
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even on vulkan
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> last time i checked ~1 year ago it was still black screening
22:51 < bridge> <murpi> So you're saying we should transition from vulkan to directx, yah?
22:52 < bridge> <murpi> can't wait to see the directx logo in your profile picture üòÑ
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the alt tab is fixed for vulkan too üòâ
22:52 < bridge> <murpi> can't wait to see the directx logo in your profile picture instead üòÑ
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no need to switch
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can i unset a env var xD
22:52 < bridge> <murpi> Remove it manually in PATH
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> normal vulkan apaarently doesnt work with that env var set
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> manually
22:53 < bridge> <murpi> Windows Key +R: `rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables`
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so yeah
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe u should somehow add it as steam start parameter if u want to use it
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs else other vk games might not work
22:54 < bridge> <murpi> I'm not starting ddnet from steam though üòÖ
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont lie
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ur crash log said steam
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :kek:
22:56 < bridge> <murpi> Steam is updating the game for me, but I launch it directly from the executable
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok üòÑ
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw perf seems pretty good
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically same FPS
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean, good for windows ofc
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on linux i have min. double FPS
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @murpi anyway if it works for you with the other game, dunno how reproducable it was, report it.
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be interesting to know if such a fix works XD
22:59 < bridge> <murpi> I've locked my fps at around 660, which is about 4 times my actual refresh rate of my current monitor
22:59 < bridge> <murpi> Too much effort üò¨
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i lock my FPS too, but still good to know what the max is :brownbear:
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vulkan fanboy
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro sound delay on win confuses my brain hard xD
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok anyway thanks for testing. i should test if i can run vulkan to dx12 to vulkan on linux with wine
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i am fully satisfied
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 the 1% low and 0.1% low frame times would be cool. Maybe not even as graph, but we extra info
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As*
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's also what u usually see in benchmarks
23:33 < bridge> <robyt3> The graph only contains 128 values, so a little over 2 seconds at 60 FPS. Would that window size make sense for calculating 1% low FPS?
23:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> lol
23:50 < bridge> <nouaa> wut
23:51 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i think that logo could be too square to fit in
23:52 < bridge> <nouaa> don't think so, will see
23:54 < bridge> <cyberFighter> this graph counter is kinda weird i think. my fps on the counter on the top right always says its around 70-80, but the graph shows it like its at 120-130s
