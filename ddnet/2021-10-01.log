06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @timakro what about russian unique servers? im glad to host them too
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> With russian discord unique race server too?:poggers:
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nah
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> sad
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> No unban for me:feelsbadman:
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Not so good yet.
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Trying to work with deen on improving the handshaking a little, that would make filtering a lot easier.
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> However I'm onto something atm that should work pretty good
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yay breaking protocol changes
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> No.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Handshaking itself wouldn't be changed, I suggested introducing a "force reconnect packet"
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> however, I can also just abuse the "server is full" reconnect
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> however, I can also just abuse the "server is full" reconnect, which of course isn't transparent, but would stop pretty much anything currently leaking.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Im not sure what you are on to tbh :D
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> -> validate handshake using a custom challenge
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> -> whitelist flow, reconnect player and allow traffic to acutally pass through to the game server
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How much incoming traffic is guaranteed on secured.gg?
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Attack ,or clean trafifc?
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> both
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Clean traffic just as much as the actual server can handle of course.
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which in this case, is 10Gbps in both USA & DE
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Attack traffic? Depends.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Amplification attacks generally don't cause any trouble, and are filtered upstream.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> L7 filtering 100Gbps, can however be upgraded pretty fast on our end.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Attack traffic? Depends.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Amplification attacks generally don't cause any trouble, and are filtered upstream.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> L7 (game) filtering 100Gbps, can however be upgraded pretty fast on our end.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well vali not only uses normal DDoS, also sends spoofed packets
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> We're aware
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with player ips
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that's no problem
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It's the first handshake packet which is being sent
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It's the first handshake packet which is being sent, which is not challengeable or cachable on our end.
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which makes things a little problematic.
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> However, introducing a reconnect packet to implement a custom challenge, should work perfectly.
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which would be seamless for the client
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> "first handshake packet" being "\x10\x00\x00\x01TKEN\xff\xff\xff\xff"
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea but game traffic doesnt use tokens iirc
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only in 0.7
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Ok, that doesn't really matter
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> We don't expect game traffic before handshaking
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but if he sends spoofed packets with ips from connected players
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> A flow consists of
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> iph id, source ip, source port, dest port, dest ip
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Chances are a few packets will then still leak due to them perfectly matching that
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> but it'd be so low volume, it can't cause issues.
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> and you can of course also rate limit that traffic, even though I'm not a huge fan of rate limits
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> problem on my server right now is, that OVH limits incoming traffic to a very low amount during an attack, that means the custom firewall cant filter all packets because also legit packets are being filtered
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'll move soon, then its not a problem anymore
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> great to see other servers working on a solution too
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If @deen can implement what I suggested, it shouldn't be a huge issue for servers that are with us
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If he can't implement that, I'll abuse the reconnect mechanism that already exists
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If he can't implement that, I'll abuse the reconnect mechanism that already exists, also not a huge issue.
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just use that I think
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> older clients are still around
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways^
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It'll display that "server is full, reconnecting in 4 seconds" message
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> so it wouldn't be super transparent
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> but it'd work
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It works
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 🙂
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> <idle>-0     [004] ..s. 19300946.505675: 0: generated and saved challenge: 454029306
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän>           <idle>-0     [004] ..s. 19300946.644496: 0: success!
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän>           <idle>-0     [004] ..s. 19300946.644505: 0: yes
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> @Fän do you mind elaborating on what is missing on ddnet's initial token handshake? Why do you need a custom challenge?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Nothing's missing, to be fiar.
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Nothing's missing, to be fair.
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Ideally, our filtering environment should be able to issue challenges, which it is. However, as of right now, we can't make the server "state-aware".
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> For this we'd a) require new gear, which is coming in some time october or b) simply make the player reconnect.
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> that's interesting. Well, I hope it works 🙂
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Try connecting to a GER1 server and you should notice
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Try connecting to a GER1 server and you should notice how it'll reconnect you
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> yea, it does
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Only happens once though.
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> so, at that point my ip address is whitelisted?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> The flow, not the IP directly
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> there's more to it, but yes, your client is whitelisted at that point.
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> the thing is, when I open a second client, the dialog also doesn't appear again
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Agreed
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Fän how does that thing work? I currently have a website https://f.zillyhuhn.com running to validate an ip address via tcp handshake, could that be replaced by ur reconnect thing?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If you're asking if you can run this with your dedicated server / vps, then likely not
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It uses xdp / eBPF
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats that
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_Data_Path
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and why shouldnt i be able to use this?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> VPS gets killed even with XDP xd
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Not all NICs support this, especially not in a virtualized environment.
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not on my vps
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> And even then, there's the capacity issue.
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but the firewall infront
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If you have a 1Gbps link, and that gets blasted, there's nothing you can do
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> k*
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> An interesting article about that from CF https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-drop-10-million-packets/
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> We do all our filtering in XDP / eBPF, and it's great, however not everyone can just "set that up"
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know, but I know someone who could
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you explain me how it works, maybe in dm
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> ^
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk wym
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or in what relation this is
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I've explained how the whole thing works a few msgs above
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> however, open sourcing this as example won't work
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> as your server still can't handle > 1Gbps or whatever its capacity is, and even if we did open source this or smiliar, attackers will be able to find a way around.
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vali will anyways xd
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Good luck!
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> @Fän maybe instead of disconnecting with "full" you could instead display something like "Please wait..."
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not possible
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> ^Yes possible
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not how it is rn
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> deen already mentioned it, and I've made the changes
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> ah, okay
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> just need to push it live.
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Isnt that message clientside?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Not at all.
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh didnt know
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> That's how we force the reconnect
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> ah, the client uses the keyword "full" for detecting whether it is full
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> now, everything makes sense
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> correct.
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> ```cpp
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän>             if(g_Config.m_ClReconnectFull > 0 && (str_find_nocase(ErrorString(), "full") || str_find_nocase(ErrorString(), "reserved")))
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän>                 m_ReconnectTime = time_get() + time_freq() * g_Config.m_ClReconnectFull;```
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> hum, "please wait four full seconds" contains "full" 🤔
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh god, hpw did we leave that in there? String matching EW
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/hpw/how/
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Works great for me 🙂
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it worked out, but still it’s very meh software engineering 😄
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Agreed
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> but it does help a lot now 😉
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So what is the idea btw? How does making people reconnect help?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I explained above
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> upon first connection, our xdp mitigation will challenge the connectio
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> upon first connection, our xdp mitigation will challenge the connection
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> upon first connection, our xdp mitigation will challenge the connection, instead of the game server
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> once that's verified, it'll reconnect the player to "sync" states
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> upon first connection, our xdp mitigation will challenge the connection, instead of the game server doing so
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that’s a nice idea. I had a PoC that used an xdp filter on the server and I instead used a bpf map
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Well, bpf maps aren't the issue here
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> As we're intercepting the initial handshake challenge, the actual game server won't receive it
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that's why we're reconnecting the player
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> to whitelist the flow, we're of course still storing data in bpf maps
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, I was talking about what I did. I did let he game server receive the initial handshake. I can see how handling that entire flow in xdp would be more efficient
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> As a generic solution I would be really happy if some hosters provided a way to upload custom xdp into some upstream firewall.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> That won't ever be a thing.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It's a liability that no hoster will willingfully take.
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, too flexible
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> You can cause quite a lot of trouble otherwise.
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Then some reasonable subset language
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just wish I could configure the firewall without having to ask a hoster to do it for thousands of dollars
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Well, there's also the issue of most hosting providers not even knowing what eBPF / XDP is.
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Which is the reason as to why custom ddos protection providers are so successful nowadays.
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Its rather "new"
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> "new" technology from 2016
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Some companies are using JAVA 6
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m not sure a reasonable subset exists, an upstream firewall would have access to traffic not even destined for you. I could see it maybe being a thing on an “upstream” firewall that is right before your server
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Which no sane provider would allocate >10Gbps to
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I don’t see it happening. Maybe a very crippled verifiable language that gets compiled down to bpf
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> Maybe just use "standardized" stateful protocols instead 🤔
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As in?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The solution that would work on most hosters without much friction would be to mimic the protocol of some popular game
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Even then, providers like Hetzner have basically no protection.
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> The only provider I could think of would be OVH
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> The only provider I could think of would be OVH, which most servers are still being attacked on
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Hetzner offers ddos protections, but mostly you end up nullrouted 😄
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t think hetzner null routed us even once the last 3 years
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> We got nullrouted twice in 6 months already, not KoG
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/ddos-schutz
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But you right, hetzner isnt the best player out there
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> This is just for amp-related floods
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Anything actually spoofed won't be stopped at all.
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Fän btw did you consider the 2 other protocols we support when you wrote your rules?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> "DNS reflection, NTP reflection or UDP floods on port 80."
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> basically things that were blocked using static ACLs in 2010 already
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I haven't tested older clients
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If you're talking about the info request (i don't have a sample of that atm), then yes, that's passing just fine.
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vanilla 0.6 doesn’t have a token, 0.7 doesn’t use the same layout for the header (e.g. the token isn’t in the same place)
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are only deploying this filter while under attack it’s fine to drop these, but if it’ll be always deployed we might have to allow those flows through albeit with a ratelimit
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Of course I'm not very deep into all this, but isn't it granted to assume that most players would use the newest version?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> (found at https://ddnet.tw)
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, a very large percentage of players would be using either the ddnet client or derivative clients that will use our version of the handshake
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the servers support all 3 versions of the handshake, so we probably should allow those through aswell
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or if this is only deployed during attacks maybe we should just not advertise on the 0.7 master during that time
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I can likely add support for 0.7
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> not entirely sure about vanilla 0.6 though
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can just let that through with a ratelimit and let it drop in userland?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Just to get complaints about "server getting ddos"?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Rather not
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I'll see what I can do
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Let's say a newer client uses the protocol 0.6 uses, however sends their version as newest (afaik a certain packet contains the ddnet client version), will it allow that to pass through?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The server doesn’t really pass things through
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure what you mean
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> ok, let me rephrase
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Right now, the newest version connects using an initial challenge
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> if the client did not send the challenge, but connected smiliar to how 0.6 connects, would it still allow the player to join?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It won’t take up a slot. The server has a “handshake” built for 0.6 clients that abuses a behaviour of the client. So it will get a tad deeper into the netcode then will get dropped
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can tell you the path it takes in code if you want to take a look
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Sure!
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So `SECURITY_TOKEN_MAGIC` iow `TKEN` is what we use to indicate a client supports the ddnet protocol. In `CNetServer::Recv` `IsDDNetControlMsg` will check if the magic is in the packet. If not it will take the 0.6 path. Which is in `CNetServer::OnPreConnMsg`, this will simulate an accept, there is a nice comment there you can read about what it does
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It basically abuses the fact that the client will return the gametick in it's input packets. So we send a generated gametick, and in the input packet we check that it is the same generated gametick we sent
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Cool, can add support for that.
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How are you thinking of doing it? Will you re-implement it in XDP or will you pass it through?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Assuming that it doesn't support the same reconnect mechanism
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I'll have to wait for the new gear to come in
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> and I then can mess with it, and send custom generated responses to the server and such
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which will make the entire "reconnect" thing useless as we can handle it in an easier way
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> well, instead of auto reconnect you can also instruct players to reconnect
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fan is the guy from secured.gg right?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel grateful but i cant stop thinking about the day he will abandon us
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if this works out
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> +1
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, what easier way? Don't think storing the handshake packets is viable
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It's not.
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> As of right now, we reconnect the player to send another handshake packet
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> to forward to the server, after validating the actual connection as legitimate
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> with the new gear, we can instead generate packets and send them as a "replacement" handshake packet
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that way we won't have to reconnect players at all
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, so the firewall/the system in between will do a handshake with the client, if it's a legit connection it'll do another one with the server then let them speak with eachother? I guess that works since we don't have tokens in actual game packets iirc
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Correct.
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's nice to finally have someone that knows what they are doing with xdp and has access to some decent hardware 😄
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye but that doesnt remove my worries xd
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> That's how our Rust filter works aswell, to some extent
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Obviously there's more to it, but that's one of its main functionalities
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have access to said xdp code?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We've all been messing around with this kind of solution but with our peasant 1g links it's just too easy to overwhelm
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is rly great, but with such a long lived game as ddnet people come and go you know it
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki nope, not sure what the conditions are around that one
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its better to be prepared
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing they keep the firewall stuff a bit of a secret, which is fair, given the nature of this kind of thing
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw if this solution proves useful we should probably implement a reconnect message so people don't get the "full"
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It won't be required with the new hardware anyway
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> We're having trouble with a vendor, so things might take another week or two, but at that point we'll have a lot more control over traffic flow
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> Will you officially support teeworlds/ddnet filters for all customers?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> So this whole "reconnect" thing is just temporary
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Once we consider the filter as fully functional, yes.
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> cool, I want one
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> (which means support for 0.6, 0.7 and current version)
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but will u need a dedicated or just a vps?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> VPS will do just fine
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats nice
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'll probably sooner or later move to 0.7 protocol ourselves
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> So another protocol change?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> anyway, can add support for 0.7 if someone can provide me a download
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Ah I see
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is a mod of teeworlds
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it ended up being more popular
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I know, just not fully aware of all versions
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ok
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well teeworlds changed protocol from 0.6 to 0.7
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I wouldn't hold my breath, I've been intending to port ddnet to 0.7 for 2 years now. I just don't have the time for it
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ddnet stayed at 0.6
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt rush the 0.7 stuff
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this will take lot of time
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and lot of angry people
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do support the 0.7 protocol though, the filter should probably allow it
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just don't use it in the client
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> porting to 0.7 fully would mean new skin system etc lot of changes and lot of ppl who dislike changes
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki yeah the skin thing is going to be a huge issue
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd probably have an extra netmsg to allow people to use legacy skins
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also we should never ever take their text rendering stuff
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sucks ass
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks rly bad
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ᵃᶜᶜᵒᵘⁿᵗˢ
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie @Ryozuki is insulting your text renderer
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/893474944552415283/unknown.png
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cmon
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know it
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is rly bad
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> what's this
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeworlds 0.7 chat
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> ough
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like it went to 2000's
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/893475202212712448/unknown.png
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the skin system is nice tho
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only BIG  downside
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is we got lot of skins
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that would be lost
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, ours does look prettier, why is that?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ours looks like 0.6 teeworlds
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 changed it
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to use the shadow weird
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it looks rly bad
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> nah, not my fault that i kept the look
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> but screw Ryozuki anyway
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> outline > shadow
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, I found a bug with `cl_chat_old` funny how I predicted this the second we were forced to include yet another config to keep old players happy
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can remove it
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure at this point only konsti and ravie use it
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most ppl are 2 lazy to change
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you turn it on and off you'll get messages without a tee on the left
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> proximity voice chat ddnet when
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @murpi i wanted to look into that
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that would be so toxic 😄
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always wanted to learn voip
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can see sp someone already
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a soundboard
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the nazi anthem
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Do I have to modify anything to allow 0.7 players to join?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> imagine having to moderate voice chat :/
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> my server doesn't seem joinable on 0.7
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur ddnet server?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> actually, nvermind!
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> actually, nevermind!
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> put map in maps07 folder
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> integrate intels bleep system
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Fän yes, you need to generate the 0.7 map, there is a tool included in the zip for it, and you need to enable `sv_sixup`
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if there are any issues enabling the compatibility layer there will be a warning on the command line
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/893476456099901501/IMG_20211001_124636.jpg
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: Restarting the client should be changing the src port, do you think maybe you have a bug there? I only got the double connect the first time
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> A: Had to limit flows to ip saddr temporarily
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this some fake nintendo
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> why does it have to be nintendo
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> its just a arm device with controller
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does anyone want to donate a steam deck to me so i can test ddnet there? (for dev purposes obviously) :monkalaugh:
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> sure y not
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> our company's publisher got the dev kit
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> might as well donate to ddnet
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't think there is much that needs to be done specially for the steam deck
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it works on linux it should work, no?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 shh
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> other than making a better controller support
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :thonk:
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides why would you donate it to ryozuki, you should donate it to @Jupstar ✪ if anything is broken it'll be the gfx
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i always thought L and R to move and left stick gun right stick hook might be better than using stick to move btw
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a controller its hard to hook + hammer + aim at same time
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> something quite frequent in ddnet
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> and move
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> auto aim for switch to make it easier :kekw:
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well but move would be on the other hand
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> our ddnet rip off has aim assist lol
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bitcoin got back to 40.000 there goes my hopes for normal gpu prices
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> imagine using bitcoin
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> you just tap other's avatar to auto hook. and hook aim will change angle to snap to a hookable surface if it is right at the edge of an unhookable surface.
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I feel like switch players will get banned on noby fng guaranteed
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, following people is still quite hard with the new serverlist, I wonder if we can do anything about that
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 shareable server links
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the server browser can have a extra button
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "share server link in chat"
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> joining should require confirmation
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it should be heavily rate limited
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, how would you click the link tho?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet would provide the functionality
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a special packet
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not an actual link
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just something u can click
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That part is easy, I was more thinking UX
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe add a new tab
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the esc menu
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We dont have a cursor while playing to click with
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to see shared servers
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by people
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its not intrusive in the chat
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and can be easily ignored
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by non interested people
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we had accounts we could do parties. Everyone follows the party leader
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could do that already
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> parties dont need accounts
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well it would only last a single server
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at this point it would be easier to just join a team
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and make a command
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /flw <ip>
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /accept
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Minecraft flashbacks.
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it amusing you add a dot to all sentences
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The server dictating the next ip to contact is dangerous
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its just me maybe
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Habit
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually this could work
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> flw would send a netmsg to all clients in the team, accept would be a clientside command
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> accept wouldnt even be a command actually, just a popup
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Fän lol searching about people who add full stops on instant messaging apps i found this https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2015/dec/09/science-has-spoken-ending-a-text-with-a-full-stop-makes-you-a-monster
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the internet is crazy
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh no
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> “send nudes.”
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Linguist reveals why the punctuation mark is making you look 'passive aggressive'
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye thats what i felt
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about ppl who add dots in msges
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen does it sometimes too :monkalaugh:
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Just looks better in certain scenences, no?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Just looks better in certain sentences no?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not for me xD
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Just looks better in certain sentences, no?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Surely does for me
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i specially get nervous when ppl say
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No.
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your opinion is invalid Ryozuki.
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if they angry or smth
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i know ur on mobile cuz u capitalize ur text
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> leeks
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can actually tell exactly which device I'm on at all times
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My ipad will turn :P into 😛
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Tell me which device I'm on? 😐
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur probs on mobile
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We havent known you long enough yet @Fän
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Dang
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Good ol' MacBook Pro with US-based keyboard (I hate it)
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if learath is on pc he is probs on gentoo or complaining about systemd arch
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The keyboard or the macbook or both?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> The keyboard
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> the macbook is ok, but 60hz really sucks
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dont get me started on systemd :PaimonAngeryWOKE:
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/60dce35c8ed8b373e421bd92/3x.gif
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 😆
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it the butterfly switches that annoy you or the layout?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today ill get my ryzen 5600x, my rust programs will compile faster :monkalaugh:
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I'm EU-based (surprise surprise), and it's a US keyboard.
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> See why I'm annoyed yet?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had to get the damn keyboard replaced 5 times because the butterfly switches are awful
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what did you have?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ryzen 2600
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bruh xd
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that is surely old
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> lol
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works wonders tho
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> switch to am5 kekw
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It's a great entry CPU for sure
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2600 came out in 2018
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not that old
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> boo ddr5 booo
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I love US keyboards. Though I also just replace all accented characters with non accented ones. Makes me look uneducated but whatever, I'd rather have {}[]\`~ easily accessible :P
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I code on QWERTZ keyboard, but my MacBook is QWERTY.
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I always need to get used to whatever keyboard I'm working on at that moment
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> And don't even get me started about how "@" is ctrl + l on the macbook
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> And don't even get me started about how "@" is ctrl + l on the macbook (??????)
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> And don't even get me started about how "@" is ctrl + L on the macbook (??????)
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have karabiner on my mac so I can make the keymap match my desktop keyboard
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you tried just remapping a bit?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Meh
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm @ is shift 2 for me
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> alt gr 2
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My huge issue here is at uni, the computers all have italian keyboards
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🤌
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Makes me code at snail pace. I look like an old man trying to find keys
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Also let's not talk about the useless touch bar at the top which is really only useful for emojis (which aren't even useful)
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I miss my physical f keys and esc
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I can't even ctrl + f5 to reload cache.
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Having a touch esc is so annoying in emacs and vim
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mapped esc to `
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> your ESC key is touch? o.O
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah the shitty butterfly keyboard also came with that
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> https://gyazo.com/b483eb2d1a51f2c9d73500c829bdebd2
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/893487375429300264/20211001_151937.jpg
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> this is what my keyboard looks like
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> this is what my touch bar looks like
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Though this is a M1 macbook
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah touch esc was such a horrible idea they changed it the next gen, they also replaced the horrible butterfly switches
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> maybe older mac's have touch ESC
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> oh yeah
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I can imagine how that is awful
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, if you have an m1 mac can you check if ddnet works there?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> makes you write spaghetti code :monkalaugh:
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> This M1 Macbook Pro is the first Apple device I bought
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> This M1 Macbook Pro is the first Apple device I bought, ever
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that's why I was so surprised this is only 60hz
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 👌
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> anyway yes I can check
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> let's see lol
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like the idea of M1 a lot. Hopefully other vendors will get on the hybrid core trend soon
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> for some reason i read iMac there
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> works fine on m1
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great \\○/ don't need to bother with an arm build
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People wouldn’t be able to join if the filter is set up as I think it is
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> They can't as of right now
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> again, easy to implement once the new stuff arrives in frankfurt
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So registering on the 0.7 master would be wrong
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, 0.7 can be verified just by a refresh of the server list, because the serverinfo requests uses tokens already
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And 0.7 still pings every server manually
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Ive previously asked this question, but had to unfortunalty leave before i could read the answers... basically i know a way to bypass the "maximum reconnect" attempts, and have been using it when i want to get into a server that is. Its a nice thing, but at the same time if its a security risk, its better that it gets patched
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt you are actually bypassing the limit
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless you are changing ips

22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Pak I think there's no limit to reconnect attempts, the server just bans if you reconnect too fast
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you still think you've found a bug, feel free to PM Learath2 or me 🙂
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Fän do you have filters for existing UDP games?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (sorry for all the protocol replacement talk, I'm sure you're getting annoyed at it already given that you deployed filters for the current protocol)
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which protocol would we have to imitate to get the best DoS provider coverage?

23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (why isalnum can segfault with glibc)
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> localization makes everything worse
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the programmer
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the users also don't enjoy the increased complexity leading to bugs and crashes
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my parents wouldn't enjoy english software
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, it can be a requirement, but sometimes it's overused
