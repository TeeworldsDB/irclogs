00:03 <@deen> most mistakes in maps cause segfaults in clients
00:04 <@deen> I fuzzed the map loading stuff once and had crashes everywhere
00:05 <@deen> But it was all read-accessat least...
00:07 <@heinrich5991> there are no bounds checks
00:07 <@deen> exactly
00:07 <@heinrich5991> (I noticed that when looking at the code for writing my own library ^^)
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <jao> as a mod you can still see ips of banned people in rcon, idk if this is wanted
23:23 <+Socialdarwinist> Of course it is wanted, for the purpose of seeing if a banned guy is coming back with a related IP.
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but you can't see ips of people
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <jao> from my understanding admins wanted to completely hide ips from mods
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> if i understand correctly?
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <jao> ye that too
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <jao> you cant see ips without banning people
23:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup, so it should be hidden as well
23:25 <+Socialdarwinist> But say a mod has banned two times and wants to see if that is the same one and if one should look if he comes back.
23:25 < ddnet-discord> <jao> and how do you look if an ip comes back?
23:26 <+Socialdarwinist> Whois services.
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <jao> for that you need to acess the ip
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Topic has already been discussed i guess
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> before commit that change
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so, the way that you can check ip of player as a MODERATOR
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> should be fixed as well
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <jao> only downside is that you dont know who to unban if you banned a lot people
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <jao> maybe it should say the name of banned person instead
23:28 <+Socialdarwinist> Maybe as a separate command
23:28 <+Socialdarwinist> bans for admins, bannednames for mods or so
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> unban only works with ip
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or store both
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> not only
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can unban by ID
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> only
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> as well
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> u cant
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you changed that?
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> please think it for a moment..
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> why?
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ids are given when a player connects
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you are wrong
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> im correct
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> bans
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> in rcon
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> uban<id> of ban
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ban <id> , bans the ip of that guy
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòâ
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that doesnt work nor exist
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> try
23:30 <+Socialdarwinist> But the unban command does not take IPs as argument.
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and it doesnt makes sense
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it does
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ryo try byt urself
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know what im syaing
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you know that if u ban a player, and another joins, this one will fill that id?
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> if it doesn't work on ddnet
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ids arent user for bans at all
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then, they changed iot.
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> only when you ban, but that ban issues to the ip
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> BUT, BANS HAS THEIR OWN
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ID
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> please think it..
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> what the hell man D:
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <jao> ye bans have ids
23:31 <+Socialdarwinist> Also, I do not see the bad of seeing IPs of *banned* people. Banned people are regularly responsible for having their IP exposed thus.
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and you can unban by ID
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Socialdarwinist, it is hidden for moderators only
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> unban    Unban ip/banlist entry unban_range    Unban ip range unban_all    Unban all entries
23:32 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> just think it programatically
23:32 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ur arg doesnt make sense
23:32 < ddnet-discord> <jao> you can ban by mistake or a bad mod just bans randomly to get someones ip
23:32 <+Socialdarwinist> Why do you have bad mods?
23:32 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you can't unban by id
23:33 < ddnet-discord> <jao> because mods are not our rl friends
23:33 <+Socialdarwinist> For me it looks like you are fiddling to hide befallen administrative mistakes.
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <jao> im not saying that there are bad mods, but anyone is capable of doing stupid stuff
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander see, the ban command accepts id, because the player is connected and it has a ip attached to it, so the server find the matching ip for that id and bans that ip
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/e5u0Rq7i51251
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ryozuki
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> cpp class CServerBan : public CNetBan {     class CServer *m_pServer;      template<class T> int BanExt(T *pBanPool, const typename T::CDataType *pData, int Seconds, const char *pReason);  public:     class CServer *Server() const { return m_pServer; }      void InitServerBan(class IConsole *pConsole, class IStorage *pStorage, class CServer *pServer);      virtual int BanAddr(const NETADDR *pAddr, int Seconds, const char

23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòâ
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats not an id
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its an index
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> from a list
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <jao> @Savander dont post ppls ips here lol
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't care
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> at this moment
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i was right anyway
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> say what you want, youi can unban guy by ID
23:35 <+Socialdarwinist> I do not know the exact rationale why the DDNet wanted to hide IPs completely. For me, a reason would be data privacy. Instead of ‚Äústatus‚Äù, a command for seeing the IP of a specific player is needed. It may have a threshold, so the ominous bad moderators can only request a limited number of IPs.
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats not an id :P
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> say what you want, its uniq ID
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> of ban
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can have index 0 twice
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so it's id
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> index isnt a id
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's just namind
23:36 <+Socialdarwinist> Are you just fighting about words?
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> m_Players[INDEX].m_ID
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> see the diference
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> .. . .
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ok, you are right.
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Be smarter, because its not "ID" but "INDEX" lol
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> imagine you ban someone, and there are already 10 bans, that player has a id of 5, you ban him, his ban gets indexed as 11 and then as you said, "you can ban by id", you would do unban 5, which is wrong
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats what i want to express
23:39 <+Socialdarwinist> Both are IDs, just different kinds of IDs.
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they arent ids....
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> the index is a index
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ID are uniq
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> index is uniq, id is uniq
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can't have two the same index in one table
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it would be stupid
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well, you don't want to understand it even when i stated it clearly so idc anymore
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and not works
23:40 <+Socialdarwinist> What does ‚Äúunique‚Äù mean in your understanding? The IDs are of course unique only for a limited time.
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> player id in teeworlds, can't be use twice. right?
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you joined, you have your own ID for a limited time
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> nobody else will have it
23:41 <+Socialdarwinist> So they are IDs.
23:42 <+Socialdarwinist> And the numbers in the ban lists are also IDs.
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yeah
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes, what's your point?
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and ids are also a programming lang
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Irvine Dataflow (Id) is a general-purpose parallel programming language
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :))))
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I said that
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> im jk of this hilarious thing
23:43 < ddnet-discord> <jao> so hide ips if you ban people and display name instead
23:43 <+Socialdarwinist> The point is that your actual quibble is that the moderators need to get the distinction explained so they do not make mistakes.
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i guess
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you made a mistake, I didn't say anything like that
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i just explained, that the discussed this already
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> a month or more ago
23:47 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we should just revert the hide ips patch
