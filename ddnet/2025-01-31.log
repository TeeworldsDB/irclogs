00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The Clipboard API sounds interesting. If we can listen to print key on windows, we could add screenshot support😂
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sad to say it tho
00:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2025 and windows didn't find a solution
00:11 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> @chillerdragon bro please give me mod on your solofng save server, there are all time stupid russian kids with cheats
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> You should not override print screen in principle
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> It’s a key with clearly defined behavior, users don’t want screenshots duplicated in their ddnet folder every time you press screenshot
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> It’s a key with clearly defined behavior, users don’t want screenshots duplicated in their ddnet folder every time they press print screen or any derivative
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Plus, ingame screenshot mechanism isn’t needed imo
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Steam and basically every OS already implement it
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> Are you talking about the fullscreen thing?
00:17 < bridge> <chairn> uh ? always worked for me
00:19 < bridge> <louis> doesnt work on some fullsxreen modes for me
00:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Most of them are not very dangerous even with cheats I could get them killed easily.
00:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
00:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yes some kind of anti bot system is on my todo. What is your in game name?
00:24 < bridge> <zhn> its Nagi01
00:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> a
00:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The hooker
00:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes nagi find me in game tomorrow and I will whisper you some rcon :)
00:25 < bridge> <zhn> needed,
00:25 < bridge> <zhn> needed.
00:26 < bridge> <totar> steam screenshots are terrible quality
00:26 < bridge> <totar> OS screenshot does not work correctly in fullscreen
00:32 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> my in-game name is Nagi01 {LAN}
00:36 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> see you tommorow 😄
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> No, *Windows* screenshot does not work correctly in fullscreen
00:43 < bridge> <totar> I believe windows is an OS
00:44 < bridge> <Ewan> > OS screenshot does not work correctly in fullscreen
00:44 < bridge> <Ewan> what is someone supposed to take away from this except for the broader OS screenshot mechanism is broken
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not, it's a windows exclusive issue
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and i dont want to argue about semantics
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> https://tenor.com/view/milk-in-your-face-splash-milk-face-protein-gif-16842713
00:45 < bridge> <totar> so your suggested solution is to not use windows if you would like good screenshots?
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it was more a way of saying windows sucks
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> and they are at fault for this bug
00:46 < bridge> <totar> yes it only supports 99% of the playerbase, we should just ignore it
00:46 < bridge> <totar> I agree
00:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> to not use windows if you would like good ~~screenshots~~
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> what are you reading exactly
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> does this sound like i agree with that
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> does this sound like i agree with what you're saying
00:48 < bridge> <totar> ingame screenshot solution is not needed because we can ignore windows users
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as devs continue to accommodate windows bugs, it gives windows devs an excuse to not fix it
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> and there really are other ways of screenshotting
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> im not even necessarily opposed to the ingame screenshot thing having remembered how broken it is on windows, but it still shouldn't need to exist in principle
00:49 < bridge> <totar> yeah I agree the microsoft devs will fix it
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> well
00:49 < bridge> <totar> so it's not needed as I said
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought you were being sarcastic
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> for an open source project whose funding & administration is detached from almost all of their player base
00:50 < bridge> <totar> no obviously I hate windows players they don't deserve good screenshots
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> what a joke
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> this is really funny
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1334674874547048518/IMG_7526.jpg?ex=679d6457&is=679c12d7&hm=955b8ec5c71ad92a85c73cf56643da3a27ff021a7be03d5d13dc0f9ddc662416&

01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> apparently this is another, different gamescope bug <https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1593>
01:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this looks sick af tho WHAT
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i don’t like that you can pick out parts of my inbox in that screenshot tho
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> the other screenshot
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ima delete

01:10 < bridge> <Ewan> epilepsy warning
01:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it might just be wrong color format
01:15 < bridge> <zhn> ofc microsoft will hop on fixing their shitboat after getting 7 angry messages from russian kids that can't even use english properly
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t think that’s really gonna happen
01:15 < bridge> <zhn> ppl will just stick to windowed mode after this xd
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> many do
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> this problem has existed a long time
01:16 < bridge> <zhn> none of ppl i know uses windowed mode, except those who use weird big screens
02:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> is this in nightly now?
02:51 < bridge> <pioooooo> I guess it is, my version is 19.0-20250130
02:54 < bridge> <pioooooo> I experienced weird behavior with antiping on. Sometimes  when I hook others, the other tee stuck midair and don't move at all
02:55 < bridge> <pioooooo> Not happening with antiping off tho
02:55 < bridge> <pioooooo> Haven't seen this behavior in previous versions so I assume it's caused by this antiping update
03:13 < bridge> <kebscs> this is patch for behaviour youre describing
03:15 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe nightly didnt update with this yet
03:21 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh that's good to know
08:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> good morning sdl3 enjoyers and others
08:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think ubuntu and debian dont have sdl3 either
08:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its a bit too early
08:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> on ubuntu its on the unreleased plucky
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> got my sdl3 package
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ls /usr/lib64/libSDL3*

08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> the ai features seem unobtrusive
08:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> I recommend just turning it off - keeps your brain sane
08:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> How is it working on nix? Given their LSP servers shouldn't work without some ld magic
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> rust lsp worked fine out of the box on mac

09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there a way to see the current checkpoint?
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> seemed laggy on linux
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> nixos* my guess is gpu related
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> typical issue on my setup
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> nvidia + hyprland + nixos is a very nasty combo

09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > SDL_vulkan.h
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions() no longer takes a window parameter, and no longer makes the app allocate query/allocate space for the result, instead returning a static const internal string.
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr() now returns SDL_FunctionPointer instead of void *, and should be cast to PFN_vkGetInstanceProcAddr.
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface() now takes a VkAllocationCallbacks pointer as its third parameter. If you don't have an allocator to supply, pass a NULL here to use the system default allocator (SDL2 always used the system default allocator here).
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize() has been removed. SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels() can be used in its place.
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > SDL_vulkanInstance and SDL_vulkanSurface have been removed. They were for compatibility with Tizen, who had built their own Vulkan interface into SDL2, but these apps will need changes for the SDL3 API if they are upgraded anyhow.
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice stuff iguess
09:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> Thats kinda hot!
09:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
09:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> How is getting sdl3 to work going so far?
09:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> Getwindowsizeinpixels is a weird replacement for getdrawablesize
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf is going on here
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i feel like having lags/prediction bugs on localhost
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a tiny ass map i am on latest ddnet master server and client
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the debug graphs show nothing im at a stable 666 frames
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sometimes i teleport like 2 tiles wtf
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no idea how to debug this, time to buy a new pc
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe its the SDL3? xd
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg i have big regrets updating my system
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @jsaurusrex ^ maybe still not fixed with anti ping?
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks sdl3 now manages audio samples internally
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> SDL3 now manages the removed samples field; apps that want more control over device latency and throughput can force a newly-opened device's sample count with the SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_SAMPLE_FRAMES hint, but most apps should not risk messing with the defaults. The other SDL2 SDL_AudioSpec fields aren't relevant anymore.
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> m_MaxFrames = FormatOut.samples * 2;
10:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk what to put here xd
10:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> samples doesnt exist
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That sounds like a problem
10:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1334821812059508876/image.png?ex=679ded2f&is=679c9baf&hm=349ef239bc093022ec8db85465e08e322c97555cbc003ca7de44f29845dfebce&
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since we use a custom mixer
10:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> do we need the custom mixer
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I also dunno what exactly they mean with managing internally
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> the callback has this additional field tho
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> , int TotalAmount
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> could this be the samples
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk much audio
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So they just changed the buffer size or smth
10:48 < ChillerDragon> anyone else on arch can reproduce ddnet client having stutters?
10:48 < ChillerDragon> ``CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.``
10:49 < ChillerDragon> ``Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:``
10:49 < ChillerDragon> ``/home/chiller/Desktop/git/ddnet/AVCODEC_INCLUDEDIR``
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Turn off anti ping
10:49 < ChillerDragon> ``   used as include directory in directory /home/chiller/Desktop/git/ddnet``
10:49 < ChillerDragon> never seen that before
10:49 < ChillerDragon> i never turned anti pin gon
10:49 < bridge> <totar> antiping should not affect your own camera
10:49 < bridge> <totar> it's not possible
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1334822945134088203/image.png?ex=679dee3d&is=679c9cbd&hm=b848dd7a514c73f5688839656d6c917a1757b75cee99fdad850896842d2522c0&
10:50 < ChillerDragon> omg i cant see ryos image
10:50 < ChillerDragon> i had to uninstall firefox trying to downgrade sdl
10:50 < ChillerDragon> and uninstall half of gnome
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do we mix ourselves?
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:50 < ChillerDragon> but now ddnet wont fakin compile anymore omg i hate shit like this
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not let sdl do it
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bcs there is no library that can mix like tw wants it
10:51 < ChillerDragon> the error was coming from ffmpeg not being installed hmm i assumed our cmake throws a nicer error in that case
10:51 < ChillerDragon> something like "please install ffmpeg"
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The most useful mess ffmpeg xd
10:53 < ChillerDragon> dood yes
10:53 < ChillerDragon> sdl depends on ffmpeg
10:53 < ChillerDragon> ffmpeg depends on sdl
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller just use website built
10:53 < ChillerDragon> firefox depends on ffmpeg
10:53 < ChillerDragon> sdl depends on firefox
10:53 < ChillerDragon> i managed to compile!
10:53 < ChillerDragon> i actually think its fixed
10:53 < ChillerDragon> but my arch is in a super cursed state xd
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf xdd
10:53 < ChillerDragon> oh thats fucked
10:54 < ChillerDragon> sdl2-compat rly seems to be the issue
10:54 < ChillerDragon> gotta upgrade to sdl3 asap xd
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> OK. You vs ryo
10:54 < ChillerDragon> ok maybe sdl3 is the issue not the compat layer
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gl dealing with the backward gang
10:55 < ChillerDragon> apparently its used in CS2 so it should have a trillion users already battle testing it
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
10:55 < ChillerDragon> it isnt?
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probably only on Linux
10:56 < ChillerDragon> 4min fng gaming without a single stutter
10:56 < ChillerDragon> vs every few seconds
10:56 < ChillerDragon> test results are final
10:56 < ChillerDragon> sdl2-compat breaks ddnet on my machine :c
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just install the real sdl2
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do you want the compat version
10:57 < ChillerDragon> i did install aur/sdl2 now
10:57 < ChillerDragon> arch replaced sdl2 with sdl2-compat
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's evil xd
10:57 < ChillerDragon> well its arch
10:57 < ChillerDragon> they wanna serve useres with the latest and greatest sdl3 gaming xp
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but I want to see the apps already upgraded
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But one q.
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did the lags happen directly
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or after time
10:59 < ChillerDragon> i upgraded yesterday night
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In game
10:59 < ChillerDragon> today this morning i was testing a server thing
10:59 < ChillerDragon> i wasnt even playing
10:59 < ChillerDragon> and i could notice instantly that something was off
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But directly after game started
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok
10:59 < ChillerDragon> define directly?
10:59 < ChillerDragon> less than a minute for sure
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Okok
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> All I needed to know. Bye
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gm sdl3 enjoyers (sent from my firefox)
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a draft
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wonder if i should report something to the sdl2-compat repo but sounds like work
11:12 < bridge> <chairn> don't use AV512, you'll kill performance due to DVFS
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> wat is DVFS
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a cpu with avx512
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D
11:14 < bridge> <chairn> it consumes too much power, so they had to lower the frequency for several milliseconds after each avx512 instruction
11:14 < bridge> <chairn> so unless you have a million of them in a row, it's not worth it
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-avx512/6
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> well the avx512 is a sdl3 option
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are some assembly routines in sdl and i guess this enabled them to use that
11:16 < bridge> <chairn> erf, wikichip is offline, but they had a nice graph that shows cpu frequency depending on executed SIMD instruction
11:16 < bridge> <chairn> i mean, if you only have few avx512 instruction, it will slow down the rest of the program. It's interesting only if you're doing blas or ai thingie with huge dataset
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> or av1
11:18 < bridge> <chairn> avx and avx2 also reduces cpu frequency, but way less
11:19 < bridge> <chairn> if wikichip comes back online, i'll send you the table they had
11:19 < ChillerDragon> interesting self compiled sdl2-compat is smooth
11:19 < ChillerDragon> so annoying to test that shit
11:19 < ChillerDragon> gotta uninstall firefox then ffmpeg then reinstall ffmpeg then build ddnet xd
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> switch to gentoo
11:19 < ChillerDragon> ryoqwo
11:20 < ChillerDragon> im sure its worse
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> in gentoo they test stuff
11:20 < ChillerDragon> sdl2-compat with ddnet lag spikes?
11:20 < ChillerDragon> yea im sure they test that
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> we got no sdl2 compat
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> we got sdl2
11:20 < ChillerDragon> oldschool
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder why they removed sdl2
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have sdl2 and sdl3
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> in my system
11:21 < ChillerDragon> i have SDL1 SDL2 sdl2-compat and SDL3
11:22 < ChillerDragon> gentoo so outdated for using SDL2 
11:22 < ChillerDragon> it hasnt been updated since yesterday
11:22 < ChillerDragon> dead software
11:22 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2
11:22 < ChillerDragon> bleeding edge sdl2-compat has been updated 7 hours ago
11:22 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl2-compat
11:23 < ChillerDragon> well i really hope arch team fixes that shit
11:23 < ChillerDragon> i will just not update my hand massages system for a while so i can do proper gaming
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I didn't have ryo on my who adds SDL3 support bingo card, ngl
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks tbh i probs cant finish it all myself
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1: idk how ime works
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2: i barely know how audio mixing works, but i think i got it working
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem is i cant test until i got it to compile and that requires either removing some features i dont know like ime or idk
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> SDL_SysWMmsg got entirely removed
12:14 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> is it good?
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> better than without xd
12:16 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> have an ryzen 7 9800x3d
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whaaat
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> give to me
12:19 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> react to my pull request then hehe

12:21 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> good I checked then :justatest:
12:21 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> or you mean I created it at the wrong place?
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Nope you did right in creating an issue
12:25 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> alr :D
12:26 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> I would want it to be asigned to me if its possible bdw :D
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok now give 9800x3d

14:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you got more permissions in ddnet repo? 0_o
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> promotion
14:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's time to merge more 0.7 prs :lol:
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> We decided to just let him turn ddnet into 0.7
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Resistance is futile
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i can cose issues and assign labels^^
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> road to #666 again #wontfix
14:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> huuge
14:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pro
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think he deserves being a real ddnet member
14:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ^
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Which does not imply i like his prs
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
14:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Honestly I was surprised when opened org members first time and didn't find chiller there xd
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> most are private to you anyway
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes default is private
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and most are pretty inactive tbh
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had to click a shit ton of buttons to flex org memberships 
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1738331858.png
14:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just make a bash script for it
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imo they should be public by default nobody knows they are private and then people just dont know who to contact
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i think i disagree with heinrich too much to get merge rights
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can guess who is public by looking who merged in past
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i disagree with everyone
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so convienient
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf we don't ever merge our own prs really
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but other prs
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the merger always has merge rights
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon2 wants to merge a pull request
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> But you also have very different goals. You'd have to be brainwashed first
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon2
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a thing
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar i would never do such shenanigans
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1738332206.png
15:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> The most chillerdragon thing I've seen in 2025
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use a fake account to merge to upstream projects quite often. bcs then i can act like i am some russian guy that barely speaks english and they don't ask so many questions
15:04 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> ._.
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is some advanced schizophrenia
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> interesting technique jupstar
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i should try opening prs with my heinrich9551 account and see if they get merged faster
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Could work
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> RoB1t
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good one
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> Temu robyte
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think most devs are more lenient to new devs
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> bad opsec

15:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> real
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat i had a idea involving IRs
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> since the llvm C api in c is a bit meh to build around and use in rust my idea is to make a custom IR that looks like llvm IR completly in rust and make a builder api in rust that feels good to use
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and prove a translation to llvm ir
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> and provide a translation to llvm ir
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> RustIR
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> struct Drop0;
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> impl Drop for Drop0 {
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki>     fn drop(&mut self) {
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki>         print!("0");
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> fn main() {
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>     {
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>         let _ = &Drop0;
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>         print!("1");
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>     {
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>         _ = &Drop0;
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>         print!("1");
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks what does this print
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> no running localy
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does that compile? xddd
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then probs 1001
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is the second a pattern match or smth
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or the lifetime of Drop0 is simply static or smth
15:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> Shouldn't it be 1010 or 1100 ?
15:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> I mean 1 is printed, then the block ends and it calls self, thus printing 0
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> its 1001
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
15:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> Damn
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> let is dropped at end, the _ without let is a assignemt, its dropped at end of thestatement
15:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> I suck at rust confirmed
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah this is obscure
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> honestly didn't even know you could use _ even for that xd
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> second is a destructiruing assignment
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> so yeah pattern match
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i knew xd
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so all my let `_ = result;` could simply be `_ = result`?
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so all my `let _ = result;` could simply be `_ = result`?
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> but with second its instantly dropped
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> best placeholder
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> with first u get temporary lifetime extension
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i do that w tuples all the time
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> to end of scope
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> so with the _ = result u may get some borrow checking errors maybe
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> or not
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> depends on context
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> In both cases, since we don't assign the Drop0 instance to a variable, it is a temporary.
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> In let statements, temporary lifetime extension takes place and extends the temporary's lifetime until the end of the block, there it is dropped. So 1 is printed first, and then the Drop0 is dropped and 0 is printed.
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> In assignments, however (_ =  is a destructuring assignment expression), there is no temporary lifetime extension, and temporaries are dropped at the end of the statement. So, 0 is printed first then 1.
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> This behavior also means that if we would try to use the value after the assignment, the compiler will disallow this with a borrow checker error, as the value was already dropped.
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without the let?
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> No
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> bruv
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft we talkign about _ without let
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> I see that
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> iksde
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t often need to create smth and never assign it
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is usually also better 😄
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i just make a method that doesn’t take self in that case lol
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> for one-offs
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean everyone does so idk why im even talking about this
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> procrastinating work
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> grg
16:18 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> what does the `Stroke` mean in function `ExecuteLineStroked` ? Is it something related to button press&release
16:19 < bridge> <zhn> wdym assignment if there's no mutable variable with such ident in the scope
16:19 < bridge> <zhn> how does it work wtf
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @gerdoe its a pattern match
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> (_ =  is a destructuring assignment expression)
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but u can doit
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Isn't that the delayed execution thing
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I could swear I saw that from you a while ago xd
16:26 < bridge> <robyt3> The `Stroke` refers to whether the action is being pressed or released, see `ExecuteLine` which just presses and releases immediately. This is so commands that don't start with `+` are repeated while the action is being pressed.

16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks ur ethos
16:31 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> in fact i want to make a button similar to that bind wheel, but instead of selecting, sliding to different directions for commands
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/30/Rust-1.84.1.html
16:32 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean a touch button?
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> Fix ICE 132920 in duplicate-crate diagnostics.
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Fix errors for overlapping impls in incremental rebuilds.
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Fix slow compilation related to the next-generation trait solver.
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Fix debuginfo when LLVM's location discriminator value limit is exceeded.
16:32 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> yes
16:33 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> The switch weapon button in early version, which can slide to switch next & prev weapon is kinda cool
16:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be relatively easy with the current button code, in `OnUpdate` the `m_AccumulatedDelta` variable will be the change in position touch (should be set to zero after using)
16:35 < bridge> <robyt3> You just need to check if a sufficiently large movement in the same direction was made, then check which direction would correspond to that
16:35 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok
16:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be relatively easy with the current button code, in `OnUpdate` the `m_AccumulatedDelta` variable will be the change in touch position (should be set to zero after using)
