11:04 < Hamid_Jigool> hey there
11:04 < Hamid_Jigool> hi my friends
11:05 < Hamid_Jigool> anybody can compile DDNet-Sql_server for me? i have linux 64bit in my PC but my Virtual Server is 32bit ... i can just compile 64bit...please compile x84bit(32bit) Server_Sql for me
11:05 < Hamid_Jigool> pleasssssseeee
11:06 < Hamid_Jigool> :-(
11:14 < masoudd> Why can't you compile it?
11:19 < Hamid_Jigool> i can
11:19 < Hamid_Jigool> but my linux in home PC is 64bit
11:19 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna 32bit
11:22 < masoudd> If you don't have a 32bit machine to run it on then you don't need it. if you have a 32bit machine then you can compile it
11:24 < Hamid_Jigool> my VPS is 32bit but dont have internet access.. so i cant use this command "sudo apt-get install libboost-dev"
11:24 < Hamid_Jigool> so i cant compile that
11:24 < Hamid_Jigool> are you understand?
11:25 < masoudd> What's the point of a server without any internet connection?
11:25 < Hamid_Jigool> point is "Lan - Anti DDos"
11:25 < masoudd> What?
11:26 < Hamid_Jigool> my server is in Lan Mode... Anti DDos... Attack... trafick
11:26 < masoudd> How do you even connect to that VPS then
11:27 < Hamid_Jigool> do you know what is DDos?
11:27 < masoudd> I do. But disconnecting from the internet doesn't really solve it. If anything it means you are completely offline
11:27 < masoudd> It means the DDosers won
11:28 < Hamid_Jigool> no its intranet (just my people in my country can joint it)
11:28 < Hamid_Jigool> you know?
11:28 < masoudd> Oh
11:28 < masoudd> What is the distro you are using on your VPS?
11:29 < Hamid_Jigool> whats mean of distro? :D
11:29 < masoudd> debian/ubuntu/centos?
11:29 < Hamid_Jigool> Ubuntu 150.1
11:29 < Hamid_Jigool> Ubuntu 15.1
11:29 < Hamid_Jigool> i have debian too
11:29 < Hamid_Jigool> ubuntu and debian
11:30 < masoudd> http://mirror.iranserver.com/ubuntu/
11:30 < masoudd> change your repo to this one
11:30 < Hamid_Jigool> realy? oh my god
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> thanks
11:31 < masoudd> نوکرم
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> لول
11:31 <@EastByte> can he access that server from intranet?
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> =))
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> my friend solve my problem
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> thanks all
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> thank you masoudd
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
11:31 < masoudd> EastByte: it resolves to 185.4.28.21 which is in Iran
11:32 < Hamid_Jigool> i love you baby D:
11:32 < masoudd> :)
11:32 <@EastByte> I wonder how such a whole-country intranet works
11:33 < masoudd> Me too. I guess they would have to fuck with the dns to resolve to a private ip
11:34 < masoudd> Hamid_Jigool: what does   host mirror.iranserver.com    return?
14:22 < Hamid_Jigool> hi again my friends
14:23 < Hamid_Jigool> i run DDNet Sql Server on my server and i set sv_sql_ip other server ip... and show me error can not connect to mysql on localhost (111)
14:23 < Hamid_Jigool> whats mean of that?
14:23 < Hamid_Jigool> i dont wanna connect to localhost
14:24 < Hamid_Jigool> but it connect to localhost
14:24 < Hamid_Jigool> !
14:24 < Hamid_Jigool> pleas help me
14:24 <@EastByte> that's strange
14:25 <@EastByte> can you show me your configuration file?
14:25 < Hamid_Jigool> what? please explain that for me
14:25 < Hamid_Jigool> yee
14:25 < Hamid_Jigool> wait
14:26 < Hamid_Jigool> just sql commands?
14:26 < Hamid_Jigool> or all?
14:26 <@EastByte> paste the whole config somewhere (pastebin e.g.)
14:26 < Hamid_Jigool> ok
14:31 < Hamid_Jigool> http://pastebin.com/WRCUJMQQ
14:31 < Hamid_Jigool> hear you are
14:31 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
14:35 <@EastByte> hm that error message seems to appear independently from the configured address
14:36 <@EastByte> are you sure the database is running?
14:39 < Hamid_Jigool> ye
14:39 < Hamid_Jigool> its runnig on domain "perisiants.ir"
14:39 < Hamid_Jigool> exuse me persiants.ir
14:40 <@EastByte> did you configure the database to allow connections from remote hosts?
14:40 < Hamid_Jigool> no
14:41 <@EastByte> afaik mysql/mariadb doesn't allow connection from outside by default (security reasons)
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> ommm
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> i must unistall mariadb
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> ha?
14:41 <@EastByte> no, reconfiguration
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> how?
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> ok
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> google
14:41 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
14:41 <@EastByte> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8348506/grant-remote-access-of-mysql-database-from-any-ip-address
14:42 <@EastByte> or something
14:43 <@EastByte> deen: why does mysql show "Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' (111)" when connecting to a remote ip address?
14:47 < Hamid_Jigool> let me explain that
14:47 < Hamid_Jigool> i have a Windows Server
14:47 < Hamid_Jigool> so i need to linux
14:47 < Hamid_Jigool> i downloaded VmWare
14:47 < Hamid_Jigool> and install Ubuntu on it
14:48 <@EastByte> nah, mysql should just run fine on windows
14:48 < Hamid_Jigool> i have Wamp Server on my windows
14:48 < Hamid_Jigool> and i wannat connect my VmWare Linux on windows
14:48 < Hamid_Jigool> but it show me that error
14:49 < Hamid_Jigool> then i have to connect it ro other host
14:49 < Hamid_Jigool> but show me this error again
14:50 <@EastByte> can you even reach windows from inside the vm?
14:50 < Hamid_Jigool> so i have MySql on my Wamp Server on Windows
14:50 < Hamid_Jigool> a windows that a linux install inside it
14:50 < Hamid_Jigool> you know?
14:50 <@EastByte> yes
14:51 < Hamid_Jigool> so how can connect it to wamp server windows?
14:51 <@EastByte> so you want to host a ddnet ranked server on a linux vmware vm inside of a windows host?
14:51 < Hamid_Jigool> yeee... i wanna database be in windows bu files to run be on linux
14:52 < Hamid_Jigool> DDnet(linux inside windows) ----->>>> Conecting to Wamp MySQL in Windows
14:52 <@EastByte> running the database in the linux vm would reduce complexity, why do you want to have it on windows?
14:53 < Hamid_Jigool> so its betted that i run mysql on linux 
14:53 < Hamid_Jigool> ha?
14:53 < Hamid_Jigool> better*
14:53 <@EastByte> well it's easier
14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> i have some runnig software on Wamp Windows .. so its not problem i fix it on linux
14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> thanks
14:56 < Hamid_Jigool> but i dont know why this error show for other ip host again ?
14:56 <@EastByte> I don't know either
14:56 < Hamid_Jigool> DDnet know this address:158.58.186.171 as localhost
14:57 < Hamid_Jigool> for what?
14:57 < Hamid_Jigool> :|
15:05 < IcyFoxy> Q: pong
15:05 < IcyFoxy> Erm, wrong channel
15:06 <@EastByte> since when does Q ping?
16:01 <@deen> EastByte: it should not
16:01 <@deen> EastByte: maybe he's not using the config
16:02 <@EastByte> I tested it locally with any ip address, it always shows localhost
16:03 <@deen> strange, but that error is not generated by our source code is it?
16:03 <@EastByte> nah it's a mysql error
16:03 <@deen> I guess just a bug in the mysql lib
16:04 <@deen> because i am pretty sure other servers than localhost work :P
16:05 <@EastByte> you already proved that on ddnet :p
16:09 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: I think I'm going to go 100% from scratch, re-writing teeworlds in Rust. Clean slate is good, but I'll have a lot of work either way.
16:10 < IcyFoxy> EastByte: Another channel, somone starting with q, ping'd me. :P
16:12 <@EastByte> IcyFoxy: rewrite in rust? Then you should get in touch with heinrich5991 and matricks
16:12 < IcyFoxy> EastByte: These two also rust programmers, aye?
16:13 <@heinrich5991> at least one of them already coded some TW-related stuff in rust :)
16:13 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: Sweet. Protocol? ;)
16:13 <@heinrich5991> datafiles mostly
16:14 <@heinrich5991> huffman decode/encode as well
16:14 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: I started this a long time ago and now updating the code to modern rust and splitting up the single file I had. XD
16:14 <@heinrich5991> what did you code already?
16:14 < IcyFoxy> IIRC the protocol is huffman encoded.
16:14 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:14 < IcyFoxy> I had a basic parser for the packets, really not much.
16:14 <@heinrich5991> but only if the compression flag is set
16:14 < IcyFoxy> ^ In which I'm *currently ignoring* ;)
16:15 <@heinrich5991> yea, I got the code for that part
16:15 < IcyFoxy> Sweet :D
16:15 < IcyFoxy> Github or somewhere?
16:15 <@heinrich5991> nowhere except my computer
16:15 <@heinrich5991> *essentially nowhere
16:15 <@heinrich5991> backups etc.
16:15 < IcyFoxy> Well. I'll be uploading to github somewhat soon, even if just stubby.
16:16 <@heinrich5991> cool
16:17 <@heinrich5991> I could probably also give you my source if you're interested
16:18 < IcyFoxy> In terms of features... Definately want multiple gamemodes, maintain user state (I.e. authentication, and on certain gamemodes, upgrades). map managed tuning zones and event tiles (freeze, deepfreeze, no weapons, etc). chat commands and rcon. 
16:19 <@heinrich5991> maybe you should aim for TW-compatiblity first
16:19 <@heinrich5991> gonna be hard enough
16:19 < IcyFoxy> Oh definately.
16:19 < IcyFoxy> Protocol core first, then an interface to cleanly send the client the appropriate events and then the server side should be able to do anything.
16:20 <@EastByte> I wonder how networking in rust looks like
16:20 < IcyFoxy> Movement / physics would need to be synced obviously.
16:20 < IcyFoxy> EastByte: Really pretty if you use mio.
16:21 < IcyFoxy> Basically an event loop focused for networking and timers.
16:22 < IcyFoxy> So.. Ask mio for a timer to respawn entities, etc. Don't need to keep track of ticks and decrement them every iteration.
16:24 <@EastByte> hmm
16:25 < IcyFoxy> The event loop contains one handle function / callback, in which you centralise the entire execution flow around. Packets and timers wake the thread and at only matches (think switch) decide which code to call.
16:25 < IcyFoxy> Very lightweight
16:26 < IcyFoxy> EastByte: See github for better mio/networkign sample than me talking about event loops... lol
16:30 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: Do you think you'd be able to do all the map management code? Physics, collision, effects of tiles when the player touches them, etc. ?
16:31 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #411: Add DoS protection to server info requests (master...pr_ddnet_serverbrowse_dos_prot) https://git.io/vza1N
16:32 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: smaller info responses? how do they look like?
16:32 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: no player info
16:32 <@EastByte> ah, nice
16:32 < IcyFoxy> I've written a serialisation format for Rust, although I doubt it'll have much advantage for TWs formats.
16:33 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: does it still send the player number?
16:33 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:33 <@EastByte> so that doesn't cause a parsing error client-side?
16:33 <@heinrich5991> no
16:33 <@EastByte> neat
16:34 <@heinrich5991> the client code is bad
16:34 <@heinrich5991> (noticed that a couple of months ago)
16:34 <@deen> maybe it should at least send 1 player that says something like "X players"
16:34 <@deen> because many people filter out empty servers
16:34 <@heinrich5991> as said, it doesn't cause a parsing error
16:34 <@heinrich5991> you get as many players as you send
16:34 <@deen> ah, ok
16:34 <@deen> i misread
16:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: is this for the regular server infos or also 64 player ones?
16:36 <@heinrich5991> good question for the latter one
16:36 <@EastByte> the latter one is only 3 times worse in case of amplification :p
16:36 <@EastByte> 4*
16:37 <@heinrich5991> ah, for 64p info I should just send a high offset
16:38 <@EastByte> well, I guess that would work
16:38 <@heinrich5991> ah nvm
16:38 <@heinrich5991> it's fine for 64p as well
16:38 <@deen> good
16:38 <@deen> it looked fine for me, but i wanted to make sure
16:39 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: ^ Yes / no for you and map/collision/physics?
16:39 <@heinrich5991> uhm. I guess I can do that
16:39 < IcyFoxy> Cool.
16:46 <@EastByte> but isn't that simple gamelogic/math?
16:47 <@EastByte> I mean the code should be pretty similiar to other languages
16:49 < IcyFoxy> Sure. But I'm focusing on making everything generic and easily modable. I could do it myself, but he said he did work with the datafiles.
16:50 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #411: Add DoS protection to server info requests (master...pr_ddnet_serverbrowse_dos_prot) https://git.io/vza1N
16:58 <@EastByte> heinrich5991 or deen: do you know whether it's possible to clone a git repository without loading the whole historie? (so based on a more recent commit)
16:58 <@heinrich5991> --depth=1
16:58 <@EastByte> whaat
16:58 <@EastByte> could you wait a bit before responding
16:59 <@heinrich5991> no. why? ^^
17:00 <@EastByte> nvm^^ it just was unexpected
17:00 <@deen> EastByte: what's the use case? the github zips are pretty quick
17:00 <@EastByte> the use case is to have multiple clones of the teeworlds repository without loading the whole history every time
17:01 <@EastByte> like when using multiple users or a vps
17:01 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: just clone it locally
17:01 <@heinrich5991> uses hardlinks then
17:02 <@EastByte> I think hardlinks are a bad idea
17:02 <@heinrich5991> why?
17:03 <@EastByte> it messes with the filesystem
17:03 <@deen> hardlinks are always fun!
17:03 <@EastByte> I once removed a part of my filesystem from within a container
17:04 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: for readonly files it should be fine
17:04 <@heinrich5991> which is what git does
17:04 <@EastByte> but I still want to be able to create branches and work on stuff
17:04 <@heinrich5991> yes
17:04 <@heinrich5991> do you think a local git clone would deny you this? ^^
17:05 <@EastByte> if it's readonly it will
17:05 <@heinrich5991> the .git/objects thing is readonly
17:05 <@heinrich5991> and hardlinked
17:05 <@EastByte> ah
17:05 <@heinrich5991> it's readonly in every git repository
17:05 <@heinrich5991> *except for packing
17:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: strange, i'm getting a bad response already in the script for http://ddnet.tw/status/
17:05 <@deen> from one of the servers with your serverinfo changes
17:06 <@heinrich5991> cool
17:06 <@deen> 10 is probably too low!
17:06 <@heinrich5991> you said you get one request per second
17:06 <@deen> ?
17:06 <@heinrich5991> oh no
17:06 <@heinrich5991> I determined that from the pcap
17:06 <@deen> yep, but right now it seems higher than 10/second
17:06 <@deen> good that it's runtime-configurable!
17:07 <@heinrich5991> :)
17:07 <@heinrich5991> maybe you're just under attack?
17:07 <@deen> nope
17:07 <@deen> it's just evening and more players coming online
17:08 <@EastByte> I guess we can remove the getinfo firewall ratelimit then
17:08 <@deen> EastByte: we have one?
17:08 <@EastByte> on GER in the firewall panel
17:08 <@EastByte> and currently on chile
17:10 <@deen> not sure, still a good idea to reduce load of the server
17:10 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: isn't objects/ extended once there are new commits pulled?
17:10 <@EastByte> deen: yea, but we could increase the ratelimit
17:11 <@heinrich5991> extended. but only the *files* are hardlinked
17:11 <@EastByte> ah so you explicitly hardlink only what already there
17:11 <@heinrich5991> git does that
17:12 <@heinrich5991> if you git clone a local repository
17:12 <@EastByte> it does hardlinking?
17:12 <@heinrich5991> yes!
17:12 <@EastByte> what?
17:12 <@deen> heinrich5991: hm, no. i think the code is doing something wrong
17:12 <@heinrich5991> k, sorry
17:12 <@heinrich5991> tried to test it
17:12 <@heinrich5991> it worked for me
17:12 <@deen> i tried as well^^
17:13 <@deen> but look usa.ddnet.tw:8321
17:13 <@deen> i set it to 50 requests/second already and still not showing players
17:14 <@deen> same with 500, only works with 1000
17:15 <@deen> and i'm pretty sure we don't get 500 per second
17:15 <@heinrich5991> mh
17:15 <@EastByte> MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND looks pretty static
17:15 <@EastByte> am I looking at the wrong commit?
17:16 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/411/files
17:16 <@EastByte> ah
17:18 <@heinrich5991> the code is a bit wrong
17:18 <@heinrich5991> but it doesn't cause tha
17:18 <@heinrich5991> t
17:18 <@EastByte> hm why are you ratelimiting in SendServerInfoConnless? wouldn't it be better to do that when receiving requests?
17:19 <@EastByte> since info64 causes multiple responses
17:19 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: read the code :P
17:20 <@EastByte> I'm bad at reading diffs
17:20 <@heinrich5991> SendServerInfoConnless is only called once for each request
17:20 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: ^
17:20 <@EastByte> hm okay
17:20 <@EastByte> I thought it was a recursive call or something
17:21 <@heinrich5991> yes, but to SendServerInfo
17:22 <@EastByte> kk
17:22 <@heinrich5991> (which I also find weird, because it causes several things to be recomputed)
17:23 <@deen> even with 1000 it happens now
17:34 <@heinrich5991> can you give me a tcpdump of that server?
17:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: 
17:34 <@deen> but only on some servers
17:36 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: why do we need m_ServerInfoHighLoad? isn't it enough to compare a counter against the limit and reset the counter every second?
17:36 <@deen> EastByte: in a new second you would be sending responses again
17:36 <@EastByte> right, what's wrong about that?
17:37 <@heinrich5991> what's right about that?
17:37 <@heinrich5991> the conceptual thing I tried to do is:
17:37 <@deen> in a DoS attack we don't want to send these huge responses at all
17:37 <@heinrich5991> if we get more than 10/s I wanna send short responses
17:38 <@EastByte> but m_ServerInfoHighLoad block for a whole another second, independently whether there are still requests arriving
17:39 <@EastByte> blocks*
17:41 <@heinrich5991> mh. we could increase the sampling period
17:41 <@heinrich5991> *frequency
17:42 <@deen> but i still don't understand what happens
17:42 <@deen> on my local system this doesn'T happen
17:42 <@deen> at most i get 9 requests/second there, nowhere near 1000
17:49 <@deen> ha, when you connect 2 players it bugs
17:49 <@deen> wait, no
17:50 <@deen> when you change map!
17:50 <@deen> m_ServerInfoFirstRequest is not reset
17:50 <@EastByte> ah because of the game tick
17:51 <@deen> yep
17:51 <@deen> game tick is reset to 0
17:51 < Sadale> Anyone interested in homework black market? :P
17:51 < Sadale> It's a final year project. All info I've got: "hello.Can you make a apps using eclipse with opencv to detect vehicles?For example the number and the types. Like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Cvn3_4yGo " (I wish I've got more info)
17:51 <@deen> Sadale: all messages to this irc channel are publically logged btw
17:52 < Sadale> Ok :3

17:55 <@deen> Sadale: i'm not interested and think it's a bad idea to have other people do your homework
17:55 < Sadale> I don't play DDRace. But I often watch my little sister to play it :P
17:55 < Sadale> deen, seriously, it isn't my homework. It's my friend's homework. As not creditable as it may sounds. :P
17:55 < Sadale> I can program. Therefore, I don't need other's help on programming :3
17:55 < Sadale> See Sadale.net . That's my site showing what program I've made :)

18:08 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: Care to share the datafile code?
18:09 < IcyFoxy> Sorry for my delay, was writing code that I probably should be yet... Oh well, just fletching out the desired interface.
18:10 <+Learath2> you actually are going to rewrite tw in rust ?
18:11 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: Yea, why not? Should **REALLY** help the modability and I love this game. :)
18:11 <+Learath2> good luck m8 that is some work :P
18:11 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: Indeed. :P
18:12 <+Learath2> i'd help but i have no idea how to rust :P
18:13 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: Well, it's much simplier than C++ ;)
18:15 <+Learath2> syntax didnt make much sense to me the first time around maybe i should just give it another try
18:18 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: Maybe :)
18:19  * IcyFoxy thinking... Do we really need  Client, Player and Character?
18:19 < IcyFoxy> I mean, one or two could do.
18:20 <+Learath2> well i guess you  would omit player
18:21 < IcyFoxy> Character doesn't need to be it's own object really, just may exist in the world or not. So Option<Point> for position.
18:22 < IcyFoxy> You might save a little bit of ram when a player isn't playing, but destroying the character and recreating it every spawn is kidna pointless.
18:22 < IcyFoxy> Same goes for pickups, they don't need to be destroyed, just effectively disabled.
18:25 < IcyFoxy> Actually I think the pickups are ::Reset and not destroyed, but IIRC Character gets destroyed and recreated on spawn?
18:26 <@EastByte> I guess that's typical in OOP design
18:28 < IcyFoxy> In rust this will still be OOP.
19:11 <@heinrich5991> IcyFoxy: code might be simpler if you have a world that contains all objects
19:12 <@heinrich5991> also, the character abstraction helps you share code between server and client
19:16 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: Indeed. At least for now there is no intention to share code... Although I do write code in a library structure so it wouldn't be difficult to do that if the time ever comes.
19:16 <@heinrich5991> oh, you only want to write the server?
19:16 < IcyFoxy> Well... Do you want a client too? XD
19:16 <@heinrich5991> ah. yes. but server only is fine too I guess
19:16 < IcyFoxy> I mean.. We can do that, but it'll take a lot more.
19:17 <@heinrich5991> if you want modding, you'll also need the ability to modify the client
19:17 <@heinrich5991> but yeah, server only sounds like a good first target
19:19 < IcyFoxy> Not necessarally, I'm aiming for ddnet compatability so the ddnet client should work (vanilla too). But sure, if the time comes that we want a client, then it shouldn't be too difficult to do as I said,.. I already write my code in a library structure so it's inheritly modular enough. Worst case, minor things might need to move from structure to structure.
19:19 < IcyFoxy> And as I'm sure you know, Rust is a very clean language. :D
19:20 <@heinrich5991> IcyFoxy: do you have a bitbucket account?
19:21 < IcyFoxy> Negative
19:21 < IcyFoxy> Although, I do have github.
19:22 < IcyFoxy> Any reason as to use bitbucket?
19:22 < IcyFoxy> I'm open for it
19:22 < IcyFoxy> Just don't have an acc
19:24 < IcyFoxy> Happen to know the first packet to respond off the top of your head?
19:25 < IcyFoxy> I.e. as a blind test before I actually understand what the packet even means :P
19:25 < IcyFoxy> Just want the client to acknowldge connection
19:25 <@EastByte> sending of control packet CONNECTACCEPT I guess
19:27 < IcyFoxy> Simple enough. 
19:28 <@heinrich5991> yup
19:28 <@heinrich5991> IcyFoxy: well, bitbucket allows for private repositories. I'm not ready to share that library yet, but you can have a look if you want
19:29 < IcyFoxy> heinrich5991: Oh? Okay. I'm in.
19:33 < IcyFoxy> I have an account
19:34 <@heinrich5991> name?
19:34 < IcyFoxy> IcyFoxy
