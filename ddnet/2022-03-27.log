15:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> enough features for website map renderer?
15:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Any feature idea useful for ddrace?

16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> toggle entities
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> something to hide certain layers
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> something to hide some layers
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean if u want an editor i can also just use the whole client XD
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> will see about entities tho, shouldn't be too hard
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe a way to see/download certain mapres images in it without running the entire ddextract exe?
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u can do that with teeditor
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait but isnt teeditor not compatable with non-teeworlds maps?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i mean u can still open them
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u just cant rly create non teeworlds maps since it doesnt have any of the entities
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Well a full ddnet client isnt hard, if you want that xd
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I actually wanted a stripped down map viewer similar to the one on the website, maybe a bit more friendly to use(also for mobile)
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Well a full ddnet client isnt hard, if you want that (then u have a full read only editor) xd
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I actually wanted a stripped down map viewer similar to the one on the website, maybe a bit more friendly to use(also for mobile)
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> website is also pretty buggy:
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> clipping not working(zoom out to see parts of the map), texture coorindates are wrong, zooming causes laggs
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://ddnet.tw/mappreview/?map=Wour+Forlds
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vs. (which is the client stripped in size + minor changes)
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://aliveclan.de/ddnettest/load_map.html?map=Wour+Forlds
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> both aren't loading on my end
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh nvm aliveclan loaded first
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the first does load u just need to zoom out very far
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs of the clipping bug
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> coordinates in url
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> interesting idea
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> google teemaps, where is next restaurant
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but sounds useful, thanks

22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> New ddnet feature preview: SMART_PAUSE
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It unpause if tee is moved when pause/spec.
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> At the moment it is spamming echo ðŸ™‚
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957733360401260644/smart_unpause.mp4
22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Smart pause, To be decided:
22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 1) Add a checkbox for smartpause in setting?
22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 2) If client is in spect and chat, it will unpause and keep chat opened or unpause and close chat?
22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 3) If client is snapped on dummy, at the moment it keep focus on dummy.
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, checkbox is important
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> i think for 2 and 3 it should be changeable via a console command :hmmm:
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i.e im playing with tees while they are spectating
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so i move them kekw
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> maybe instead of checkbox make it an extra command
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> checkbox and extra command are connected kekw
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> i meant a chat command, so you can have separate buttons. But i guess it works by just chaining it to the pause as well
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> whats the use case for this though?
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> theres already a clear indication if someone is in spec, and most people know not to touch people while in spec
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Sometimes people, when frozen, go spect other teams.
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> So your team fail becuase you are unresponsive specting others.
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's a very common scenario actually.
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> @Not Keks dummy splitscreen when? :D
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> eeeh, it's not that common. when it happens, it's devasting indeed, but definitely not common
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> devastating as in it usually happens with only one person alive :P
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> Does this still work with showall 0 when your camera is far away from your tee?
