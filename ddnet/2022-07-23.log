11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> should we have a popup that let player knows that servers without the checkmark are hosted by others and can not guarantee to be safe. maybe show it when people first click on internet.
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but that does mean gatekeeping teeworlds contents from new players which is a huge down side
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teeworlds people already blame us for murdering their game :D
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's what i mean
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but sometime i feel like it is necessary
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is the checkmark not obious enough? xd
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is the checkmark not obvious enough? xd
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but we can add a tooltip for the checkmarks
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a tooltip on the column?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I actually didn't even notice some servers had checkmarks until the checkmark design was changed and I was the pull request. maybe I'm just blind
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I actually didn't even notice some servers had checkmarks until the checkmark design was changed and I saw the pull request. maybe I'm just blind
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A popup when you first click the internet tab isnt too too annoying either
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i hate popups xD
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs i see "ACCEPT COOKIES" popups every day xD
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 and can we have server list subscription? like we can let people subscribe to a url of ours so they know we hosted the server on the list. like a customizable tab.
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to learn to love the accept cookies popup. Think of it as the first shot in humanities war against corporations
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be cool ^^
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> by ours I mean twcn
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's true 😄
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> of course
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think we shouldnt add a tooltip
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its too unfair rn
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should add a form appliance to get the checkmark
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u know, sometimes when google's search engine gives shitty results i have to use an annonym tab, and then this fat ass popup blocks the whole site
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unique clan servers should get it
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or that
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://uniqueclan.net/serverstatus/GER
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but still, people maybe not see the checkmarks or don't understand what it means
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are checkmarks used in chinese internet?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean in western stuff its used everywhere pretty much
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I guess it could work, but it creates alternate hubs of trust we cant manage. E.g. someone shares a subscribe link, they stop hosting servers after a while, someone else buys the domain, now they can sneak their servers into your list
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well if they went with the effort of adding the link then they probably trust it. just give it the same treatment of internet if we do add popups.
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~I mean the hud change broke my heart really, so~~ I don't really care if we move too far away from teeworlds at this point.
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> make fng hud
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, the tick was supposed to be a mark for official servers, not trusted servers. I guess we could think about expanding the meaning of it
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> fng masterrace
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho we should add trusted servers
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rename kog to community
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and add them there
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> doesn't kog already add other servers to their tab, how do they even do that?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet manages it
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ok
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> so they have to submit all their servers to deen when they add new ones?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or me
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That tab was a stopgap measure because we didnt have http masters, it might be time to remove it
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> as a gores player I really like the tab it's very convenient 😅
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made an issue
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw couldnt we add like a "auth" password to http register server process, so "community" servers are automatically in the tab
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or does that already exists
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't but it could be added yeah
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> what about using checkmarks in the internet tab aswell and add a 'trusted server' filter instead?
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://info2.ddnet.tw/info?name=nameless%20tee
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> half of the info are server addresses, so might slim that part down a bit 😄
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A bearer token that gets converted to "category": "kog" by the masterserver
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> "Community" is a little confusing isn't it? Are all the servers that are not officially verified not part of the community? idk if there's any better name though
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> trusted, community whatever
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean "trusted" is wrong anyway
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That way we have some sort of control over what is verified, e.g. a token leak, or a owner change
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> "slightly trusted" xd
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> add a 'trusted server' filter instead?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> edit: im silly
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Should(tm) be fine(tm) we hope"
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "community" might make sense if we consider the player base
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Kog is a community
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> block is a community
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> city is a community
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and hosting your own fng or block server doesnt directly build a community around your server
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah dont name the tab kog
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was hoping we can also let network owners group their servers a bit
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can add a tag
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to the http master
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or tags
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, we should ask heinrich
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> maybe consider how other similar games handle server browser. Like garry's mod
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1000347200137740339/unknown.png
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but there should always be a list without categories
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> that's the "Legacy Browsing" button xd
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "werwolf nazi german berlin rp"
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "mexicanborder rp"
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gottal love gmod
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I assume the servers get to choose any gamemode and then the client filters them into the lists
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> garrys mod has no verification, I wonder how they prevent people from faking player numbers to get to the top of the list
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we let konsti have a trusted server network
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wonder if we can restructure the server browser a bit anyway
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i always find it so unpracticle
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1000349808592175114/unknown.png
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you want to get lynched? That's how you get lynched
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not more than removing stars xd
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> what does the "1.4" version mean?
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno ask kog
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I wish those buttons on the bottom for filter/friends/info were biggers, it's annoying to click them
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> maybe I should pr
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I wish those buttons on the bottom for filter/friends/info were bigger, it's annoying to click them
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i generally find our UI too big tbh xD
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the screenshot is also modified, its not original sizes
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1000351250866511922/unknown.png
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I guess but often I double click on a friend to highlight their server and then go to info to see who else is in the server, then go back to the friend tab and repeat
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> if friends and player list was on the same tab I guess that would fix the problem
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let them make their own searches and bookmark them i guess
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there are fake servers tho
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕵𝖔𝖊𝖑> speaking of tags in http master, what can be good is that the client can translate it because I think that some do not understand novice, moderate
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Easy: "Can I Play, Daddy?"
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Moderate: "Don't Hurt Me"
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Hard: "Bring 'Em On"
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> This is what it should be
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> good old difficulty levels text xd
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Insane: "Is that all you got?!?"
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Cellegen | RiH insane is "I Am Death Incarnate!"
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> or "I might've made a mistake"
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no, those are wolfenstein's difficulties names, I think quake & doom too
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> probably not quake
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's now a deny all button 🙂
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> really agree with this
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's a lot of UI that feels like extra space is used in an ineffective way
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for example, the Reason field for call vote is small and easy to miss, but often needed to make use of the feature
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have always wanted a compact friends list. i don't care about clans and even stripping them from ddnet.cfg still remains 2 lines tall
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for server and friends tab
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i also think the editor would benefit from a ton of QOL but I don't think that's many ppls focus nowadays
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i also still miss ui_scale
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> being able to see servers bigger was so nice
