10:21 <@Nimda> Anoteex by Deeper just released on Solo at 2017-01-15 10:18
10:37 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: what are the downsides? :)
10:38 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: you talk about harfbuzz in there, does it mean that it supports RTL text?
10:42 < necropotame> heinrich5991: Harfbuzz/ICU are used to proc
10:42 < necropotame> are used to convert strings to glyph, with support or RTL and other complex stuff. But it's optional
10:43 < necropotame> I don't think you want those libraries, and I've not fixed yet the problem with Harfbuzz on Windows
10:44 < necropotame> For the rendering system, the downside is maybe that it use more normal memory (I kept a copy of what is inside the video memory to update it faster)
10:46 < necropotame> I've to admit that the system is slow because it's more complex. But the implementation is better than the actual system so it's faster at the end (I use search in sorted array instead of linear search)
10:47 < necropotame> The downside is also tht i
10:48 < necropotame> also that it's more complex so harder to maintain.
10:48 < necropotame> (sorry, my enter key is sensitive ^^)
10:50 < necropotame> The code is here (it contains also Harfbuzz and a quad cache) https://github.com/teeuniverse/teeuniverse/blob/master/src/client/components/textrenderer.cpp
12:21 <@deen> necropotame: very interested
13:28 < necropotame> OK, I will create a PR once I've ported the core.
16:59 < Timmae> hey
