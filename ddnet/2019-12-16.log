00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:58 PM] Jesus Christ: fu breton
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:58 PM] Jesus Christ: u worst admin i hope ur servers die
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:58 PM] Jesus Christ: abuser
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :lol::lol::lol::lol::lol::lol:
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Well it's nothing new breton is abusing his role on his server, I think it's very questionable ddnet is still featuring him
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah i dont even play on infc but ive heard exactly the same thing
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lifebans for insulting him etc ..
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Noby u abuse too
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Pls be quiet if u arnt better
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> a: buse
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> noby abuses me
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why would you tolerate people insulting you?
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @heinrich5991 even if u dont tolerate it dont u think lifebanning someone for it is a bit harsh? theres a mute command u kno..
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably harsh
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but coming to a server, insulting the owner and *expecting* not to be banned is quite demanding
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah true anyone is free to make a server and ban whoever they want whyever they want, it just may earn them the reputation as an abuser
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why are you called an abuser if other people come to your server and insult you and you remove them from your server for that?
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> talk about entitlement of playersâ€¦
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you even tried to apologize and talk to the owner before coming to a public channel and complaining?
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> this doexnt apply to me ive just heard it from other people over time
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:00 AM] heinrich5991: why are you called an abuser if other people come to your server and insult you and you remove them from your server for that?
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> bcs there are more appropriate ways of dealing with it imo
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel you own nothing to a player that insults you
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why would you?
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure, you could be nice to them. I probably would
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why do you come here and DEMAND that you shouldn't be lifebanned for insulting?
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> everyone has bad days sometimes i dont think its fair to permanently ban someone cus they get mad in chat
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I probably would. and it probably hasn't served me the best in the past)
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont demand anything lol
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, either you continue this discussion and say they're justified, or you're not ^^
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can probably talk to te server owner if you apologize for insulting them
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i didnt insult anyone i just quoted @Jesus Christ because i found his comment amusing
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I realize
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> everytime he joins my server he says noby:gay and i just ignore him but its funny to imagine what happens to him on infc
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I realize that. I use "you" as the general you in the messages above
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> gotcha
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well it may be hard for those players as the owner doesnt use discord
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > you can probably talk to te server owner if you apologize for insulting them
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How to talk to a server owner while being banned?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @heinrich5991 well i've heard form several people for the OI community that got banned for accusing his mod abusement, but when i asked them, they said it was just a conversation about changing stuff and working together, literally you can piss breton much with long talks that if he's tired of it, he will just simply ban you
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon look for other contact options or ask someone not banned
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hmm
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ... i assume he doesnt have discord, which means he is not part of the REAL official infclass community
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think the point is that people who are reasonable enough to find the owner to apologize probably didnt deserve the ban in the first place
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and maybe breton does not care for ban appeals which it makes it reasonably terrifying
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> You are really overestimating Breton, he is literally banning who he wants for whatever reason. If you come back and with VPN and want to talk about it he just bans you again. And if you want more proof of abusement please go to the infclass discord.
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> If you circumvent the ban to talk about it, you deserve a reban
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I guess i am wrong. It was dumb to believe ddnet cares if it gets associated with abusing admins. This place is full of them so it really doesnt make any difference.
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I guess i am wrong. It was dumb to believe ddnet cares if it gets associated with abusive admins. This place is full of them so it really doesnt make any difference.
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is it normal that on (i guess newly started) ddnet servers there is no novice type in the votes? It currently is a novice server but it is not shown.

14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get it, if you don't like the way he runs his servers, then just don't play on them and run others?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I was scrolled up again, stupid discord
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> i just think ddnet client shouldnt promote stuff like that
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon no, that's a bug on ddnet7 i guess
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/issues/17 this one I guess
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ah
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ScReeNy its just so people can find servers even while the masters are getting ddosed
16:58 <+breton> lol, all the highlights
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People don't seem to like you very much
18:12 <+breton> my mom says i'm the best and that is enough for me
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd suggest being nicer to people that play on your servers, hostile environments arent good for anyone
18:15 <+breton> thank you for your suggestion
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Np
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> "my mom says i'm the best and that is enough for me"
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> nothing else to add
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> his mom is proud more than enough
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> congrats breton :)
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In an ideal world we wouldn't have to add anyone to the ddnet serverlist and instead have http masters for everyone ðŸ˜›
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> CFLAGS='-m32' forces 32bit architecture?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> should be possible on a 64 bit machine huh? Because without it works but with this flag my build fails
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but then you also need 32bit libs etc
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is it worth compiling ddney with march native or something like that
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I wonder if it is more perfomant
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> For self use ofc
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> March native is always a good idea, I thought it was the default though
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont think its default
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Using -march=native is inappropriate for binaries that will be distributed to other machines.
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats the reason
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Interesting ,I wouldn't guess compilers assumed binaries would be distributed
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52653025/why-is-march-native-used-so-rarely
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always set -march=native on a new gentoo install, I always wondered why I did that
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently its not the default and it makes sense to set it by hand :P
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But thats good, u and only u use those
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I can also do that in arch
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In fact i think i did
