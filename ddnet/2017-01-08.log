10:19 <+necropotame> What about adding a new NetObject for DDNet? Like DDNetData. It will contain at least the race tick, and why not an animation tick (instead of faking the gametick to choose the timeline). It will be cleaner than my stupid warm-up tick hack. And it seems coherent that DDNet must send contioustly some global informations.
10:21 <+necropotame> Penalty could be sent too like this. The idea is that since you send a tick and not a time, the compression/diff will send only one time this object
