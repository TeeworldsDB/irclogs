16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Trashmap patch for Python 3 is here https://github.com/timakro/ddnet-trashmap/commit/c3f0d388ff4deb68252b47ff3788e3a56fb8d195
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen i think for now we fixed most crucial ddnet7 bugs. What about doing a first release? People keep asking me about where to get ddnet7 servers.
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then delete all ranks afterwards cuz somebody already abusing the servers
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no release
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Cellegen a server binary release for personal use has nothing todo with official ranks
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then i didnt say
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki do you want me spreading self compiled crap instead? xd any reason u are against the release?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon you mean I should build a binary? is it really that important?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we dont really need that
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why do the explosions from mapped bullets only affect one player at the time?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> f3 fix it
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that rly broke the part i had in my head
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but i found a cool thing to map with it:greenthing:
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> > why do the explosions from mapped bullets only affect one player at the time?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> clearly a bug to me
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> physics change = big nono
