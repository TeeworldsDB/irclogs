07:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Conflict moment
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i am getting windows homesick
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i love a linux when i remote into vps but all the desktop issues are still so apparent
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> shit just not working
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> bluetooth, audio, dpi, gpu drivers, apps with no alternatives or ones worse than the original app
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but the power cannot be harnessed on windows
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> I can’t have my system on 3 different nvme ssds on windows (and it be supported)
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> I tried to move some parts to another drive and it worked except for store apps
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> and my damage can only be reversed by a reinstall lol
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue really
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its bad u judge linux based on the hardest distro and u failing
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing gentoo specific
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is, gentoo doesnt do a lot of things other distros do
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have no problems with anythong u mentioned
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s all just linux desktop stuff
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> not gentoo trust
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> neither of my controllers worked via bt (bluez), refreshed the page while in a discord call and my airpods mic was replaced with a loopback/monitor (pipewire/firefox)
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> kde is the only wayland compositor with relatively competent dpi scaling. And it looks and feels like shit
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got my controller working without issue
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ps5
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just shared that with learath not long ago lol
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill give u that hdpi is not good in linux
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought u already knew
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i got my 4k monitor right after i reinstalled windows
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> amd was working on it iirc
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> even hdpi has issues in Windows
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder why its hard
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> not really
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> yed rly
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> not anymore
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> they have perfected it
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have Friends who told me their issues
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> or was that hdr
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> windows hdr sux
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah well
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> hdpi tjen isnt a issue
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought i was talking about hdr xd
08:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> windows “display server equivalent” is able to identify windows by their process/executable (unlike x) and check the app’s manifest to see exactly how the app wants dpi to be handled
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> also has compatibility settings per-app for this
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> and new techs are using DIPs exclusively
08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> so even fractional scaling isn’t a fundamental roadblock like on wayland n stuff
08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> run time api as well
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> ds4 and xbox s/x controllers, probably could have made them work with some finagling but cmon who has time for that when trying to play
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i said it before but i went back to windows bcs the linux desktop took away too much of my computer time from doing productive shit
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it became spending time on the computer in order to continue spending time on the computer
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> gnome is so close to getting it, really
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s just too much that’s out of their control. and the dpi thing
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u chose gentoo, its all about mingling
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> and especially now that im working again i just dread the computer cuz i gotta install whatever pkg and fuck around with whatever config to make things work
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u wanted to not waste time yet u  chose gentoo
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> the irony please
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought it would be fun
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> and it is but not as a daily driver
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is fun, but probs not for u
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is fun for me and i use it as a daily driver and also for work
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also flex a bit at work :gigachad:
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> they dont give a shit at my work
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> landscaping rn
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing like coming home after a long day in the sun to a broken system. lol
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> no one to blame but urself rly
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> this is what happens when u dont go to college
08:33 < bridge> <reitw> u'd flex if templeos was ur daily routine at work
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt go to uni
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> well judt 1y
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> idk seems like a lottery
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> breaking into tech without creds
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> here at least
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> all about knowing the right people. which I don’t. and I can’t act like im the type of person to get into social networking like that enough to see results
08:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> here its not uncommon
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not extroverted like that. i dont go to meetups. i just chill online
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> not enough for the industry
08:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> im also the highest paid among friends xd
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am an introvert bro
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> how u got your job
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks to my work
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i showed what i did at ddnet, my rust repos etc
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> even ryoOS helped me
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> what work
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> it showed interest in low level stugf
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> who u showed?
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> at the interview
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> u gotta show off
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> which u got how
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> sec i do some reps
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> good resume or did someone hook u up
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> nobody hooked me up
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i also have a fundamental issue overstating my achievements like you’re encouraged to do in a resume. it’s always just like. i did this thing and it’s sorta cool
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got this all thanks to me
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i passed the 4 interviews they did
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> where did u apply for job
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> just online or what
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> they aproached me on linkedin
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> they saw my gh
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i despise recruiters
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> they wanted a rust dev
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just despise urself
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> make cool stugf
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> stugf
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> fcl mobile
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> no time
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> have to work now
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont even need to finish it
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> do it anyway
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i did when i had my older boring kob
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> job
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> if j want change u gotta make it happe  urself
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel like a motivational instructor xd
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i also have issue where the jobs are where i live but i dont live where i want to live
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but im working rn where i want to live
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> no dev jobs in ski town
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> they want line cooks n shit
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> still looking into denver jobs as often as they come into my feed but haven’t gotten an interview in forever
08:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if it is worth trying any more
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> work remote
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> fully remote positions are rare
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> especially for cpp
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway im not gonna motivate u more im not a therapist xd
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> best i can see myself doing is hybrid and i commute back and forth every other week or smth
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> 3hrs it’s a fun commute rly
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i always wonder about college but idk how will i pay for it
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> my cousin got into school and with scholarships only paid $1400 per semester
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but that’s here, and to live here, i’d have to pay rent, and i have to work to pay rent. and i sure as hell can’t do both
08:45 < bridge> <reitw> tf that much
08:45 < bridge> <reitw> got school for free lol
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yea that’s considered a smoking deal here
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> he got a good ass track record and a few grants
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i would have to pay way more
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> insane
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1400
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> 1400 is nothing
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats a year of uni here
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> not nothing
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> americans just got fcked up ed
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> here it is when it comes to tuition
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> the school is wanted to go to when i was in hs is $15k per
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> and this is no ivy league school
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i could do it and rack up insane debt
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but it’s a big risk bcs idek if i will like if
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but it’s a big risk bcs idek if i will like it
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i need to network
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> find ppl
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> my main guy has been stretched pretty then when it comes to finding opportunities for me. cto at a startup and nowadays he sends me links to podcasts and in-person apprenticeship programs in California
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s grim
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> and idk ppl and idk how to get to know ppl
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> in person where it matters at least
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> So i whack weeds and piss my life away
08:57 < bridge> <Ewan> I could always hit that one company back up. the ones that offered me an internship and revoked it immediately after. but their internships are in the summer so I would have to wait the better part of a year anyway
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish i could go to cppcon lol it would be so cool
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk man
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not as hard as u make it be
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> linkedin works even if its shit
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt rely on connections
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt even more its harder in america
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> its prob way easier
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u took the no uni route
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> u gotta show off u can do stugf
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> stuff, cuz u dont have the i went to uni card

10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is big
13:52 < bridge> <__admin> ddnet is not dx12 right?
13:54 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> ddnet is opengl and vulkan
13:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan and opengl*
13:57 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> opengl and optionally vulkan
13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
13:57 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1089822959184646154/1139604438898716712/951A2E16-4EB1-4E6A-967F-B482F1CD0DE9.gif
13:58 < bridge> <__admin> asking for a friend but do you have any idea why opengl hook that worked on ddnet suddenly stopped working
13:58 < bridge> <ultrakeker> 3 opengl's > 1 vulkan
13:59 < bridge> <ultrakeker> :think_bot:
14:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @jupeyy_keks
14:08 < bridge> <ultrakeker> :justatest:
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan is a open gl
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did he update drivers. Software
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What hook are we talking about
14:32 < bridge> <__admin> this thingy https://github.com/adafcaefc/Universal-OpenGL-2-Kiero-Hook
14:33 < bridge> <__admin> he had the latest ver for a long time, unless there was an auto update that happened today
14:34 < bridge> <__admin> if you mean opengl driver
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds like it requires OpenGL 2. Is that selected in the graphics settings
14:37 < bridge> <__admin> before you call me, i mean my friend stupid it used to work with this mysterious 1.4 version before
14:37 < bridge> <__admin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1151134566514446546/image.png
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh well then dunno. Guess he has to live without that hook then
14:41 < bridge> <__admin> sad life
15:48 < bridge> <__admin> my friend somehow managed to fix it
15:48 < bridge> <__admin> he is still not sure how but he suspects that it has something to do with disabling fullscreen optimizations
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @robyt3 do u have flamegraphs of ddnet execution
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> would be nice to look at
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i once tried in linux but i got a bunch of hidden stuff, i guess i was doing smth wrong
18:53 < bridge> <robyt3> I haven't saved any. I think I only tried some profiling with tools integrated in Visual Studio though
20:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> today i learned python and js arent able to multiprocess
20:46 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> so it has to do everything on one core
20:47 < bridge> <robyt3> @heinrich5991 Can you rebase #7150 to give the CI another go or should we fall back to merging without the queue if it keeps failing?
20:47 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7150
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers

21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, we should probably fix the build :/
21:08 < bridge> <antizypate> on my lan server, i want to add code that gives players rocket launcher from default and removes hammer and gun, i found some commands online that would do that, but it says i have no permission? even though i host the server?
21:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What commands?
21:09 < bridge> <antizypate> addweapon 1 or smth
21:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If it’s a ddnet server there is no command for that
21:10 < bridge> <antizypate> it doesnt say command doesnt exist, it says i have no permission though
21:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can you send a screenshot?
21:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What do you even need it for? Do you want a grenade pvp server?
21:11 < bridge> <antizypate> Moderator authentication successful. Limited remote console access granted.
21:11 < bridge> <antizypate> 2023-09-12 21:10:45 I console: Access for command addweapon denied.
21:11 < bridge> <antizypate> in f2
21:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why moderator
21:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Login as admin
21:11 < bridge> <antizypate> how
21:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Whatever you set as a rcon password
21:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not mod rcon password
21:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sv\_rcon\_password
21:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Set that in the Config and use it to login
21:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you have all the power
21:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But why do you want to do that weapon change anyways?
21:13 < bridge> <antizypate> for a gamemode
21:14 < bridge> <antizypate> and i dont know if its possible in map editor
21:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which gamemode?
21:14 < bridge> <antizypate> like zcatch
21:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/releases/tag/v1.1
21:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I recommend this as a base
21:14 < bridge> <antizypate> what is this
21:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s ddnet based gctf
21:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can not change vanilla ddnet to zcatch with rcon or map editor you need to change the code
21:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But it you want zcatch you need to run a zcatch server
21:15 < bridge> <antizypate> i just wanted the weapon change part to do tricks on maps
21:15 < bridge> <antizypate> without picking up grenade alway
21:15 < bridge> <antizypate> but i check it out
21:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like there is a workaround, although this looks pretty ugly if we have to copy this into every workflow: https://github.com/dtolnay/rust-toolchain/pull/94/files
21:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then I recommend the thing I sent
21:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which is gctf
21:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s not zcatch
21:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But you spawn with grenade and kill in one shot
21:16 < bridge> <antizypate> it says its ungewöhnliche datei
21:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds like a windows issue
21:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What Anti virus’s do you have active? And what did you download?
21:17 < bridge> <antizypate> windows-latest
21:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good
21:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Unzip it
21:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And run the exe
21:17 < bridge> <antizypate> sus
21:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
21:17 < bridge> <antizypate> what is the exe
21:18 < bridge> <antizypate> what will start
21:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> DDNet-Server.exe
21:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It will start a ddnet based gctf server
21:20 < bridge> <antizypate> can you teach me how to create spinbot
21:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> now that’s sus
21:20 < bridge> <nouaa> :justatest:
21:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you manage to run the server?
21:20 < bridge> <antizypate> i didnt do
21:21 < bridge> <ultrakeker> :banhammer:
21:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Spinbot is basic maffs
21:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With sinus and cosinus
21:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And PI
21:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Doing circles
21:22 < bridge> <antizypate> but how can i make it run in my teeworlds
21:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Tbh idk never had to code it. I developed a hand cramp at young age which is a layer 8 spin bot
21:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Goto controls.cpp
21:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In the snap method
21:22 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Find memory offsets and create external in C :troll:
21:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And the the angle
21:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Set\* mobile
21:23 < bridge> <antizypate> controls.cpp where is this
21:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ctrl+p
21:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In vscode
21:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> To find files
21:23 < bridge> <antizypate> ok
21:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or what editor do you use?
21:24 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Stop teaching bots, chiller :kek:
21:24 < bridge> <antizypate> no matching results for controls.cpp
21:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> By the way character.cpp is a nice file for you spawn with grenade changes
21:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Search for weapon\_gun and replace it with weapon\_grenade
21:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Send screenshot
21:25 < bridge> <antizypate> is this in default ddnet folder or your github
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you open the ddnet source code with vscode?
21:25 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Just open your eyes
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Depends on what you want
21:25 < bridge> <antizypate> i opened the ddnet folder
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want gctf to run my exe
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want to build a bot? That’s sus
21:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you do not know how to open a source code file I recommend watching a few episodes of my teeworlds coding series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhJkqAQmOh5LyYOfnMy4PJB6CSZltQyTc&si=hFKGHWO5s-R0cS1s
21:26 < bridge> <antizypate> ty
21:27 < bridge> <antizypate> which episode for sourcecode
21:27 < bridge> <ultrakeker> All
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Start from 1 if you miss all the basics
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s for teeworlds not ddnet but it’s pretty much the same concepts
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And pls don’t build bots .\_.
21:28 < bridge> <antizypate> i want to flex
21:28 < bridge> <ultrakeker> And get ban :kek:
21:28 < bridge> <antizypate> you said in ep 01 watch this if you want to build bot hax clients whatever
21:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s just marketing
21:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> My marketing department and lawyers do not get along
21:29 < bridge> <antizypate> i think coding an advantage is fair
21:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it would be for a hvh server
21:30 < bridge> <antizypate> hvh?
21:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but it's not otherwise
21:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hack vs hack
21:32 < bridge> <antizypate> if you had to go to war, would you choose a stick as your weapon or an AK
21:33 < bridge> <antizypate> even better a fully automated drone or a guy with a slingshot
21:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> how does war relate with a pvp (probably you're talking about pvp) mode?
21:33 < bridge> <antizypate> winning
21:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
21:34 < bridge> <antizypate> you wouldnt understand
21:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
21:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not according to basically all major server admins
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what about minor server admins though?
21:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have yet to witness a admin more pro bots than my self
21:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And even I do not encourage most of the unfair advantages
21:40 < bridge> <antizypate> downloaded the ddnet-master and theres a file called compile.py
21:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Teeworlds is really lacking some anarchy servers
21:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It just doesn’t fit that well in such as skill based game
21:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s for code generations
21:43 < bridge> <antizypate> #include <engine/antibot.h>
21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s for skids like you
21:44 < bridge> <antizypate> youre a old wine
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ima 0.6 newfag
21:45 < bridge> <antizypate> in this ep 01
21:45 < bridge> <antizypate> sendchat
21:45 < bridge> <antizypate> did you use that for your afk messages
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
21:46 < bridge> <antizypate> dope
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait no sounds serve side
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Client side was Say or something like that I forgot
21:46 < bridge> <antizypate> is there a file for clientside
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s in chat.cpp the client side
21:46 < bridge> <antizypate> nice ty
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But if you want that afk message just use chillerbot-ux it’s also open source
21:48 < bridge> <nouaa> bots everywhere

21:50 < bridge> <antizypate> badge
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> join a server, open your favorite ddnet client fork
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try to compile on windows.. but fail
21:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxaxa
21:52 < bridge> <antizypate> blay
21:52 < bridge> <antizypate> blayt
21:53 < bridge> <antizypate> i give up
21:53 < bridge> <antizypate> send code chiller
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What code
21:56 < bridge> <antizypate> when i have my chat disabled, return a message  that says x has chat disabled
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://chillerbot.github.io
21:56 < bridge> <reitw> ban
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Goto settings and set a reply message
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I made a bind to hide Chat and reply with I have Chat off on the same key
21:58 < bridge> <antizypate> ok
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> careful about not creating infinite feedback loops
21:59 < bridge> <antizypate> only when pinged

22:01 < bridge> <tomek0923> hi, according to rumors, it is impossible to block a ddos attack on ddnet server.
22:01 < bridge> <tomek0923> explanation: the network packets from ddoser look exactly like real ones.
22:01 < bridge> <tomek0923> 
22:01 < bridge> <tomek0923> but what if the server is doing statistics about quantity of specific packet types and detects the ddos in that way? i got no idea how exactly the ddos is performed so im looking for somebody who has experience with that.
22:01 < bridge> <antizypate> will this cfg run all the time
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea it automatically reply’s to all pings with „my chat is off“ and pings back. So if two people have that active it should ping pong. But I think I implemented ignore duplicated messages in one of the auto reply systems at least
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I run this cfg on a bind
22:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are different kinds of DoS attacks
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With bind key exec mute.cfg
22:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> some just overwhelm the network interface
22:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should make a bot at this point
22:02 < bridge> <ZombieToad> to prevent getting ddosed just unplug your router
22:02 < bridge> <tomek0923> like botnet? i had one where 1000 clients just connected to my server once. but i think they are rare, at least not as common as normal ddos. right?
22:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with those, it's impossible to block after you receive the packets
22:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: have you thought of that?
22:03 < bridge> <antizypate> how can i ddos
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no questions to break the rules
22:03 < bridge> <antizypate> theres this guy i want to ddos so bad
22:03 < bridge> <reitw> ping -f 8.8.8.8
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @antizypate one more rule breaking post and you're timeouted
22:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This guy is pushing it haha
22:04 < bridge> <antizypate> pinging sounds weak
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> timeouted
22:04 < bridge> <tomek0923> yea but what about pinging 100000 times per sec
22:04 < bridge> <reitw> bruh idk why he continued lmao
22:04 < bridge> <ZombieToad> rei knows alot about ddosing
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @tomek0923 timeouted as well
22:04 < bridge> <ultrakeker> :kek:
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> score: 3
22:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Censor moment
22:05 < bridge> <ZombieToad> can you mute the matrix bot
22:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you just delete a meme?
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which matrix bot?
22:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He posted an empty message I assume it was a gif or something
22:05 < bridge> <reitw> ig he meant the bridge
22:05 < bridge> <murpi> He's referring to himself, I think.
22:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg Matrix is so bugged haha
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1151253213861924915/testxd.png
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that still works
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> element is too clever xd
22:34 < bridge> <reitw> tf did u do lamo
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now u know xd
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> back then replies didnt exist xxd
22:36 < bridge> <reitw> duno
22:36 < bridge> <reitw> dunno
22:36 < bridge> <reitw> afterall discord sux, they implement stupid features
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the reply gives it away xd
23:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> posted an empty image
23:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or almost empty, who knows
23:03 < bridge> <reitw> well tried to look at but there's no link
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1151253213861924915/testxd.png

23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but don't tell discord
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else they fix xd
23:04 < bridge> <reitw> tf lmao, well discord just doesn't put any link
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it optimized it out
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> might be smth like react that thinks it's empty xd
23:06 < bridge> <reitw> u mean electron
23:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no i mean they might use virtual dom
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno what they use, but the img html element doesnt even exist
23:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I have an idea for what I can finally program.
23:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I might try using Zig for this because I hear it's fast to execute and easy to read.
