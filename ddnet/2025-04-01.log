00:27 < bridge> <teero777> No
00:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I assume body and feet would be the custom colors so they're just unset (or set to black)

00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
00:31 < bridge> <teero777> :o
00:32 < bridge> <teero777> By observing something you modify it.
00:32 < bridge> <oxyzo.> theres pixels
00:32 < bridge> <oxyzo.> thats scary
00:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that how you code, yeah?
00:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's more like, you can't observe something without interacting with it
00:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's more like you can't observe something without interacting with it
00:42 < bridge> <learath2> You are probably logging way too early in the connection
00:42 < bridge> <learath2> You need to log those after startinfo is sent
00:45 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôm logging on CPlayer::Snap(), the same data is used by default code in there.
00:46 < bridge> <learath2> That should be spamming the log, is it?
00:46 < bridge> <_qey> No, I made it log only once via bool variable.
00:46 < bridge> <_qey> You mean the data can be set later?
00:46 < bridge> <learath2> You are logging it once before startinfo is received probably
00:47 < bridge> <_qey> Hmm‚Ä¶
00:47 < bridge> <learath2> First of all make it spam the log to verify that if indeed you were logging all the time it does get set properly
00:49 < bridge> <learath2> Actually, what are you even doing? That shippet doesn‚Äôt really make much sense to me
00:49 < bridge> <learath2> Why are you reparsing the snap?
00:50 < bridge> <learath2> All the info you require is available inside `m_TeeInfos`
00:51 < bridge> <_qey> I need this data to create a fingerprint of a client for my external moderation tool.
00:52 < bridge> <_qey> Not perfect, but something.
00:52 < bridge> <learath2> Actually, what are you even doing? That snippet doesn‚Äôt really make much sense to me
00:52 < bridge> <learath2> But you don‚Äôt need to be parsing the snap when you are within the server code
00:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> key word external
00:53 < bridge> <learath2> Inside `CPlayer::Snap()` you have `m_TeeInfos` available to you
00:53 < bridge> <learath2> He said he is logging this from `CPlayer::Snap()`
00:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh I see yeah I get it
00:54 < bridge> <_qey> Yeah, thanks. Do now, optimize later, yk.
00:55 < bridge> <learath2> Sounds a little insane to me, but you do you
00:56 < bridge> <_qey> Until the concept is proven, I tend to write really shitty code‚Äîwhat comes first to my mind.
00:56 < bridge> <_qey> Then and only then I start thinking about what could be optimized.
00:57 < bridge> <_qey> Actually saves time if you think about it.
01:06 < bridge> <_qey> Yeah, no. Still all 0.
01:07 < bridge> <_qey> That saddens me.
01:08 < bridge> <learath2> I am 100% sure you are still trying to do something clever instead of just logging `m_TeeInfos`
01:09 < bridge> <_qey> No, I‚Äôm using it directly.
01:14 < bridge> <_qey> Okay, I tweaked it a little. Now it shows.
01:14 < bridge> <learath2> I was about to show you that it worked for me
01:19 < bridge> <_qey> And I‚Äôm actually getting it on the first tick, so, yeah, it‚Äôs not too early, it‚Äôs just me being dumb.

08:49 < bridge> <vahemaaa> Hello, when a player dies, character values resetting, such as `pChr->m_Value` . how can i prefent some values from resetting
09:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> You just set it again after he dies.. eh
09:08 < bridge> <vahemaaa> thats the problem, im trying to keep player in an area, with a variable called `m_InArena`. if player dies, he must respawn in "arena" if the variable is true; since the values reset when player die, the value is always false
09:21 < bridge> <louis> have u tried defining the variable in the player code not the character code
09:22 < bridge> <vahemaaa> the variable is set in CCharacter
09:23 < bridge> <louis> i think character usually refers to the specific instance of a tee, see if u can set it in CPlayer or whatever its called instead
09:24 < bridge> <vahemaaa> okii thanks!
09:24 < bridge> <louis> i guess just try that until someone more familiar with the codebase can help you :justatest: maybe theres a simpler way
09:27 < bridge> <vahemaaa> IT WORKED LOUIS
09:28 < bridge> <vahemaaa> thank you soo much, i have been trying to fix it since yesterday
11:14 < bridge> <_qey> I can‚Äôt for the life of me to figure out how to change player name‚Äôs color in the chat. I get that it‚Äôs the client‚Äôs responsibility to render the color using configured values. Thing is, DDRace team colors are not client-defined, not via config variables at least (I found none), and for each team 1-63 there‚Äôs a hardcoded color. How can I report to the client that the tee is in a team without actually setting the team?

11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning peeps
11:39 < bridge> <vahemaaa> morning
11:39 < bridge> <vahemaaa> morning rozuki
11:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for text containers, the color is set in 2 ways
11:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1. for each text part (set color before the text part is create)
11:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2. for any part without a set color (set color before text container render)
11:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> setting text color can be done with Textrender()->Textcolor(r, g, b, a)
11:44 < bridge> <_qey> Thanks, but I meant changing the color server-side.
11:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Color is controlled by the client
11:45 < bridge> <_qey> That‚Äôs exactly why I said in my previous message that I‚Äôm trying to report fake team, since teams have their respective colors pre-defined.
11:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Right now client customized color for authed and then friend and then static color for team color
11:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> That would break very quickly
11:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Client prediction would break
11:46 < bridge> <vahemaaa> what about FDDRace's RainbowName?
11:46 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôm trying not to break things, I don‚Äôt want to touch the actually functionality behind teams, just report fake DDRace Team ID to other clients.
11:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Maybe you can "disable teams"
11:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> While still setting team
11:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> That's still brittle though
11:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Have a look at it, it's open source right
11:47 < bridge> <_qey> The team functionality should remain intact.
11:47 < bridge> <_qey> Does it change name color?
11:47 < bridge> <vahemaaa> yes
11:47 < bridge> <_qey> Will take a look, thanks.
11:47 < bridge> <vahemaaa> DisplayName and ChatName
11:48 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôm trying not to break things, I don‚Äôt want to touch the actual functionality behind teams, just report fake DDRace Team ID to other clients.

12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> hello im trying to add `SpreadGun`, but there is an issue about projectiles; as you can see if player has spreadgun, he must fire another two projectiles, but when player fires, other two bullets are invisible, and when they hit any object their stars appear.
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> 
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> i have a similar issue about `SpreadGrenade`, when i fire; 3 bombs go out but additional 2 bombs goes through walls and players; and disappear when the main bomb explodes
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> 
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> am i using projectiles wrong?
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> ```cpp
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> new CProjectile(
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa>     GameWorld(), WEAPON_GUN, m_pPlayer->GetCid(), ProjStartPos, Direction, Lifetime, false, Explosive, ImpactSound, MouseTarget);
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> 
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> if (m_SpreadGun)
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa> {
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa>     new CProjectile(GameWorld(), WEAPON_GUN, m_pPlayer->GetCid(), ProjStartPos, SpreadictionX, Lifetime, false, Explosive, ImpactSound, MouseTarget);
12:00 < bridge> <vahemaaa>     new CProjectile(GameWorld(), WEAPON_GUN, m_pPlayer->GetCid(), ProjStartPos, SpreadictionY, Lifetime, false, Explosive, ImpactSound, MouseTarget);

12:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I really wanted to say "you didn't make an issue for this"
12:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> But unfortunately you did
12:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Although the interaction on that pr doesn't make it clear what state the issue has to be in or if it's required for small things
12:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Also I get the wasted work, I mostly do client side stuff though so if it's rejected I just use it anyway
12:26 < bridge> <teero777> I dont like this xd
12:26 < bridge> <teero777> Let me do the work and then you decide if you like it or not
12:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I am generally against this but the wording in the pr is ... Vague
12:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "to avoid wasted work make an issue to discuss the feature before implementing it"
12:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I would prefer
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> I think chillers comment makes sense
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> What if a feature is wanted but he issue doesn't get a response for 4 months
12:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> That happens
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> I think chillers comment makes sense
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> What if a feature is wanted but the issue doesn't get a response for 4 months
12:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Same happens for prs
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> void OnRender() 
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>   for tee in tees {
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>    RenderName(ui_state);
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>    RenderClan(ui_state);
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>    RenderId(ui_state);
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>    RenderStrongWeak(ui_state);
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>  }
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> If only it was that simple
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Ehheheheeh
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The point is, you have to make it so simple
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> we can set like a time for the issue to get a response and jf  not its valid to make a pr anyway
12:47 < bridge> <teero777> my c code is that simple jupsti
12:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Uhhh kinda hard
12:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> When I want it to do everything
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> having a pr already biases a bit towards merging and bloating ddnet
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Good, then you understand the problem of the maintainers
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Bcs they have to deal with the unreadable version forever
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> pls comment on the rfc
12:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Mmm I don't... Care that much
12:48 < bridge> <teero777> We should make a maintenance period for authorities to refactor code. No prs allowed
12:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I tried to make the nameplates .. good... But I grok my code idk how it is in the eyes of others
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> They are probably better than before
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And probably enough for what they do
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But if new features are added some day, maybe it get's too messy again
12:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I somehow doing strict camel case and no structs pr for some reason, I stopped since I knew it wouldn't be acceoted
12:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It can't handle dynamic parts very well. The plan for the future was to have a full editor but people want settings to move just a single thing
12:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Which isn't supported nicely
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks if only ppl made refactors cleaning code instead of new features
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> the world would be better
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> the skin loading refactor from robyt was nice
12:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Isn't that too facilitate
12:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> The lazy skin losing
12:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Loading
12:52 < bridge> <oxyzo.> i think you guys should delete ddnet as an april fools joke
12:52 < bridge> <Sans> guys, am I doing this right?
12:52 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356582004090605658/image.png?ex=67ed16f1&is=67ebc571&hm=589df900bc48eb8060689fc632c39eaefc967a9ae3c9de9bc0eeee10e23082d1&
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> lazy loading = u can have 1k skins in ddnet folder
12:53 < bridge> <oxyzo.> haha funny colors
12:53 < bridge> <Sans> :heh:
12:53 < bridge> <Sans> idk if theres a better way to capture all of those values into groups
12:53 < bridge> <Sans> i suck at regex
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 can we force the twinbop pink skin on everyone today for april fools
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We aleady have Linear II as april fool
12:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> meh
12:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should force a egg skin for easter
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> If I am in the ddnet channel I am still on irc but I don't check it much üòÑ
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> The issue is that it seems we are all just too soft to say no after people have done the work üòõ
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> The idea is to draw a line between a feature being wanted by the community and that feature being something we want in the official client.
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> E.g. chat translators, a lot of people want them but we do not want that in the codebase
13:52 < bridge> <Assa> should I open an issue now for all the visual laser features I am working on?
14:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> its always better than not imho
14:15 < bridge> <kebscs> No issues hehe
14:19 < bridge> <Assa> hope it doesn't sound to mean
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> lego head lasers?
14:42 < bridge> <Assa> I googled that and I have no clue what you are talking about xD but I find a cool video about lego laser cleaning

14:46 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 irc?
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> Am I still in the ddnet channel?
14:47 < bridge> <filoqcus> :justatest:
14:47 < ChillerDragon> yes shall i dm u?
14:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes?
14:47 < ChillerDragon> i slid into ur dms lerato
14:47 < bridge> <Assa> maybe we need a developer-OT channel
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> Lets see if my bouncer still works üòÑ
14:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> bring back #reports but do a rick ashley meme on it
14:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that is the easiest prank you can pull out of your asses
14:49 < Learath2> helo
14:49 < bridge> <Assa> or a developer-important channel with 30 seconds delay, where the bot posts
14:49 < bridge> <Sans> who are you and what did you do to the real learath :dcolon:
14:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Evil learath arc :monkaS:
14:50 < bridge> <Sans> :heh:
14:50 < bridge> <Sans> I don't know anything about irc, but so far this looks ancient
14:51 < bridge> <Learath3> irc means Ice Raspberry Cream
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I don't think important convos get buried by off topic much. Long form discussion is what gets lost
14:52 < Sans> I don't see any Ice Raspberry Cream
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> hm, you might be right ü§î
14:52 < Sans> you lied to me
14:52 < bridge> <Sans> :mad:
14:52 < bridge> <Learath1> morning
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> scammer
14:52 < bridge> <Learath3> my mistake, thought i saw some
14:53 < Sans> So is there any benefit to using irc instead of your normal discord client 
14:54 < bridge> <Learath3> privacy i guess
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes it doesnt require a phone number or randomly blocks ur account 
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and its faster
14:54 < bridge> <Learath3> you got 50% less of your data stolen
14:54 < bridge> <Sans> "privacy"
14:54 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356612721579397292/image.png?ex=67ed338d&is=67ebe20d&hm=aa128ec424f956530fe24ae3cbf4bb3dfbf2937b7a3eddac33cd57ef45961241&
14:54 < bridge> <Sans> mmm yes
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and you can use custom clients
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which in discord is tos
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> In exchange you lose contact with all your non-turbonerd friends, and all modern features like image sharing
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> worth
14:55 < bridge> <Learath1> totally worth it
14:55 < bridge> <Sans> im good, ill let you all enjoy the tinfoil hats though :D
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what bridges are for so i can chat with you normies
14:55 < bridge> <Learath1> @jupeyy_keks that name is already taken
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> You get a cloak by registering
14:55 < bridge> <Learath1> I am the only 1

14:55 < bridge> <learath2> Which requires nothing but an email

14:56 < bridge> <Learath3> so you're the only 1 in CoDinG StyLe
14:56 < ws-client> <Learath69> u all fake
14:56 < bridge> <Learath-1> @milkeeycat I am the square of you
14:56 < bridge> <Sans> I have no idea how to register, i just googled "irc" and found some random thing which asked me for a name and channel
14:56 < bridge> <Learath3> LOL
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> You dm q to register
14:56 < bridge> <Learath-1> (or other weay around xDDD)
14:56 < bridge> <Sans> who is q
14:56 < bridge> <Learath-1> (or other way around xDDD)
14:57 < ws-client> <Learath69> Q is quakenet gigachad
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Q is the bot that manages most aspects of quakenet
14:57 < bridge> <Sans> how do i dm it
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> /msg Q uwu
14:57 < bridge> <Sans> i dont see no sidebar thing
14:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> /query q if you're like all cool
14:57 < bridge> <Sans> ur so cute, ty
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> /query Q if you're like all cool
14:58 < bridge> <Learath-1> @forgottenabscat today is your day, rename to Rob1t like you always wanted to
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> `/msq Q HELLO email@addresshere email@addresshere`
14:58 < bridge> <Sans> wait chiller do you see that im specifically responding to u or is it just a free floating message
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg lerato i have to go i got no irc on my phone but pls answer me i will read later
14:58 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 any opinions about #9901? 14 lines of code :3
14:58 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9901
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see this @Sans https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> signup token is nimrocks
14:59 < bridge> <Sans> ofc you have your own thing
14:59 < bridge> <Sans> why did i think otherwise
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> Looks nice but I'm wondering if it really creates enough visual difference to indicate a door
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> To be honest though, I do not really have any other idea, so perhaps it's fine. I was once upon a time considering making door lasers very thick, but it didn't look good
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> doors also have (now) a fixed body tick, so they don't flicker anymore. So there is more to it, but this change is already merged üòÑ
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> this makes them also "look thick"
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> because they have constantly the maximum thickness a laser can have
15:05 < Sans_> I logged in and now I have an underscore next to my name
15:05 < Sans_> sadge
15:05 < bridge> <Sans> there's no dark mode, time to never use irc again
15:09 < bridge> <teero777> wdym? just make your own irc client
15:45 < bridge> <Learath-3> @jupeyy_keks hi @learath2 hi
15:46 < bridge> <Learath3> i guess lea invented clone technology, from using too much rust i guess

16:14 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Hello VulkanStar
16:23 < bridge> <zerolacqua> @ryozuki I think #9939 can be merged successfully now. I just renamed the old variables added in recent commits
16:23 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9939
16:23 < bridge> <lemo∆û> @forgottenabscat @jupeyy_keks when are you guys marrying?
16:27 < bridge> <Learath3> i guess voxel didnt see im lea3 :twintri:

16:30 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> When c++ supports getting staffs from nullptr
16:30 < bridge> <lemo∆û> what's a staff in c++
16:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 90s kids are no longer kids :(
16:31 < bridge> <lemo∆û> do you hire people in c++
16:31 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok stuff
16:31 < bridge> <Learath3> staff include:
16:31 < bridge> <Learath3> - robyt3
16:31 < bridge> <Learath3> - deen
16:31 < bridge> <Learath3> - heinrich
16:31 < bridge> <Learath3> - learath

16:32 < bridge> <lemo∆û> lamb enjoyer
16:39 < bridge> <Aoe'nt> Omg big fan
16:40 < bridge> <lemo∆û> hi not aoe
16:40 < bridge> <Learath5991> technically, if you use 0 and not tthe nullptr keyword, in some address spaces 0 is a valid pointer address you can dereference ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è
16:41 < bridge> <Learath5991> forgot murpi
16:41 < bridge> <lemo∆û> is nullptr not 0
16:42 < bridge> <Learath5991> nullptr may not be 0 in some address spaces
16:42 < bridge> <property of fingers> i love lamb
16:42 < bridge> <property of fingers> lamb burgers

16:42 < bridge> <Learath5991> @tsfreddie do u know why NULL is a macro define
16:42 < bridge> <property of fingers> mmmmm
16:42 < bridge> <property of fingers> eat it up
16:42 < bridge> <Learath5991> xd
16:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok but do you love wool
16:43 < bridge> <sometimes> yeah
16:43 < bridge> <sometimes> i like myt clothes
16:43 < bridge> <sometimes> wooly
16:43 < bridge> <sometimes> cotton
16:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> üëç
16:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> üêë
16:43 < bridge> <lemo∆û> i just thought it was #define NULL 0 and the NULL is purely for intention
16:43 < bridge> <Learath5991> only the constant value 0 in the source code is the null pointer - the compiler implementation can use whatever value it wants or needs in the running code. Some platforms have a special pointer value that's 'invalid' that the implementation might use as the null pointer. The C FAQ has a question, "Seriously, have any actual machines really used nonzero null pointers, or different representations for pointers to different types?", that points o
16:43 < bridge> <Learath5991> 
16:43 < bridge> <Learath5991>     a negative value might be just as usable by the platform as an address - the C standard simply had to chose something to use to indicate a null pointer, and zero was chosen. I'm honestly not sure if other sentinel values were considered.
16:43 < bridge> <Learath-1> you mean robyt3 and rob1t
16:45 < bridge> <lemo∆û> read it all, none made into the brain
16:45 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> You ‚ù§Ô∏è
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> Ackshully, 0 is a null pointer constant. So it's sane to use in place of nullptr and NULL no matter what. The compiler has to justmakeitwork
16:45 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I mean, <.3
16:46 < bridge> <Assa> Asckshully I do as the IDE makes me not do yellow or red squiggles
16:46 < bridge> <Learath5991> thats c specific
16:46 < bridge> <Learath5991> for example in llvm
16:46 < bridge> <Learath5991> Pointers with the bit-value 0 are only assumed to be non-dereferenceable in address space 0, unless the function is marked with the null_pointer_is_valid attribute.
16:46 < bridge> <lemo∆û> i hate green squiggles
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> Good, unnecessary information. In a couple years grok will do all of this anyway
16:46 < bridge> <lemo∆û> C# have too many green squiggle cases
16:47 < bridge> <lemo∆û> and it keeps changing between versions
16:47 < bridge> <sometimes> @tsfreddie are you a lemon because i wanna suck you
16:47 < bridge> <Assa> typo squiggles, just ignore
16:47 < bridge> <lemo∆û> woah dude, hold up
16:47 < bridge> <lemo∆û> like actual syntax squiggles
16:47 < bridge> <lemo∆û> C# has some default styling recommendations
16:47 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> #developer is brainrot channel
16:48 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Water in my brain:nouis:
16:48 < bridge> <Learath5991> ~
16:48 < bridge> <Assa> Thats the nature of sitting infront of your PC 8 hours every day typing letters into files hoping the magic stone interpretes them right
16:48 < bridge> <Learath5991> when i see ~ i think of the japanese
16:48 < bridge> <Learath5991> am i down bad?
16:48 < bridge> <sometimes> holding up
16:48 < bridge> <lemo∆û> like in C# 12 they introduced a `List<int> a = [];` syntax and they'll just green squiggle `List<int> a = new ();` or `List<int> a = new List<int>();` you had in the project if you upgrade.
16:49 < bridge> <Learath5991> ah the underline squiggle
16:49 < bridge> <learath2> „Çì„ÇÑÔΩû
16:49 < bridge> <Learath5991> thats like the ide way to show a fix hint
16:49 < bridge> <lemo∆û> was it really a fix tho
16:49 < bridge> <Learath5991> lately i only use c# to make ffxiv plugins
16:49 < bridge> <lemo∆û> it's like forcing every one to use every C# syntax sugar every update
16:49 < bridge> <lemo∆û> it's like forcing everyone to use every C# syntax sugar every update
16:50 < bridge> <lemo∆û> it's like forcing everyone with ADD to use every C# syntax sugar every update
16:50 < bridge> <Learath5991> i think there is a rust to CLR
16:50 < bridge> <Learath5991> aka c#
16:50 < bridge> <lemo∆û> there probably is
16:50 < bridge> <Learath5991> https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr
16:50 < bridge> <Assa> "forcing" bet you can turn it off by setting some linting hints
16:50 < bridge> <lemo∆û> i mean ye. but with my ADHD i think i prefer to have sugars in my project
16:50 < bridge> <learath2> Just upgrade your code, don't be lazy
16:50 < bridge> <Assa> if not, then microsoft :nouis:
16:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no you're up good
16:51 < bridge> <lemo∆û> it just changed a bit too fast. i was doing the same thing from `List<int> a = new List<int>();`to `List<int> a = new ();` in company code after we enabled linting to make interns think less
16:51 < bridge> <lemo∆û> and now with godot i got hit with a new syntax that i've never seen
16:51 < bridge> <lemo∆û> wild
16:52 < bridge> <lemo∆û> that was like 5 months ago
16:52 < bridge> <lemo∆û> too be fair unity's C# is older than godot
16:54 < bridge> <Learath5991> @learath2 btw did u know its coming https://thenewstack.io/rust-gets-its-missing-piece-official-spec-finally-arrives/ ? rust is adopting ferrocene spec to make it official
16:54 < bridge> <lemo∆û> is it weird that the number 5991 triggers my fear response
16:54 < bridge> <Learath5991> so rust probs will have a spec
16:54 < bridge> <Learath5991> @tsfreddie kek
16:54 < bridge> <lemo∆û> i see 5991 typing and i'm scared
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> Woooo finally
16:55 < bridge> <Learath5991> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/03/26/adopting-the-fls.html
17:16 < bridge> <teero777> i got a 5.991 time on race recently, quickly pulled the plug
17:24 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if they will adopt it as a true standard. A true standard should not retroactively describe an implementation. It's only really useful if any change made first is a change to the standard
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> Or at the very least simultaneous since the rust foundation both controls the implementation and the standard
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> maybe because it looks like a prime but isn't, it components are 3 and 1997, making it a semiprime
18:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i keep forgetting davides number. Was it @davide55? yo can i dm u somewhere
18:04 < bridge> <katondda> how to establish a limit for the consumption of RAM in a custom client
18:05 < bridge> <teero777> @davide55
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @katondda do you want the client to crash when it reaches the limit or what?
18:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you run on linux you can read /proc/self and just kill the client once the threshhold is hit :D 
18:11 < bridge> <katondda> yea
18:11 < bridge> <katondda> windows
18:13 < bridge> <lemo∆û> üçã
18:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk man looks pretty divisible by three to me
18:15 < bridge> <Assa> yeah if you can do 24/3 in your head :justatest:
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 9 and 9 are both divisible by 3 so you can remove them from the divisibility test
18:16 < bridge> <lemo∆û> I think my teacher told me if the sum the digits are divisible by 3 then the whole number is
18:16 < bridge> <bestgamereveruseen> :< i wanted to say it
18:17 < bridge> <lemo∆û> forgot why tho
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like, you don't need to do the full sum for the divisibility test, you can remove invidual digits or pairs of digits that sum to 3
18:17 < bridge> <lemo∆û> very true
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the power of modular arithmetic
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> 5+1 is also divisble by 3, so you can remove them
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and if you're left with nothing at the end it passes the test
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and if you're left with nothing at the end it tests positive
18:17 < bridge> <lemo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356663856612507709/image0.png?ex=67ed632d&is=67ec11ad&hm=2fe8c2a828417d50c67d2ec680eda2f61631e9246dae982460b8a0fb4d5ae6f1&
18:17 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Bruh
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> now if we just had an operator for that in C++, something like `%`
18:18 < bridge> <bestgamereveruseen> "remainder from division"
18:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's the AI striking back
18:19 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Can't you just make a operator in c++
18:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> call it "the non-divisible bit" operator
18:20 < bridge> <davide55> Hey ChillerDragon, I have Telegram if you want
18:20 < bridge> <davide55> Same name as here
18:20 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Finally, the two criminal can use suitable chat applications
18:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not for arbitrary characters, and you can't overload operators for native types
18:21 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Finally, the two criminals can use suitable chat applications
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> guys, if youre so good in modular arithmetic, maybe you can improve my section in the automapper part in the wiki
18:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> why did Telegram become the app for criminal scum?
18:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @davide55 can we quickly meet in game maybe? xd i mean i also can ask u here i have some networking question but i dont have tg
18:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> meanwhile Discord is the app for less intelligent criminal scum -_-
18:23 < bridge> <Assa> public groups and hard to track by authorities
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> What problem are you trying to solve? Put `if(GetMemoryUsage() > 2048) exit(1)` into the render loop (getting the memory usage is actually the easiest on Windows) :justatest:
18:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah lel we have GetMemoryUsage
18:23 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Did some googling seems like you could override < and > with a weird object in between to make something like that. So like `<op>` could do something. And you can macro the thing
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> No, we don't have a function for this yet, but it would be easy to implement on Windows
18:24 < bridge> <lemo∆û> I remember it being less moderated at the start
18:24 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Probably still is?
18:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i forgot where i recently saw the java app that did something similar to work around its own memory leaks xd
18:24 < bridge> <Assa> really smart criminals or criminalized people use signal
18:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> signal is literal spyware
18:24 < bridge> <lemo∆û> and accidentally invite a journalist in the group
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it requires a phone number getting one not attached to your real identity is quit a struggle in most places
18:25 < bridge> <Assa> yeah, thats the apps fault ofc :nouis:
18:25 < bridge> <lemo∆û> #off-topic I guess and I'm sleeping. Gn
18:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> really really smart criminals use Matrix
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> really smart criminals use some crypto phones with their own special chats operated by the FBI
18:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh wait no
18:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it'd have to be something proper decentralized now that I think of it
18:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something I2P maybe
18:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> email
18:26 < bridge> <Assa> not like you can just encrypt the messages yourself and send them over any client
18:26 < bridge> <louis> i guess whenever you pass 0 you lose 1 in mod 3, but it gets added back to the carry
18:26 < bridge> <katondda> ty
18:26 < bridge> <louis> i guess whenever you a multiple of  10 you lose 1 in mod 3, but it gets added back to the carry
18:26 < bridge> <louis> i guess whenever you pass a multiple of  10 you lose 1 in mod 3, but it gets added back to the carry
18:26 < bridge> <lemo∆û> smort
18:27 < bridge> <davide55> Sure ChillerDragon
18:27 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Sounds like it
18:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke i will join a secretr server
18:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> With Matrix you get the benefit that nobody can know what you're sending, and you don't have to trust a company on their word about E2E
18:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I think it's even better if nobody can even know that you're sending messages in the first place
18:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @davide55 join me on SECRET server password is 123
18:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's why decentralized darknet stuff is peak
18:28 < bridge> <davide55> What a secret password!
18:29 < bridge> <Assa> still better than the pw on my test server :justatest:
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> and then there are people who ddos pw protected servers, because they can't enter
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> even if the pw is in the servername
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> We should use discord messages as a transport and implement our own group e2e encryption over it
18:31 < bridge> <lemo∆û> There is a vencord plugin for that
18:33 < bridge> <Assa> Step 1: collect as many public keys of websites as you can
18:33 < bridge> <Assa> Step 2: generate as many keypairs as you can
18:33 < bridge> <Assa> Step 3: find a match
18:33 < bridge> <Assa> How long would it take me and would the universe still exists when I find my first match?
18:33 < bridge> <bestgamereveruseen> let chatgpt do it
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> forever, probably not
18:37 < bridge> <learath2> Say you are doing rsa keys, and a 2048 bit modulus, that would be 1024 bit primes, a quick googling suggests there are approximately 1.26 * 10^305 1024 bit primes
18:38 < bridge> <Assa> hmm, according to gemini:
18:38 < bridge> <Assa> `The observable universe is estimated to contain between 1078 and 1082 atoms`
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> If it took you 1 nanosecond to generate a pair and check, that would still be 4~ * 10^288 years
18:40 < bridge> <Assa> still more than estimated atoms in the observable universe
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> 4 Centillion years, damn
18:41 < bridge> <Assa> so not only can we give each atom in the universe it's own ipv6, we can also give it it's own unique zertificate ü§ì
18:41 < bridge> <Assa> so not only can we give each atom in the universe it's own ipv6, we can also give it it's own unique certificate ü§ì
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> Easily
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> We can give them all 10^220 certificates each
18:42 < bridge> <Assa> we only need to work on the ping :justatest:
18:46 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place if you want the extended door feature, create a new issue (for now). The point is to discuss a feature before it's implemented
18:49 < bridge> <louis> i don't really want it
18:49 < bridge> <Assa> Also I move fast and break things, throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks. This workflow is not liked by "products" with a lot of "customers", as you should not break running systems. Same applies to ddnet to a degree
18:49 < bridge> <louis> i just don't like how they say "this needs a discussion" and then just close it anyways
18:50 < bridge> <louis> if you wanna close it just close it, no reason to do this pleasantry "pls make an issue first so we can discuss etc "
18:50 < bridge> <Assa> I am sure that @robyt3 just read it as "extended rotating laser doors" :kek: and simply missed what this PR was about
18:52 < bridge> <Assa> On the other side if I do a PR which is undiscussed and gamebreaking, I should expect it not to be merged or to be discussed first
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> it's supposed to be for the implementers good, so you don't spend hours on something that we might not want, or maybe we don't want in a particular form
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> e.g. the /afk thing, it's wanted but the pr made for it is not really the form we wanted it in, if the person was following the issue or created a new one where we could discuss it, they'd know I think it belongs in a netmsg not a chat command
19:04 < bridge> <louis> #9994 is not good though imo
19:04 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9994
19:04 < bridge> <louis> you shouldnt assume that someones work or time is wasted it they implement smth that falls thru, its not like theyre working on ddnet company timr
19:04 < bridge> <louis> you shouldnt assume that someones work or time is wasted it they implement smth that falls thru, its not like theyre working on ddnet company time
19:05 < bridge> <louis> usually its cause they wanted to have fun and code a little pr, or maybe they have smth in their custom client they want to upstream
19:05 < bridge> <louis> i personally wouldnt want to make an issue and wait 3 weeks for discussion if i already have the code ready, or if i plan on coding it whether its wanted or not
19:06 < bridge> <louis> i guess ill voice my opinions in the issue :justatest:
19:10 < bridge> <Assa> open issue -> immediately open PR to it
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah I'm unsure about 9994 aswell, perhaps we should just be more like oy and use wontfix more
19:22 < bridge> <lemo∆û> Also I just don't think it is our job as a community to motivate people
19:23 < bridge> <Assa> its our job as developers not to demotivate people who want to help or do stuff
19:24 < bridge> <Assa> like, every help is needed
19:24 < bridge> <lemo∆û> is it
19:26 < bridge> <lemo∆û> people generally would just do whatever they like. even if you have a rule set in place they can still run into the same thing but in a different way. And I would say generally if someone submit unprompted features mean they don't really want to do issues for other things anyway.
19:27 < bridge> <lemo∆û> if they do they'd start by looking there.
19:28 < bridge> <louis> small conspiracy but I think the motivation behind 'issue first, then pr' is mainly to filter out tiny-feature PRs that get merged quick but over time add a little bit of bloat
19:28 < bridge> <louis> but i think theres a better way to solve that problem
19:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 irc me daddy
19:29 < bridge> <lemo∆û> maybe I've been doing this for awhile that I have a general expectation of not getting in anyway. Cuz issues doesn't show anything I want the way actual code and artifacts do.
19:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> lemons are usually sour, not salty!
19:30 < bridge> <louis> and yeah this is funny xd

20:49 < bridge> <oxyzo.> thats 91 because 9+10=910 but wedont count the zero so its 91
21:53 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @ noby
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> I expected something deeply philosophical
22:49 < bridge> <teero777> same XD
22:54 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 just out of curiosity, why are you not appearing in admin mail?
23:14 < bridge> <learath2> I'm showing offline
23:15 < bridge> <Assa> because I see only 3 users there, guess all offline admins are just hidden or there might be an issue
23:16 < bridge> <learath2> now you should see me
23:17 < bridge> <Assa> yes, thanks for debugging
