05:16 < bridge> <louis> is there any way to get free cursor while in esc in windowed mode?
05:16 < bridge> <louis> would be kinda nice
06:33 < bridge> <meloÆž> Huuuuuuuh whyyyy
06:49 < bridge> <zhn> known disease sevenanza

09:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice progress writing llvm bitcode from rust with no deps
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I canâ€™t pin point it. But something feels unnatural.
09:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t think it would be nice. I coded that once because I needed it for something specific. But it was cursed. You can just press f1 to release your cursor.

09:48 < bridge> <totar> lmao where is that
09:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> sentry
10:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> They are not joking. From a slow connection their site takes minutes to load for me
11:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> With most things cached and a fast connection it's still pretty bad. Sometimes part of their UI doesn't load, but they won't give you an error
11:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1337000010814066728/Screenshot_2025-02-06_at_11.00.16.png?ex=67a5d9ca&is=67a4884a&hm=af1b4c586c8115cebe740807b3d01d311392a27e242de412d4c515c30ea13987&
11:36 < bridge> <avolicious> But they atleast give you a hint that it might take some time ðŸ˜„
11:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How did you get exposed to sentry
11:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> We use it at work
12:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You work? I thought your 12
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> 14 days until rust 2024 edition
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> :brownbear:
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:

12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat i fixed ur var in if thing
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw here is the repo of the llvm bc builder https://github.com/edg-l/llvm-bc
12:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Go 1.24 will be released this month
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> for now i only have the bitstream format done, now to implement the llvm bitcode builder
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> for now i only have the llvm bitstream format done, now to implement the llvm bitcode builder
12:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/tja here's eeeh... a compiler backend xd(i does nothing for now)
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats on my todo list too
12:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> business as usual
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but after doing llvm-bc ill write a mini lang with it
12:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks rate the repo name
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 12/11
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do germans go to a cafe in the morning to drink coffe? how much it costs
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> here its rly common
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and coffe is like 1.40
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> coffee*
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I think so, but I hate coffee, you ask the wrong person xD
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> any german
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> im going to german next month
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> germany
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn us keyboard
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> im on the m3
12:23 < bridge> <zhn> 0.5?
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> arent u russian
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt germany is cheaper than s(pain)
12:23 < bridge> <zhn> i mean what size of cup
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You can go to supermarket they often sell it for 1â‚¬ xD
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> but thats not coffee
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its water
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what u mean?
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk bro ur usual coffee cup
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/good-morning-gif-3182996378180720501
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> this size
12:24 < bridge> <zhn> we have 0.2 0.3 0.5 l cups
12:24 < bridge> <meloÆž> The cost in Germany depends, I pay 4â‚¬ for a big one (around 250ml)
12:24 < bridge> <zhn> from 1.2 euro to 3.5 euro
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean coffee made in a coffee machine like in the places
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @ryozuki I'd be very surprised if the hotel has no coffee... like VERY surprised
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/coffee-barista-latte-heart-valentines-day-gif-16292907
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah in the supermarket it's also made in a machine
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> barista is the name? idk
12:25 < bridge> <meloÆž> Ryo you'll laugh, we have coffee machines in our supermarkets
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not a hotel as is but i guess
12:25 < bridge> <meloÆž> And they're actually decent
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh lol
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt know
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only know germans have pretzels
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i went to stuttgart when i was 14
12:25 < bridge> <zhn> hand made coffee is another level imho though
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats it
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was a bit depressing place
12:25 < bridge> <zhn> basically it's based on how they store their milk
12:26 < bridge> <meloÆž> To much effort, I have this crumble coffee you just put in hot water :KEKW:
12:26 < bridge> <meloÆž> ANywaY, this is DeVeLopEr
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do this at home too cuz im rly lazy
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> and drink lot of coffee
12:26 < bridge> <zhn> i develop
12:26 < bridge> <zhn> my autism
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i mix it decaffeinated
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> soluble
12:26 < bridge> <meloÆž> Nah I need my heartbeat to reach 180bpm, otherwise I can't start my day right (I'll die in 15 years)
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> 15 is too much imho
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:27 < bridge> <zhn> pretty optimistic today aren't we?
12:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> :baked:
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr a gf of a friend i have, when we go out to drink or some party stuff, she always mixes vodka with red bull
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> she will die soon imho
12:28 < bridge> <zhn> i'd call it red scare
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> u make me red
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252358080522747904/1267876556261560454/EB37683D3A4CDA1932DD5DD1561EC9AF.gif
12:29 < bridge> <zhn> i want coffee bruh
12:29 < bridge> <meloÆž> Wodka Bull is my go-to drink for blackout night
12:30 < bridge> <meloÆž> Wait I go to supermarket to get 1â‚¬ coffee
12:30 < bridge> <zhn> bring me too!
12:30 < bridge> <zhn> i want two 0.5 cups
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> im at office
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i use office coffee
12:30 < bridge> <zhn> coffice
13:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> now fix the bug which doesn't allow to use a comparison expression with literals on both sides as a condition in `if` statements :santatrollet:
13:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> (eg. `if 5 > 1 {...}` doesn')
13:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> (eg. `if 5 > 1 {...}` doesn't work)
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh lol
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ty
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its a inference issue
14:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also there's a parsing error when `if`'s body is empty
14:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> pebble is back mfs
15:01 < bridge> <den1488bil_24492> Ð¿Ñ€Ñ€Ð¿Ñ€Ð¿Ñ€
15:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have paid 6 bucks for a cappuccino in Munich
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> i pay 80c :P
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat ive been thinking about rewriting a bit and using a arena so code is less messy
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/typed-generational-arena
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> a crate i found
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> this avoids lifetimes completly
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just keep typed indexes
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can also serialize the whole arena with serde
17:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nice
19:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar do you know why i can not connect to 5.181.50.244:8340
19:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am stuck in the connection screen its the alive fng2 server
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah just restart client
20:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> what the hell is a void pointer
20:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1337139125492514856/Screenshot_20250206_141311.jpg?ex=67a65b5a&is=67a509da&hm=11bafe294c86f67506813e7483a6747bddbc063f76eaced1f3b565c61e75389e&
20:13 < bridge> <kebscs> pointer with no type
20:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> makes sense
20:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> helped indeed wtf jupstar
20:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is that
20:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato void pointer is like ``any`` in typescript
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> its useful when you work with addressed and dont need to know the type
20:16 < bridge> <kebscs> its useful when you work with addresses and dont need to know the type
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s helpful if youâ€™re writing C otherwise thereâ€™s a better solution
20:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> im indeed writing c
20:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> at least trying to
20:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> i want to implement vectors
20:23 < bridge> <kebscs> ive used uintptr_t instead of it before, is there anything better than that?
20:23 < bridge> <kebscs> both are so barebones idk what could be better
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of the time you donâ€™t want a void pointer to just observe raw data
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s used as an API thing to state that this type could be anything you want
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> the answer is usually templates
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> or a variant type
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> also theyâ€™re unavoidable for FFI and stuff
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> so it is what it is
20:34 < bridge> <kebscs> ty will check variant
20:34 < bridge> <kebscs> but dont think in my use case there was anythin better than void ptr
20:34 < bridge> <kebscs> just pointer to a address of a class that you dont have a definition of
20:34 < bridge> <kebscs> just pointer to a address of a class that you dont have the definition of
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of very modular systems will use it
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> for user data and stuff
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> which i can't complain about either as error prone as it is
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i haven't seen a specific alternative to the user data usecase of void* because i think that pattern doesn't really need to exist once you leverage other modern features too
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chiller port
23:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think I have my ports fixed they should be the same after restart. But maybe not on my new pc. But even then why does a port change help with joining
