01:46 < bridge> <davide55> What happened?
01:52 < bridge> <learath2> idk it gets through
01:52 < bridge> <davide55> Saw it, should be fixed
01:52 < bridge> <davide55> It was a 1.1Tbps attack
01:52 < bridge> <davide55> Seems like the load balancing was not working correctly and one of the uplinks got saturated
02:00 < bridge> <davide55> Found the reason of the incorrect load balancing
02:00 < bridge> <davide55> There's an ongoing maintenance on my main transit provider

12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 Thursday for Vulkan. What vk question is on your heart today
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i looked into how MIR works in Rust
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a CFG
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> rly close to what llvm ir looks like
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> which makes sense xd
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks my vulkan question: can you have security vulnerabilities / injections via layers in vulkan
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> if it makes sense xd
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok actually a layer is smth the driver implements right
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvm
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe a better question, can u do privilege escalation via vulkan
12:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> this looks like a lot but its barely 20‚Ç¨ xd
12:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200043006150066236/IMG_20240125_084152.jpg?ex=65c4be24&is=65b24924&hm=987a0c5ebe2a18f20415b9d1c0c3d1f0c9b0df6e4b3641c43d76bd7bf838e318&
12:43 < bridge> <patiga> what is the limiting factor to the amount of shaders you can upload?
12:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would guess memory or whather int max value the driver uses
12:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would guess memory or whathever int max value the driver uses
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's in the user land, so only if the back end has a bug I guess..
12:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> üò¨
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is a limit? Xd
12:44 < bridge> <patiga> idk :d
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BTW this isn't even a bad question. Because layers must not be inside the driver. But without root rights u probably can't install them
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But overlays can defs contain bugs
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well then it's mostly the amount of memory I guess. Ofc for stuff inside the shaders there are individual limitations too. Amount of uniform, amount of textures per stage etc.
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If it makes you happy to know. 4000 shaders are not uncommon even for mobile games
12:47 < bridge> <patiga> since you do most memory management in vulkan by yourself, do you also need to manage where the shaders are placed?
12:48 < bridge> <patiga> they should be located in v-ram, no?
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont u make ur own memory allocators for everything in vulkan?
12:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> meanwhile unity compiling 30k shaders if you are not careful when using URP Lit
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You don't have any influence about that
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks if i break my computer with i hammer i have influence in that it wont be placed anywhere :)
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Memory management is still more opaque than writing asm for cpus
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> asm for cpus is crystal clear isnt it
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is no amiguity
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ambiguity
12:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i cooked our game all day today
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> everything needed baking its so slow and stressful
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> was it tasty?
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at least we saw gameover the first time today
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it had been crashing before we could finish a round for the first two play test sessions
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie the company where i work is also into making games now
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> they use unity :d but the backend is in elixir
12:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym into
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> to usse the erlang otp
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> by into i mean they making games too
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oof
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> They use edlang
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly i think i hate making games now
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not in that department so
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> im making a compiler
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> more interesting
12:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i used to think making gamn is just putting things in place and make them move
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but in the office i can see
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> and talked to some artists xd
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3d modelers
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga for the host side of the vk driver u actually can pass custom allocators. So you can influence that. I wonder if it's ever used anywhere.
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess no device that implements vulkan doesn't also have a heap xd
12:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently you need to make the exact correct design decisions for every single objects. and it is too hard to teach all designers and artists about the technical detail in such a short time
12:54 < bridge> <patiga> huh interesting
12:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and we just let them do their thing
12:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and remake the entire map again on our end
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and they came back with a map like this

13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks omg a new editor in rust
13:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Is it worth it to fix the validation warnings? With `dbg_gfx 4` you get like 4 MiB of validation warnings, mostly about us not freeing everything I guess
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks bro this editor is legit
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> im trying it
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> it feels nice
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Zed is currently only available on macOS minimally requires Catalina (10.15).
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh rip
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> well ill use it on my m1
13:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> apparently because they use metal and not vulkan
13:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hope they switch
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Some warnings will sadly increase complexity, but not freeing stuff should actually throw an error instead of a warning
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lmao
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If seen it already, as long as it has debugger support it sounds cool
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ive seen it already, as long as it has debugger support it sounds cool
13:44 < bridge> <learath2> I did find this back when I was trying to do something like it yeah
13:44 < bridge> <learath2> Surprised you remember
14:40 < bridge> <smetanolub> is it possible to make inclient queue for unfinished maps? 
14:40 < bridge> <smetanolub> you choose max ping limit, you choose a map difficulty and type limits, there should also be points limit so 200pts novicers wont match for insane5, you press button and just wait
14:40 < bridge> <smetanolub> when it finds ppl, it chooses a server so ping will be about the same for all, and automatically connects to it for all players
14:40 < bridge> <smetanolub> it would be useful for ppl who play rare, because its hard to find teammates to instantly play

16:16 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> i played vanilla but never saw this
16:22 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> are you gonna realease it for ddnet?
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> That has already been tried in different ways and has never really worked. There were:
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> -discord servers
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> -the discord thingy were you can create like conversation, sorry idk how they are called.
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> -and some web stuff like what MilkeeyCat sent.
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> 
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> A lot of players mostly play with the same people over and over. Unless it's t0. So even tho you may find someone "randomly" or just by asking, it's not super common.
16:25 < bridge> <devinci24> It might work well with lower points players? idk
17:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> My thing is obviously will be successful and not doomed at all :brownbear:
18:54 < bridge> <smetanolub> We should do it as button in client, so more ppl will use it, especially new players who cant even find something in settings

19:35 < bridge> <archidev_> *oh no you found my secret account*
20:27 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Seems like #6578 is caused by the client starting minimized and inactive on Windows, because `shell_execute` always starts the process like that. It's a bug anyway that the client is not in the foreground after restarting, but weird that Vulkan can't create a swap chain if the window is started minimized
20:27 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6578
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think this was also a bug when we still showed the client console (not related to vk)
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i think i also seen a sdl issue, where someone complained about it, but the sdl dev said, windows sucks xd
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how did u install validation layers on windows?
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it vk sdk or some nvidia thing?
21:44 < bridge> <robyt3> VulkanSDK I guess
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally the validation is correct
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to prevent that from happening when tabbing out the vk backend stops rendering completely while so
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe we can trigger this state here too.. 
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rn it waits for the SDL event to say that the window was minimized
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> could also try to just force a higher resolution if the width or height is reported as 0
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è be legal and will only result in vk's surface reporting that the surface doesn't match the requirements
21:47 < bridge> <robyt3> It possible to reproduce the bug by creating a desktop shortcut to DDNet.exe and setting the shortcut launch option to minimized
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh interesting.. why does sdl window creation not fail here then?
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't we explicitly tell which size we want for the window? üòÑ
21:49 < bridge> <robyt3> It works with OpenGL, so something with SDL<->Vulkan or only Vulkan must be the issue
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well opengl doesn't have a concept like minimized at all
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 in vk backend in `GetSwapImageSize`
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u try to add
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```cpp
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if (RetSize.width == 0 || RetSize.height == 0) {
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             RetSize.width = 800;
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             RetSize.height = 800;
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         }
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder what will happen
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> add it before `VkExtent2D AutoViewportExtent = RetSize;`
21:56 < bridge> <robyt3> does not change anything
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh interesting. is the maxextend in `VKCapabilities` 0?
21:59 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, currentExtent and maxImageExtent width and height and both 0
21:59 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, currentExtent and maxImageExtent width and height are both 0
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it's defs a weird thing that this can happen under windows.
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without a swapchain you can't test if the surface was changed, without surface change event, you can't really know when the surface is not 0 anymore.
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if there is any useful sdl event triggered directly after window creation
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 another try:
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in `RecreateSwapChain` after `vkDeviceWaitIdle(m_VKDevice);`
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```cpp
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR VKSurfCap;
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         if(!GetSurfaceProperties(VKSurfCap))
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             return -1;
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         auto Caps = GetSwapImageSize(VKSurfCap);
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         if (Caps.m_SwapImageViewport.width == 0 || Caps.m_SwapImageViewport.height == 0) {
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             m_RenderingPaused = true;
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         }
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and in `PrepareFrame()`
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> replace `RecreateSwapChain()` with
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```cpp
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             if (RecreateSwapChain() != 0) {
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>                 return PureMemoryFrame();
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             }
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not sure about the last one, but maybe worth a try.
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe `m_RecreateSwapChain = true;` in `Cmd_WindowCreateNtf` needs to be moved out of the android-macro
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else it probably has no idea that the surface is now ready
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is defs messy, bcs normally on desktops surfaces are never non ready, like on android xd
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so tabbing out would always trigger a rebuild of the swapchain :/
22:11 < bridge> <robyt3> doesn't work
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but does it crash?
22:11 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't get window events until after init already failed
22:11 < bridge> <robyt3> no, same as before
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL_WINDOWEVENT event=7 d1=0 d2=0
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL_WINDOWEVENT event=1 d1=0 d2=0
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL_WINDOWEVENT event=10 d1=0 d2=0
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL_WINDOWEVENT event=12 d1=0 d2=0
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL_WINDOWEVENT event=3 d1=0 d2=0
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL_WINDOWEVENT event=14 d1=0 d2=0
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> all after creating the swapchain fails
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in Cmd_Init?
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah wait
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> after m_RenderingPaused
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there must be a `return -1;`
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else it tries to create the swapchain xD
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it's only in cmd_init and some sdl event triggers maximize or restore i'd say it's an easy fix
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else i'll have to think about it
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> I added 
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> if(m_VKSwapImgAndViewportExtent.m_SwapImageViewport.width == 0 || m_VKSwapImgAndViewportExtent.m_SwapImageViewport.height == 0)
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3>     return false;
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> after `m_VKSwapImgAndViewportExtent = GetSwapImageSize(VKSurfCap);`
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> and this seems to work
22:22 < bridge> <robyt3> combined with all your other changed, I don't know how many were actually required
22:22 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll do more testing another day
22:23 < bridge> <robyt3> combined with all your other changes, I don't know how many were actually required

22:32 < bridge> <bts._.> monospace ü§ì
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the first time that happened to me on vscode
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but also on like third time
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if it's related to using 2 vscode instances with different extensions or smth xd
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or if it's simply a console bug
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i also didnt update in a while
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the first time that happened to me on vscode
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but also only like third time

22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if it's related to using 2 vscode instances with different extensions or smth xd
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or if it's simply a console bug
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for some reason clang-format also is broken if i have a second vscode instance open
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> clang-format-10 to be precise
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess it somehow loads the new and the old one or smth like that
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> very weird
22:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> everything works perfectly in neovim, no matter how many instances is open üòè
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> great, now if it wouldn't be so user unfriendly i'd maybe use it üò¨
22:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wdym unfriendly üò¶
22:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just learn few vim motions and dats it üòè
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i simply dislike using vim-like editors
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need mouse and stuff
22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> üò¨
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also use micro in terminal
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it's the only user friendly terminal editor
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use tmux btw üòè
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> micro
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200193345343991860/epiccodermoment.mp4?ex=65c54a28&is=65b2d528&hm=6fd134467cebd2c998877ae8f96b0d994556466e4ed799bd49497ff86aba8d81&
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i forgot to capture my mouse pointer
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but just imagine it
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nvim also supports selecting text with mouse
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and also shortcuts like ctrl x?
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no :santatrollet:
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just press d
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> or `"+d`
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes i also use my mouse only to move code
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not often, but sometimes
22:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but u can make any shortcuts you want üòè
22:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i guess üòè
22:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i guess :justatest:
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess thats rather standard for editors xd
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> except you mean, u create a shortcut to automatically download vscode inside vim and use it inside there
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would ofc be really cool
22:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont have muscle memory to press ctrl+x/c/v in code editor
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also rightclick with mouse and click cut
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:

23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 maybe it's interesting for you to know, but I never read openfng code^^
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I took the basic idea ofc
