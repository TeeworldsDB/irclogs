00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let me quote this from someone ```jao is now killing his own rules -> everyone can due secret releases without testing now.
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It's ridicolous.
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The forum is dead now, Discord is shit.
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And so is the community.```
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that sounds so hi_leute, is it hi_leute?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its 100% is
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it 100% is
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> hi leute sucks because aoe says so
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ` jao just did an ego trip, didn't ask community, ignored all counter arguments, ...`
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> definitely hi_leute
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> fuck aoe hes the reason for the gay rule about not reporting mods
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ZombieToad yeah aoe is god and his fanboys rule the world
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if aoe says hi leute is shit he is shit
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> https://forum.ddnet.tw/search.php?keywords=ridicolous&sid=6e6305de109ffde6e9d3f7128ca0fa98
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is how most ddnet works
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yet aoe isn't even mod :thonkery:
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> easy to find out :thonkery:
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but aoe is deep govt
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> so we move here from general to complain :feelsgoodman:
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he rules the underworld with his puppets @snail @gdin & @Learath2
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oops, that was meant to be secret
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```Well...jao was basically the only guy left with some powers who wasn't completely fucked in his mind and was able to contribute to DDNet. But now there is none left.
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich is really the biggest problem. He thinks he is the owner of DDNet.
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And blocks every possible improvement.```
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its ok @Learath2 im deens friend ill cover whatever u say
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ryozuki why are you part of my ridicolous shit then
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hypocrite?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> üçø
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i first thought it was good but its not
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh no, hi_leute can't convince heinrich or any of us with his half decent arguments and is mad?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why are you still in it?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> does anyone force you?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove me
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> to spy
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :thonkery:
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> blocks every possible improvement :thonkery:
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see learath is mad
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> üòÇ
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> learath is never not mad
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no, I'm dumbfounded as to how you can think those are even vlaid arguments
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> instead of trying to get me to fix stuff, you just stay silent and then talk shit behind my back
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw blocking the whole discord chat #general shows how great u are in censoring
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all people didnt followed ur shit rules
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and so u had to close the chat
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bumm> @Ryozuki jao is now angry cuz of you

00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Learath2 i wouldnt be suprised if u were 13
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i even admitted im throwing out all what my thoughts without thinking in #general
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> how can you be dictator of ddnet is every admin is dictator
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont read its not my problem
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Amu~Cookie :GWfroggyWeSmart:
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can see these admins have big problems when they have to lock down a complete channel
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> how can you be dictator of ddnet if every admin is dictator
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you were making too much noise with your temper tantrum
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> LOL
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it won't reach anywhere there is no point in writing it out
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and? people only talks shit there, i wasnt making anything new
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it was related to ur administration
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could jsut let it go and ignore me
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u have to lock it down
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since censoring is a thing u guys like a lot
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ddnet2 will come soon
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> censorship free
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there are people who actually like to read shit in #general
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> it wont make the same mistakes as ddnet

00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> D:
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a way to arbitrarily boost your arguments, hi_leute and Prankster do it aswell to appear in the right
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all pray allah
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @worstwish you do know that only 95% of turkey is muslim right?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> According to the government, 99.8% of the Turkish population is Muslim
