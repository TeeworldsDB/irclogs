13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Can we please get this without the debug mode like in the screen?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> people play in entities so they dont care if it doesnt look super good in the first way. Its optional anyway
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802516454858555423/20210123_133221.jpg
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how many people play in entities, probably the top 5-10% of the players
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except the new steam ppl probs around 70%
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast in gores i rarely heard that someone played in design
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> f3 for making the weak and strong hook unrelated from debug mode it is really spamming my debug interface
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> i dont play entities but i play a lot in debug mode and its so polluted by weak and strong now
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ill vote for button combination to enable weak/strong indicators
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> f3 for just removing weak hook
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Back to a billion ui options weâ€™ve been trying to move away from ;/
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could add it like the client ids or maybe atleast put it in the dbg_ group of config options
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> press ctrl+shift+g 3 times and then ctrl+shift+h to activate strong/weak ids xd
17:19 <+ChillerDragon> anyone here expirienced with socket.io ?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not me
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> yo btw 
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> where does git adapt the short form of the hashes based on collision?
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> didnt know thats a thing
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991
17:29 <+ChillerDragon> i guess ill try to get a custom suffix then if the prefix is a issue
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds better, thanks
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª is there a way for me to render everything with the colors multiplied for a while?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. I want to tint everything rendered inside a block
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling the answer is no ðŸ˜›
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I'll still ask just in case
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well you could alter the shaders
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i created a black white shader for fun xd
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we aren't using the shaders for gl1 at all though, no?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need it to work everywhere, hm
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but thats only a minority, if u dont want an important feature xd
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u could alter all streamed vertices, but that requires more computing power obv
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to isolate a component on screen, which is proving surprisingly hard
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd be easy if the component was at the very top of the render stack, but when it's in the middle it's really not easy to do
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there a way to maybe store a mask of sorts? I'd guess that requires shaders too
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I mean for future use as a texture)
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's oddly hard to work with the fixed pipeline ðŸ˜›
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you could probs load the current framebuffer image and just render it again with pitched colors
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that will have bad performance ðŸ˜„
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, even enabling this just for opengl3 is a lot of work, I guess our pipeline is just not good for this specific effect I had in mind
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is what I was looking for for the record, implemented by rendering the tees twice which has odd side effects with tees being above the foreground ðŸ˜„
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802598626739748934/s.png
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh and it's not really truly isolated, for that I'd need to render them above everything, which would render them above the hud too, which looks bad
