00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> libssp-0.dll, how to get this? is it something easily downloadable for windows 32 bit?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen could you change the wait time to be as long as the penalty time?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we chose it to be that way so people don't abuse it for getting longer times
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> libssp-0.dll, how to get this? is it something easily downloadable for windows 32 bit?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> resolved, nvm
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> offtopic but, anyone  know how i throw out digits of a decimal number? like bitshift with decimal number.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i have an integer like 17121996 and i only want 1996.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i don't want complicated -17120000 or something.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> or modulo and division and so on.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> how to do it if you don't know the value?
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i know i can bitshift bit numbers. 0110 >> 1 becomes 0011.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it's from projecteuler.net. you need to calculate all numbers from 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 until 1000^1000
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and submit the last ten digits
