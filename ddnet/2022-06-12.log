00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> libssp-0.dll, how to get this? is it something easily downloadable for windows 32 bit?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen could you change the wait time to be as long as the penalty time?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we chose it to be that way so people don't abuse it for getting longer times
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> libssp-0.dll, how to get this? is it something easily downloadable for windows 32 bit?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> resolved, nvm
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> offtopic but, anyone  know how i throw out digits of a decimal number? like bitshift with decimal number.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i have an integer like 17121996 and i only want 1996.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i don't want complicated -17120000 or something.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> or modulo and division and so on.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> how to do it if you don't know the value?
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i know i can bitshift bit numbers. 0110 >> 1 becomes 0011.
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it's from projecteuler.net. you need to calculate all numbers from 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 until 1000^1000
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and submit the last ten digits
08:48 <+ChillerDragon> convert it to string do a string slince and then back to int :troll: :D
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> learaths dream, one firefox tab uses 4gb ram xd

09:57 <+ChillerDragon> yo jupstar how u activitina da -Weverything flag in ddnet? do you edit the cmakelists.txt or can one pass an env var?
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Weverything" should work
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> `CXXFLAGS='-Weverything' cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` yea this alr worked for me but thanks
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> and oh boiiii those warnings are not stopping
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> and i am not even using clang
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i told ya what i used.. using all is insane üòÑ
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "Weverything is best
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just disable the few warnings u dont need"
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here for u to find my message
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> quite possible i dont even allow implicit conversations
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i prefer to cast variables if really needed so i can quickly refind them
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (on refactor)
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885690/Virtual_Circuit_Board/
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this looks so clean
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im gonna try it
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> heyo, I am still getting a styling error: Wrong header guard in `src/game/material.h` I don't see what's wrong with my header guard?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets se
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> DDNET_MATERIAL_H
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but if you look at other header guards, it the path to the file
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> ah it's the name üòÆ so it should be GAME_MATERIAL_H
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> GAME_CLIENT_MATERIAL_H
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if its in client
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the github file structure confuses my brain
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah its not
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> it's in both
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u are right
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh ok
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> it bugs for me, too, it's bigger then it's scrollbar üòÆ
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it could just make this gab a bit bigger,
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but when u just search material.h its fine
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985482189342912562/unknown.png
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still one of the most useful features added to github recently üòÑ
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen maybe this is related, apparently on https://ddnet.tw/css-halloween.css redirects
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985483443884396584/unknown.png
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for me this link isnt created
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> header guards are for the slaves, #pragma once for kings xd
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> modules for gods
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how long does it take until caches are cleaned?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is that all from cloudflare?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for me its still on the old page even with dev console open, really weird üòÑ
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well atleast partially on the old site, tee.js is old for example
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah I see the actions are only displayed but if you press click them the http authentication pops up
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985509566970232872/unknown.png
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah, not the best solution i know
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but normally users should not even click it
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for me it doesnt even work yet <.<
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> stupid caching xD
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ctr+shift+r ?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes i also have devtools open
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and disabled cache there
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i really assume its cloudflare
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs it also doesnt work in my other browser
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can also not uplaod a skin
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> to community
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> so you could also just make the whole edit button authenticated as it was before?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I thought the skin gets moderated if someone uploads it
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it mirrored the whole site before
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont like this amount of code dublication
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont like this amount of code duplication
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh k
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen are the skins mirrored?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://ddnet.tw/skins/skin/uhd/2005tfo.png
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> discord also cant load it
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> no
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its important tho
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can not load it üòÑ
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> normal skins must be mirrored in community directory too
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway im off now, @deen see pr if not mirrored, but maybe its just cloudflare again
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks let me clear that
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mirrored how?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> uhd
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> community
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and community/uhd also contain the normal skins
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs else the skindownload wont download those
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, done
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> perfect thanks
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> @deen pls make release_date=DESC as default in skin database
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks ^
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> which function renders the hud that shows all the players on the server? the one that is shown by pressing tab
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it's not chud::renderscorehud, that's the one down right
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i leave this decision to database crew, i think as its now was default before
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> how to know in the code which gamemode you're in?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> preferably in a hud component
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ae1876d1414cb013554db3ed839425a9647a4fc2/src/game/client/components/mapimages.cpp#L166-L183
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> smth like this
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think gameinfo contains all stuff u need
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i don't get it, it asks which entities are there and then decides it's the corresponding gametype?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> forget the entities
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it also contains booleans i think
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> IsFNG or smth like that
18:12 <+irc_tester> xd
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> there's also information when you go to server info. on the right it tells you gametype. is it json from the server or is it from the gamecode?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe i can reuse this ü§î
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> `Localize("Game type"), CurrentServerInfo.m_aGameType,` is that accessible anywhere in the huds?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i imagine the fng HUD would be something like this
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985579910091399168/unknown.png
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> having less needed DDNET entities, it would be rather minimal and would use numbers in its place.
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> though that would involve a lot more calculation so
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i also thought about kill counter üòÑ
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and combo nice too
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> you mean numbers for counting down freeze instead of shields?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean i was thinking it would be a bar but that would have to include a bit of a rehaul? of the code
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> Does ddnet have a person for graphic-design and game-sounds? I _could_ do that myself but my results are most of the time only functional
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> voxel and mind added graphics for the svg repo
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ravie did the new hud iirc
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> louis did his entities
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for sound, not that i am aware of
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a new background theme would be nice, so it doesnt sound so cheap xD
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (l like that theme, but realisticly its not really "awesome" xD)
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> I want to start creating the first material drafts and one issue is the bouncy slime material. I thought that I maybe want to add a sound for it
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i know pipou does sounds, i do sounds also but we've never had a need for it
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> teetow (an og tw dev) did explain how the sounds were made
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> go ahead
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> im interested
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> theres an image of it lurking around the wiki
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> let me get it
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985586151811350548/unknown.png
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok, the PET bottle was OG
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how the fuck xD
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> no idea, that's all i got XD
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and tbh it seems like teetow is completely distanced from tw dev so i don't want to force too much out
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> can you record sounds with audacity? Creating the sounds from a technical POV is not the problem üòÑ
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if you have a microphone? yes
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u have a good microphone
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good sound design is probs hard
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so much real world factors that annoys u
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for the slime thing yeah we'd probably need a sound for bouncing + hooking it if it got added
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i offered to make it in one of the github issues, but shouldnt be too complicated so either of us could do it
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> > hooking it
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> So i slap some spaghetti?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lio messi> what about add feature that u can see which CP u have? sometimes is very usefull
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> basically
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or scrunch a wet shirt
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> eww sounds good
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i do have a friend who makes some really good music! i could ask him if wants to think up of something
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk if we need new menu music
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tw does'nt really have a central theme or central game
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> map unique music is the way to go imo
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol imagine if tw had random mellow music like minecraft
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> LOL
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but every good game has this one menu theme
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u know
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lets add random cave sounds to tw
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> *vote insane map*
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> *boss music starts playing*
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI5AcN6eOSw
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this in tw
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and gg
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we just need few nintendo music designers around here
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> make ddnet great in japan
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao, hearing any smash bros theme before playing fng would be insane
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> instant competitive
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok lets form a band and record a theme
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the spirit
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> teeworlds band
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azbvol2FdMA
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD hear complete killer music, and then see these cute rainbow skins
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tw starts with the most banger music ever and then you join a map and :ddnet_lgbt: is the first player you see
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> :heartw: 
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> :giftee_green:
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> soundtrack would be dope tho, imagine maps get categorized into how difficult they are/how their design looks and random tracks play based on that
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we would have to exclude maps that HAVE a track tho
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki do you use the stable kernel on arch?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, though I remember you using a modern cpu, you might suffer less from it, but I've been noticing lately that electron apps absolutely wreck havoc with scheduling in the kernel
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye stable
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on a 5600x xD
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do electron apps feel for you?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what electron apps do u even use? XD
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> discord and spotify
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> discord always sucked for me, but i guess thats nothing suprising xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> electron apps the real stress test
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> rehaul, idk i don't think so. a number counting down or shields or bar is not so different, i mean it's modular i think. but actually a number counting down would involve a lot of design i think. there are now number assets
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> rehaul, idk i don't think so. a number counting down or shields or bar is not so different, i mean it's modular i think. but actually a number counting down would involve a lot of design i think. there are no number assets
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the CPU is busy e.g. compiling sth, and I have an electron app open it'll absolutely destroy the scheduler
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u dont clear the discord cache at least once in a month, its getting slower and slower xD
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to do that
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i use it in browser
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> NT Kernel seems to handle this sort of stress much better, even it struggles with electron apps, but the rest of the system atleast keeps running even if the electron apps can freeze up
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to ask if any of you tried the pf or zen patchset, supposed to be better at providing responsiveness
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nintendo sounds https://www.8bitpeoples.com/
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think i never had non responsive computer since i have my 8 cores üòÑ
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> r u sure its not the GPU that struggles xd
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> there's lots of this kind of music on this site,
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> dunno about the license

20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> How does renaming existing maps filename affects DDNet Server?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I'm packaging ddnet maps, and some of them contain special characters which messages to be output. For example, Sp√ºli.map from novice.
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Changing Sp√ºli.map to Spuli.map changes nothing in the file's checksum.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> How does renaming existing maps filename affects DDNet Server?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I'm packaging ddnet maps, and some of them contain special characters which causes warning messages to be output. For example, Sp√ºli.map from novice.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Changing Sp√ºli.map to Spuli.map changes nothing in the file's checksum.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> `Can't translate pathname
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 'usr/share/ddnet/data/types/novice/maps/Sp√ºli.map' to UTF-8` is the output
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen https://ddnet.tw/maps/?json=Stronghold the json thing seems broken, haven't investigated though
21:08 <+ChillerDragon> wat is is supposed to show?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ranks and mapinfo in json form
21:14 <+ChillerDragon> ou dats nice
21:15 <+ChillerDragon> but its not used for the discord bot or frontend is it?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3702#issuecomment-1153273344
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i tried to solve this, but i think i have some linting issues or something. is there a script or a tool to fix the linting? so that it's the same with ddnet
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Not Keks thanks for improving the skindb :D
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nvm i have found this: scripts/fix_style.py
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think you changed every newline, ending. You have to use LF instead of CRLF
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> okay, because fix_style.py didn't change anything
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i think
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you have to tell it visual studio or git
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and then?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> idealy both
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> how to relint
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it is not linting
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you changed every lineending

22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> git config --global core.autocrlf false
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i got this, but i'm checking for visual studio
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think git will be enough
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> It was probably git that changed it to crlf
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> okay, i hope
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> when i now type `git status` should all files be changed? because they are not
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> after i did `git checkout-index --force --all`
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> This is also just a huge QOL feature for normal map making. Either I'm unaware of a shortcut for "focusing" the Tele button or the best current way is to move your mouse, click, and then press F (which is also not always what you want if a destination already exists)
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Pressing F also does not collapse the Tele popup which is a bit annoying, but it wouldn't exactly be expected behavior either. I think it's just my preference for F to collapse it, but I think esc works anyway
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> We could also discuss other shortcuts, like "Populate all game layers" which adds every type of Game layer to a group (which could arguably exclude the sound layer since many maps don't make use of it)
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Skips the need to run through them all if you expect to use every single layer
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> There is still the cascading issue with highlighting multiple layers and making adjustments to the group, but it's already an issue in GitHub
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Tile/quad layer should probably not be populated as well. I suppose a better name for this then would be "Populate entity layers"
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> available from the group context menu

22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> found another issue with ui_scale 105 lol
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the list continues

22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Yoydex please be constructive
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya i also mentioned it's good for normal map making, not sure that it's crying_wah.gif worthy
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yoydex> üò¶ ok next time
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you want to remove ui_scale it's fine. I just think it makes the UI a bit more clickable at 1080
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's why i use it
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> none of the issues really bother me with 105, since i can still make use of the UI that way, but no doubt i would be using something higher if i could
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yoydex> so have fun @heinrich5991
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> haha i could fix it with a linux tool called dos2unix.
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i think i even found some windows line endings in some files xd
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> that were there before like in data/languages/hungarian.txt
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but the build failed on github, idk why. i don't think it was because of the lineendings
