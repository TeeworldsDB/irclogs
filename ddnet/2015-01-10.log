00:00 < eeeee> but implementing those the right way is more work than just using cjob
00:00 < Learath2> signals ? i dont see signals there 
00:00 < eeeee> oh okay lol
00:00 < eeeee> nvm then
00:01 < eeeee> for some reason i was sure it does use signals
00:01 < eeeee> didn't expect this lame shitcode
00:01 <@EastByte> please...
00:01 < Learath2> anyways can probably make it CJob 4 days later
00:04 < eeeee> yeah would be better imo
00:04 < eeeee> can also fix cjob while you're at it :)
00:05 <@deen> hm, sounds like the entire curl stuff still isn't ready =/
00:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/TU5ckQ
00:05 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 9f34461 def: Version 6.6.5
00:05 < eeeee> well we can start with testing and merging just the first commit
00:05 < eeeee> which only links to libcurl
00:08 < Learath2> all the libcurl stuff works it just isnt perfect
00:08 < eeeee> yeah that's true
00:09 < eeeee> but i'd really like to have this latency issue solved
00:09 < Learath2> im solving it 
00:09 <@deen> yes, that's pretty important
00:09 <@deen> if ddnet client suddenly downloads maps slower, that's bad
00:09 <@deen> most people are in Europe, and get the map in < 1 sec right now
00:09 < eeeee> also i think you can proactively reduce number of bugs by using cjob
00:11 < Learath2> I checked with Awayst.map it was 18.06 sec for standart and 6.3 for the webdl roughly timed by hand
00:12 <@deen> 18 seconds? wow
00:12 <@deen> where did you download
00:12 < Learath2> DDNet GER
00:12 <@deen> why is it that slow?!
00:12 <@deen> you have fast download enabled?
00:12 <@deen> ah, can't even disable in client^^
00:12 < eeeee> even a few lost packets would screw it up
00:12 <@deen> hm, yeah
00:13 < Learath2> mhhhh i just dont have a clean way of falling back to the standart download without moving more stuff around client.cpp
00:13 < eeeee> it lacks any of heuristics tcp was accumulating over decades
00:40 < Learath2> eeeee: got rid of the latency just need to fix up the progress bar which decided it doesnt want to show if http fails
00:54 < Learath2> eek with my sleepy head i might have force pushed some stuff onto dd_webdl
00:56 < Learath2> deen: got rid of the first check for 404 this is as fast as it can get without some weird stuff like downloading both from http and gameserver at the same time if http fails use gameserver vice versa
00:57 <@deen> i wouldn't consider that weird stuff, but ok :P
00:58 < Learath2> yeah why did i think it was weird anyways :
00:59 < Learath2> should be like a 4 line change to do that

01:31 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
01:34 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
01:38 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
01:43 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
01:52 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
02:08 <@deen> strange, RUS not coming back
02:17 <@deen> oh wait, the gameservers are there
02:17 <@deen> just ssh not working
02:36 < Nimda> DDNet USA went down!
02:37 < Nimda> DDNet USA went back online!
02:38 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
02:39 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
02:51 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
20:59 < eeeee> why would you want to download from both at the same time?
21:00 < eeeee> it will consume so much extra gameserver traffic because of bursting
21:00 < eeeee> and might actually make things slower for people with slow connections
21:01 < eeeee> i think should just try to keep all maps available over http
22:17 < Learath2> eeeee: what do if http server dies
22:17 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't :D
22:17 < Learath2> that was why i didnt do it parallel download is slow and bandwidth waste
22:18 < Learath2> i'd say we should use cloudflare as a cdn which should ensure uptime and give fast download anywhere
23:03 < eeeee> cloudflare for map dl might not be the best idea, i think it's only supposed to work for actual web browsers
23:04 < eeeee> but we could buy some real cdn
23:05 < eeeee> can anyone estimate how many gigabytes of maps are downloaded per month?
23:43 < Learath2> eeeee: not much prolly except on map releases
