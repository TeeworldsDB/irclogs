00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> there is no automatic refreshing of the server browser list when you focus it, or at least i sometimes have to refresh / see myself on a server i just left. is that worth creating an issue? to refresh it at some more occasions
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what do you mean by focus it?
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When you switch tabs in server browser (internet -> ddnet etc) it auto-refreshes
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean opening the server browser while ingame should also refresh it? I'm not sure if that's intuitive
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what you guys use for diff tool and merge tool?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> none, tell me if you find good ones ðŸ™‚
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> p4merge is popular, but I always just used `diff` and `vim`
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i use meld, but the merge isn't that good when there's conflict
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How are lasers determined which they are in the code? Like how does it tell the difference between a shotgun laser and a rifle laser?
07:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> There is also door laser and freeze laser
07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Are there any files that items.cp is linked to that could help with this?
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Are there any files that items.cpp is linked to that could help with this?
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Are there any files that items.cpp or items.h is linked to that could help with this?
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> What does this part of CItems : OnRender do?
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997018418173726760/unknown.png
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> What does this part of CItems :: OnRender do?
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997018418173726760/unknown.png
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So my plan is for a potential Multi-laser color system is that, there will be 4 modes for the laser color, and whichever is sent in by the right object will co-relate the color with the laser type.
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'll be simplifying it a bit by merging doors with draggers and explosive plasmas, and freezes with freeze plasma.
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997036416829767690/unknown.png
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I just don't know how to do it yet. The four modes will be
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ```ClLaserRifle[]
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ClLaserShotgun[]
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ClLaserGame[]
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ClLaserFreeze[]```
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> For now I'll just do the first two until I know it will be 100% possible
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> imo tooltips take too long to appear (i never even noticed any until now) and it's unclear what things have tooltips on them
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so if you "get helped" by them it feels like a total accident, unless people are specifically looking for them and knew they existed beforehand
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Changing the delay is easy u can do it
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But showing what has tooltips, idk
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Yep I also thought about  that, the delay is way to high. And there should be an information indicator that there is an tooltip
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> maybe the indicator apears instantly on hovering
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or is always there
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> also the tooltips should be multiline and should not go over the whole display, but only like max 1/2
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> better 1/3
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> a button for toggling tooltips or an indicator as c0d3d3v wrote
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> looks like that is specificly the rendering of predicted lasers, shot by yourself. maybe they get generated local
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ah, nice.
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Can you download the steam DDNet.exe without having steam or windows?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Or in other words. Do we have a way to get a trace out of an RTP dump, from a steam build?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can ask the person to copy it
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I have access to them on Steam, which one do you want?
14:28 <+Konsti> why cant i join some servers with reason No response from server yet?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats not a reason
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It just doesnt show "connecting to..." for 100years anymore, instead that
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so there are probably attacks going on, or you are not whitelisted, depending on which server you try
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neroo> RUST GIVEAWAY
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neroo> Steam officialy sponsored one of the biggest Rust skins giveaway
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neroo> Hurry up and make sure to take part in this event! https://rustroullette.com/case
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neroo> The amount of free skins is limited, first come - first serve!
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neroo> Hurry up and get your prize!
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neroo> @everyone
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Discord Mod
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Ryozuki you just missed Rust giveaway ðŸ˜„
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> attacks going on, there is no whitelist
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> > depending on which server you try
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there are multiple ones that use whitelists
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we would need account for that i believe
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> :trollet:
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how then?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> website
14:38 <+Konsti> accounts bad
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how you prevent attackers to use your website?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they can
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but cloudflare
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Chairn lots of attacks are from spoofed ip addresses
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> It was just about the person in #bugs would it be enough if he uploads the DDNet.exe?  Would that contain the symbols?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we strip them
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If the exe contained the symbols, then we could just resolve them immediately in the crash dump
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but then the executable would be much larger
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we should definetely put commit hash in the crash dump
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 43 MB for DDNet.exe alone
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, exact version in crash dump would be nice
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I wonder how that even works that we can use the addreses from the optimized version and find them in the debug version
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do we still not have address space randomisation on?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I compile for windows with -pie
15:36 <+Konsti> deen being able to block spawn is fixed right?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `72f3b774b (deen/pr-spawn-block) Use "occupado" spawn spots when nothing else is left (1 year, 2 months ago) par def`
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3837>
15:56 <+Konsti> just to make sure cuz there a map with 1 tele and on ground in testing :justatest:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the protocol code generation is such a mess
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how did matricks come up with that idea ?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it is still posible to block on some maps, that even have solo on the spwan but next to it kill tiles. because you bounce off and fall into death xD
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> actually not to bad xD since I reworked part of it ^^
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But yes would be better to have a nice C++ protocol instead of relaying on the generation.
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But yes would be better to have a nice C++ protocol instead of relaying on the generation via python.
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> man, there's a part where python reads itself instead of just importing the file
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> :DD I know
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats 2010 python style
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xDD
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> *2008
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf is this shit srsly? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/dafc3984dd0881cc67004dcfdf00e0cbe8d200ee/datasrc/compile.py#L373-L381
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can refactor it
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf is this shit srsly? <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/dafc3984dd0881cc67004dcfdf00e0cbe8d200ee/datasrc/compile.py#L373-L381>
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn, i wasn't even out of highschool ðŸ˜„
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh, github can find declaration now, but only in python files
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats old
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it can do that for like 4 years
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> at least
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> works also on php
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, never had to deal with python on github until now ðŸ˜„
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> php and python are really easy to parse. I guess thats why they got that so early for these langs
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> python is the hardest language on this planet
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD says the rust programmer
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> im no rust developer
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think python is pretty easy. Thats also why it is the most preffered lang to teach after java in school and university
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> python is hard to debug to weak typing
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> python is hard to debug due to weak typing
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> python is hard to type
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> O.o why hard to debug?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> same variable can be of so many types
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs python syntax sucks xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that has an interpreter debugger xD you can run every code you want on the fly while you debug. while c++ will not allow you to create obj on the fly while debug
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't know how to use it :feelsbadman:
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but some code is harder to follow in the logic in python
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like our code generation one ^^
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess that is just the way we see all languages that we did not learn yet xD
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can create in every lang hart to follow code
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> assembly is best language, no type at all :troll:
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> especially if you do not know the lang
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can create in every lang hard to follow code
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure you can create an object while debugging, what gave you the impression you can't?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can not even call a function with clangd
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will make a screenshot
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can in both gdb and lldb
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Clangd is a language server, no? How is it related to debugging?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997165226686435428/unknown.png
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> sorry I meant lldb
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but it is gdb anyway xD
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess at least the function is not called. Because I get no usefull output
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> in python it would just print the output
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not connected to the internet, so cant get a screenshot but function calls work just fine in gdb
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997166238088298576/20220714_174206.jpg
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> then it is badly integrated into vs-code
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah no
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> dbg_msg call works
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but that is a pretty simple function
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh actually now it works also for some other funtions xD I will come back to you as soon as I remeber the case I wanted to do last timte
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here created an object for you
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997168080717369374/20220714_174945.jpg
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh actually now it works also for some other funtions xD I will come back to you as soon as I remeber the case I wanted to do last time
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah nice rubik's cube you got there
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah you have to use $ vor new variables good to know
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u use lldb in vscode, make sure to set the extension parsing mode to native
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else u cannot do unsafe stuff
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997168890373218364/unknown.png
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it even supports python xD
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can you also do somthing like that?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997169074020831282/unknown.png
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can you also do something like that?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/997169074020831282/unknown.png
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if gdb can, then lldb too xd
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and if any of them can, then vscode too xd
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i can run expressions yes
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `p dbg_msg("test", "dsadsa")` prints the line as soon as i continue the debugger
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried to create a projectile but made a mistake and crashed it :P
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32096371
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it's definitely not as easy as in python, but you can indeed do pretty much anything you want in gdb and lldb
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Biggest problem is a lot of things get inlined, so you might e.g. not have access to the constructor
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do any of you know VHDL? If you do, any good resources on it?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can upload an university course from me... I did not take the course I only did make "Hardware Reverse Engineering" in that you learned only a little about it. But I think I have materials for the other course in that you have a lot more details for VHDL
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is vhdl closed src?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah its a lang
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd like that actually
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://www.isy.liu.se/edu/kurs/TSEA83/kursmaterial/vhdl/free_range_vhdl_2019.pdf I found this book which looks pretty nice
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ok I will search in my data for it ... and will ping you if I have found it
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have slides from 11 years ago for VHDL on FPGAs too
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't remember that much, except that timing is always off and you get weird artifacts on VGA because of that
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> @ The Windows Users what IDE are you using for C/C++ ?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> @ The Windows Users,  what IDE are you all using for C/C++ ?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Which do you prefer
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Because i am using Visual Studio but i see others using VS Code with extensions
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> but maybe even some other ide ?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> (those two only as example)
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> ^_^
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> visual studio is good too, just use what u like
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't bring myself to agree with visual studio being good, it's just way too bloated
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can excuse almost any IDE, but that thing is a resource hog of epic proportions
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use neovim
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i only use visual studio for building the program LOL
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk if VS Code can do that...
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can build on windows without using visual studio on windows, you can either use msys or you can also use the cmake gui
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I like that visual studio works without installing a dozen vs code extensions which have changing versions
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw I just install the C++ extension pack by microsoft and that's enough for me on VSCode, never really messed around more with the extensions
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I want very little from my editor, so YMMV
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll move to vim soon though, one less electron program on my computer
