08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today advent done with bruteforcing
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feels bad but im not smart enough
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its some math optimization function or smth
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (second part bruteforced, the first was easy to figure out xd)
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe weighted average works
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im 2 lazy

09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how bad was your solution @Ryozuki?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mine was O(n^2) for part two
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not rly good at calculating time complexities xd
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i have 3 for loops nested
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most inner loop can be probs optimized rly ez but idk
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I only have two
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye i forgot about n(n+1)/2
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah üôÇ

13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <younesdevil> Complete translation for Persian language
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <younesdevil> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/917759463337893978/persian.txt
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks! Have you tried it ingame? I remember that for Persian it's difficult to make look correct in-client
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <younesdevil> yes.If there is a problem, I will fix it and send it againüòÅ
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> why am I in this list, whats that
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://adventofcode.com/
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u joined past years
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh probably
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> In the same way the "friend" work, could we add a "toxic" list ? So we remember to not play with them ?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> f1, add_foe
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> I've tried to "ignore" them, it's cool. But he don't remember be to not playing with them
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it is intentionally hidden and not persistent, otherwise people will at some point not see any players
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> what it does ?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what you suggested
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> will try
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it mutes them for you
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can also do it ingame in Esc -> Players
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Yeah, I already do the mute thing. Just don't really remember the player and not looking the list each time
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> It doesn't do anything add_foe... I still see the player like others
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> you still can see them as they play, but what it did is, it blocks all chat related stuff from your perspective only
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 ?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> you still can see them as they play, but what it did is, it blocks all chat related stuff from that person, from your perspective only
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> So this isn't what i want. I would like to see they name in red so I remember i shouldn"t play with them
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jupeyy, maybe you'd know about this? You were the one that messed around with mouse stuff
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> They have so much toxic ppls, it's would be could to have a list IG i can provide to remember
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I mean highlight colors for foes would be good @deen
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Yeah that.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> idk if there's one
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Nop.
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @chilledragon wake up in ddnet bro

20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> DDNet client just disables my primary display, goes into windowed mode and does not launch at all. Any suggestions on how to debug this problem?

20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> If I launch the game afterwards my secondary display goes out and I have to reboot my PC. After that primary monitor is still shut off

20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut you can probably work around that by pressing f1, moving the cursor away from the border, closing f1 and continuing to move the cursor
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π try desktop fullscreen in graphic settings
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> I assume it already is in fullscreen
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> I played it on the same machine a few weeks ago and it was in fullscreen
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "desktop fullscreen" and "fullscreen" are two different settings in the ddnet client
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can imagine this problem happening with "fullscreen", less likely with "desktop fullscreen"
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bo
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens if you try that?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where does the cursor appear when you press f1?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> will try next time, anyways thats not nice that it happens at all
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> f1 cursor moves the same as ingame
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> position is the same
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> obviously. but it might help debugging the problem
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in spectator mode I don't have a cursor
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> obviously, lol
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and ingame it's not the same cursor
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but there is a cursor, indirectly
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for me
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i go to f1, move thr cursor right, then go ingame and move it left, open f1 i see the cursor at the left
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Unfortunately game isn't running at all so I can't change any settings. I assume there is a way to do it through config files?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so what I thought might have happened is that your OS cursor ends up on the right side of your screen and cannot move right anymore (thus leading to the "invisible wall" behavior)
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was trying to figure out if it is that by asking the questions abvoe
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I got interviewed on Carnival by some youtuber https://youtu.be/AV23hbBPxD4?t=693 and some random streamer chick called me conspiracist lol
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well it doesnt happen regularly
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> lol are you propagating arch linux everywhere? xddddd
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but if it happens ur confused af at first, then you know it and its annoying
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:p
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π)
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> gotta use em opportunitie
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> s
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol nice
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish i understood everything but i heard linux and open source
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Well it‚Äôs not me obv I‚Äôm joking \:D but I can still identify with that dude
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not as fun then
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I saw chillerdragon before, and I was confused
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not that good with faces so I assumed I must be misremembering
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> so you are simping for that random german girl, aren't ya?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hahaha lmao Heinrich
