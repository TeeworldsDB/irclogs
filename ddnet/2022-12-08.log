00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's true, I think
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should integrate it into the game, I guess
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The option is there in case the game doesn't start at all
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should catch that from the game
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Rightclick the game > Manage > Add desktop shortcut
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jore ^
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Even faster: add the desktop shortcut to taskbar ^^
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jore> yea no i prefer to keep desktop and taskbar clean and launch all games through steam thanks anyway :). Wouldn't it be possible to it in form of rightclicking the game -> properties -> and set launch options with a command so the people who know what they play with can choose how it starts there
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't find a way to do that in Steam settings
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So what heinrich5991 suggests would be the cleanest solution
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Alternative: Right click steam system tray icon and select the game there
06:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How do you make two packets interact with each other in the case of a `void CExample::OnMessage( ... )`? I want an action to occur, but since I added an extra packet as an extension to the other one, I want both to read off one another when the information is all recieved on both ends.
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> decide which to send first (probably the extension). when it arrives, store its data in a variable, and only take the action once you get the other packet
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what packet are you talking about? ðŸ™‚
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Sv_KillMsg and Sv_KillMsgTeams
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> But yeah that makes a lot of sense, having the extension send first.
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Only problem is, when the team actually DOES die, I want to calculate the team size so that I can properly adjust the killfeed
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1050285045912457257/image.png
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> This is probably an ugly way of doing it
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can calculate the team size beforehand, send the message and then start killing players
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there might even be a function for calculating the team size(?)
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm gone for 1.5 h
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Alright
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i never had an issue with it, for me more stable than pulseaudio :D
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen we managed to interleave our part 1 and part 2 ranks again
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> perfectly fair, we both get the same amount of points ^^
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> today my code isn't really readable, but it works I guess
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1050434797706682488/8.hs
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so i start later, but finish faster ðŸ˜„
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't like my solution today either, didn't find any nice tricks, but also didn't look that closely
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1050435063050928238/day08.py
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I like your part 2, I wouldn't have considered using lambdas there
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At first I had it in long form and then made it more compact once it worked
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Hey guys, do you know how i get the exact player objects who are on screen here and discard those who are slightly outside but still rendered?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1050491470668378194/image.png
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://letsencrypt.org/2022/12/05/ed-letter-2022.html
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (rust mentioned)
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know. Why?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> For this feature i try to implement. https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/994591252819488848
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> I want to be able to hover over a group of people and with a special spectator mode be able to watch only those. Atm i only watch the rendered ones, so if e.g. /showall is activated its broken
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> And i have to care about aspect ratio too, so i cant just calculate
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what exactly is the problem
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just iterate over the players and look which is inside and which is outside
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> zoom level and ascept ratio are in client
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is a calcscreenparams or smth in graphics_threaded
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> How do i know what is inside my view?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> ah
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if player.x > screenleft etc xd
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maplayers.cpp can be useful
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it uses the math quite often
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aScreen[4] or smth
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah and make sure to scale player pos to viewport size
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think its different to physical sizes
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Thanks jupstar, i will see if i can make it work
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's extremely impressive how well bluez and pipewire work together
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For once in my life something was extremely streamlined on linux, I connected my bluetooth headphones and they justworked(tm)
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I disconnect them, music pauses, pipewire switches output back to builtin speakers
