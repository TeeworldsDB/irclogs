00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> i think im overthinking it
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> no I think you are right... you can also use the finish time... team members would have the same time... But I think that team ranks, with same members get not converted to t0 ranks if they get overwritten... maybe you test it out xD
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> no I think you are right... you can also use the finish time... team members would have the same time... But I think that team ranks, with same members get not converted to t0 ranks if they get overwritten... maybe you test it out xD (or look it up in the code!?)
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they still go into regular t0 ranks even if they get overwritten

15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Product created on: 31.05.2022
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Cancellation possible 31 days before end of the minimum contract length
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Possible cancellation (if cancelled today: 30.07.2022)
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I also fear this xD I just rented it... ðŸ˜¦
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will try to cancel it via mail
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can cancel via your widerrufsrecht
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the customer control panel
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just called them... they told that the system always adds one day so it does not think you would cancel the contract at the same day as you buy it. If you cancel at the same day via mail and tell them that you want to cancel for the 30.06.2022 it works, additionaly you could use the "Satisfaction guarantee" and get full price back after 30 days
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the mess I made of the windows logger should be looked at again sometime
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what mess did you make out of the windows logger?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Windows really wanted utf16 for some reason and I implemented it but it's not very correct, you might be running in mintty under windows which wants utf8 instead
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ad-hoc implementation of utf8 -> utf16 I made should probably be replaced with a winapi call too
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also doubt that it works well with output redirection
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: can I recommend `set -o errexit; set -o nounset; set -o pipefail` to you?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also maybe `mktemp -d`

19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> your computer is slow? No way, I think it is your monitor! My monitor? I have never heard a monitor can be slow....

20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> For what?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also do you still need something regarding the integration test? Iâ€™m mobile -.-Check the integration\_test/ directory there is logs of client and server.

22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> just kidding, i think i pay way to much for my uberspace, while not using it so much
