00:03 < Ameb> i dont remember when i closed irc
00:04 < Ameb> did i miss smth deen 
00:04 < Ameb> last i said was about playing tutorial map
00:07 <@deen> nope, missed nothing
00:07 <@deen> yes, that's a good idea and many people tried that already
00:07 <@deen> but i'm not convinced that the tutorial should be local
00:07 <@deen> instead it should be online, so people immediately get used to their regular ping
00:07 <@deen> and it should be advised when you start the client for the first time
00:08 <@deen> and the tutorial could make use of special client features, doesn't need to be a regular map
00:08 <@deen> but the important part is that it can be played alone with some kind of serverside automatic dummy and explains the game well
00:09 <@deen> for some tries for such tutorial maps see the 1 star novice maps
00:09 < Ameb> someone said about localized map
00:09 < Ameb> translated one
00:10 < Ameb> each region has is own official language?
00:10 < Ameb> ger- eng chl-spanish rus-rus
00:11 <@deen> that's more of an afterthought
00:11 <@deen> first it has to be great in english, then afterwards you can translate it, sure
00:12 < Ameb> true
00:13 < Ameb> should it be played with dummy, with bots, what happens if noone is online :?
00:13 <@deen> with a serverside intelligent dummy :P
00:13 < Ameb> ahá
00:14 < Ameb> that seems kinda hard to do
00:16 <@deen> the dummy could just execute some predefined sequence of inputs. you could gather that sequence by recording a player
00:16 <@deen> then the dummy gets triggered and does that stuff to teach the player
00:17 < Ameb> what about adding a trigger who shows 2 ghost players doing it
00:17 <@deen> nope, sounds difficult to follow, especially for a noob
00:19 < Ameb> have you played hdp obstaculos
00:21 <@deen> no
00:25 < Ameb> its a map about easy drags
00:25 < Ameb> and get harder and harder
00:27 <@deen> ok, then i know it
15:47 < Ryozuki> hi
15:56 <@deen> hi
16:14 < o_be_one> lo
16:33 < Ryozuki> ah
16:34 < Ryozuki> !ddos
16:34 < Ryozuki> ;(ç
16:39 <@deen> definitely something strange network-wise, reported it
16:43 <@deen> there were a few ddos notifications today, so might be related
16:44 <@deen> 25% packet loss and 250 ping, but only on some ports
16:47 < Ryozuki> it's true
16:47 < Ryozuki> only half people are laghging
16:48 <@deen> if you restart your client you have a 50% chance of the problem being gone!
16:48 < Ryozuki> xD
16:48 < Ryozuki> im on a half map (naufrage)
16:48 < Ryozuki> on the half of the map*
16:48 <@deen> simulate a timeout and use timeout protection
16:49 < Ryozuki> i stop it in task bar?
16:49 < Ryozuki> or i have to shut down internet?
16:49 <@deen> Ryozuki: no idea, killall -9 DDNet works for me
16:49 < Ryozuki> fck
16:49 < Ryozuki> m
16:49 < Ryozuki> where i put that?
16:50 < Ryozuki> or you use ubuntu?
16:50 <@deen> yeah, that's on linux
16:50 < Ryozuki> anyway
16:50 < Ryozuki> all people failing near me cuz lags xD
16:50 < o_be_one> Ryozuki: what you host ?
16:50 < Ryozuki> we failed all!
16:50 < Ryozuki> a group of 10 failed xDD
16:50 < Ryozuki> nope
16:51 < Ryozuki> i host the wiki
16:51 < Ryozuki> but not servers
16:51 < o_be_one> k
17:27 <@deen> > Internap appears to be experiencing an internal problem in Frankfurt that is causing some random periods of packet loss for some clients there during DDoS attacks that should not be causing problems. We are currently following up with them about this.
17:30 < o_be_one> deen: what about ger2 btw ?
17:31 <@deen> o_be_one: the ddos protection blocked all kinds of valid stuff and wihtout it we can't run a server
17:33 < o_be_one> Oo
17:33 < o_be_one> it was already fixed no ?
17:35 <@deen> no
17:36 <@deen> even an ssh connection to the server takes 1 minute for me
17:38 < Ryozuki> i think now is fixed
17:39 < o_be_one> i'll have to check that so
17:46 < Stitch626> ssl-pub/privatekey of teeworlds.tw: http://pastebin.com/gYFhtUaM
17:47 <@deen> ...
17:47 < o_be_one> Oo
17:47 <@deen> EastByte: ping
17:47 < o_be_one> this guy is weird
17:50 < Ryozuki> oh isnt fixed i think
17:50 < Ryozuki> trhat is the private key of teeworlds?
17:51 < Ryozuki> dafuq
17:53 < WolfAlex> no noone cares about that key
17:54 < WolfAlex> my key
17:59 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: lol its your private key x) ?
18:00 < WolfAlex> yea only website... but the website is not 'public' yet, so idc
18:00 < WolfAlex> he is just pissed
18:07 < o_be_one> x)
18:07 < o_be_one> stitch is someone weird, really
18:15 < fstd> you can be rather sure that whoever obtained the keys wasn't stitch
18:15 < fstd> he isn't very talented
18:15 < o_be_one> sure
18:18 < fstd> maybe the R can give you some rust protips
18:18 < fstd> w/c
18:25 < WolfAlex> fstd: well, it was my fault xd
18:25 < WolfAlex> was @setting server up
18:25 < WolfAlex> did not change permissions on nginx/ssl
18:25 < WolfAlex> ._.
18:26 < fstd> ah, i assumed it was heartbleeded or so
20:01 < Ryozuki> its me or webpage dont load?
20:01 < Ryozuki> :(
20:02 <@deen> Nope, wasn't just you
20:24 <@deen> i wonder if any hoster even reads abuse mails
20:30 <@deen> Oh well: abuse@sinor.ru: SMTP error from remote server for RCPT TO command, host: bell.sinor.ru (92.127.157.169) reason: 550 unknown user
20:30 <@deen> That answers my question
22:11 < fstd> write to postmaster@ instead :)
22:11 < fstd> can be reasonably sure that account at least exists
22:12 < fstd> whether or not someone reads it is a different question ofc
23:41 < Ameb> Hello
