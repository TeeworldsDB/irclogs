00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> docker for windows is seriously such a mess....
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> ... windows is seriously such a mess ...
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Ddnet too
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> that too but if a company has the resources to fix their mess it's docker
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Vali the ddoser is such a mess..
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> I mean they acknowledged the bug that they are trying to start the containers mounting the host system earlier than the host system mount is available 1.5 years ago which results in people having to restart containers mounting the host system manually everytime they restart the system
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> does vali have any valid reason why he is behaving like a mistreat child?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why u even use windows for whathever u are doing?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> games and I have to maintain the infrastructure in the company I'm working with where 50% is working with windows
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> and I actually like powershell  while I'm at it
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I use docker only for one thing, mailcow and it really makes ugly when i use df -h to see the remaining space on my system

12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> having a clean system is awesome for testing and development in general
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Looks good eh
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> just remove the unused containers
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> just remove the unused containers/images/volumes
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> got 0 problems with docker on linux environments but since they are the first company actually doing something with Hyper-V it's a freaking mess in windows
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> well rant over
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I also got 0 problems
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ™‚
