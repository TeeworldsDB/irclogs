08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I usually have 2-3 fallback internets at my disposal but maybe Iâ€™m just flexing my 1st world city life. Where I have a phone with internet and cafes with free internet.Currently when the server goes down nothing is saved anyways. There was a issue discussing if during ddos it should hold the gamestate but I forgot what happened. And if the server crashes due to a actual crash the server also does not save since it is not a feature.

10:08 <+ChillerDragon> @noby?
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> deen: did i ever tell you that i appreciate you being so fast at merging?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no problem, simple change
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> still
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> gitlab ðŸ¤“
10:27 <+ChillerDragon> ikr im thinking about doing a big gitlab pr :D
10:27 <+ChillerDragon> deen: whats ur opinion on that? i would add like 3 more gitlab yamls is that cool?
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> i understand that ddnet is github only but imo it would be cool to have forks not having to reinvent the wheel for gitlab pipelines
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any idea whats going on here? my curses build gitlab pipeline broke after the rust stuff was added https://gitlab.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/-/jobs/3384569397
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> still works fine on my machine and used to work fine on gitlab too
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> its "just" the test stage but still its annoying
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> i assume i gotta link curses during that test hmm
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> but why doenst it break locally then
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Gitlab rly cool
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i managed to reproduce it in a docker file hmm still super confused on how to fix it. ``wget -O Dockerfile https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Wn && docker build .`` fails with this log :( https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/LB no idea why the rust test does not lik curses it seems to be linked fine 
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> neutral. donâ€˜t care for it, donâ€˜t care enough against it to stop you
