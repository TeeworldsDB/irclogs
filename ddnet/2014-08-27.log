00:09 < Savander> MEH
00:09 < Savander> why! Xd
00:09 <@deen> i don't do map decisions^^
00:09 < Savander> :(
00:09 <@deen> but we need more testers
00:09 < Savander> who?
00:09 < Savander> saavik?
00:09 <@deen> some maps are untested for 1 month
00:09 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/staff
00:10 < Savander> heh
00:10 < Savander> :)
00:10 <@deen> but testers so inactive =/
00:10 <@deen> if you're bored, please test some maps
00:10 <@deen> and write your opinion in forum
00:10 < Savander> I will stay in c++ and other languages 
00:10 < Savander> ;D
00:10 < Savander> my opinion

00:11 <@deen> about the map
00:11 < Savander> ah
00:11 < Savander> i didn't saw this
00:11 < Savander> [00:10] <@deen> if you're bored, please test some maps

00:29 < Savander> :)
00:29 < Savander> idk but, its funny bug
00:29 <@deen> somehow it's not reset properly
00:30 <@deen> maybe you can try if it always happens
00:30 <@deen> with your dummy horde

13:06 < CookieMichal> D:
13:06 < EastByte> Savander
13:06 < CookieMichal> http://ddforce.net/ best site ever :>
13:06 < CookieMichal> Index of /
13:06 < CookieMichal> Savander should add index.hmtl / index.php :I
13:07 < Savander> specjalnie
13:07 < Savander> tak zrobilem
13:07 < CookieMichal> : I
13:07 < Savander> dodalem zeby indexowalo wszystko
13:07 < Savander> ;D
13:07 < CookieMichal> bez sensu ;-;

13:07 < CookieMichal> lepiej to w PHP zrobic i zeby jakos wygladalo :I
13:08 < Savander> nie chce mi sie
13:08 < Savander> ;I
13:08 < CookieMichal> my IRC client rulz http://is.gd/jKr71U
13:09 < EastByte> ya it does
13:10 < CookieMichal> When I type deen it suggests me deed :I
13:10 < CookieMichal> is there a command to slap someone? :D
13:12 < EastByte> it's a 'feature' of the quaketnet webchat client
13:12 < CookieMichal> deen Linux i686 :D
13:14 <@deen> hm?
13:14 < CookieMichal> You are currently on Linux i686
13:14 < CookieMichal> :>
13:14 <@deen> how would you know?
13:15 < EastByte> ctcp
13:15 < CookieMichal> I call it *magic*
13:15 < CookieMichal> Thanks EastByte :c
13:15 < CookieMichal> irssi v0.8.16 - running on Linux i686
13:15 <@deen> yes
13:15 <@deen> but irc bouncer on x86_64
13:15 <@deen> and my ssh connection from x86_64 too^^
13:15 < EastByte> interesting
13:15 < CookieMichal> xD
13:16 < EastByte> I think ctcp is the only thing that makes irc unsafe
13:16 < CookieMichal> :D
13:18 < EastByte> and now that guy is tracing my channels
13:18 < CookieMichal> XD
13:36 < laxa_work> I am back !
13:37 < laxa_work> Fuck me, I bought Chupa Chups at lunch, can't open them T_T.
13:39 < EastByte> xd
13:40 < EastByte> you might be a little bit too old for that
13:40 < laxa_work> Well, I paid 8.5 with a lunch check, and my meal was 7.8, so I had to fill the rest with these...
13:42 < EastByte> well you can give me some
13:43 < laxa_work> And tell me how kids are suppose to open them if I can't !
13:43 < laxa_work> Well, I finally opened it.
13:44 < EastByte> for a kid opening sweets is the easiest thing
13:45 < CookieMichal>  Hahaha xD
13:46 < CookieMichal> http://is.gd/rbMJDg
13:47 < laxa_work> Just use irssi on a remote server, you'll never loose any logs...
13:51 < EastByte> yep, my logs are really old
13:58 < EastByte> deen: if I do 'import zlib' is all the zlib stuff included in my current namespace?
13:58 < EastByte> I would rather like to access it via zlib.name
14:05 <@deen> yes it is
14:05 <@deen> but you can still use zlib.name
14:06 < EastByte> but what if zlib includes types I've already defined in a different way?
14:06 <@deen> then it depends on how you use them
14:06 < EastByte> wouldn't it be more save to let zlib have its own space only?
14:06 <@deen> if the type signature makes the usage obvious, then the correct one is used, otherwise you can use zlib.name
14:06 <@deen> or you can exclude imports
14:06 <@deen> save?
14:08 < EastByte> well it adds symbols to my namespace I don't know about so I etsimate it as unsafe
14:08 < EastByte> I wanted to say safe :D
14:09 <@deen> hm, i don'T know
14:09 < Savander> What are you talking about?
14:10 < EastByte> so import zlib is like "from zlib import *" in python
14:10 <@deen> yes
14:10 < EastByte> hm
14:11 <@deen> i haven't had a problem with it
14:11 <@deen> but first i thought the same
14:11 < EastByte> I guess there won't be any problem because the compiler warns about ambiguous types
14:11 <@deen> yeah
14:11 <@deen> unlike python :P
14:11 < EastByte> ye
14:12 <@deen> hmmm, i think one time i used a wrong function because of this
14:12 < EastByte> ambiguous <- I have no idea how to memorize that spelling
14:12 <@deen> but still a nice tradeoff for not writing "from foo import *" and foo.name
14:14 < EastByte> hm might be a problem if you import a second module later which creates ambiguous situations
14:15 <@deen> compile time error then
14:15 < EastByte> yes
14:15 < EastByte> and a lot of fixing
14:15 < EastByte> maybe
14:19 < Savander> EastByte: look, cool browser
14:19 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/
14:19 < Savander> xd
14:19 < Savander> XD

14:24 < EastByte> is the server running in china?
14:24 <@deen> yes

17:44 < Savander> i have exec
17:44 < Savander> where he will be executed

18:07 < laxa> How to do that ?
18:07 <@deen> i don't know
18:07 < laxa> xD
18:08 <@deen> but what i do is this: telnet ts.ddnet.tw 10011
18:08 <@deen> and serverinfo
18:08 < laxa> 10011 is default port ?
18:08 <@deen> says "error id=2568 msg=insufficient\sclient\spermissions failed_permid=13"
18:08 <@deen> yes, for server queries it is
18:09 <@deen> afk
18:26 < Savander> deen: 
18:26 < Savander> how to execute map config? Its possible on vanilla type?
18:29 < Savander> nvm
18:32 < laxa> Savander: as far as I know, you can make a nameMap.cfg in the same folder, it will be automatically called.
18:32 < Savander> nope
18:32 < Savander> only in ddrace
18:32 < laxa> Just watch the logs of your server, the server will say.
18:32 < laxa> Hum...
18:32 < laxa> deen: it should be good !
18:32 < Savander> I had to add in the code
18:33 < Savander> this
18:33 < Savander> str_format(buf, sizeof(buf), "maps/%s.cfg", g_Config.m_SvMap);  	Console()->ExecuteFile(buf);
18:41 < Savander> WOW
18:41 < Savander> weird
18:41 < Savander> i can't sent gametype to CTF

19:11 < laxa> deen: the failed_permit is still 13 ?
19:12 <@deen> yes
19:12 < laxa> Meh, what framework are you trying to use ?
19:12 <@deen> laxa: telnet is no framework^^
19:12 < laxa> Yeah I know.
19:16 < Savander> add to quest

19:16 < Savander> then deen, could connect
19:18 < laxa> I did
19:18 < laxa> deen: what IP should I whitelist ?
19:18 <@deen> ddnet.tw
19:20 < laxa> deen: it's working from my computer.
19:20 <@deen> you just do telnet and serverinfo?
19:20 <@deen> not working for me
19:21 < laxa> hum wait I try again

22:27 < _KinG> hi deen 
22:27 < _KinG> deen: what's the rcon password?
22:31 <@deen> hi
22:31 <@deen> Chicken_: yes
22:31 < Chicken_> Ok
22:38 < laxa> deen: ok, I know how to query now
22:39 < laxa> connect to telnet ts.ddnet.tw on port 10011
22:39 < laxa> type this
22:39 < laxa> use port=9987
22:39 < laxa> then you can do channellist & clientlist
22:39 < EastByte> lol I thought only ts2 has such kind of thing
22:40 < laxa> EastByte: TS3 is really complex and full of options...
22:40 < laxa> their documentation wants to be nice but seems out of date on nearly everything
22:40 < Savander> EastByte: 
22:40 < Savander> https://docs.planetteamspeak.com/ts3/php/framework/
22:40 <@deen> wtf
22:41 <@deen> strange stuff, thanks laxa
22:41 < laxa> all permissions have been set for people to use serverlist
22:41 < laxa> but that doesn't work
22:41 < laxa> and I am mad cause I don't understand why !
22:43 < bor> laxa how do you manage your teamspeak server ?
22:43 < laxa> What do you mean ?
22:43 < bor> there is a program called YaTQA
22:44 < bor> if you don't have it i suggest you install it
22:44 < bor> it has many options that are not there in teamspeak client
22:44 < bor> to manage server
22:44 < Savander> eq.
22:44 < Savander> invisible groups?
22:44 < Savander> or not?
22:45 < laxa> You can do everything in command line afaik.
22:45 < laxa> You dont need YaTQA
22:45 < bor> kind of , for example Server Query Admin group is not there in teamspeak client 
22:45 < bor> but you can give it to users with yatqa
22:45 < laxa> Hum...
22:45 < laxa> Is that really usefull ?
22:45 < laxa> I'd like to have the Server Query Admin group xD
22:46 < bor> depends 
22:46 < bor> if there is more than one admin and you want to have a group others can't get from you
22:46 < bor> it is useful 
22:46 < Savander> bor: 
22:46 < bor> otherwise not really , but that is not the only feature in yatqa
22:46 < Savander> possible
22:46 < Savander> tto add invisible
22:46 < Savander> group?
22:47 < Savander> Smth like Server Query ADmin
22:47 < Savander> ?
22:47 < laxa> bor: I am the only admin and it'll stay that way.
22:47 < laxa> deen: I just compiled the last ddnet sources, no sv_kill_protection on client
22:47 < Savander> its not
22:47 < Savander> client feature
22:47 < Savander> its server feature
22:47 < bor> depends on what do you mean by invisible group , server query admin is not invisible because it states that a user has it if you click on them , it is just absent from the right click menu server groups
22:48 < Savander> its inbisible
22:48 < Savander> you can add this rang
22:48 < Savander> without console
22:48 < Savander> and this rang have no place on list
22:48 < laxa> bor: where do I get YaTQA ?
22:49 < bor> you can find it on teamspeak forums
22:49 < bor> here http://forum.teamspeak.com/showthread.php/65770-YaTQA-Query-Admin-Tool
22:50 < laxa> Well
22:50 < laxa> This is for windows !
22:50 < Savander> btw
22:51 < Savander> it's no that hard.. and i guess laxa
22:51 < bor> it runs in wine
22:51 < Savander> it need Server Query ADmin
22:51 < Savander> so..
22:51 < bor> i have ubuntu
22:51 < bor> and it works nicely 
22:51 < laxa> I don't have wine
22:51 < laxa> Anyway, I don't really need it
22:51 < bor> its free , i run many programs in wine , although there is nothing you can do in yatqa which you can't by typing in commands manually in query admin
22:52 < bor> but its just nicer and easier to have a gui
22:52 < EastByte> then you don't want to see my desktop :D
22:53 < bor> why , whats in your desktop :-s
22:53 < Savander> btw
22:53 < laxa> bor: you can't run YaTQa on a server without any graphical environment anyway.
22:53 < Savander> its really similar
22:53 < Savander> to TS3 official
22:53 < Savander> permission editor
22:53 < EastByte> bor: looks more like this http://i.imgur.com/lfZU2.png
22:53 < Savander> you can't do nothing more in this program
22:53 < Savander> Oh sorry
22:53 < Savander> you can move, or send message
22:54 < Savander> to all 
22:54 < Savander> in one moment
22:54 < Savander> xd
22:54 < bor> EastByte: Scary :-s
22:55 < bor> laxa: you don't run it on server , you run it on your own computer and give it connection information 
22:56 < bor> Savander: it has neat features , i usually move users with it while i'm not in server , they can't see me in server and it says they have been moved by serveradmin xD
22:57 < Savander> as you can see
22:57 < Savander> laxa, don't have serveradmin password
22:57 < Savander> so it's useless for him
22:57 < laxa> I know how to set it up now
22:57 < laxa> I thought I couldn't, it was worked in the documentation, but apparently you can.
22:57 < laxa> deen: are you here ?
22:58 < Savander> you can't do everything laxa
22:58 < Savander> IF you don't have SA
22:58 < Savander> :/
22:58 < Savander> SQA*
22:59 <@deen> laxa: what?
23:00 < laxa> deen: I just compiled the last sources and there is no sv_kill_protection
23:00 < EastByte> laxa :/
23:00 <@deen> laxa: me too and here it works
23:01 <@deen> laxa: maybe you're in f1 instead of f2?^^
23:02 < laxa> Oh...
23:02 < EastByte> 22:50:10      Savander | its not
23:02 < EastByte> 22:50:14      Savander | client feature
23:02 < EastByte> 22:50:17      Savander | its server feature
23:02 < EastByte> :D
23:02 < Savander> xd
23:02 < laxa> I thought that was in client that you could configure it deen xD
23:03 <@deen> laxa: nope!
23:04 <@deen> but if you're really dedicated to killing yourself accidentally you can always bind k "kill; say /kill"
23:04 < laxa> what is sv_kill_protection on ddnet then ?
23:04 <@deen> it's the time when kill protection starts
23:04 <@deen> 20 = 20 minutes
23:04 <@deen> 0 = off
23:05 < laxa> yeah I knoiw that
23:05 < laxa> but what's his value on ddnet
23:05 < _KinG> deen: 
23:05 < Savander> 20
23:05 < _KinG> deen: why do i can't force vote? :|
23:05 < laxa> bor: can you tell me how to enable server query group admin on YaTQa ? :)
23:05 < Savander> value = minutes
23:06 <@deen> _KinG: i don't know how you force
