01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> Hi all, I want to make a feature request.
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> It will be good to have a special `keep_pos_reload` command in ddnet testing servers. This command will reload the server and move tees to the positions they had before reload. This will help a lot
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @skua https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/585
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Basically save all Player and character variables
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am completely new to databases and MySQL, how do i set up a database with entries i can decide to save and how do i call to save the vars i want on disconnect and all that stuff that is needed for accounts? :) If anyone has the time around noon/afternoon helping me setting that up, id be very happy ^^
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> sometimes the map browser doesnt show all maps of a category
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ive added server side bots, 1 sec after i connect them the server crashes, how do i check the issue?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> run the server with gdb?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what do you mean @Im 'corneum
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> jao, https://wiki.debian.org/HowToGetABacktrace
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fokkonaut*
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> debian lol
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that onbo uses windows and btw he fixed the thing with visualstudio debugger
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Jao indeed, sorry.
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used gdb on windows when I was on windows
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its shit, the visual thing is so much better
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gdb ftw
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's shit? I've accomplished much more in gdb then on the visual studio debugger, the included debugger in visualstudio wishes it could be the crippled cousin of gdb
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Terribly hard to set watches, terribly hard to observe memory, terribly hard to observe locals
19:17 <@heinrich5991> I was able to use the visual studio debugger without googling first, I wasn't able to use the gdb debugger without googling first
19:17 <@heinrich5991> apparently the visual studio debugger is also good at something
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> debugging something simple that can be solved with a backtrace, sure you can do without googling, anything else tough luck
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> Can someon tell me how i can use curl in  the DDNet source? Im getting undefined reference to `curl_global_init' etc
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Brian checkout updater.cpp
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> i dont have this file
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> ah found it sorry
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> src/engine/client/http.cpp helping alot
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> wtf why is CURL *pHandle = curl_easy_init(); working in src/engine/client/http.cpp but not in src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp (only for example) i already checked headers
20:20 <@heinrich5991> what's the error message?
20:21 <@heinrich5991> ah, probably because the server doesn't link curl
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> And how can i fix it? Its a cmake thing i guess
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Check CMakeLists.txt where we add CURL_LIBRARIES to LIBS_CLIENT
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you'll need it in LIBS_SERVER too
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brian> @deen thanks its working now ðŸ˜ƒ
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ðŸ˜ƒ
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> could "message of the day" be renamed to mapinfo or something? it doesnt really fit its purpose on ddnet servers
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who cares
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> me
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and maybe new players
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to think the ddnet mod is not used only in ddnet servers
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mod is useful and widely used
23:02 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motd_(Unix)
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet servers use it for map info
23:03 <@heinrich5991> it's a known term
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well thats fucked
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> many many games use motd
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> must be a programmers thing. i didnt knew about it at all
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u never hosted
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a game server then
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not a programmer thing
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u probs use windows
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows doesnt have any motd
