00:26 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Thanks @ReiTW didn‚Äôt know exec has new crew members
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well it was easy to spot that it was exec behind lol
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! ùêìùêÉùêåüè¥ Ol√≠mpiaÊ≠ª> guys my game doesn't open, it even opens but dps closes out of nowhere nor does the game screen appear and still bugs the windows that are open someone help me please
09:17 <@deen> on Windows? Is there an error message?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <manu> the audacity to even ask that question üê¥ üëç
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> open the client from the commandline and check if there something in the log
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/828919674661109780/unknown.png
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should know where this is from
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I forgot
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki want something to be pissed at before lunch?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 whats the most famous piece of software that disregards copyrigth?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sqlite
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/uuid.c
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found something you'd love to be annoyed at
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> show
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you ever seen an "Ethical Source" license?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh no
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it like those CoC with an agenda
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They call it "Open Source: Evolved"
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_Insane:531555386453655582>
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dislike even the term open source
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The license gives you right to not let anyone who you don't agree with politically not use your code üòÑ
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its overtaken by corporations who want software without giving back
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I have an extra not there
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yes i seen it somewhere
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It let's you basically disallow people from using your code if you don't like them
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats so orwellian
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ethicalsource.dev/
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this is so wrong, firstly because each person has their own definition of whats ethical
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First time I spotted sth like this. I immediately knew this sort of stuff would catch on
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/828921772178407435/Screenshot_2021-04-06_at_11.18.38.png
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should see the way the person who started this movement (also the person who started the CoC thing) operates. I'd argue it's extremely unethical to threaten developers and communities into adopting these things
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 does this license hold in a court case?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> She basically swoops in, says either you adopt this or you are a sexist+racist+unethical project and I'll make sure every one of my twitter checkmark buddies and media friends lets everyone know
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt this violate some rights of "freedom of thought" or whathever
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm, never tested obviously, I think GPLv2 is the only one tested in US courts. It probably should hold though, you have a lot of rights on intellectual property
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no "freedom of thought" per se
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u know the gnome executive director is a bit like this
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://twitter.com/nmcgovern>
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another reason to avoid this js shitfest
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> most of the debian board is like this too
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt know something like gnome had a executive director
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we went way too corporate üò¶
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually love rust governance
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.rust-lang.org/governance
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wish we could turn back time, to the good old days when people just coded and there was a maintainer
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Each major decision in Rust starts as a Request for Comments (RFC). Everyone is invited to discuss the proposal, to work toward a shared understanding of the tradeoffs. Though sometimes arduous, this community deliberation is Rust‚Äôs secret sauce for quality.
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not board of directors, 50 layers of stakeholders, 20 companies funding a project injecting their ideals
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the current hot topic is https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/03/18/async-vision-doc.html
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I currently have a huge aversion to the word "foundation"
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/welcome.html>
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like corporate interests and corporate way sneaking their way in hiding under the guise of being "non-profit", only there for "guidance"
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in rust the foundation is separated from the governance tho
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hopefully rust wont suffer the fate of others where the foundation will provide more and more "guidance" until you don't even notice they are the "governance"
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I especially love what happened to LLVM where the maintainer aligned so well with the corporate interests that he just directly became the chair of the foundation
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> direct conversion
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw did u know there is an (independent) project to create a new compile target appart from llvm: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's also gcc-rs
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and mrustc (this one only for bootstrapping though)
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the state of gcc is a little sad :/
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (gcc-rs is in development, mrustc can already be used for bootstrapping 1.19, 1.29 and 1.39
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> )
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if any of you ever dug into the gcc source, it's actually one of the dirtiest codebases I've encountered, would take months to get acquainted
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even for the smallest of change
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard boostrapping is really important for safety or something like that
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it helps against the trusting trust attack
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> clang on the other hand is actually quite pleasant to read
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/828925463632150558/unknown.png
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good explanation
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my sql queries are checked for correctness at compile time ‚òï
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/828932287638536223/unknown.png
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is one thing I love about having an ORM library, another is the ability to version schema changes
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really think using raw sql is mostly obsolete now with how good ORMs are at creating queries for most usecases
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this thing im showing is not a orm library xd
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i see what you mean
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most libraries today where you write sql make it really easy to serialize the data back and forth
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, you have a sql library that can check schema?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i like how much more control i have
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses rust macros
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does it know what schema to check?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using a env var
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u put it in the .env file
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, okay thats also nice
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/sqlx/0.5.1/sqlx/macro.query.html
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe try an ORM next time, it's really pretty imo, and you can always do raw queries if you need the fine control
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/828974672866836510/unknown.png
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i used a orm lot of times
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know I hate convenient stuff, so if I like it you know it's actually useful :P
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:ferris_bongo:813480034349744150> :ferris: :ferris_happy: :ferris_hello: :corro:

22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 soon u will have to embrace rust
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i thought that client has lazy-load feature, interesting
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has a skin fetcher, which kinda is. but not for local skin files
