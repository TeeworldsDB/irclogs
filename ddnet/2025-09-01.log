06:29 < bridge> <blazulite> MELON
06:29 < bridge> <blazulite> HI
06:29 < bridge> <blazulite> CHECK THE DDNET-RS SERVER
06:29 < bridge> <teero777> melone on XP?!
06:30 < bridge> <melon> <a:catcry:853242701745750097>
06:30 < bridge> <melon> Testing my visualization, this is the PC I got connected to the sps
06:30 < bridge> <melon> I hate it hete
06:30 < bridge> <teero777> Honestly xp has the same standing as Linux for me
06:30 < bridge> <melon> I hate it here
06:30 < bridge> <teero777> xp is good
06:31 < bridge> <teero777> I was on xp for 5 yrs of my life
06:31 < bridge> <teero777> very great years
06:32 < bridge> <teero777> now I'm on Linux and I code shit. Back on xp I was playing lucky luke demo edition
06:32 < bridge> <teero777> And Autobahn Raser
06:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> uh i didnt route the old domain, my web is edgl.dev, the old domain is a redirect, ill fix it
06:35 < bridge> <totar> 7 also good, equal to xp for me
06:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> winshit
06:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> linux best
06:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> win xp isnt good u just have "old memories" aka nostalgia
06:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> most nostalgic things arent good too
06:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
06:36 < bridge> <totar> idk what you mean, from a design an usability perspective I think microsoft peaked between xp and 7. after that they went downhill with UX
06:37 < bridge> <teero777> I think from 7 onwards it started to go down hill
06:37 < bridge> <totar> idk what you mean, from a design and usability perspective I think microsoft peaked between xp and 7. after that they went downhill with UX
06:37 < bridge> <teero777> I mean 7 is great
06:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> well not just downhill with ux but also they went more corpo with ads and stuff, and the main menu is web based
06:37 < bridge> <totar> so you agree :D
06:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i agree that xp  was better than win nowadays
06:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> not that it was the best
06:38 < bridge> <totar> what was best then
06:38 < bridge> <totar> 8.1?
06:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> personally i find the best a wm but im a nerd
06:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> twm*
06:38 < bridge> <totar> twm?
06:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> not windows
06:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean
06:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
06:38 < bridge> <teero777> terminal things
06:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> twm tiling window manager
06:39 < bridge> <totar> the convo was about best windows OS version
06:39 < bridge> <totar> :/
06:39 < bridge> <teero777> I mean tiling window managers are great. Maybe I should make my desktop and everything and win7 rice
06:39 < bridge> <teero777> Would be funny
06:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a linux de window sthemed for kde iirc
06:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.haiku-os.org/ 
06:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> this looks a bit like old windows
06:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1411933699817078895/4-no-bfs-alert.png?ex=68b6753a&is=68b523ba&hm=9c77dbf559c44c044b078681697bc688d2da6aade989ade5d6bb76af73daf0c3&
06:40 < bridge> <totar> I use windows for software compatibility, not UX. but everything is broken on windows 11 anyway so I'll switch to linux next time I format a boot drive.
06:40 < bridge> <teero777> os version I think winxp or win7 would be the best. any Linux based OS doesn't really have a major version imo so it's not something I can be nostalgic about.
06:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> goood
06:41 < bridge> <teero777> I still think aero was goated
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> well problem is 32bit was rly constrained
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ram and such
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i remember when 64 bit was becoming more famous
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think i also heard lot of ppl say 64bit is slower smh
06:43 < bridge> <teero777> hm? Windows XP and win7 do bost support 64bit though
06:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah im talking when i was young and had win xp
06:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> most computers were 32bit
06:43 < bridge> <teero777> Phone at 2% so I'll head to bed, gn <3
06:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol i woke up at 6
06:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should sleep better
06:44 < bridge> <teero777> You said the same thing 2 years ago, c'mon you gotta fuck up your drive somehow, next project I share with you will wipe it.
06:44 < bridge> <totar> lol
06:45 < bridge> <totar> I'm still enjoying windows only software rn
06:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i play ffxiv on linux and it runs better than native lol
06:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> (ffxiv is winshit only)
06:45 < bridge> <totar> games are usually fine but proffesional tools don't run on linux usually
06:45 < bridge> <teero777> Actually yesterday my sleep schedule was perfectly fine but today I got obsessed with a bug and couldn't stop until I fixed it. I didn't manage to fix it but laying in bed got me new ideas and I think I can fix it now once I sleep and forget how I wanted to fix it.
06:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> what tools
06:45 < bridge> <totar> running reality scan rn
06:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u knowledgable about linux?
06:46 < bridge> <totar> It's on my laptop
06:46 < bridge> <totar> I just prefer windows
06:46 < bridge> <teero777> (running ubuntu)
06:46 < bridge> <totar> except win 11
06:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i probs can get it working but im lazy i see it requires epic launcher
06:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> what are u scanning
06:47 < bridge> <teero777> I had a nightmare with starcraft2 and battlenet last time
06:47 < bridge> <teero777> Took me 3 days
06:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue
06:47 < bridge> <totar> stuff for fun, to make 3DGS
06:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i booted sc1 and 2
06:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and wow
06:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> if it has a kernel anticheat u are right
06:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u are agreeing to runnning a kernel anticheat so u should stay in windows
06:48 < bridge> <totar> I don't think it does
06:48 < bridge> <totar> unless epic launcher comes with kernal anticheat by itself
06:50 < bridge> <totar> can you get pirated photoshop running on linux
06:51 < bridge> <totar> can you get pirated photoshop running on linux?
06:52 < bridge> <totar> ah wait you were talking about starcraft
06:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> Linux anticheat might become a reality at some point because Valve's hardware runs linux
06:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> And Valve is working on a gaming console
07:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> Which is probably more like an actual PC
07:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> Because Valve is awesome
07:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> Pricing might be an issue though
07:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> Since the whole point of consoles is that they're cheap
07:21 < bridge> <louis> the thing abt a lot of professional software is u dont want to waste time debugging various bugs due to linux, u just want to use it easily
07:24 < bridge> <louis> recently ive been enjoying mac a bit more over windows for professional software. but navigating the os feels a bit slower on mac, just the feel and simplicity feels pretty nice
07:24 < bridge> <louis> recently ive been enjoying mac a bit more over windows for professional software. but navigating the os feels a bit slower on mac, just the looks and simplicity feels pretty nice
07:25 < bridge> <blazulite> truee
07:40 < bridge> <melon> Ye I agree, out of all things windows XP was peak in terms of UX
07:40 < bridge> <melon> 
07:40 < bridge> <melon> Win 7 was also good and I'm sad it's unmaintained, everything else is just disgusting UI wise IMO
07:43 < bridge> <reitw> It can be done pretty easily
07:43 < bridge> <reitw> Just the market is way too small to give an interest to linux. But yes since the increase of steam deck users maybe devs will finally work on it
07:45 < bridge> <pilonpl> The market is growing all the time
07:46 < bridge> <reitw> On linux there always was only a few percent of players
07:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> Linux has 2.8% on steam
07:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> Which isn't too bad
07:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> And it seems this doesn't include steam decks
07:55 < bridge> <reitw> It is pretty bad
07:56 < bridge> <reitw> 2.8% is way enough for big companies to not care
08:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had a great idea
08:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> implement erlang style process Mailboxes for message passing between drivers / threads in my kernel
08:23 < bridge> <soulyvevo> oh wow i was expecting it to be more in the 0.1% or something
08:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah
08:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> Overall linux desktop has about 5% market share
08:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> But idk how accurate that is
08:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> The steam survey is optional
08:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> And this is data from browsers o think
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> steam went up a lot lately
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was under 1%
08:38 < bridge> <Assa> and it will go up more when win 10 is Eol
08:55 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^^
08:59 < bridge> <netsu_0741> ?
08:59 < bridge> <netsu_0741> Why would i give a fuck

15:36 < bridge> <pathos3005> It shouldn't have the symbol, just 5 stripes of 3 colours
16:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> So threads need to send messages to each other through the kernel?
16:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> They share memory right
16:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> So why would kernel be involved
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> kernel is basically a scheduler, its the entity that decides what thread gets to run and the time slices each thread runs for, but threads sometimes need to wait for some i/o read or write to complete for example, during that wait they effectivly do nothing, for user threads, the kernel can know for example by the syscalls it calls, like read or write, for kernel threads, u can do it more cooperatively, like yielding on purpose, anyway my kernel th
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 @jupeyy_keks i upgraded the cpu on home from 2200g to 5600, i knew the 5600 doesnt have APU, but i didnt know the mobo needs a freaking apu to complete POST, now my home server doesnt boot xD, i  asked the ai and they tell me to buy a cheap gpu like gt 710
16:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> > It is an ASRock thing. Ryzens and TRs can run headless servers without any issue.
16:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> > It's the mobo that actually checks for a GPU during POST and refuses to boot without one.
16:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> stupid cheap mobo
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, what? It can't post without an igpu?
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah its an actual thing lol
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt ever notice in my lifetime cuz most cpus i had either had igpu or i had a gpu
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but apparently some MOBOs wont boot headless
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> asrock is one
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The ASRock B450M (assuming you mean B450M or B450M Pro/BM450 variant) is a consumer AM4 board.
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > These boards do not POST without a GPU unless an APU (with “G” in the model, like 2200G) is installed.
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > So:
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > With the 2200G → GPU is integrated, board POSTs fine.
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > With the 5600 → no iGPU, board expects a discrete GPU, otherwise it hangs at POST. SSH never comes up.
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > If you want the 5600 to run, you must plug in a PCIe graphics card. Even an old low-end card (GT 710, HD 5450, etc.) is enough.
16:53 < bridge> <learath2> Would it boot if you had a gpu?
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> im buying a gt 710
