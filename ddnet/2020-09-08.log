00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was just killed by switch weapon on pickup
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> enabled by the update üòÑ
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ouch
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/cdfc97e03568aa3306ea701f36e219d2 diff two updates
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we should distinguish "default" and "not set" value. As user might explicitly chose default value so on update we should not change his value
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk how to implement that in a nice way
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we change variables in CConfig all over the place, it's not clear whether it's the default value or the explicitly chosen default value
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <holic> can we please change it back from type to server pls it looks so bad
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <holic> or make it something like Maps
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <holic> Novice Maps
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <holic> Brutal Maps
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or "difficulty"
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk if its good to mix in fng/zcatch/etc with the ddnet tab too u know
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u could have all of that in a "pvp" tab
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @heinrich5991 idk how to implement that in not a nice way without tons of refactoring work
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> The only thing I been thinking about is to declare some class X {int Value; bool WasModified;}
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Define implicit cast to/from int for this X type
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Not sure if it is possible and how hard it will impact the perfomance cuse never tried it in c++
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @holic I renamed it to Maps already
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I guess I should have told you to test without ffmpeg installed locally üòÑ
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I should have checked with otool...
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Me too
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I totally forgot about that
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I guess the best way would be to have a function in CConfig that we always use to set config vars
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think this was my worst release in a while, broke so many things
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess we can't run the DDNet executable on the GitHub CI thingie?
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On which platform?
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> All
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My guess is that we don't have a display and SDL2 has no easy way of just telling it to software render to /dev/null
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I see what you meant, we can run it with a framebuffer probably
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, that would be nice
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> problem is, what do we look for? üòÑ
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something like `./DDNet quit` would be enough to test for proper linking
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think just having xvfb on linux would work
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Wh not write a test that tried to connect to a certain game server and the you will see nit only linking issues but it will also check the basic features of the client?
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> points query feels more slow :\
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Why not write a test that tried to connect to a certain game server and the you will see not only linking issues but it will also check the basic features of the client?
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> nvm it's ok on empty server
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Fin sure, that's even more fancy
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Well. But I guess its not too hard? You could even do it via cli if we give a run option or something like they did on ath
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> And the just check for the incoming connection on the server?
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Or is that already possible? Like `$ DDNet connect 127.0.0.1:83030`?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, possible: `DDNet ddnet:127.0.0.1:8303`
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So you can link `ddnet:` links to be opened with DDNet client
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but testing graphical applications this way is rather brittle
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> is it even possible to start the client without a graphical enviroment? To fake some screen or something like that
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could observe the traffic on both sides and compare it to a known good sample which should make breakages obvious, but we are making this more and more complex while we don't even have the most basic testing üòÑ
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: xvfb would work on linux for that, no such thing on mac or windows, if we had our own buildbots maybe we could
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> would be kinda cool to use xvfb in the ci for at least linux then huh?
11:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> Sounds better, I like @Learath2 idea with the traffic :o
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> oh i should hav read all messages before writing probably xd
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> i mean since we build it anyway we can also test it manually real quick?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @deen

11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lot of people are having trouble
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> seeing entities after the updates?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rejoining the server sometimes fixes it
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Is FNG right?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> on 0.7?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its my fng server yes and
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its a 0.6 server that supports 0.7
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> they are all using ddnet
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @onby 
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2750
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so its known issue
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ok
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll wait for a response of the network ppl
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else i'll fix it xd
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> üëç
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ what is the issue?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the gameobj gameinfo ext is sent as a snapshot
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it needs to be sent as a packet after joining the server
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> before the map is known
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think that's a feasible change
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> entities on fng used to work for people
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do you need to know the gametype so early?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the map is built onmapload
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby I'm guessing the new renderer is doing a lot of work in advance
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not built every frame anymore
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rejoining the server seems to fix it for *most* people
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but not all
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes bcs then they already got the snapshot
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me take a look, but I don't think we can easily move this out of the snap without a lot of compatibility cruft
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok thx
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ is it maybe possible for you to rebuild it when more info is available?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats pretty expensive
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> cant they get gametype from server browser
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was like that before
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i doubt it changes often for most servers
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i first implemented my code
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby relying on silly strings for determining info like this is very brittle
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what does it rely on currently?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> to make only red entities show up
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> on uninitialized memory xD
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> .-.
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You send a GAMEINFO_EX object, which has the needed information
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wait so
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the red is shown bcs its a ddrace tile
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> is this something i can fix serverside
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> red spike is ddr tile?
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably yes
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean the index
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not our fault you relied on information that's not there yet
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the behaviour üòÑ
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not his fault
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> me?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :x
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely not his fault
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> his=
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it worked before bcs it used the mod string
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> whoever implemented gameinfo just didnt thought about buffering
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so lets pls just be constructive
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whoever implemented the new renderer didn't check whether the information he used is actually populated at the time of use
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to play blame shifting
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as i said
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's rather trivial
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i programmed it it used the mod string
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not any packets
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> look the commit in the issue
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ok so to be clear
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont have to fix my server right
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, except u want features from the client, else the client should assume its unknown mod and just display all tiles
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hmm
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> can i ask smth, kinda off topic
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> which distro has most minimal live iso?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> can i do anything to help the client understand that its fng entities xd
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i wondered if the ddnet codebase of my mod mightve been mesing it up
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if the client allows snapshots before connected
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont think os
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ can't it be updated when the entities info changes?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know a mod that actively uses that IIRC
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it can but its expensive and will cause lags
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are we talking? 1ms?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends on hardware
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but building VRAM isnt fast
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. I mean it's in the very first snapshot
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps one could delay building the vram until the first snapshot is there?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (would still break the server that changes the gametype info)
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd just rebuild it, if a server changes gameinfo that late we can just tell them that it incurs a cost
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im ok with that
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can i compare the objects?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, different question
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does the filtering work?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or rather, the rendering?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it render the whole layer to a texture?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if m_DontMaskEntities
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is not set, it will look if its a valid ddrace tile
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it upload the texture indices to the graphics card?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it uploads vertices
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt even upload vertices that arent valid
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so like put this part of the entities texture there
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it adds valid tiles to a list
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rest is ignored
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looking to replace the texture in place?
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but how does it upload the valid tiles?
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just by position in the entities layer?
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it uploads it as vertices xD
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what that means ^^
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it knows the positon of the entities layer yes
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fill the list with fng tiles by default for quick fix? üôÇ
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ so if we were to upload all tiles and change the entities texture to only include those that we want, it would work fine?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problem always was, that you could e.g. spam a front layer into fng
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why is that a problem
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because people did it and it caused entities to be unplayable
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> maybe its intentional
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, in fng it works anyway, but in ddrace its annoying
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 yes that would work
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nice, and without delay, too, I guess?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it will then create front layers independent of the mod
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes without any delay
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so if we have a fng front layer
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or generally, a non ddrace front layer
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> should be fine
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> isnt the "front" layer supposed to be unused for all types of maps except ddrace
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes but we dont know the mod üòÑ
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so better built everything
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i c
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the front layer doesn't exist by default I think
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't indeed
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also the credits of the entities will then work
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why does it show the front layer in fng in that case
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so either remove them or still check some tiles
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u right @onby
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can still just not render the front layer
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in any other mod
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only gamelayer, and the mod programmers have to add it to ddnet, if they require other layers
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i suppose this would fix the fake tiles that @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti makes too
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> most faketiles are fixed already
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i guess we need ddnet_front.png then?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and game seperatelly
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> working on it
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok thx üòÑ
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> really
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What will you do about the credits?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still strip them in all gametypes if there's a possible position
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, don't we already clean up the layers from invalid tiles btw?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the problem ^^
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we do that with incomplete information
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> heinrichs solution is really the best
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the mapper creates invalid tiles and destroys performance in his maps
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its the mappers fault
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we'll have to strip the credits from the source files as it'd be tricky to strip them in the code
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can also just create the texture on fly acutally
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can still stirp them in source
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when loading entities just create front and gamelayer by cheking for valid tiles
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But won't we need a table of valid tiles for a given mod?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, we kinda do this today
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but instead of modifying the texture, we modify the game tiles in the (loaded) map
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, same idea but we use it to build the entities texture instead of cleaning the layers
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great solution actually
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes üòÑ
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, may I hand it back to you? @Jupstar ‚ú™
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, i'll fix it
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks!
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like any of us has any idea how the rendering stack works anymore üòõ
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so when map is rendered the gameinfo object is initialized in some way?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GameInfo object is actually uninitialized when the map is loaded I think
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has a default state, but it takes atleast one snap without gameinfoex for it to get there
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it initilaized with null paramters tho
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if not found
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but only at the first snapshot tick
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe initialize it to `GetGameInfo(0, 0, &ServerInfo);` OnConnected?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i dunno rn when the client calls render for the first time
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> after three snapshots arrived I think
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its already fine
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you need it to be initialized onmapload
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no we change the texture on fly
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as it knows its fng, it will display fng tiles, but invalid tiles are transparent
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well when you first render the map on OnMapLoad, it will be uninitialized
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont require it here anymore
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I think it won't display anything until the 3rd snapshot
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen you can put it into ddnet_scripts if you haven't already
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it will build all tiles
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen just tell me where the new position of the script is so I can put a link there
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We seem to have an issue capturing the mouse
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on macOS mouse clicks won't register until I switch to another app and back
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does ddrace have a front layer too?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not ddnet
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> are the tiles different?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure, though is ddrace still relevant? I don't think anyone hosts it anymore
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok then i build it up like ddnet
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At least http://ddrace.info/ points to us üòÑ
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, I own the domain ^^
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah!
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 any idea about getting stable builds for steam_api.dll?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could apply diffocsope to two subsequent builds
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 what's up with that demo gif on diffoscope website? https://diffoscope.org/ I just watched 2 minutes of progress bars until I got bored üòÑ
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll write an email
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/update/diff_update.py
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen have you put it into diffoscope yet?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `diffoscope file1 file2`
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 Some bytes are different, but doesn't tell me much
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you paste the diff somewhere?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like all it does is hexdump and then diff
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sometimes it shows more intelligent stuff
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like what headers differ
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752855371202166845/message.txt
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whole diff?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you also post the binaries please?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752855826208784394/steam_api.dll
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752855876494164090/steam_api.dll
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, are those just timestamps maybe?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the first one is a checksum
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so fixing the second one probably suffices ^^
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the second one is in the beginning of the .edata section
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm. why does the checksum even differ? does the checksum cover more than the PE header itself?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 4
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >     4
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >     Time/Date Stamp
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >     The time and date that the export data was created.
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I assume it should be over the entire file
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ha, my guess was right!
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, the second one is a timestamp
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#export-directory-table
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we just need to tell the linker to use a fixed timestamp and all good I guess
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, sth like that
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what compiler is it? mingw?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/TimestampsInPEBinaries
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Xlinker --no-insert-timestamp`
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from your link
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > This works for executables, but DLLs builts like this cause problems with bound executables: updating a DLL without changing its timestamp causes bound executables to crash.
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So we should set the timestamp, but only update it from the old value when something actually changed. That seems hard to do
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's see what bug it causes and whether it applies to us
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen seems it's only important for a feature called "binding"
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/march/inside-windows-an-in-depth-look-into-the-win32-portable-executable-file-format-part-2
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ctrl-f binding
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't do that, so null timestamps should‚Ñ¢ be fine
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds good
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you want to make a PR?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, this affects our normal build
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Mac does the same btw, but we don't have an autoupdater there
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give me two builds for that one?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Apparently in our case there are no timestamps, interesting
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so nothing to fix on mac
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen fixed
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> what the purpose of masking entities ? Its just for graphics?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in the editor?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to prevent mappers from adding entities that don't exist yet, but might later be added
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ingame
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably peformance
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am missing why we can not ignore the 'mask_entities' flag when loading not DDNet.png
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am missing why we can not ignore the 'mask_entities' flag when loading not entities\DDNet.png
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> or we build like layot for any image for future? Probably I need to read what verticies are to understand it, @Jupstar ‚ú™
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> or we build like layot for any image for future? Probably I need to read what verticies are to understand it, @Jupstar ‚ú™ ?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why does the editor not remove speedups instead sets their force to zero?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @BannZay dunno what u mean but the flag is too late
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why we do initialize these indicies for everymap instead of every server type?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> like keep initialized indicies for fng for future
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> like keep initialized vertices for fng for future
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @BannZay the purpose of masking entities ingame is to not show entities that don't have an effect
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> hmh, to fix DDNet.png?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im finished except that i need a force restriction for speedups, because else they are saved,
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so no mod compability for speedup layers, until the editor is fixed xD
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why its on the image then?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> who programms the editor here?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nobody and everyone üôÇ
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there were not that many changes to the editor I think
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ but now that you mention it, you can take it over as well. seems like there are no more graphics problems left üòÑ
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> famous last words
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no graphics problems left
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dejavu
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752873500875685938/screenshot_2020-09-08_14-50-02.png
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and tune zone also working forgot it here
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar ‚ú™ are vertices will be rebuilded in case when I left one fng server and connect another? Is there any sense to do it?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it will rebuild the entities
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since only entity rendering is the problem
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not every tile layer
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the entities textures to be precise
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen you mean rendering the editor with texture arrays?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nah, just improving it in general
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its soo messy, probs easy to reprogram it, but don't really want to, way too much work xD
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, should i restrict speedups with force zero, else they are displayed, but it removes the possibilties for other mods to use speedup layers with speedups with force 0 xD
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no other mod uses them I guess ^^
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did a bit with the editor, but instead started spending time on editor2 over in 0.7
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like a much cleaner base to work with
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah, i saw it too, nice additions
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Native support for undo-redo is nice
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I recently watched a talk by a guy working on photoshop, their approach to undo-redo kinda shocked me üòÑ
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do they do?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Instead of saving the changes, they just say fuck it and save entire snapshots on every save
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> every change*
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez ram
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do they do CoW?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought this was insane, because people edit massive files with photoshop but they have a cute optimization
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes CoW
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcVXgEVMJg Interesting talk and an interesting approach to polymorphism all in all
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what use case do they have for polymorphism?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In photoshop you have multiple objects within a document that need to be drawn
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is the example he was using
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how well it will age as compilers get better and better at devirtualization
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The main arguments he gives against runtime polymorphism is that calls that go through the vtable aren't cheap
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I thought you'd do ecs or whatever they call it nowadays
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What he creates throughout the talk is quite similar to an ecs
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> using existing work might have been nice for the new mapeditor
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found the same project as last time when I thought about it: https://www.mapeditor.org/
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've no plan if i destroyed compability to blockworlds
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or ddrace
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (not ddnet)
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what layers they have/had
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can we remove "-Winconsistent-missing-override"
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> because i like to use override now, since its safer
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's only safer when you use it consistently, right?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i use it for future implemented functions
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so its already safer there
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you cannot have NULL virtual functions for these
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> future implemented functions?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> functions i implement now or in future
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like that dont exist yet
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> NULL virtual functions?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> from base class
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean pure virtual functions or sth else?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> About editor: couldn't the "editor2" from vanilla be adapted?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, would be nice
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i fixed the bug anyway
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> editor2 has muuuch work to be ready
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's LordSk's project and he isn't working much on it. I did a handful of PRs that kept him active but I don't think there was any activity after I had to take a break
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we want to adopt it for ddnet we'll need to adopt the development aswell
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I thought it's finished already :c
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how would we do envelopes and stuff if we use a tile editor like the one you linked?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought about extending it, but true, envelopes are a huge features that is missing from it
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Could someone do me a build for Win x64 with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2730 added in?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/1082821630
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> top right artifacts
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lovely
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i give 100‚Ç¨ to whoever codes tees as tiles
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and gets it into ddnet
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> respectable bounty üëç
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i.want.it
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i need it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What will you do with a tee tile? üòÑ
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> think about it and you will have many ideas.  you could put a boat part in the middle of a solomap. you could make easy to use dummy maps.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if they react like normal tees to tele/switch etc. and reset for every team
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does that work for team 0?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think it has a lot of use in team 0
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spawning the tees in isn't much trouble
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The tees doing anything at all is a bit of a trouble
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what do you mean. they dont need to move by themselfes or anything
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing you'd want them hooking up for a dummy part e.g.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they somehow need to do something useful for team 0, or it would only be possible on solo maps
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I like the idea with tee`s does nothing
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well i guess on team 0 you can have them in little areas where a group cant steal them away from another one
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> either way it would add bounce, hook and the tee as itself for pressing buttons for example.  you could use them in places without having a real player to go there
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> also for dummy maps you wouldnt need to get your dummy out of every part. you can map it so you can just leave them
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I though the spawned tee should be respawned back on entity touched again. It should be in switch layer to have multiple entries for the same tee
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so you can have few of them if you want to
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i would think like a new spawn tile that spawns one tee where it is and no more
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you have any idea why nginx might reply to a Client Hello with Bad Request?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah figured it out lol
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> this way it is not possible to replay the part if you lost your dummy
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what was it?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah true @BannZay  but it would be easier to map
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was a http server listening on 443
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the TLS Hello didn't make any sense to it üòÑ
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as long as just one respawn is enough for mappers dreams üôÇ
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> they should respawn anyway at kill (at least for solo and dummy mod)
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I would provide any support if need as I like this feature very much
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont like connecting my dummy every time I connect dummy server, joining the team etc etc
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> add some to the bounty then üòÑ
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really? Huh
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll add it I guess
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as well the problem with making your dummy deep will be gone
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as well as deep fly
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah true
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and noobs can maybe get into dummy quicker bcs its not so hard to understand
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what about weak strong
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 2 kinds of tee or all strong?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the main Idea to teleport dummy to entity is to reset level / start next one
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I think about it from mapper side
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you could do parts that tele them into one single pit but it requires like a 10 tee tower
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not stupid switch door stuff
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Learath2 is it possible to make such dummy not to take place on the server? So we can still have 64 real players on the server ?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah sure, it's just an entity
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not with the current code
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh definitely needs some work
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could probably manage to only take up one server slot
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if only one dummy is ever in view at the same time
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that would be shit
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> Yo guys
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea, it is defenetely should work with teams. But you can spectate all teams togather as long as I know
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea, it is defenetely should work with teams. But you can spectate all teams togather as far as I know
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Does anyone know how to know when a thread is terminated in C/C++ ?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what kind of thread? how did you start it?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> 1 sec
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> with pthread_create()
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> with 
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ```c

16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ```
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like you can only do that by changing variable that your main thread can observe
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> hmm y
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> sad
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you trying to do?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> You mean the program or with the thread ?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with the thread
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> You mean with the program or with the thread ?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> The function i call with the thread display squares and count them
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> The function i call with the thread displays squares and count them
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you want to wait for the thread to finish?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pthread_join can do that
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Y i saw this, but i dont understand what it does
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it waits until the thread is done
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Like, i can know when my thread finish with a condition ?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Like, i can know when my thread finish with a condition on it ?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it can only wait until it is finished
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> mm ok
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> I think ill just use a global var
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> join blocks ur current thread until that thread ends
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can also check if the thread is joinable without blocking
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then call join if its true

17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mano le rigolo xddd> Hello me and my brother like FNG but we cant play in the same server because we have the same IP can you set up that ?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Mano le rigolo xddd what server are u trying to play on?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mano le rigolo xddd> on all fng
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if u mean the server at 51.89.23.241:8338 then join the discord for it https://discord.gg/cv5HzE and ask me or a moderator when u wanna play with ur brother
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and we can allow 2/ip
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mano le rigolo xddd> ok
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mano le rigolo xddd> Thx
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> np
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @onby me too plz
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #metoo
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> really
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes my dog wants to play with me
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ... xd
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby that sounds annoying, why not always allow 2?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> people abuse dummy
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> they either ban themselves with dummy hammer / use it to boost kd and other stats
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, that's annoying too
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> they either ban themselves with dummy hammer / use it to boost kd and other stats / use two tees to play
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @deen if theres a more elegant solution in-client to prevent this then itd be cool to see, if not then the best strategy ive found is to just point people to who to ask when they wanna play with people on the same network
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @deen if theres a more elegant solution in-client to prevent this then itd be cool to see, if not then the best strategy ive found is to just point people to who to ask when they wanna play with people on the same network and leave 1/ip otherwise
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> hello, the elegant solution is called IPv6
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby would it help if we sent an explicit dummy notification?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> people could still open two clients to cheat stats but yes i think it would still be helpful
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> for the other fng servers+other mods that want to prevent dummy
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> not even considering my server it sounds like a good idea
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> also bit irrelevant to the dummy issue but ipv6 still doesnt fix the thing where people can have two monitors and spec themselves/the enemy with another client
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> also bit irrelevant to the dummy issue but ipv6 still doesnt fix the thing where people can have two monitors and spec themselves/the enemy with another client and zoomout
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Of course not. With ipv6 your ISP often gives you a whole range, so even your ip limit won't help
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> D:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> need ipv6 detection lol
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and even if it fixed it, someone could just make a hotspot with their phone
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i actually never see any ipv6 addresses in f2 status, not sure if my vps even supports it, but i guess its translated to (different?) ipv4 addresses
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and yes right thats the problem, this or use an undetected vpn
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the problem is that the master servers don't work with ipv6 i think
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so no one even knows the ipv6 address of your server
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i just personaly saw way more people using 2/ip to abuse than using it to play with people irl so i decided to make it something that a mod should oversee
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hmm
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if the vps doesnt support ipv6 and someone tries to connect to it with ipv6 will it show a ipv4 address for them
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only if your host does some fancy tunneling, but i doubt that
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if they dont would they be unable to connect
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it doesn't support ipv6 it has no ipv6 address so no one can connect on ipv6
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rip
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i guess thats a problem i very well may not even know about
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if they cant connect
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if they cant connect to tell me or find the discord link
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if you really want, you can have multiple addresses even with IPv4
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> explain
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah u can have the spec-scanner thing and have whole map zooz :O
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> right xd, people use dummy copy and spec themselves and play zoomed out in spec
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or two monitors for the same purpose
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or just kill their dummy for free multix
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or just kill their dummy for free multis
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but the problem is that everything is heavily NATed today - a lot of people can share single IP, so allowing only unique IPs on server is quite dangerous, isn't it?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> IPv4 must die üòÑ
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive been hosting fng server for about three years and only once ive ran into the problem where two different players share the same ip
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i was rlly surprised when it happened
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and so were they
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> im not sure if its silently happening more and i just dont know but somehow doubt it
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe with larger player base it would become more noticeable problem
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> probably yeah
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> one smallish server is less likely
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well if u allow 1/ip and then include a discord link in the motd
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the 1 who can connect can go there to ask for help if they want 2?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or just ask on server
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> not everyone is brave enough to ask such thing, you know üòÑ
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i guess but i think putting link in the motd should imply that we want anyone to join
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hope so at least lol
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, some people overdo the NATting, like Qatar used to have a single IP address for the entire country: https://techcrunch.com/2007/01/01/wikipedia-bans-qatar/
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wtf hahahah
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> that's not even possible without breaking so many things üòÑ
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> there are only 65536 ports available
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> this makes me wonder about all the large rangebans ive done
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ü§®
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if one ipv4 address can be a whole country
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's so evil üòÑ
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ‚ú™ cp 25 has this little bug on it (size 100)
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752926938712244444/unknown.png
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange, i dont have it
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie r u sure its size 100?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it fills the space much more
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752928472648646746/screenshot_2020-09-08_18-27-52.png
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah it says 100
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is your libfreetype.dll up to date?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did you change the font?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> something must be different
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm on the previous version cause new rendering is ugly
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i told ya change the shaders
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want higher mipmap so despretly
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm too stupid for that
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in data/shader/tile.frag replace 
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     vec4 TexColor = texture(gTextureSampler, TexCoord.xyz);
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     vec4 TexColor = textureLod(gTextureSampler, TexCoord.xyz, 0);
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that won't help then i dunno xd
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> might only work with opengl 3.3 tho
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh yeah it works, thanks
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I can't live without the clear textures
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks for saying my algorithm was better than from amd or nvidia xD
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well it's not blurry as heck so, yeah
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752935418315407441/unknown.png
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> I am trying to debug this issue: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2695 , and find a really weird thing...
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> why (0 + 0 + 1 ) % 128 = 2
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> ah, i find the reason... the usage of micro always connfused me
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752939268120248410/unknown.png
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> ah, i find the reason... the usage of macro always connfused me
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> but it is actually a bug
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is the web renderer broken for:?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.tw/mappreview/?map=Ice+Cave+2
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie wait wait, what is the difference? you mean the less-blurry thing, that's why you sit on older?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> depending on the driver and resolution you get different mipmaps, in old renderer it used a different calculation for that, so full hd screens probs got a higher mipmap
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> \*sweats in 2560x1440\*
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 1920x1080 and tiles were visibly blurry
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'm afraid I didn't even notice difference since sitting on entities xd
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe cause on this resolution tiles aren't scaled close to 32x32 or 64x64
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ‚ú™ and the higher mipmap the better?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and cause my default zoom is 7, not 10 xD
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if you can rate it in good or bad
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might look less sharp, but normally the quality is better bcs the mipmaps are generated with a computational more expensive algorithm
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs they only build once not the whole time
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. zooming out probs looks better in the newest renderer compared to old renderer opengl 3.3
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Video tools have god awful commandline interfaces except for ffmpeg. Makes one wonder how all the pirates don't go absolutely insane messing around with these while encoding their releases

21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> Can't update to version 14.7.1 of the non-steam client... Also can't unzip the version from the website without the Windows defender alarm ü§î

21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Wollwolke you can report this as a false positive to Windows Defender
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> interestingly, the steam version does not result in the warning
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure what else we can do about that
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> kk
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Surpsisingly, for me the version from website didn't show any viruses, neither on unzip nor on full scan
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe win32 instead of win64?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> antivirus heuristics are really annoying
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how they come up with these signatures
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did we always have these antivirus warning?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get them every once in a while on some updates
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, i remember i got them first time using glew in a different project, bcs glew dynamically loads functions from the opengl.dll üòÑ
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if windows defender is still that bad
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok cant find anything, so could also be unrelated

23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> amazing explanation
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u should become a teacher
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen @Kingston's antivirus also detected DDNet & removed his files ._.
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe cuz ddnet got more famous
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kingston> 100%
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Wollwolke can you tell me your defender definition version?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-security-center-antivirus#definition-version
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> Sure: Security intelligence version 1.323.757.0
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, it's not threat definition version for you?
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> nope
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> it says security intelligence version
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, that's odd
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you show me a screenshot? I don't have access to windows right now so I can't check :/

23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though, I guess it's the same thing
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> for me it's ~security analysis version (translated from PL) 1.323.764.0
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 4h of difference between our versions
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> and you have no problems?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yep
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I submitted a false detection report

23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it didn't detect anything
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> >.<

23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Microsoft is really one big meme
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> newer version tho
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> even though he checked for update 2 hours after my version was released, it didn't detect update for him xD
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ||my version is: Linux arch 5.8.7-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat, 05 Sep 2020 12:31:32 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux||
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Soreu has 1.323.764.0, wollwolke has 1.323.757.0, the online scanner they use to scan submissions has 1.323.775.0
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> which part of it called the bot lol
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the hash 1 maybe
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> While the file was getting scanned by the online scanner they changed the online scanner to 1.323.788.0
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just got update to 1.323.780.0
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> Got a new version: 1.323.780.0: no problems there... sorry to bother you all
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now they will send me a mail asking why I bother them for problem they already fixed
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> ^^
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ü§° company
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Kingston @jason54 | KingServ.fr update your antivirus' definition versions
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It takes so long to get a sample scanned, if you want to get it faster you need "Premier support"
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we should get a code signing cert, I bet they treat signed executables less harshly and it's only a one time payment
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...and the price is?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one time payment
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> per year
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 150‚Ç¨
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kingston> √ñ
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn monopolies üò¶
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://en.sklep.certum.pl/open-source-code-signing.html
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems cheaper here
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Deleting the Microsoft SmartScreen Filter¬Æ system message
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Certificate cross-certified by Microsoft
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sad
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sabu> maybe someone from ddnet team injected some ransom
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but for 400$ per year it gets ignored
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 400$ per year to make an undetectable trojan? :thonkery:
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'll get 400$ pretty soon with your trojan, doesn't even matter that you get detected
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ransomware is your best bet, trojans are so 2007
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> trojan delivery method, ransomware payload
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Does Microsoft bs trigger on steam version tho?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no, and the new version of the threat definitions seems to fix it
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> steam and non-steam might actually be the same binary
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone want to check? ^^
