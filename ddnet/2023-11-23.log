03:32 < bridge> <chronoveins> When will the results of the moderator selection be announced?
04:03 < bridge> <learath2> Verysoon. We discussed some guidelines before we announced the results
09:57 < ChillerDragon> i was promised rcon!
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> the test framework llvm uses is not bad
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1177183738141085716/image.png?ex=657194ca&is=655f1fca&hm=a338fcf02733fbae08a575f2908e29d15a013d27e816a7d7ed4cba1852c0656c&
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 82C kek
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> my cpu always hot
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> 15s for 2k tests
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they compile the tests beforehand
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> (its not included in the seconds)
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i saved a lot of money going with murpi‚Äôs cooler recommendation but now the fans are absurdly loud
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i was afraid of this
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> one day i will bite the bullet and splurge on high quality fans for my whole case
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone know of fans that are quiet enough for long enough to rival noctua considering their price $$$
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not worried about 82C tho btw
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its normal for a high end cpu to get hot at 100% load
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i read amd squeezes out all the temp they can
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> meaning they will run as hot as possible before throttling
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill wait for next gen amd in AM5
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and upgrade tho
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna compile llvm in 1 min
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i should get a threadripper
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i wonder how good it is for gaming
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> First of all, die you check your temperatures?
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> temps fine
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont like the noise
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then lower the fans
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> no
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> fans will be quieter if ur cooling mass is bigger
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Speed
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i leave auto curve
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> meaning u need to get a big ass cooler
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a big one
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats what she said
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm looking for fans
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> or not
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok but then it's normal they are loud
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The motherboard probably didn't know how good your coolers are
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yes so i want new quiet fans
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> adjust ur fan curve
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mine are completely off until 70¬∞c
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> a good mobo allows u to do that
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the mobo
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> messing with settings :(
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i still have yet to overclock :feelsbadman:
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> always ill do it later
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Often they come with a quite profile
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Quiet

11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i wont learn macos
11:45 < ChillerDragon> its pog too
11:45 < ChillerDragon> ok havent tried arm
11:45 < ChillerDragon> i only did intel mac
11:45 < ChillerDragon> i think arm is cool too
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Who tells me you aren't lying. Pic or did not happen
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Post here ofc
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not gigachad yet

11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got ur joke xd
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> late
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yesterday i made soup and i burned my tongue a bit
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> rip
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw rip is a register
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant use directoy
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant use directly
12:01 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> dummy moves and dummy hammer interactions are sucks can I copy the original client and modify and use them ? or u guys will fix this dumbass controls ?
12:01 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> dummy moves and dummy hammer interactions are sucks can I copy the original client and modify and use it ? or u guys will fix this dumbass controls ?
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur nice words really encourage any devs to work on what u want
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i swear ppl dont rly know respect kek
12:04 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> actually, Im a eng learner so I think I didnt express my thoughts properly
12:04 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> I mean m I able to make some changes in client and use it in game ?
12:05 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> secand q is do you working on this ?
12:05 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> sry for my words
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure u know what dumbass means
12:06 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> ye
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> feel free to open  a issue in gh with ur problem
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> then it will be discussed
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> then if its good it may be implemented
12:07 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> sry for my words again and ty
12:07 < bridge> <furo321> You can modify the client, but what exactly do you mean by "dummy moves and dummy hammer interactions are sucks"? What would you like to see changed?
12:08 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Roby licking His Fingers dropping off the Most insane and Rude commenr ever Seen by mankind on His issue
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Changing Input can result in ban
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Better discuss it first
12:09 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> while dummy moves 1 if you give another input dummy_hammer 1 it stops what it is doing and moving
12:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Seems Like youre complaining about Dummy Copy - ..copying your Inputs ?
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe u can record a video
12:12 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> btw I want to say that last night I tried to understand the mechanism behind the game from srcodes for more than 3 hours and I amazed to work done. simplest game Ive ever seen but not easy to do
12:12 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> I will

12:15 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> :/
12:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Make a Video of your issue, But from what i got - Dummy Copy obviously overweites pervious toggles, you can Use a +toggle bind to have dummy_hammer on Input
12:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> "Bind mouse4 +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0" for example
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> show
12:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Make a Video of your issue, But from what i got - Dummy Copy obviously overwrites pervious toggles, you can Use a +toggle bind to have dummy_hammer on Input
12:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> "Bind mouse4 +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0" for example
12:30 < bridge> <furo321> I think this is what he means, activating `cl_dummy_hammer` overwrites the current dummy input. Looking at the code it seems that `cl_dummy_hammer` has it's own `CNetObj_PlayerInput` instead of using the already existing one, which seems strange.

12:33 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> yes, exactly !
12:33 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1177210318762541126/image.png?ex=6571ad8b&is=655f388b&hm=d25bae00085685c330ec54d6d51b3122d2a2aca6f1b0fc29d9180987995252c2&
12:33 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> I think this is why
12:34 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> line 450
12:36 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> it stores the input and execute it after dummy hammer turned off
12:37 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> that is good but it ruins long hooks especially when u try to do dummy drag
12:40 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> +toggle command also stop the move
12:41 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> especially it gets complicated when u use dummy hammer and dummy cops at the same time
12:47 < ChillerDragon> > btw rip is a register
12:47 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki they all refer to the instruction pointer when saying RIP on tombstones
12:48 < bridge> <bts._.> i dont think you want to change this unless you want to kill all the current dummy mechanics
12:51 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> nah, I dont want to kill. just improve
12:51 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> I donno how to do so I came to developers with my abusive words

13:01 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> I want more to know
13:02 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> especially it gets complicated when u use dummy hammer and dummy copy at the same time

13:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good to know I can ping llvm dev on the next compile error I get
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:15 < bridge> <furo321> I broke a lot of stuff. But if you wanna try you can change `m_HammerInput` to `m_Controls.m_aInputData[!g_Config.m_ClDummy]` instead. Also I'm unsure if your way is wanted behaviour.

16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> behold unsafe
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is how u compile with llvm c api
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As good as irc, alright üòÇ
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And you call me minimalistic
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft happy thanks giving
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> give me my thanks
16:47 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ instant messaging with zero delay. App startup as fast as vim. No authentication bullshit. No bugs. Blazingly fast and bug free clients. Open and decentralized.
16:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess there are console clients for matrix, ChillerDragon
16:49 < ChillerDragon> yes there are
16:49 < ChillerDragon> even weechat can do matrix the client i love for irc
16:50 < ChillerDragon> i also have matrix client with vim bindings
16:50 < ChillerDragon> and one that can render images in the terminal
16:50 < ChillerDragon> but none of these clients not even weechat have a acceptable user expierience
16:50 < ChillerDragon> login is pain und bugged af
16:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in what way?
16:50 < ChillerDragon> many
16:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> give an example
16:50 < ChillerDragon> some notfications can not be marked as read
16:51 < ChillerDragon> message ordering is random
16:51 < ChillerDragon> and changes on client reboot
16:51 < ChillerDragon> messages get lost
16:51 < ChillerDragon> its unusably slow
16:51 < ChillerDragon> gotta get back to work but the list goes on
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds super bad indeed
16:54 < ChillerDragon> some images and videos do not load
16:54 < ChillerDragon> some load for minutes
16:54 < ChillerDragon> some clients can not do proper authentication
16:54 < ChillerDragon> then all clients get an alert that some login is pending that can not be finished
16:54 < ChillerDragon> authentication in general is painful
16:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> irc doesn't have any images at all, I guess
17:03 < ChillerDragon> i rather see a link to a image i can click which loads instant in my browser than see a bugged empty message
17:03 < ChillerDragon> if i really want images i just use a irc client that supports images
17:03 < ChillerDragon> i can send images just fine via irc
17:04 < ChillerDragon> if there are too many images sent here and i want to go all gui mode i go to chat.zillyhhn.com
17:04 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700755439.png
17:05 < ChillerDragon> ignore my wip tenor support :D
17:05 < breton> yeah, irc is great!
17:05 < ChillerDragon> woah
17:05 < ChillerDragon> random irc user appeared
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chiller what i want to say is. Irc is annoying. U often read out of context etc
17:06 < ChillerDragon> breton: is lurking here since 5 years waiting to defend irc axaxaxax
17:06 < ChillerDragon> yes i hate discord for adding reply feature
17:06 < breton> my time has come
17:06 < ChillerDragon> and fakin matter bridge for not supporting it 
17:06 < ChillerDragon> breton: u play ddnet?
17:06 < breton> a bit
17:07 < ChillerDragon> what username?
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Imagine chatting to yourself
17:07 < breton> you will not believe
17:07 < ChillerDragon> omg jopsti
17:07 < ChillerDragon> go leak
17:07 < ChillerDragon> username
17:07 < ChillerDragon> dnt be so dramatic im dying breton 
17:07 < ChillerDragon> wait is it "breton" ?
17:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you can contribute to matterbridge
17:08 < ChillerDragon> yea yea
17:08 < ChillerDragon> i thought about it
17:08 < ChillerDragon> but then i nob
17:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the reply feature is quite nice
17:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it helps add context
17:08 < ChillerDragon> sounds like work and my todo is quite big
17:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's always a matter of priorities
17:09 < ChillerDragon> also not sure if i want irc replys even
17:09 < ChillerDragon> with quakenetes current ratelimit
17:09 < ChillerDragon> replying to a wall of text would resend the wall of text and ban the bridge
17:09 < ChillerDragon> one more trap next to code snippets and edits
17:09 < ChillerDragon> yes time is always a matter of priorities
17:10 < ChillerDragon> and replies are not high enough 
17:10 < ChillerDragon> also way to time consuming for my developer skills to make it work
17:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> classic
17:10 < ChillerDragon> breton: why you idle in this irc? :D
17:11 < ChillerDragon> breton: can you speak russian?
17:11 < ChillerDragon> are you one of those russian hackers lurkin in irc?
17:12 < ChillerDragon> he gone
17:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U scared him
17:12 < ChillerDragon> dude i got excited
17:13 < ChillerDragon> one of the 10 mysterious ideling irc users woke
17:13 < ChillerDragon> used to be more before heinrich swang the banhammer axaxax
17:13 < ChillerDragon> classic heinrich
17:13 < ChillerDragon> swung?
17:13 < ChillerDragon> was swinging?
17:13 < ChillerDragon> swem?
17:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> swung
17:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think I banned anyone from IRC permanently
17:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only stopped people from talking on IRC when they were trying to circumvent bans
17:20 < ChillerDragon> yes thats what i was referring to
17:20 < ChillerDragon> kicking the poor souls that cant defend them selfs
17:20 < ChillerDragon> pulling the plug of life support irc users
17:20 < ChillerDragon> dramatic day
17:22 < ChillerDragon> oh wait no that was not what i was referring to
17:22 < ChillerDragon> i meant the people you were running a bouncer for @heinrich5991
17:23 < ChillerDragon> but yea too discord trolls
17:27 < ChillerDragon> rip XXLTomate
17:27 < ChillerDragon> he will be remembered
17:35 < ChillerDragon> omg all irc users ded again breton gone :( m!nus is the only epic irc user who actually gets pings on irc

17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u have space for a terminal, you also have space for this
17:40 < ChillerDragon> I prefer weechat over gui
17:41 < ChillerDragon> also a good client can only safe so much
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's ok chiller, you are allowed to come to the year 2023
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i officially allow you
17:41 < ChillerDragon> if the network protocol is inherently fucked and the matrix.org china controlled spy instance is slow at stealing your data
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i still consider you a hipster afterwards
17:44 < ChillerDragon> xd

18:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could simply use a different server
19:46 < ChillerDragon> i never tried a different insance
19:46 < ChillerDragon> sounds like work
