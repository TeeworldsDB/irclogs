00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga here?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I took a look at your prs and they look rather safe, one question about ddnet/ddnet-discordbot#21, what do you think this could be used for?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot/pull/21
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> especially extend_layers
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> extending layers up and left
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which is not supported by the editor
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> also cleaning up unused envelopes and images
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which testers usually want mappers to do and can easily be automated
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Makes sense
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> although yeah, the interface might be not the most user-friendly, because it literally takes command line arguments. but its just the testers that can use that command
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm also just a little scared about command line injection attacks 😄
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you want, the debug pull request means a lot more to me than the edit one
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html#creating-subprocesses
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think injection attacks via the command line are only possible if we use the `create_subprocess_shell`, not `create_subprocess_exec`
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they would need to find an exploit in my parser, which I find rather unlikely
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that's good, I guess I'm okay with both prs then
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I"ll give these a merge, let's see if they blow up
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 👍
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually let me first get twmap compiled on the server
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `cargo install twmap` if you haven't used that before
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> as long as you have cargo ^^
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and rustc xd
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My arm is absolutely killing me this time around
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sounds like you are havin fun
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I also planned to make the command available to everyone in #bot-cmds, although I think that has time and I'll wait for whenever the next bot is up
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast I have 5g now
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 👌
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga merge conflict on #21 now
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/21
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> uhm
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 21 kinda included 20
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh 😄
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, I think I solved that conflict in 21 once ^^
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it's very simple, solved it on the web editor
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> gimme a sec, the merge should be quick
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> nice
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ok now lets see how this blows up 😛
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga so how can we give it a quick test?
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> nothing could possibly go wrong with any deployment 🙃
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sure
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which channel can I use
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> integration hell timeee
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> #❌🎉caterpillar looks suitable
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 if you are still awake: going through the last messages is going to create some edge cases. testers can for example accept a map from an otherwise untrusted person by giving a specific reaction. I don't think I want to be bothered to check that. but that might just be edge-case enough to be ignored, I could maybe make the bot reply to the map it edited
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, mine was just a suggestion
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea its a good suggestion for sure, that would be much more intuitive
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 tested functionality on a private discord server, the checks if the map is from a trusted source are copied from other parts of the code
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Flurix> @everyone hi guys, I'm leaving this fucking game, take my skins (only one, https://i.imgur.com/SAvJYv5.png), i confirm all exchanges, there won't be enough for everyone, so don't be offended.. -
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Flurix> http://steamcommurnuity.com/tradeoffers/new/?partner=164064522&token=axDA400
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Patiga @Learath2 great deployment, guys 🥳
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No integration hell this time
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll merge if I have time for a coffee at the airport. Otherwise I guess I can merge it tonight
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh nice @Patiga you made maps shiftable to the bottom right with twmap?
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also which troll sent confettis on matrix \:D
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It takes a different kind of ignorant to travel in the middle of a pandemic and not even read about regulations
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 5 people in front of me in the line. Not one that booked their covid test in advance as the airport regulations say
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to archive the first 3 years of teehistorian and it's like nothing
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3gb
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I was using the wrong filter :/
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> chillderdragon: yeah, and also reducing the size of every layer as much as possible :)
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cool!
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> how much is it?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it takes so long to go through them, so I started the find but it'll be a while
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [timakro](https://matrix.to/#/@timakro:matrix.org)\: thanks for motivating me to giving email server a try again. Suprisingly it worked this time 🥳
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how can i get path to config dir?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i mean in code
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> There are multiple ones why exactly do you need the path? Usually one uses a method provided by storage.cpp that handles the path for you
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i need to save files
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> with my specific way and i need path
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> open file with the Storage() method and save
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :zzzz: okay
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> like for example here @uwu  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/59deb42252cfe9b999c3991db88f678ca607ea58/src/engine/shared/config.cpp#L50-L81
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> k thx
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can you take a look? 🙂 ^
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for what it's worth, it's never happened to me on USA
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but maybe you know that already

15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hello.
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> How you do update the language files? I doubt you do it manually but I can't find a script for that.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have you looked in the script dir?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Sure I did. But you know, asking a question in a chat usually makes you smarter. Sometimes the answer came right after the message, sometimes a bit later.
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I looked at every script in the scripts. But I missed the subdir https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/scripts/languages
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Thank you @Jupstar ✪!
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Sure I did. But you know, asking a question in a chat usually makes you smarter and makes you more attentive. 😄 Sometimes the answer came right after the message, sometimes a bit later.

16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Configuring nginx is so weird, the if suggests an imperative programming language but it's all a weird declarative jumble with insane edge cases and workarounds
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Configuring nginx is so weird, the `if` suggests an imperative programming language but it's all a weird declarative jumble with insane edge cases and workarounds
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You basically require the firefox network debugging tools to verify your nginx config is doing what you think it should be doing
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lwn.net/Articles/863459/
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> side by side with a c one
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I'm flying to Italy next week from USA. I am fully vaccinated. Do I need to take a test before I fly there? Or at the airport?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro, a very good tool to help debug nginx routes is add_header
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2\: yep i'm doing that
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No tests needed from the US. You only need your green certficate showing your second dose was 14 days ago
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> man i wish nginx was a full brown programming language
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> man i wish nginx was a full blown programming language
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I have the white vaccination card from the CDC. My second dose was a couple months ago. Sounds like I should be fine then. Thanks @Learath2
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish nginx wasnt this insane. The way nested location blocks work is just flat out stupid
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> can you explain to me how they work?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are treated like its not nested at all basically
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> is my assumption right that a request is always handled by a single location block? in other words a request can't enter multiple location blocks?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only a single location block will ever match a request indeed
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And it is quite weird. It uses the longest regex match unless a ^~ route matches exactly
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah the order of the blocks doesn't matter in most cases
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i found a way to disable auth\_basic in case a cookie is set, currently i'm trying to set that cookie after the user authenticates
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but sometimes this cookie is returned with `return` statements without the user authentication
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but sometimes this cookie is returned with `return` statements without the user authenticating
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i basically want a "remember me" for auth\_basic
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> so what are the rules for nested location blocks?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> does every level need to match?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess my actual problem is this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40447376/auth-basic-within-location-block-doesnt-work-when-return-is-specified
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you can't protect `returns` with `auth_basic`
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess my actual problem is this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40447376/auth-basic-within-location-block-doesnt-work-when-return-is-specified
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you can't protect `return`s with `auth_basic`
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Timakro the inner blocks must share a prefix with the outer, so basically the outer has to match indeed
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok then nested location blocks are really just a shortcut for writing them all out in a list
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Timakro yep, it's for organization mostly even, as the outer block won't be executed for the inner ones. And the order within blocks matters very little
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is discord doing this?...
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk it looks strange
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I specifically don't hilight anyone
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \@Timakro does this work maybe?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LOL
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> are you on discord?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, I'm on discord
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> does it work when i ping you? @Learath2
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `@timakro` maybe this works?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what were you doing different?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you wrapped it in code? xD
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had to put it within backticks so discord wouldn't highlight a guy named tim
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, wrapped in code
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> huh, from my side it works super nice transparently
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i couldn't even tell you are on discord
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on discord it's fairly obvious you are on matrix
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess when names have this hash and a number behind them it means discord
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wait, so @Ryozuki [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org) @YupHio @Jupstar ✪ you all are on matrix?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hm no doesn't look like it
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> chillerdragon is
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chiller is on matrix the others are discord
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have an account somewhere, but i'd use it for friends only anyway^^
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> The bridge is so random I am also confused who is here and who is there
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 316gb before 2019
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I now need to download 300~gb on a 20mbit connection
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Will only take me 33 hours 😄

21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I swear this is the only combination that does what I want
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Switching out any statement for another breaks the whole thing
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> This is pushing the boundaries of nginx to its limits
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Might turn this into a blog post
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Should probably offer prize money for finding a bug in this
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what u trying to use nginx for
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at the end of the day its better to use it as a reverse proxy and do anytghing with ur own http sv
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `@timakro` if no one understands it you are doing it right
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can anyone explain me for what purposes do people set up nginx
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> to serve websites, to proxy stuff
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> >to server websites
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> how actually?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ehe?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i broke learath xd
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe either it reads a html file and servers it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or it talks to a php fpm
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or it proxies it to another http server
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> serves*
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it can talk to like anything, as long as it speaks a known protocol, like fpm or uwsgi
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can make backends in assembly 😛
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
