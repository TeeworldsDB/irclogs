00:00 < laxa> np :)
00:13 <@deen> DDNet client/server 6.3 released
00:13 <@deen> the menus at the left side on http://ddnet.tw are getting bigger and bigger
00:14 <@deen> Should I just make the menu move with the rest of the site?
00:14 <@deen> or keep increasing the necessary screen height
00:22 < eeeee> i tried coming up with a better layout for the website but it seems i have no design powers whatsoever :(
00:23 <@deen> me neither, but thanks for trying!
00:23 < eeeee> probably have to read a book on that or something
00:24 < eeeee> or i just get a designer friend drunk an make him come up with some ideas
00:37 < xrothx> deen:  
00:38 <@deen> hi xrothx 
00:38 < xrothx> I get a player telling that ddnet is infected
00:38 < xrothx> he uploaded the mod to virustotal
00:38 < xrothx> & he is watching ddnet for over 4months now? 
00:38 < xrothx> Who is the compiler of the mod before its published? 
00:38 <@deen> I am
00:39 < xrothx> aight, why would it be scanned as virus? 
00:39 <@deen> many programs do that when compiled with gcc for windows
00:39 <@deen> virus scanners are shit
00:39 < xrothx> ok :P 
00:39 <@deen> it's usually some generic detection
00:39 <@deen> "something looks suspicious"
00:40 <@deen> and of course ddnet client is suspicious, it has an autoupdater that can load any code from the internet
00:40  * eeeee pretty sure that's the autoupdater part
00:40 <@deen> I think Tsin was flaming about DDNet client being malware before we had the autoupdater
00:40 <@deen> I explained to some guy how I compile it with gcc
00:40 <@deen> He did the same and got the same virus results
00:44 < eeeee> https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d96ccfd7deec47dee2bb68d3bcb098dbb0d21ad57039ea8833c3bf4ae88d5673/analysis/1416959048/
00:46 < xrothx> !twp xRoThx
00:46 < Nimda> xRoThx is currently playing 1TeeMap on server : DDNet GER2 - Oldschool [DDraceNetwork].
00:46 <@deen> eeeee: yeah, always looks something like that
00:47 < eeeee> dafuq is ByteHero
00:47 <@deen> haha
00:47 < xrothx> deen: 
00:47 < xrothx> ger2 tested & secure :)
00:48 <@deen> xrothx: i see ddos still incoming
00:48 <@deen> 100 mbit/s make it through
00:48 <@deen> xrothx: how strong was the attack?
00:48 <@deen> Everyone seems to know ByteHero just from virustotal^^
00:48 <@deen> and it seems to have many false positives
00:49 <@deen> chinese anti virus software I'd say
00:50 < laxa> !fr-en reconnaissance
00:50 < Nimda> Translation: recognition
00:51 < eeeee> that reminds me of old windows xp days when it was more like a real fight against viruses
00:52 <@deen> Or win95/98, when your system would be infected by connecting it to the internet for a few minutes^^
00:53 < laxa> there was a worm on win XP
00:53 < laxa> I came back from holiday
00:53 < eeeee> i once had to fix friend's computer after a virus got onto it. friend had "mcafee" antivirus which somehow couldn't prevent infection and in turn got infected and somehow deleted itself leaving the computer without any antivirus whatsoever
00:53 < laxa> it was restarting computer every 1 minute
00:53 <@deen> I sent ByteHero a report about the false positive, lets see what happens
00:53 < laxa> and you were gotting it just by internet connection iirc
00:54 < eeeee> had to fight the virus with bare hands after that. it was restarting way too fast after being killed from task manager so you couldn't delete the binary, but i wrote a batch file to kill and delete it in loop and it lost eventually.
00:54 <@deen> eeeee: that's what the virus wanted you to believe!!!
00:54 < eeeee> oh shi-
00:55 <@deen> haha
00:55 < laxa> !fr-de beaux-frère
00:55 < Nimda> Translation: Feine Bruder
01:08 < xrothx> deen:  Got 3 people today that I know for a couple years telling me that ddnet is not good
01:08 <@deen> xrothx: why?
01:08 < xrothx> master pw in it, ? 
01:08 <@deen> what?
01:08 < xrothx> in the mod
01:08 <@deen> i don't understand the question
01:09 < xrothx> Can you check the latest update
01:09 < xrothx> pretty weird all those people
01:09 <@deen> hm?
01:09 <@deen> There is no master pw
01:09 <@deen> I can't control other people's servers and clients, if that's what you say
01:18 <@deen> eeeee: I like simple webdesign, but people said the ddnet.tw website looked too simple
01:18 <@deen> so I made it into the monster it is now
01:21 <@deen> Like my personal website: http://felsin9.de/nnis/#teaching-research (Just uploaded my paper!)
01:23 <@deen> xrothx: no report on the ddos size?
01:24 <@deen> xrothx: and i still didn't understand why ddnet is bad according to your old guys
01:24 <@deen> the usualy argument is that we kill off teeworlds because we're too big
01:43 < Maple> can somebody tell me what Naiß﻿ means
01:43 <@deen> "nice"
01:43 < Maple> ok phew
01:43 < Maple> i was thinking it meant noob
01:44 <@deen> when you pronounce it in German it sounds exactly like "nice"
01:44 < Maple> xd
01:44 < Maple> !twp Fudgyking
01:44 < Nimda> No Fudgyking found online.
01:44 < Maple> !twp Broken

01:46 < Maple> deen the name faking prevention still doesnt work
01:46 <@deen> Maple: really?
01:46 < Maple> yea im in server with broken
01:46 < Maple> and i have his name 
01:46 <@deen> let me check
01:47 <@deen> That server wasn't restarted yet
01:56 <@deen> Maple: any better idea than just regarding whitespaces as nonexistant?
01:57 < Maple> well
01:57 < Maple> in vanilla servers
01:57 < Maple> my faking doesnt work
01:57 <@deen> in vanilla server only ascii characters work
01:58 < Maple> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character
01:58 <@deen> the only negative effect i can imagine is if someone is called "B r o k e n", and Broken enters, he will get named "(1)Broken"
01:58 < Maple> i use U+2060 : word joiner
01:58 <@deen> yeah, i know
01:59 <@deen> it's recognized, just not in the middle of a name^^
01:59 <@deen> only at start and end
01:59 < Maple> well that one is not even visible
01:59 < Maple> so the person using it is faking for sure
01:59 < Maple> for the visual whitespace, you can make exceptions
02:00 <@deen> yeah, but i don't want to blacklist every single whitespace that may be too small to be visible
02:00 < laxa> deen: Wtf, only ddrace use utf-8 chars for nickname ?
02:00 <@deen> laxa: it's a change in 0.6.2 for vanilla i think
02:00 < laxa> ok
02:00 <@deen> most mods have kept utf8 names (probably because they're at 0.6.1)
02:00 < laxa> cause otherwise, I would have said, completely remove utf8 for nickname and just use ascii
02:00 <@deen> yeah, great
02:01 < laxa> it's complete bullshit to me to be honest
02:01 <@deen> let's force russians to use english names!
02:01 < laxa> hum
02:01 <@deen> everyone has to have an english name!
02:01 < laxa> just normal chars I mean
02:01 <@deen> fuck other cultures!
02:01 <@deen> yes, "normal chars" are english :P
02:01 < laxa> just alpha-chars
02:01 <@deen> that's the english alphabet
02:01 < laxa> String.Alpha.NoCulture()
02:01 < laxa> better ? :D
02:01 < Maple> *grabs popcorn*
02:02 < laxa> Maple: fuck off :D
02:02 < laxa> Just normal alpha chars in every culture should be allowed
02:02 < Maple> tbh, faking should be considered as admiration
02:02 < laxa> that's what I mean
02:02 < laxa> Maple: I am not talking about faking at all anyway
02:02 < laxa> just about nickname
02:02 < Maple> i think its deen's issue
02:03 < laxa> faking or nickname ?
02:03 < Maple> faking
02:03 < laxa> nickame isn't deen's problem, he has to follow the rules of teeworlds
02:03 < laxa> teeworlds is like the first game I ever seen accepting every char from utf8
02:03 < laxa> ok, gotta go sleep, anyway, nice talking, bye bye :)
02:04 <@deen> bye

03:26 < eeeee> nice webpage. i reloaded a couple times because i thought css didn't load :)
03:31 <@deen> haha
03:31 <@deen> it even has a css: http://felsin9.de/nnis/css.css
03:32 <@deen> Especially nice: background-color: #eeeeee;
03:32  * eeeee approves
03:46 < eeeee> so if you wanted to simplify the website i guess you could use some tools like google analytics to understand how do people use your site and then optimize for that
03:46 < Nimda> Xabier by Waschlappen & Broken just released on Moderate at 2014-11-26 03:43
03:47 <@deen> good night
03:47 < eeeee> nite
14:33 <@EastByte> good afternoon
14:38 <@EastByte> deen: I want to test stuff
14:45 < laxadedi> LL
17:33 <@deen> EastByte: what stuff?
19:22 < BeaR> sup?
19:34 <@deen> hi BeaR 
19:35 <@deen> There's elevator music at the start of Xabier
19:35 <@deen> released tonight
19:35 < BeaR> ah cool
19:35 <@deen> apparently still no one can compress opus files properly^^
19:35 < BeaR> hm lol
19:35 <@deen> I've had to reencode for all maps with sound
19:36 < BeaR> there are more ?:
19:36 <@deen> Little Forest by Kintaro
19:36 <@deen> The halloween moderate map by Ama
19:36 <@deen> and now Xabier
19:36 < BeaR> k
19:36 <@deen> I've made a category for maps with sound in the votes^^
19:37 < BeaR> you changed sth at the soundsystem? (I didnt follow the commit history in the last time (: )
19:37 <@deen> I reduced the max drift, but I think you saw that
19:37 <@deen> from 2 seconds to 0.2 or something
19:37 < BeaR> ah k
19:37 <@deen> because phacrum & 645654 are working on Justice 2 and they always use every single feature
19:38 <@deen> at the start of the map they have a huge clock and it's ticking
19:38 <@deen> analog clock that shows the actual game time^^
19:38 < BeaR> lol
19:38 <@deen> But they've been working on the map for a year, so don't expect a release soon
19:38 < BeaR> sounds fun with the envelope editor only :>
19:39 <@deen> I did some bugfixes yesterday, but couldn't figure out the sound bugs we still have
19:39 < BeaR> there are more expect that cutoff?
19:39 <@deen> today i'm busy with grading lambda calculus homework
19:40 <@deen> only what's here: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues
19:40 <@deen> oh yeah, so it's just that 1 + more complicated sounds as a feature^^
19:40 < BeaR> have to write a paper so currently im lacking time :<
19:40 <@deen> about what?
19:40 < BeaR> API comparisons
19:40 < BeaR> not interesting tbh
19:41 < BeaR> that complicated sound stuff would high probably break compatibility with older clients /:
19:41 <@deen> ah, i fixed HD flag for sound
19:41 <@deen> with older clients and with older maps?
19:42 < BeaR> can't remember if I added some versioning for all the sound stuff
19:42 < BeaR> older clients
19:42 <@deen> if no sound plays on older client that's fine
19:42 <@deen> people who stay at old client can't expect that new features work
19:42 <@deen> but map should still be playable
19:42 < BeaR> nah, will it will probably fuck up the serialization /:
19:42 <@deen> ok, shit
19:42 < BeaR> - will
19:43 <@deen> that's too bad
19:43 <@deen> round sound is often not what mappers want apparently
19:43 < BeaR> hm, I fixed that cutoff thingie already, dunno where the source is
19:43 < BeaR> gonna tackle it tomorrow
19:44 <@deen> 2 of 3 mappers who used sound have asked for a way to do "same sound level in an entire room, nowhere else"
19:44 < BeaR> hm?
19:44 < BeaR> no falloff?
19:44 <@deen> exactly
19:44 <@deen> sound should just play in room
19:44 <@deen> or maybe rectangular falloff
19:45 <@deen> I wrote a small twping tool and am now recording my ping to the 3 european ddnet servers: http://ddnet.tw/ping/
19:45 < BeaR> (:
19:46 < Axomar> Deen, r u there. Have u a minute for me pls
19:46 <@deen> hi Axomar 
19:46 < Axomar> hi :D
19:47 < Axomar> give it other chatroom to talk alone? :D
19:47 < Axomar> s
19:47 < BeaR> hm there is an easy workaround for that compatibility break maybe (:
19:47 <@deen> BeaR: nice =)
19:48 < BeaR> deprecating the old LAYERTYPE_SOUNDS and add sth like LAYERTYPE_SOUNDS_V2 would probably work
19:48 <@deen> yes
19:49 <@deen> how do you plan to extend sounds?
19:53 < BeaR> basically extend the CSoundSource, add some m_DoFalloff bool and index for a list of shapes
19:54 < BeaR> shape would probably be some sort of tagged union with Sphere/Rectangle/(?)
19:55 <@deen> maybe make the falloff a float between 0 and 1
19:55 <@deen> or an int from 0..255, or sth like that
19:55 <@deen> so you can set earlier dropoff
19:55 <@deen> 255 would mean dropoff starts in the middle
19:55 <@deen> 0 means no dropoff
19:55 < BeaR> true, probably more flexiable (:
19:56 < BeaR> flexible*
19:56 <@deen> Sphere and Rectangle are also the only shapes I can think of that would make sense
19:56 <@deen> but it's still a problem for rooms in weird shapes
19:56 <@deen> what if two rectangles overlap?
19:56 <@deen> ah, that's what you mean by "tagged union"?
19:56 < BeaR> huh?
19:57 <@deen> ok, not^^
19:57 <@deen> so, what would happen if they overlap?
19:57 <@deen> Sound plays louder, right?
19:57 < BeaR> y
19:57 < BeaR> tagged union is some kind of algebraic data type
19:58 < BeaR> sth like data shape = Rectangle | Sphere
19:58 <@deen> I'd prefer to imagine all shapes as a union, so that you can create a more complex shape by combining multiple
19:58 < BeaR> hm would be pretty complex :D
19:58 <@deen> BeaR: syntax error, should be Shape ;)
19:58 < BeaR> :p
19:59 < BeaR> I actually learn it tomorrow :>
19:59 <@deen> I taught it on Monday
19:59 <@deen> But we've finished Haskell now anyway
20:00 < BeaR> ah lol
20:00 <@deen> now lambda calculus, type inference, prolog, scala, x11, mpi, compilers :P
20:00 <@deen> it's a weird course
20:00 < BeaR> x11 ?
20:00 < Maple> xorg
20:00 < BeaR> but why
20:01 <@deen> the terrible x11 language
20:01 <@deen> oh wait, it's x10^^
20:01 <@deen> http://x10-lang.org/
20:01 < Maple> i started seeing assembly today
20:01 <@deen> I don't like it anyway, always joke about how long compiling programs takes
20:01 < BeaR> heh also want to learn Scale some day
20:02 <@deen> Maple: hopefully not the java bytecode we do^^
20:02 < BeaR> all hail SIMD vector math \o/
20:02 < Maple> we see the basics using WinSimul
20:02 < Maple> more lke the logic
20:03 <@deen> BeaR: I should be writing a paper for a conference using that, but can't access the machine i need for that^^
20:03 < BeaR> :P
20:04 <@deen> Maple: cool, now you can optimize DDNet server to work well with 512 players
20:04 < Maple> xD!
20:04 < BeaR> concerning the complex shapes, I believe everything beside polygons is pretty much out of scope tbh
20:05 < BeaR> MAX_CLIENTS = 512 :>
20:06 <@deen> BeaR: then let's just do circles and rectangles, but have to make sure they work with the grid
20:06 <@deen> then it should be fine to build bigger shapes with 0 falloff (i hope)
20:06 < BeaR> y
20:25 < Learath2> deen: what happens when i try to autoupdate with a client 3 versions older or smth ?
20:33 <@deen> Learath2: it should work!
20:33 <@deen> Learath2: it should make a list of what has changed since that version
20:33 <@deen> and download and update all these files
20:34 < Learath2> just verifying couldnt really read what the old one was doing 
20:34 <@deen> I didn't write it!
20:34 <@deen> I think I tried around some time ago and it seemed to work and I even understood why
20:35 < Learath2> but you probably know how it behaves and its easier to ask you :)
20:48 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
20:48 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 472
20:48 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
20:48 <@deen> looks good
20:49 <@deen> there was a bug today on ddnet: when you changed server type from solo to non-solo it would stay solo^^
20:54 < o_be_one> hi:)
20:54 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
20:54 < o_be_one> how are you deen ?
20:56 <@deen> half-dead
20:56 < eeeee> be optimistic! half-alive
20:57 <@deen> shouldn't have bicycled 100 km right after donating blood^^
20:57 < eeeee> lol you're hardcore
20:59 <@deen> o_be_one: what are you up to? I've seen middle americans on CAN^^
21:01 < o_be_one> lol eeeee :D
21:01 < o_be_one> ahah deen yes CAN is getting more regular players, good to see :) and funny to see some US players ...
21:01 <@deen> eeeee: i don't know how to autogenerate what characters are rendered as empty
21:02 < o_be_one> Broken, Pepe and other come often too lol :o
21:02 < o_be_one> Hard Candy x)
21:02 < o_be_one> finally i think you can state that it was a good idea ^^
21:03 < o_be_one> even if there is only like 10 players, its a new way to get a better ping for many of them
21:03 < o_be_one> ive just 23ms, Mapple 20, seen some with 15ms .......
21:03 <@deen> well, i don't mind. but some people complain that we have too many servers
21:03 <@deen> citing CAN, CHN and Brazil as main examples
21:03 < o_be_one> yes thats a problem cause so there is players on all servers
21:03 < o_be_one> but not all on only one
21:04 < Learath2> you do have alot of servers but not sure how that is a problem 
21:04 < eeeee> deen: i thought you were going to render each character to bitmap and compare those to find the ones which look alike
21:04 < o_be_one> but i take advantage of that, cause all servers are very customisable by voting
21:04 < eeeee> can't you just also note which ones look like space?
21:04 < o_be_one> we can set a server on the mod and on the map we want in only 2 clics ... 
21:04 < o_be_one> all servers can be like "private" easily, its not a bad thing
21:05 <@deen> eeeee: I've just used the unicode confusables, seemed easier
21:05 <@heinrich5991> deen: you could specify that you may only use characters from a single language
21:05 <@heinrich5991> I believe unicode has some properties for that
21:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, I've read about that in the confusables document
21:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: but that would break many existing names
21:05 <@deen> which I would like to avoid
21:06 <@deen> (even if I hate that kind of name)
21:06 < eeeee> oh okay then. the existing function seems to be okay as well.
21:06 <@heinrich5991> deen: you could whitelist all the characters that are in use today
21:06 <@deen> eeeee: actually I had to add a space character there
21:06 <@deen> recently
21:06 <@deen> heinrich5991: so much work^^
21:06 <@deen> heinrich5991: i think the current solution is ok
21:06 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you keep logs?
21:06 <@deen> no
21:06 <@deen> they would be huge
21:06 < eeeee> D:
21:06 <@deen> don't even have the space to store them
21:07 <@heinrich5991> but wait
21:07 <@heinrich5991> you keep records
21:07 <@heinrich5991> enumerate the chars from there
21:07 <@deen> then that's unfair
21:07 <@deen> some characters are allowed, some not. not very transparent
21:08 <@deen> Logs are deleted whenever server is restarted
21:08 <@deen> still GER has 15 GBs of logs right now, even though I restarted a few times in last days
21:08 < Learath2> sounds like you need logrotate and some compression
21:08 <@deen> oh wait, most of that is a single log file
21:08 <@deen> looks like a potential attack^^
21:09 <@deen> indeed!
21:09 <@deen> 14 GB of [14-11-26 03:43:03][]: connection less packet too small, 4
21:09 < eeeee> oh man, such a classic
21:09 <@deen> attack was by "Hard *Candy*₡" it seems
21:09 <@deen> tonight at 4 am
21:09 < Learath2> BAN
21:10 <@deen> I shouldn't log that
21:10 <@deen> too easy to create 14 GB of log
21:10 < eeeee> yeah comment out that dbg_msg first
21:10 < Learath2> then BAN
21:10 < eeeee> i thought i had that in ddrace64 already
21:10 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/c3KuwA
21:10 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 9d3cb79 def: Remove log that happens too often
21:10 <@deen> but now that i commented it out, people will discover this^^
21:10 <@deen> apparently attacks read ddnet git commits
21:11 <@deen> attackers*
21:11 <@heinrich5991> deen: that's no problem after commenting it out
21:12 < Learath2> not deployed yet tho
21:13 <@deen> exactly
21:13 <@deen> and i can't restart already full servers
21:14 <@heinrich5991> what about not pushing until deployed?
21:14 < eeeee> well hopefully impact is not very big as we have async logging
21:14 <@deen> yeah, that would've been smart
21:14 <@deen> eeeee: except if they get more traffic than disk can write
21:14 < eeeee> it was more of an issue in old times when logging was sync
21:14 <@deen> my async logging code is pretty stupid
21:15 <@deen> it works well in normal scenarios, not sure if it's attack proof
21:15 <@deen> but currently I deploy by pulling from github^^

21:25 <@deen> Now I have nice visual proof how terrible ping on GER is for me: http://ddnet.tw/ping/

22:42 < xrothx> deen: 
22:42 < xrothx> deen:  did you choose? 
22:44 <@deen> xrothx: no, but I'm graphing my ping to locations now: http://ddnet.tw/ping/
22:45 <@deen> you can see the problems on GER quite well there
22:46 < xrothx> maybe because ger has 200+ players at the peak moments
22:46 <@deen> no
22:46 <@deen> that has nothing to do with it
22:46 < xrothx> ok
22:46 < xrothx> So you ll most likely switch? :D
22:46 <@deen> no
22:46 <@deen> the performance of GER is great
22:46 <@deen> and the ddos protection as well
22:47 < xrothx> But..? 
22:47 <@deen> I would want another solution, but I guess I need eeeee's help for that, because I don't know how to set it up
22:47 < xrothx> Ok
22:47 < xrothx> deen:  I had an idea
22:47 <@deen> but the ping jumps to 120 for many players
22:47 <@deen> it also happens from Britain and Poland sometimes
22:47 < xrothx> I can buy a cheap dedicated server with 64gb etc
22:47 < xrothx> really good, 
22:47 < xrothx> but what if we take a small vps with nfo
22:47 < xrothx> and make everything go through it? 
22:47 < xrothx> :)
22:47 < xrothx> great host, 
22:48 < xrothx> great protection
22:48 < xrothx> kind of vpn style, but for hosting
22:48 <@deen> yeah, that's a possibility, but in reverse
22:48 <@deen> hm
22:48 <@deen> our approach would be superior
22:49 <@deen> also, nfo has the ping problems, which your idea doesn'T solve
22:49 <@deen> the idea would be this:
22:49 <@deen> keep GER running as it is, use GER2 as a proxy to GER, as you suggested
22:49 <@deen> and people can connect to either IP and end up playing on the same server
22:50 <@deen> then we could also add some client magic so that client automatically sends packets to both servers (or the best one)
22:50 < xrothx> Will it not be their ping + ping of GER2-GER 
22:50 <@deen> yes, it will be
22:50 < xrothx> higher ping
22:50 <@deen> but ping of GER2-GER is 0.8ms
22:50 < xrothx> ok
22:50 <@deen> on GER I have 120 sometimes, on GER2 mostly 20
22:50 < xrothx> Kind of cloud creation of teeworlds hosting ^^
22:50 <@deen> 21 wouldn't be a problem either^^
22:51 < xrothx> ok
22:51 < xrothx> Should try
22:51 < xrothx> ofcourse ^^
22:51 < xrothx> But why not taking GER2 alone then? 
22:51 < xrothx> GER is useless in this situation then 
22:51 <@deen> GER2 has worse performance and probably worse ddos protection
22:51 < xrothx> upgrade GER2 a little bigger & it will be 0.8 ping less? 
22:52 <@deen> also GER2 has bad ping for some people...
22:52 < xrothx> lol?
22:52 < xrothx> conclusion: 
22:52 < xrothx> You will Never find the perfect server
22:52 <@deen> yeah, that's why the new solution would be great
22:53 <@deen> combines all the advantages of both servers
22:53 < xrothx> Aight
22:53 < xrothx> nice
22:53 < xrothx> I have to go now, Goodluck with it ;)
22:53 <@deen> bye
23:01 < Nimda> Peaks by Ama just released on Moderate at 2014-11-26 23:00
23:15 <@deen> is there a small and simple library for checking that updated files are signed? would be nice for the autoupdater in ddnet
23:20 <@deen> since Learath2 wants to use libcurl (I think), maybe we should just use https with our own hard-coded CA
23:22 <@deen> all i could find was gnupg, openssl/libressl, libtomcrypt, crypto++
23:24 <@deen> and libsodium
23:40 < Learath2> deen did that before with ddwar
23:41 < Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/tree/fetcher1
23:42 < Learath2> I did finish the libcurl part 
23:42 <@deen> nice
23:43 < Learath2> just need to make a pretty parser for the upd file
23:43 <@deen> you could also change the update file 
23:43 <@deen> the format
23:43 <@deen> EastByte likes json, so we have a json parser in the source now^^
23:44 < eeeee> yeah hardcoded custom CA worked fine but in the end we used a real CA because we needed it for the website anyway (and you can't host two different https certs on same ip)
23:44 <@deen> i don't trust real CAs but ok =/
23:45 <@deen> for example: what if someone steals ddnet.tw domain. then they can get a certificate and push malware updates
23:47 < eeeee> hmm maybe you can still have a cert signed by real CA but make the client accept only that particular cert (not any valid one)
23:47 <@deen> yeah
23:47 <@deen> i think we could just use a different certificate for update.ddnet.tw than for ddnet.tw
23:47 < eeeee> yeah i though that too but we only had one ip
23:48 < eeeee> could use a different port for update though
23:48 < eeeee> also note how using different certs doesn't actually solve the malware problem
23:49 <@deen> at least it solves it in ddnet client
23:49 < eeeee> if someone steals ddnet.tw he will just drop some <a href="malware.exe">OMG DOWNLOAD THIS NEW UPDATE DDNET CLIENT v. 9001</a> on the front page
23:49 <@deen> can't fix web browsers
