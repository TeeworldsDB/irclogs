07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 you have to ask fokkonaut, I don't know if the server is public or not
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its private
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Heinrich I already wrote you a private msg on discord
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> Guys
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> Hey. I have a question. Is it possible to cut antiping from ddnet and insert it into another client?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well its open source so idk why not
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> would be a bit of work tho
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> I used to know how to do it, but now I just forgot

11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone else have this so we could check how reproducable ddnet is?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> building twice on the same machine with the same build system (ninja/make) seems to produce the same results
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only in release mode
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only have 4.9.2 doesnt ``apt-get update`` update this automatically?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yeah, but distributions ship different versions
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (i.e. it's normal that different distributions have different versions)
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 7.3.0 is ridiculously new 😛
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no higher version than 4.x on any of my machines .-.
12:54 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: 907ec62d3a205f49fb62f1572d75c6d9  DDNet
12:55 <+Learath2> is what I get as the md5sum on my machine
12:55 <@heinrich5991> md5sum. really :D
12:55 <@heinrich5991> ninja/make?
12:55 <+Learath2> I couldn't think of anything else :P
12:55 <+Learath2> make
12:55 <@heinrich5991> sha256sum is the one btw
12:55 <+Learath2> gcc (Gentoo 7.3.0 p1.0) 7.3.0
12:55 <+Learath2> not sure if gentoo injects a couple patches tho

13:07 <@heinrich5991> yea, different hashs for me
13:07 <@heinrich5991> I guess that was a wild idea anyway
13:07 <@heinrich5991> we haven't even compared the libs etc. we're linking
13:09 <+Learath2> well I most definitely should get a different one
13:10 <+Learath2> I compiled everything on this system from scratch, every single one of those would have to be completely reproducible aswell for us to get exact same builds
13:10 <+Learath2> actually no, forgot about dynamic linking, stupid
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Whenever DDNet crashes in fullscreen mode I cant do nothing while it running (in my case I cant start debugging it) because game is topmost and hides everything behind of it. Anyone know the way of hiding such windows without closing? (btw closing is not easy also). Win 10
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Whenever DDNet client crashes in fullscreen mode I cant do nothing while it running (in my case I cant start debugging it) because game is topmost and hides everything behind of it. Anyone know the way of hiding such windows without closing? (btw closing is not easy also). Win 10
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i know the way
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> 😃
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i too have this problem.
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can you share your solution please?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> 1280x1024. as i know, you russian. it's so or i stupid?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> lma
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> o
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you debug fullscreen DDNet when you can't see your debugger because DDNet stays on top?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ahaah
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> paradox
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> you guys must be kidding me. Thats why I talking about. I need to hideout the window
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> you guys must be kidding me. Thats what I talking about. I need to hideout the window
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> or any other solution
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a troll would answer: I have 1920x1080 (sorry, couldn't resist)
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> He already did this answer
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> DDNet crashes rarely, so I dont want change my graphics settings, thats why I`m looking for another solution
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, heinrich, I cant see nothing instead of DDNet
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> today I had crash on loading stage, what never ever occurs before (few years of using DDNet)
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @BannZay have you tried borderless window?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> haha
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> got another crash, but its not topmost anymore
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well, I`ll take this solution. Thx heinrich
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Got the same problem
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> CTRL+ALT+DEL -> Taskmanager -> then you can create a new virtual dekstop -> move debugger into the new virtual desktop -> debug

15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this symbol
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can only press windows key on your keyboard after opening the CTRL+ALT+DEL view for some reason
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ALT+TAB might work too
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ALT/WINDOWS+TAB might work too
17:25 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ChillerDragon opened pull request #1072: Add broadcast importance (fixes #669) (master...Broadcasts) https://git.io/vAbzm
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon maybe add the 6 seconds as an option
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that can be modified?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> though about it
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i like config vars c:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imo its always good
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but thought ddnet dislikes it
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its the other way around
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> great
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ill add one
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki halp i need a commit name
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im trying to improve my commit messages but all i can imagine sound ugly
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i add a random name then
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen got a solution for the crashes?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut I was at work all day
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> BTW: i tested with vanilla and it never crashes
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just ddnet and ofc on ddnet based
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> o.o
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its vanilla too
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but: just when you really spam the keys i mentioned before. on ddnet 11.0.3 you messed something completely up and its crashing almost always without even doing something
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we need to get 11.0.3 back to 10.8.6 😄
19:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 closed pull request #1071: Ignore `Makefile`s generated by the CMake Make target (master...pr_ddnet_gitignore_cmake_make) https://git.io/vAFQj
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> github should really add ff merging...
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rebase merging is alsmost the same 😉
20:34 <@deen> @fokkonaut I don't understand what that server is doing specifically btw. How is it different from just changing map? Is the source code available somewhere?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the source is not available and the thing is, its not a normal map chanhge, something is just commented out or something like this. He doesnt want to tell anyone, but he made it to be a normal change now, its working slow but its working
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how is the behaviour any different then a map change?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not waiting for answers?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> answers?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not following the protocol, anticipating what the client will send and already sending the answers to that as well
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds useless tbh...
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like reducing RTT
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a tile performing a map change sounds useless as a whole aswell
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh wow
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're so unimaginative 😛
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'll just take everyone to a new map
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the server has support for handling multiple maps
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😉
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doubt it, if he hacked that toghether he'd be able to run ddnet in a debugger 😄
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but yeah, with that it could be cool
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is teeworlds mapping turing complete? 😄
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh? not in a way that I know
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is ddnet/ mapping turing complete? 😄
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was wondering could one build a computer using switches, doors, tees and stuff
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmmmm
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lost story 2 crashes last ddnet client when opengl 3.3 enabled
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ are you jupeyy on github? ^
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think so 🙂
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 its a tile that only sends you to another map. yes the server has multi map.
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can also Watch in spec over the other map
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and he deleted somehthing in the change to make it Switch faster, and that caused crashes at some point (11.0.3 extremely)
21:04 <+Learath2> should add that to the list of things i'll build someday just to have it open source
21:06 <@deen> @fokkonaut Well, figure out what he deleted, that's the cause...
21:06 <@deen> probably some data structure isn't initialized yet
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he doesnt want to tell me nor anyone else
21:07 <+Learath2> then he should grab a debugger and figure it out himself...
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 why u want to make this opensrc?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The problem only appears on Windows so he Cant debug it
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5915
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> isn't that the blocker source
21:09 <+Learath2> I don't know tbh, I derive some pleasure by open sourcing others work by replicating it, information should be free and all
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> y why
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> jao yes its the src
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> open source is ❤
21:11 <+Learath2> could one of you grab a copy of it? I can't download from google drive from this computer
21:12 <+Learath2> open source is unsustainable unless you are a tech giant like google
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 the server of him is based on vanilla. damage is off by default. If you shoot with ur gun everythings nice. as soon as you Switch the map and shoot gun again it predicts weird, kind of it thinks that you have jetpack on. Can u fix it?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc vanilla Client doesnt have that preditction
21:13 <+Learath2> I never touched any of the prediction code, not my thing
21:14 <+Learath2> it being vanilla makes sense though, I doubt it'd be easy to do the multi map with the spaghetti that is the ddnet source :P
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can someone remap this lost story2
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it uses quad layers that are 27000x4800 big
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess thats why it crashes
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the limit is 2billion bytes
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which is roughly 9.4kx9.4k
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt somebody needs more tiles ever xd
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently kintaro does
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the map is just bad mapped
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he clipped the layers
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the game layer is only around 5kx1k
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh not even
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 2k x 600
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> XD
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ why did it work before? 🙂
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait so why does it crash actually, it's well below the limit
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i reduced the ram usage
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and since opengl 32 bit only supports native pointer size
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it would be around 4 billion
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is it 32 bit only
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the 32 bit opengl is 32 bit
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because it uses native pointer sizes
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's just made like that bcs it makes sense somewhere
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i can double the size again
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that would add 4 bytes more on system ram
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> np for normal 64 bit users
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no probnlem i guess?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> learath
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well it's somewhere ram waste
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, is it even okay to go around breaking maps? 😛
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> easiest would be to use #pragma
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but heinrich appearently saw its not standard
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ you say you reduced ram usage – why did it work before and now it doesn't? because of reduced address bits?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can pack things without pragma
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 yes
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i use 1 bit of the pointer
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ pragma doesn't reduce space
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it doesnt add 4 bytes
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well pragma push
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pack(push, 1)
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on what struct?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> means 1 byte alignment
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on maplayer.h the tile visual info
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `STileVisual`?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh actually just the tilelayers have to be fixed
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's 4 bytes
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4 bytes = 2 billion bcs 1 byte is used
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #pragma(pack) doesn'T change that it uses 4 bytes
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with 4 billion would be double the size for the pointer, but 4 bytes more for the boolean at normal alignment
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #pragma pack(push, 1)
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't change the size of that struct
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u have to add a boolean
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since i would need 1 byet more
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but at normal alignment that would be 4 bytes
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean the map probs doesnt load on 32 bit anyway xD
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can someone try with 32 bit and the old rendering?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs only 32 bit users are windows and that limits the ram to 2-3 gb
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well with old renderer maybe
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which map was it?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can test it fast
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lost story 2
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ maybe one could use the least significant bit of the offset?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> am i not doing it?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're using the most significant one
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> resulting in only half the address space being available
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh yeah
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably works
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since the number is even
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> \o/
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still these maps are using much ram bcs of bad mapping
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even with the old renderer it takes ages to load
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not really bad mapping if it achieves something different
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought it was needlessly big?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe an abuse of mapping
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk how it achieves the effect or if it legitimately needs the huge space but it is quite a different map
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but when the game layer is so small
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what layer is so bad mapped in lost story 2?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why would there be a tilelayer be so big
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno there are so many
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> give an example 😄
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its fact
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> EXAMPLE 😄
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i cant prove it it must be like that xD
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 90% of the layers have zero width xD
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> literally zero or figuratively zero?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most are mapped good*
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i cant find the fucking map layer
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its probably the chapter images
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> group 43 # 47
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure it's not pleasent to edit and sure our tools might not be good enough to edit it but I'm pretty sure every layer is needed to achieve the effect
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> group 43 - 47
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it would be a different bug
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then i don't understand what u mean xd
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it works with an old client heinrich?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with ogl3?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> #56 also has huge clipping values
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think they dont mean anything
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or no
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok the debugger say
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its crashing somewhere else xd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll just commit the fix with the font manager soon xd
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyone else getting startup crashes under windows sometimes?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 u maybe?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not using windows
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i even get crashes with the official release sometimes
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that might be part of the problem – few of the devs use windows
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rip
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how can u code without vs ;~;
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vs is a nice editor, but it doesn't run on linux
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nowadays I use vim
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u defs have 2 lifes
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with vim xD
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you need 2 lifes xD
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it crashes at mem_alloc
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like memory corruption
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and somehow destroys the pointer of the first memory header
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but if valgrind doesnt report it under linux, that makes it strange
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since vs and mingw both crashing sometimes
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried it in valgrind?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no but deen said nothing suspecious
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> actually i got that crash since 10.x anywhere around that
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, sounds like buffer overflow or so
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but now its the first time it happened in debug mode
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or use-after-free
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but at startup already xD
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well gonna see if i find anything
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just don't trust SDL
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its buggy shit
