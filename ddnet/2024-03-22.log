03:21 < bridge> <Ewan> you can
03:21 < bridge> <Ewan> set your player name to the skin and it should automatically be downloaded

05:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Any advice on how to manage different ddnet configs for different devices?
05:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I currently have only one git repo with all my settings but my laptop and desktop have different screens and specs
05:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerTW/GitSettings/blob/583c3aedf1ae1580f06070c2fba95fc8c3f01fe2/swap_settings/gfx.cfg#L24
05:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my poor laptop struggles with 666 refresh rate I guess i would either need two configs and then conditionally load those. I wish ddnet configs were turing complete -.-
05:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: adjust the way you start ddnet
05:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could pass another device-specific config on start
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats thw two configs approach
05:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why do ddnet configs need to be turing complete?
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont like it too much but seems like there is no other option
05:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems backwards for configs
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i can have one config for all devices
05:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can have that, using the approach I gave you
05:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no need for more complexity in ddnet
05:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then i need complexity elsewhere
05:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. it's not on ddnet to maintain, but on the users that need it
05:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds amazing

08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> For folks who don't have time to read a 90 page document, the case rests on specific claims, not just the general claim that iPhone is a monopoly because it's so big. Here are those claims:
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1. "Super Apps"
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> Apple has restrictions on what they allow on the App Store as far as "Super Apps", which are apps that might offer a wide variety of different services (specifically, an app which has several "mini programs" within it, like apps within an app). In China, WeChat does many different things, for example, from messaging to payments. This complaint alleges that Apple makes it difficult or impossible to offer this kind of app on their platform. Apple its
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2. Cloud streaming apps
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> Similar to "super apps", the document alleges that Apple restricts apps which might stream different apps directly to the phone (like video games). It seems there are several roadblocks that Apple has added that make these kinds of apps difficult to release and promote - and of course, Apple offers their own gaming subscription service called Apple Arcade which might be threatened by such a service.
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3. Messaging interoperability
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> Probably most people are familiar with this already, how messages between (for example) iOS and Android devices do not share the same feature-set.
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 4. Smartwatches
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> Other smart watches than the Apple Watch exist, but the document alleges that Apple restricts the functionality that these devices have access to so that they are less useful than the Apple Watch. Also, the Apple Watch itself does not offer compatibility with Android.
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 5. Digital wallets
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> It is claimed that Apple restricts the APIs available so that only Apple Pay can implement "tap to pay" on iOS. In addition to lock-in, note that Apple also collects fees from banks for using Apple Pay, so they get direct financial benefit in addition to the more nebulous benefit of enhancing the Apple platform.

10:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao I just debugged with a pen. It’s a simple problem but drawing it out helped :D
10:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> heh, nice 🙂
11:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you had time to look at registering at multiple masters? @learath2
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> I'm having a bit of computer trouble so not yet
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> I'm getting random crashes that are textbook ram issue, but it passes memtest86 no issue
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> eeh
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds bad
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have a backup of your data?
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in case your computer completely fails
11:57 < bridge> <learath2> Of the important stuff yes
11:58 < bridge> <learath2> I have almost a dozen terabytes of storage, so it's hard to have a full backup
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh wow
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> Next time I move around I'll build like a 20TB NAS 😄
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that reminds me of the teehistorian script I'm supposed to fix
11:59 < bridge> <avolicious> go big or go home, atleast 1 PB
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do you build that?
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and what are the power costs?
12:00 < bridge> <avolicious> depends, do you need it as hot storage or can it be cold storage aswell?
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> Going to a PB would probably be cost prohibitive unless I land an insane job
12:01 < bridge> <avolicious> https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/n71mh1/who_has_a_petabyte_in_their_home/
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> Especially since I wouldn't run less than a RAID5
12:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Cannabis will be decriminalized in Germany starting from April
12:03 < bridge> <avolicious> Excluded in Bavaria 😄
12:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Well, they can't undo the law.
12:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But they can do everything in their power to make it as annoying as possible for people living there
12:05 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if it's the very slight overclock I'm running
12:05 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe I should give it a little more voltage. Though it's been stable for like 3 years now, it's odd for it to be failing now
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only for personal consumption and personal growing though
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, in bavaria, too
12:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Bavaria will introduce their "cannabis police"
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> I guess thats good enough? Unless you wanted to be a kingpin
12:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> They'll do literally anything to make it annoying there
12:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It is good enough, and starting in July there will be those growclubs
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> carrying weed was without penalty before, too. consumption was never illegal
12:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> The next big step will be a full market, but that has to be done with changing some EU laws
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> carrying weed for personal consumption was without penalty before, too. consumption was never illegal
12:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Sorry to inform you that it wasnt
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> drop the "sorry" ^^
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> Was it not only technically though? I remember reading Germany only has it decriminalized
12:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> There was the "Freimenge für Eigenbedarf", which was never really something they cared about. Bavaria for example opened a case for 0.1g
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> As in it is illegal but you wont be charged for it
12:09 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, but bavaria is known for being stricter than others 😄
12:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, without penalty. it's illegal, but the worst that'll happen is getting it taken away
12:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> afaik
12:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No, they opened cases which would later be dropped if it was below a specific amount
12:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But e.g. in bavaria they didn't close them more often than in other federal states
12:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And because possession was illegal, it was in your criminal record
12:11 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing this is more about getting the actual law in line with practice. Though idk, I don't read german so it's hard for me to have a good understanding of it
12:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Which leads to you being "recognized" and potentionally when getting pulled over by the cops you have to do a piss test
12:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> The practice is very different from many people's theoretical understanding
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, interesting
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> So, the most important thing in this whole new law is:
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> - possession legal
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> - driving legal (higher values allowed for drug testing)
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> Driving legal? As in driving under the influence?
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (most important for an individual, the other things about youth protection etc is also very important)
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No, but the original limit was 0.1ng/ml blood serum
12:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and that was literally not meaningful
12:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And they gonna raise it now, so at least on the next day after sleep  you should be fine to drive again legally
12:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (when ur sober ofc, u may not drive while under the influence)
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> That number does need some context. Idk how serum levels of THC(? I assume they test for) correlates to how high you are
12:16 < bridge> <learath2> Ok. That makes more sense
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> they tested THC COOH, that's a byproduct when THC gets reduced in your body
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and firstly, testing that is very dumb
12:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> secondly, the limit of 1ng/ml was very stupid, because that basically means "this person consumed cannabis within the last few weeks"
12:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and if you're like noby who consumes a lot, daily, then you'll always be above that level, even when sober
12:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> because thc reduced exponentionally
12:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the last rest can be in your system for up to 2-3 months when you're a heavy user
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing THC COOH isn't psychoactive
12:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no, but it leads to conclusion you consumed
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> I see
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah sounds silly
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Indeed xD
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's unbelievable this went through now
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> Did y'all see apple getting sued in the US?
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lmao
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> I never thought I'd see the day
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> It has been decades since the US government last pulled out the anti trust laws against such a successful company
12:20 < bridge> <peter0x44> I hope they have actual teeth and the election doesn't interfere
12:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> Bush saved Microsoft in the last instance, sadly
12:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> Would be so much better if they were split
12:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> do you think it's good they did?
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, but I won't really elaborate further. My opinion on these things is rather extreme and I can't argue for it within a couple sentences
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> im unsure whether that has to be regulated, cuz they own their software, so why do they have to make it accessible for anyone else that is competitive? (thats why they didnt do all of that yet)
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i mean its probably right they get sued, but it's also kinda unfair (even tho i dislike apple anyways)
12:23 < bridge> <learath2> It's monopolistic
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> taking that aspect, elon musk will never get his X imperium
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
12:24 < bridge> <peter0x44> Control of my own computing matters, not that I have an iPhone anyway
12:25 < bridge> <learath2> Anti trust laws ensure a healthy free market in the capitalist understanding of the economy, and advocate for the user in a more social understanding of the economy
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I see
12:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> This is just how the capitalism goes
12:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> You used to have symbian, java, windows phone, probably some I'm forgetting
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> It's one thing we all should agree on, but our communal understanding of capitalism has gone very cloudy especially in the last 2-3 decades. People interpret the concept of a free market in such a bizarre manner
12:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> It's inherent how it ends up, it functions that way
12:27 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly why anti trust laws are integral to make sure no company becomes too powerful that they don't need to innovate anymore
12:28 < bridge> <peter0x44> Well, it's more like it's broken fundamentally and you need crappy "fixes" like that
12:28 < bridge> <peter0x44> But yes
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> I try to avoid calling it broken or pointing out any inherent flaws in it since people suddenly get very defensive when you do so
12:57 < bridge> <cyberFighter> holy shit the game is unplayable for me in linux

14:06 < bridge> <matodor> windows slows down when trying to read from corrupted hdd blocks, I had this problem recently as cats jumped on the system unit and damaged the hard disk)
14:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> when registering on the DDNet Wiki https://wiki.ddnet.org/ the e-mail you receive will not display your ipv4, but display a private ip (172.21.0.1), is that intended? :D
14:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh
14:07 < bridge> <matodor> webserver proxy pass maybe
14:08 < bridge> <cyberFighter> if it would be related to hdd wouldnt i see it on linux too
14:09 < bridge> <matodor> perhaps now there is no reading from those places
14:09 < bridge> <matodor> perhaps now there is no reading from those blocks
14:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> well if its a physical damage, yes, if its logical damage, linux might just skip those
14:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can use `badblocks` to search for blocks of memory which are either unreliable or corrupted

14:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> how to now make a game
14:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> luckily i didnt prebuy it, cuz this reeks of shit
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> how to not make a game
14:58 < bridge> <murpi> I don't get it. Why are people acting so surprised about this? This has been a thing since MH:World
14:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> there.. was a shop in mh world to buy stuff?
14:59 < bridge> <murpi> It's a CAPCOM title, of course there's going to be appearance vouchers
15:01 < bridge> <murpi> https://store.steampowered.com/app/861870/Monster_Hunter_World__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher/

15:01 < bridge> <murpi> Funnily enough, they're even more expensive in MH, lmao
15:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #developer
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its only a thing with capcom
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @murpi even if its a thing with them, people should be outraged at this practices regardless
15:35 < bridge> <murpi> It's really not. There's a multitude of other games with silly DLCs like this one.
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> my point is, people should complain and do good complaining about this xD
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is m1 l1 cache 2mb?
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt that insane
15:37 < bridge> <murpi> Oh yes, I definitely agree. It's just surprising how some folks act like CAPCOM's track record with questionable DLCs is a new thing
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> mac m1

15:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> sdl has a method for this
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> Did somebody say `std::hardware_destructive_interference_size`?
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

15:55 < bridge> <teero777> my ground_jump_impulse tune is 3.63
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because you can use your groundjump before your tee hits the ground, I think
15:55 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
15:55 < bridge> <teero777> seems like it
15:56 < bridge> <teero777> the jump impulse values should scale linearly rigth?
15:56 < bridge> <teero777> so if default is 13.2 and i use 6.6 it should be half the height?
15:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not, sure, don't think so
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in classical physics, kinetic energy is ½mv², but potential energy is mh
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so if you double the initial jump impulse, it should quadruple the height(?)
15:58 < bridge> <teero777> maybe
15:58 < bridge> <teero777> hmmm
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (given that teeworlds very roughly approximates normal physics)
15:59 < bridge> <teero777> well if i do half the ground impulse jump and then half the air_friction (0.95^(1/2)) then i wouldnt jump the same height would i?
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> air_friction only works horizontally, I think
16:00 < bridge> <teero777> oh so its just gravity then
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> afaik yes
16:01 < bridge> <teero777> hmm. gravity is the same as jump impulse ig. i mena vel.y += gravity; vel.y -= jump
16:01 < bridge> <teero777> but it doesnt seem like halving both results in the same jump height
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not the same. one is applied once (like velocity), one is applied in each tick (like acceleration)
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try taking a quarter of the ground jump impulse and half the gravity @teero777
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> when taking half of the gravity and half of the ground jump the jump is already way too low
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> so that cant be
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let's compute i
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let's compute it
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ground jump impulse v0
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> gravity g
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then we are at h(t) = v0 * t - g * t * (t-1)

16:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so we reach v(t) = 0 at t = v0/g
16:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so we reach the height h(v0/g) = v0 * v0/g - g * v0/g * (v0/g - 1)
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> okay wait
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> is v0/g supposed to be v0 divided by g?
16:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> ascii math xd
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> okay thx
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but the result looks wrong, I'm trying to figure it out
16:15 < bridge> <teero777> solve for y with default values and then solve for y with the calculated height and g/2
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah! I think the initial formula for the height was wrong
16:15 < bridge> <teero777> if i understand correct
16:16 < bridge> <teero777> solve for y with default values and then solve for x with the calculated height and g/2
16:16 < bridge> <teero777> if i understood correctly
16:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> h(t) = v0 * t - ½ g * t * (t-1)
16:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so now we reach the height h(v0/g) = v0 * v0/g - ½ g * v0/g * (v0/g - 1) = ½ v0²/g - ½ v0
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> Is teeworlds' numerical approximation of this set of differential equations?
16:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I tried to use tw math, not physics
16:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hence the weird (t-1)
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> ah
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> btw do you think you could completely represent the simple tw physics (hook/ad) as a formula?
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hook has saturated add, won't look nice
16:20 < bridge> <teero777> xD i'd play tw on pen and paper in school
16:20 < bridge> <teero777> xD i'd play tw with pen and paper in school
16:26 < bridge> <teero777> hmm my calculator says "no answer" when trying to solve the equation
16:26 < bridge> <teero777> *with the default valuews
16:26 < bridge> <teero777> *with the default values
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> Wym? That equation has a value forall v0 in R and forall g in R\\{0}
16:35 < bridge> <teero777> ah lol im stupid
16:35 < bridge> <teero777> bruhh
16:36 < bridge> <teero777> i thought h(v0/g) = (v0 * v0/g - ½ g * v0/g * (v0/g - 1) = ½ v0²/g - ½ v0)
16:36 < bridge> <teero777> yea my brain smol
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> How did you figure this out btw? It doesn't smell familiar to me
16:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/hackers-can-extract-secret-encryption-keys-from-apples-mac-chips/
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> oof
17:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … + (n - 1) = n(n-1)/2. gauß
17:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> first tick your speed is v - 0 * g, second tick it's v - 1 * g, …
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, that makes sense
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> yo im confused.
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> the default jump height is 5.23875 blocks
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> i want to calculate the jump impulse that leads to the default jump height under the condition of the gravity.
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> so i should have `5.23875 = (1/2)*((x*x)/a)-(1/2)*x`
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> which i then solve for x.
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> then `x = (a+sqrt(a*(a+41.91)))/2`
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> but the values doesnt seem right
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> ah wait
17:23 < bridge> <teero777> maybe its something with 32 unit block
17:23 < bridge> <teero777> wait
17:23 < bridge> <teero777> so actually 5.23875*32
17:25 < bridge> <teero777> ah man it works
17:25 < bridge> <teero777> sometimes i question myself
17:26 < bridge> <teero777> `x = (a+sqrt(a*(a+1341.12)))/2` thats it
17:28 < bridge> <teero777> if we half the games tickspeed would the gravity half too? based on what heinrich said i dont think so
17:28 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
18:15 < bridge> <teero777> btw its not supposed to be possible to crash the client from the serverside right?
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it would be good if it wasn't possible
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to fix such a crash, it's appreciated
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> currently, there are many ways to crash the client from the server
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> inserting 
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
18:17 < bridge> <teero777>     static int i = 0;
18:17 < bridge> <teero777>     if(++i % 2 == 0)
18:17 < bridge> <teero777>         return;
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> ```
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> into CGameWorld::Tick()
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> crashes the client on join xd
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds bad ^^ you can create an issue if you want
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> inserting 
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
18:18 < bridge> <teero777>     static int x = 0;
18:18 < bridge> <teero777>     if(++x % 2 == 0)
18:18 < bridge> <teero777>         return;
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> ```
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> into CGameWorld::Tick()
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> crashes the client on join xd
18:20 < bridge> <teero777> tbh would be funny to crash botters automatically if they are detected. theyll blame it on the client and receive constant random crashes. that would confuse the bot devs and the botclient would gain a bad reputation xd
18:20 < bridge> <teero777> jk
18:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it would be great to break their entire pc so they would never be able to join the game again
18:23 < bridge> <teero777> wtf
18:23 < bridge> <teero777> i just bricked my game with a bind i think
18:24 < bridge> <teero777> cant join kog anymore xd
18:24 < bridge> <teero777> crash on login
18:24 < bridge> <teero777> and no local server

18:36 < bridge> <learath2> I considered this for a while but I didn't think I could convince the others
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Change the range operators a..b, a.., and a..=b to resolve to new types ops::range::Range, ops::range::RangeFrom, and ops::range::RangeInclusive in Edition 2024. These new types will not implement Iterator, instead implementing Copy and IntoIterator.
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 this will be in ed 2024
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> finally ranges will be nice
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3550
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/43/views/5
18:43 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, why is this nice?
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> the Range type right now is not copy
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a big pain point
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> When would one need Range types to be copy?>
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> a range is 2 integers
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its not copy u need to call .clone()  when u pass it around
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a burden
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustc itself has its own Span type
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is like Range
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> and its copy
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2848
18:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cause it has nice syntactic sugar so you want to embed it into data structures which in turn can't implement copy then
18:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this sounds bad though, we'll have distinct types that are called `std::ops::Range` and `std::ops::range::Range`
18:52 < bridge> <learath2> Could you perhap show a smol example on what this would enable?
18:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/0ab9edfdf882830db8599878763f7cd38fb6c9ff/map/src/reader.rs#L55-L64
18:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basically it gives me a way to say that something represents a range, without adding two members called start and end, or start and length
18:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is conspicuously missing the unsafe `std::env::set_var` function 😦

19:33 < bridge> <arrowastaken> maybe it could improve by using nvidia reflex ¿is it too hard to implement?
19:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> nvidia reflex wouldnt fix screen tearing, it would improve device input
19:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> nvidia reflex wouldnt fix screen tearing, it would decrease input lag
19:36 < bridge> <arrowastaken> yeah, the input lag increased because of the vsync which fix the tearing xd
19:36 < bridge> <arrowastaken> am i wrong?}
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> well its not input lag, its input delay / latency
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> which is expected to happen when using vsync
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> roby might have an idea on how to fix your issues
19:56 < bridge> <reitw> @ryozuki u said u have a google pixel 8 pro right?
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
20:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't happen for me, do you have the crash log?
20:21 < bridge> <arrowastaken> @robyt3 👀
20:23 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAIK if you want the least input delay, disable VSync and select unlimited refresh rate everywhere
20:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> already recommended that to him, it didnt work :c
20:26 < bridge> <robyt3> using (exclusive) fullscreen should be the best, but I guess you could try with all of them if you haven't already
20:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> in older computers, its the same feeling

21:23 < bridge> <teero777> looks like it crashes since it cant find a specific map
21:24 < bridge> <teero777> also happens on older versions
21:26 < bridge> <robyt3> The message seems unrelated, can you compile in debug mode and run with gdb to get a stack trace?
21:26 < bridge> <teero777> sure

21:34 < bridge> <teero777> bt full after crashing
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> seems like a opengl issue
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> im stupid
21:35 < bridge> <learath2> still needs fixing no?
21:35 < bridge> <teero777> i had opengl 3.0.0 selected
21:36 < bridge> <teero777> idk if it needs fixing. never happened before. maybe cuz of drivers
22:18 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> you know, there is that mechanic in kog that you can despawn, but in ddnet servers its not allowed. Why? It would open new mechanics to build around maps
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> it also exists in ddnet. it is not allowed on every map as it would break a lot of them ^^
22:21 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> you mean people could skip parts or?
22:21 < bridge> <syrinok> Yes
22:30 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> i cant remember any situation ngl
23:24 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> can i turn off the info window when joining a server or? I literally never need any information from it
23:37 < bridge> <furo321> `cl_motd_time 0`
23:38 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> thx
