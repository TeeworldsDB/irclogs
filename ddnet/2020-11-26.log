02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> How do I get them to not be able to get CPickup? Thereâ€™s a ninja entity and I donâ€™t want to be caught when they pass it
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the CPickup code decides who gets it
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check `CPickup::Tick`
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> seems like this still wasn't fixed: when selecting all 4 corners of a quad and using the U/V feature, I expect the whole texture to move without affecting the aspect ratio but it just bugs out and stretches to infinity or something
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```cpp
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> void ReloadBans()
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> {
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc>     m_NetBan.UnbanAll();
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc>     m_pConsole->ExecuteFile("master.cfg", -1, true);
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> }
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ```
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> May I ask a few questions about this peace of Code? (`src/mastersrv/mastersrv.cpp:315`)
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> rip bridge
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Which bans are reloaded?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> This function gets called about every 5 minutes by default and removes every Ban?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Are this Server-Bans from the Master-Server?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I did a bit of research and found this list: https://www.teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> What does it mean? Are this the commands banning the servers again?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> And what is the `master.cfg` File? I could not find it on my local storage anywhere :c
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I thought:
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> The file `master.cfg` is somehow linked with the `master-bans.cfg` (the link i provided).
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Every 5 Minutes this file is called after all servers are unbanned? But why are they immediately banned again? And yeah, if it is a lifetime ban, why is the `UnbanAll` function being called?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @stnwtr UnbanAll is called so only the IPs in the file are banned
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the file changes at times to ban/unban servers
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> i couldn't find more usages od the file in the source -> means i have to add the ips manually into the file?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> i couldn't find more usages od the file in the source -> means i have to add the ips manually to the file?
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, if you want to run a masterserver
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you usually don't need to do this and it's probably no use either
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @deen all-locations file in ddnet-scripts have only the first server of each location, so e.g. bra2 or rus2 won't work in git-update script. Doesn't it represent an issue?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF for historical reasons that repository is not the actual source of what we use on servers
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just update it periodically
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FanTal1ty> Hey, is it possible to add front/game tiles for deepfly? It would be very nice, if u can map tiles on/off for deepfly, so that u dont allow deepfly in cmds in general for the hole map, but only for some parts ðŸ™‚
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's such a niche feature that it's enough map-wide I think
