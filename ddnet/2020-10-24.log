00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zukita> Ye. Crashes twice on a good day.
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, points are now in info2
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, forgot about the clang-format. how does that work?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> r u on windows?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> linux
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then just install clang-format and run ./scripts/fix_style.py
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> thanks, it worked

03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> don't you want to report that in the teeworlds discord?
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or is that ddnet renamed to teeworlds.exe?

13:34 < Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number
13:34 < Ryozuki> did u know math can be illegal
13:36 < Ryozuki> > ny image file or an executable program[6] can be regarded as simply a very large binary number. In certain jurisdictions, there are images that are illegal to possess,[7] due to obscenity or secrecy/classified status, so the corresponding numbers could be illegal.
13:36 < Ryozuki> lmao
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Minboggling that they still in 2020 believe they can take down anything from the internet
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing of any significance is ever lost on the internet
13:40 < ChillerDragon> i lost a twmap once
13:40 < ChillerDragon> woot i can write?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently it wasn’t of significance
13:41 < ChillerDragon> can someone hear me? xd
13:41 < ChillerDragon> oh yes u can
13:41 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon yes i can bro
13:41 < ChillerDragon> nice
13:41 < ChillerDragon> free ryo is back
13:41 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon irc tells u if your message is sent
13:41 < Ryozuki> learn ur own tools
13:41 < ChillerDragon> i dont have a + tho
13:41 < Ryozuki> if its not sent*
13:41 < ChillerDragon> now im pleb like laxa nub
13:42 < Ryozuki> + which in your case means voice only matters when the channel is in +m aka moderated mode
13:42 < ChillerDragon> nobody knows what the + means
13:42 < ChillerDragon> ah
13:42 < ChillerDragon> ok
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> + is voic
13:42 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon you should pay me, i teach u to many stuff
13:42 < ChillerDragon> rude @Learath2 i was almost crying when i lost it
13:42 < ChillerDragon> too* much*
13:42 < Ryozuki> i got myself a copy of youtube-dl source
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The youtube-dl thing made me spend my coffee break pissed...
13:44 < Ryozuki> https://ryozuki.xyz/downloads/youtube_dl-2020.9.20.tar.gz
13:44 < ChillerDragon> wait wat
13:44 < Ryozuki> :P
13:44 < ChillerDragon> does one have a tldr?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The US having so much power over the world and having the 🤡est of all legal systems is so annoying
13:44 < ChillerDragon> oof such a important tool
13:44 < ChillerDragon> will it continue on gitlab?
13:44 < Ryozuki> probs not on gitlab
13:44 < ChillerDragon> why
13:44 < Ryozuki> but its a wide used tool
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitlab probably is also owned by a US company
13:45 < Ryozuki> it wont cease to exist
13:45 < ChillerDragon> isnt gitlab netherlands
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They could just selfhost it
13:45 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u can get the source from pypi for now
13:45 < ChillerDragon> oof time to leave github i guess
13:45 < Ryozuki> https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/#files
13:45 < ChillerDragon> its getting darker and darker
13:45 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon microsoft owns it
13:45 < ChillerDragon> y
13:45 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon btw i think ucant see code unless ur logged in
13:45 < ChillerDragon> wot
13:45 < ChillerDragon> on github?
13:46 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon this is a good tool to self host repos and have a web https://gitea.io
13:46 < ChillerDragon> doubt
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitlab headquarters san francisco usa
13:46 < ChillerDragon> ye gogs and gitea nice
13:46 < ChillerDragon> oof
13:46 < Ryozuki> gitea is a fork of gogs
13:46 < Ryozuki> i think giteai s better
13:46 < ChillerDragon> idk
13:46 < Ryozuki> i should swap to it
13:46 < ChillerDragon> didnt look into deep
13:46 < Ryozuki> i did
13:46 < Ryozuki> and im telling u
13:46 < Ryozuki> so
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t like containerized blackboxware
13:46 < ChillerDragon> but u would also say ddnet > teeworlds
13:46 < Ryozuki> gitlab is too big
13:47 < Ryozuki> to many resources to self host
13:47 < ChillerDragon> so maybe ill disagree w ur opinion
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish there was a nice modular git hosting solution
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well you can host your own gitlab instance i guess
13:47 < ChillerDragon> isnt gogs and gitea that
13:47 < ChillerDragon> gitlab is not nice
13:47 < ChillerDragon> gitlab is ugly af
13:47 < Ryozuki> gitlab is too resourceful intensive
13:47 < Ryozuki> and its ugly ye
13:47 < Ryozuki> rly poor UI
13:47 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitea and gogs is containerized blackboxware
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> heh, i like it :)
13:47 < Ryozuki> Learath2 nah
13:47 < ChillerDragon> blackbox
13:47 < ChillerDragon> how?
13:47 < Ryozuki> i dont use it in a container
13:48 < Ryozuki> how is it a blackbox
13:48 < Ryozuki> u can see he source
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can chop it up into pieces and pretend it’s not a singleton but it doesn’t have clear interfaces on any of it’s connection points
13:48 < Ryozuki> Learath2 whats your choice then
13:49 < Ryozuki> im interested
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It wants to work in a certain environment, atleast it was last I tried to set it up
13:49 < Ryozuki> git --bare init
13:49 < Ryozuki> best
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t think there is any good solution out there 😭
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> hi
13:49 < Ryozuki> ill make it
13:49 < Ryozuki> in rust
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitlab is bloatware
13:49 < Ryozuki> just tell me how to design it
13:49 < Ryozuki> kek
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitweb looks like my ass
13:49 < ChillerDragon> i dont see the issue with gogs?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> hello?
13:49 < ChillerDragon> language pls
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hello
13:49 < ChillerDragon> ur we might have to mute u
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> hi
13:49 < Ryozuki> hello from the other side
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> mute me?
13:50 < ChillerDragon> no Learath
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon I’m not 8, you aren’t my mum
13:50 < ChillerDragon> he uses strong language
13:50 < Ryozuki> ye its rude
13:50 < ChillerDragon> don't be sassy now
13:50 < ChillerDragon> its the rules
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> . . .
13:50 < Ryozuki> tho i agree gitlab is bloat
13:50 < ChillerDragon> what does sassy even mean?
13:50 < Ryozuki> its so slow too
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> ok?
13:50 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 could u ellaborate on the gogs issue i dont get ut
13:51 < ChillerDragon> how to hit keys on board?
13:51 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon he says its not modular
13:51 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i think
13:51 < ChillerDragon> what does that mean
13:51 < ChillerDragon> modular agile
13:51 < ChillerDragon> blockchain
13:51 < ChillerDragon> ai
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jazondm> ok i go back to non dev
13:51 < ChillerDragon> what do u want
13:51 < ChillerDragon> xd rq
13:51 < Ryozuki> agile means u do things at the moment
13:51 < Ryozuki> without thinking
13:51 < Ryozuki> kek
13:51 < ChillerDragon> crumbans
13:51 < Ryozuki> blockchain is the biggest buzzword ever invented
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gogs looks pretty, but it's a bundle that didnt have any flexibility, atleast last I checked
13:52 < Ryozuki> use it if u want to sound retarded
13:52 < Ryozuki> look, i used blockchain to solve my depression
13:52 < ChillerDragon> what kinds flex u search m8?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The frontend is tiiightly coupled to the backend which is tightly coupled to the webserver
13:52 < ChillerDragon> if it werks it werks
13:52 < Ryozuki> Learath2 u should check gitea instead of gogs
13:52 < Ryozuki> it is a fork of gogs with more development
13:52 < ChillerDragon> oh so no swappable frontend?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will take a look later tonight, maybe it is better
13:53 < ChillerDragon> but selfhost sok
13:53 < Ryozuki> so u want a software that is a git server without web and then another web frontend for that software?
13:53 < ChillerDragon> i use github incase my datacenter explosed i can git clone my data back in
13:53 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon sadly if u dont use github ur project wont ever be popular
13:53 < Ryozuki> if u want contributors
13:54 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:54 < ChillerDragon> not that i get contributors anyways
13:54 < ChillerDragon> but i still feel it
13:54 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i saw ur making a new game
13:54 < ChillerDragon> fan
13:54 < ChillerDragon> yeet farm?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would love something similar yeah. A backend that exposes data about my repositories in a nice clean API. A separate git server that handles the git connections. A separate frontend
13:54 < Ryozuki> ye
13:54 < Ryozuki> yeet
13:54 < ChillerDragon> i even got fan comments there lmao
13:54 < ChillerDragon> thats nice on github
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. I would love to just use the git server part sometimes
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't always need a frontend
13:55 < ChillerDragon> i wasnt able tho to make a fetch() from frontend to nodejs backend api
13:55 < ChillerDragon> it fucked me with CORS and shit
13:55 < Ryozuki> ah cors
13:55 < Ryozuki> just use *
13:55 < ChillerDragon> classic
13:55 < Ryozuki> and enable everything
13:55 < Ryozuki> who cares about security
13:55 < ChillerDragon> sounds dangerous
13:55 < ChillerDragon> oof
13:55 < Ryozuki> make sure ot enable all post put and stuff
13:55 < ChillerDragon> its yeet farm
13:55 < Ryozuki> all methods
13:56 < ChillerDragon> is that how u do it?
13:56 < ChillerDragon> i thought there must be a better way
13:56 < ChillerDragon> i dont want ppl yeeting away some farms with javascript hax
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc there is a way, you set up CORS correctly 😄
13:57 < ChillerDragon> go send halp
13:57 < ChillerDragon> and u get 100 yee coins
13:58 < ChillerDragon> on official servers
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well either keep it on the same origin or add your frontend host to the cors header of your backend
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very simple
13:59 < ChillerDragon> i was on same host
13:59 < ChillerDragon> fetch from localhost website to localhost backend
14:00 < ChillerDragon> and dfq is a cors header
14:00 < ChillerDragon> sounds way too complicated
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Same origin requests are always allowed
14:00 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i list localhost then 192.x so i can access it from my mobile to test mobile stuff, then i add the domain
14:00 < Ryozuki> u know allowed hosts can be a array
14:00 < Ryozuki> make sure to add www. and stuff if u use that too
14:01 < Ryozuki> tho i thing having frontend and backend separated makes another requests
14:01 < Ryozuki> for non-idempotent requests
14:02 < Ryozuki> it requests OPTIONS
14:02 < Ryozuki> to know if it can do it before
14:02 < Ryozuki> so make sure u cache
14:02 < Ryozuki> options
14:02 < Ryozuki> to use less resources
14:02 < Ryozuki> xd
14:02 < Ryozuki> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The browser should handle that for you if you set up your cache headers properly
14:03 < Ryozuki> yeah the browser does options automatically
14:03 < ChillerDragon> where do i even set headers
14:03 < Ryozuki> depends what u using
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway this extended coffee break is over
14:03 < Ryozuki> it should be easy anyway
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon same way you set any other http header...
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bbl
14:04 < ChillerDragon> i use nodejs on backend and vanilla js frontend
14:04 < ChillerDragon> i somehow want to fetch() from frontend
14:05 < Ryozuki> then do it
14:05 < ChillerDragon> ok
14:05 < ChillerDragon> soon
14:05 < Ryozuki> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
14:05 < Ryozuki> can u read
14:05 < Ryozuki> ?
14:05 < Ryozuki> xd
14:05 < ChillerDragon> actually i cant
14:05 < Ryozuki> :troll:
14:06 < ChillerDragon> ill ask u when i keep working on it again
14:06 < ChillerDragon> to read it for me
14:06 < ChillerDragon> F ytdl
14:06 < ChillerDragon> ima go tw now
14:06 < ChillerDragon> fun talk
14:06 < ChillerDragon> nice to be unmuted again
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> What is the state of debugging?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 got a asan debug build?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my curiosity about that bug is exploding
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only managed to get a release asan build and the line numbers seem a little off but it seems(tm) to work
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> debug build failed? can you still share it with louis xd
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> there is no [number] in F1 in chat in collapsed messages
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> repeated lines probably
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Yes, I understood that
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> And that's all that I got xD
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Lady Saavik steps to reproduce pls?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> ummmmmm
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> send 2x the same msg and open F1?
16:13 < Ryozuki> editing console lines is harder
16:13 < Ryozuki> than chat lines
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> oh, you mean console messages
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> fuck it then 🙂
16:13 < Ryozuki> thats rude
16:15 < Ryozuki> @Lady Saavik i could make it print the line again
16:15 < Ryozuki> like previous behaviour
16:15 < Ryozuki> in the console
16:15 < Ryozuki> but adding a number to an existing line in console is another thing
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it should be relatively similar, no?
17:34 < Ryozuki> Learath2 idk i havent look at it much but console print uses callbacks and stuff
17:35 < Ryozuki> if u can do it go ahead
17:35 < Ryozuki> probs not to hard, im just lazy
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> seems like bot is not in sync with the DB

19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> It's just happening too fast
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Hi, can I ask a stupid question.. The Network, Packets, CPU and Memory stats. How are the .PNGs generated? I am looking on Github, but can't seem to find it. I am finding the player stats. Can someone guide me to a location as I want to take stats from logstash server I have and try generate graphs in a simple way without spending alot of time. Reminds me alot of Ganglia monitoring tool, unless that's what it is?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Probably easier to use matplotlib in python to get the graph I want.
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's in ddnet-scripts, but @deen would know that
22:36 < ChillerDragon> yay after so many years finally got my first responsive ncurses tw client https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603571667.png
22:37 < ChillerDragon> resizing window works and input is nonblocking
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @SPYRES it's rrd with some simple scripts: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/tree/master/rrd (data comes from ddnet.tw/status which uses BotoX' serverstatus)
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ganglia uses rrd too
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nowadays the cool kids use grafana for stuff like that
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Many thanks Deen. Will look into it. 👍
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Appreciate the help.
