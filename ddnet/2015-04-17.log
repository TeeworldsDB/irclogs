11:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 cea6fef def: Hack to disallow admins to enable /r after server was started
11:24 <@deen> they have their own client
11:25 <@deen> but I guess he doesn't want to maintain it anymore
11:25 <@deen> and I had requests before, but didn't want it because the chinese font was 40 MB or sth
11:26 <@deen> Still 10 MB here, hm
12:05 < heinrich5991> deen: you could do it like blizzard games, download these fonts while already playing
12:05 < heinrich5991> so you don't have to download these upfront and can already play
12:06 <@deen> heinrich5991: what do you mean by "download"?
12:06 < heinrich5991> uhm, like make an HTTP download
12:06 <@deen> from update server?
12:07 <@deen> That seems a bit hacky, I don't really like it
12:07 < heinrich5991> from there or from a different source
12:07 < heinrich5991> ok
12:07 <@deen> I reduced the file size of the font anyway
12:07 < heinrich5991> blizzard does it so you only have to download ~1/10 of the game and can immediately start playing
12:07 <@deen> the main problem for me is the increases startup time of the client now
12:07 <@deen> yeah, but ddnet shouldn't be GBs of data^^
12:10 <@deen> startup time goes from 1 to 4 seconds for me, way too much
12:23 < heinrich5991> deen: do you have threaded sound loading activated?
12:23 <@deen> yes
12:24 <@deen> the font glyphs are already loaded in some kind of on-demand fashion
12:24 <@deen> but i think every glyph up to the highest occured is loaded?
12:25 < heinrich5991> not afaik
12:26 < heinrich5991> I think only the glyphs that are actually used are rendered and uploaded to the graphics card
12:26 <@deen> any idea how to fix this?
12:26 <@deen> could also speed up font rendering in general
12:26 <@deen> the client becomes unusable with chinese fonts activated
12:27 <@deen> when someone with a weird name joins, the game stops responding for a second
12:27 < heinrich5991> okay..?
12:27 < heinrich5991> mh
12:27 <@deen> but i always had that, only for a few ms
12:27 < heinrich5991> that shouldn't happen
12:27 <@deen> and it annoyed me
12:28 < heinrich5991> mh
12:28 < heinrich5991> text rendering is one of the unoptimized parts
12:28 < heinrich5991> if I open the console e.g. I get an instant drop in FPS
12:29 <@deen> yeah
12:29 <@deen> same when you use entities with many teleporters
12:36 <@deen> I have no idea how to render text more efficiently
12:44 < heinrich5991> one thing to do would probably be to cache whole strings instead of just single characters
13:05 <@deen> this is complicated, we should all just use english instead
13:08 <@deen> This may be interesting: https://github.com/rougier/freetype-gl
13:09 <@deen> everyone seems to use hacks with CJK
13:09 <@deen> or doesn't work at all, it's really weird
18:36 < Nimda> Injection 2 by Themix just released on Brutal at 2015-04-17 18:31

19:17 <@EastByte> no problem for easty east
19:36 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

19:36 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
19:36 <@deen> too many dummy maps recently :P
19:36 <@deen> EastByte: nice
19:37 <@EastByte> haha
19:37 <@EastByte> yae, dummy maps are quite good for player statistics
19:39 <@deen> i don't even like dummy maps =/
19:41 <@EastByte> the only kind of solo map I like
19:46 <@deen> they're better than regular solo maps, definitely
19:46 <@deen> but helping noobs is all the fun in ddrace
19:58 <@EastByte> well, kinda yes

21:14 <@deen> https://github.com/savander/zcatch
21:15 < Muttley> ty is it standard compiled with sql for ranking ?
21:15 <@deen> i don't remember^^
21:16 < Muttley> xD
21:16 <@deen> maybe it's server_sql_release
21:18 < Muttley> ok will check
21:18 < Muttley> ty

21:19 <@deen> nope
21:28 < Muttley> ah great it is working, could you provide me with the votes that ur using ?
21:33 <@deen> are you making more DDNet clones? :P
21:34 <@deen> they'
21:34 <@deen> re from Savander, I guess you should ask him what he thinks

21:42 < Muttley> I will ask savander
21:54 < Muttley> ty deen
