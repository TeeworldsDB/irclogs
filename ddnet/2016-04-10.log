01:20 <@EastByte> ohwat

17:19 < Henningstone_> I play what I feel like in the moment
17:49 <@deen> eeeee: I'm running DDNet Chile more or less, but our hoster is weird and has an extremely slow connection to the rest of the world excluding Chile. I guess that's why they're not happy with even a few KB/s flowing there
17:53 <@deen> eeeee: I asked them about it
