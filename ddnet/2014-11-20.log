00:48 < laxa> heinrich5991: thanks :D
00:48 <@heinrich5991> (mole in english)
00:48 < laxa> or taupe aswell apparently
00:48 <@heinrich5991> not in german
00:48 < laxa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taupe
00:48 <@heinrich5991> wat
00:48 <@heinrich5991> oh, it's supposed to be a color
00:49 <@heinrich5991> haven't heard about it then
00:49 < laxa> I should have read more carefully :D
05:36 < eeeee> my personal preference would be just banning all unicode. in addition to faking it's just too annoying when you wanna address someone in chat but can't type their nick because of all the weird characters
08:27 < laxa> I agree with eeeee, but I know it won't change anyway
08:45 <@heinrich5991> laxa: what about allowing a special subset of unicode, i.e. only these in the identifier space
08:50 < laxa> no idea
08:55 < laxa> changing it now would be bad
08:55 < laxa> maybe it breaks compatibility with other clients
08:55 < laxa> and what about score of player with unicode character ?

15:59 <@deen> laxadedi: hi
16:25 < laxadedi> deen: I think I got all my answers from ama, apparently map uploaded from ddnet.tw are automatically added to the vote list of test server right ?
16:25 <@deen> yes, but only after map change the vote list gets refreshed
17:08 <@EastByte> deen: there was ddos on both eur ips today

17:11 <@deen> did it cause any problems, EastByte ?
17:12 <@EastByte> I can't tell
17:12 <@EastByte> just got the mail

19:31 <@EastByte> hello xRoThx 
19:33 < xRoThx> RUS down 20min? 
19:33 < xRoThx> Hello
19:33 < xRoThx> I see pretty much downtimes? 
19:33 <@EastByte> we also have been attacked today
19:34 < xRoThx> GER? 
19:34 < xRoThx> Didn't got anything :)
19:35 <@EastByte> I got attacks on both ips
19:35 <@EastByte> can't tell whether the gameservers were affectd though since I wasn't online
19:38 < xRoThx> I did not got any email about any attack
19:38 < xRoThx> Maybe the attacks were not the first of that kind and are already filtered :)

21:13 <@deen> and now my home connection gets ddosed
21:13 <@deen> ^^
21:13 <@deen> (not for the first time today)
21:14 <@EastByte> how did they get your ip?
21:14 <@deen> skype i guess
21:14 <@deen> ah no
21:14 <@deen> my ip is pretty easy to get^^
21:14 <@deen> shit
21:16 <@deen> i don't know how to get ip address in skype currently, they change that stuff from time to time
21:18 <@EastByte> iirc the skype resolvers you can find online will keep providern their service
21:18 <@EastByte> *providing
21:35 <@deen> the fritzbox really doesn't like ddos attacks though
21:35 <@deen> webinterface was so sluggish
21:41 <@EastByte> it always is :D
21:41 <@deen> from 1 second to 1 minute reaction time I mean^^
21:49 <@deen> I've had another idea to get more performance for servers! Compile with -march=native -mtune=native!
21:49 <@EastByte> what's that :D
21:49 <@deen> it optimizes the binary for the specific processor in that machine
21:49 <@deen> won't run anywhere else though, but doesn't matter since i compile on each server
21:49 <@deen> now i just need profile guided optimization additionally and it's perfect :P
21:50 <@deen> i doubt i will be able to measure the improvements though
21:50 <@deen> 200 players on GER are 6% CPU  already
21:57 < eeeee> "specifying -march=cpu-type implies -mtune=cpu-type."
21:57 <@deen> nice
21:57 <@deen> i usually use different values for both, so i didn'T know
21:58 < eeeee> when you use gentoo you have to know these things :P
21:58 <@deen> i do use gentoo
21:58 <@deen> but there was no native when i set it up^^
21:58 < eeeee> yeah so i'm surprised you didnt
21:58 <@deen> and I've switched archs a few times, so don't want to use native
22:00 < eeeee> yeah my march was like k8 -> nocona -> core2 -> native
22:02 <@deen> gentoo documentation has become really nice^^
22:02 <@deen> I remember pages of CFLAGS for each processor line

22:26 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 5f035cf def: Fix infrequent segfault when server shuts down immediately
22:29 <@deen> someone is really trying around with the ddos attacks today
22:35 <@deen> hm, on RUS they report the wrong cpu^^
22:35 <@deen> I get "Illegal instruction" when running the server now
22:35 <@EastByte> wut?
22:35 <@deen> because i compile with -march=native
22:35 <@deen> they say it's a Xeon E5-2630
22:35 <@deen> but apparently it's not
22:36 <@EastByte> ah
22:40 <@deen> they have really cheap VPSs though
22:42 <@deen> XEN, 1 core, $ 2.91 / month
22:42 <@EastByte> what provider is it?
22:43 <@deen> http://reg.com
22:43 <@deen> no paypal though
22:43 <@deen> and unlimited traffic
22:44 <@EastByte> their Xen plans looks better than the OpenVZ ones
22:44 <@deen> yeah
22:45 <@deen> ah, there are also OpenVZ without SSD
22:45 <@deen> they are cheaper
22:45 <@EastByte> yep
22:47 <@deen> they were also pretty fast from what i can remember
22:48 <@deen> fast network
22:53 <@deen> but the server sometimes makes trouble
22:53 <@deen> processes hang for a few seconds and get killed
22:53 <@deen> and right now tcp connections don't work^^
