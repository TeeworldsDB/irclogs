19:01 < EastBite> what could be the reason for keyboard skipping keys?
19:03 < dbd> skipping as missing key, or missing the keyup ?
19:03 < dbd> because I have the missing keyup problem sometimes :(
19:03 < dbd> so my tee goes in one or other direction
19:04 < EastBite> not sure, I'm pressing 'e' or '0' ~5 times and the letter appears only 4 times
19:04 < EastBite> happens quite often recently

21:35 < NooBxGockeL> EastBite, maybe a bit late but i have some ideas: hitting too soft on bad keyboard, keyboard controller not fast enough, ghosting (aka too many keys at once), software/driver based (e.g. polling rate maybe?)... Had the same issue on my old rubber dome keyboard, now i have a mechanical CM Storm rapid and everything is fine ^^
