09:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> making it not being sent repeatedly would influence the gameplay
09:27 <@deen> eeeee: about fng2: some guy came on discord #general and told us that people don't play on ddnet fng server anymore because we are missing the new features from fng2. So that's why I switched to it. Personally I don't know anything about fng
09:28 <@deen> about lua: some bot client mod of ddnet has lua, haven't checked how far they developed it
09:30 <@deen> about betting for/against wayland: http://longbets.org/
09:32 <@deen> about systemd: works much better for me than the previous stuff. and finally I have the same init system on all linux distros, so just need to learn one. It has some problems, but I don't understand how people get so angry about a peace of software.

14:42 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/871#issuecomment-330839294
14:54 <@heinrich5991> deen: it's not a race map, is it?
14:56 <@heinrich5991> we could probably keep random teleporters in case an `sv_random_teleports` is enabled, which depends on `sv_test_cmds`?
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Don't spawn all players to the same tele that can be very annoying
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> There are reasons why maps have multiple TO teles and not only one
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> imo 3 is best
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @jao there's a tradeoff ðŸ˜ƒ in the best case, we can do client prediction after this change, which means less laggy teleporters
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> For me 2
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> depends if you how you looking on subject, if you want fair races
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or just random
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> How does unlaggy teleporters help me when my game experience is ruined
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's the wrong way to approach the issue ðŸ˜ƒ think about solutions that enable both!
15:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (also, I dislike how : ) is replaced by an emoticon that looks like : D)
15:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I don't even know what laggy teleporters means ðŸ˜„
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> try playing with cl_predict 0
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then you see that collision with walls etc. is predicted within the client, that means that the client knows what the server will do without getting data back
15:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 3, 3, 3 ! ðŸ˜„
15:07 <@EastByte> teleporters will just feel more instantaneous
15:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or maybe you remember how hookthrough feels when ddnet didn't predict it â€“ the hook was aborted early and you only got the actual hook a bit later
15:08 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Ah
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> If you'd implement the sv_random command people would probably always activate it if it's not a solo or team map ðŸ˜„
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> hah, thought of that. I said I'd only enable it if `sv_test_cmds` is on, which means you can't do records while this is enabled
15:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like onf FUN server
15:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> imo, randomnes on race issss
15:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> baaad idea
15:13 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> But I'm sure other maps have random teleporters implemented as gameplay
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'd consider it a good idea to discourage that
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Either as a punishment or actual part
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> punishment?
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like what
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you jump into tp, and your punishment is to die
15:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because randomens wanted it?
15:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xd
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if some maps depends on randomness, then it should be moved to Fun. There is not place for randomness, if there is ranking system
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because its not fair
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or should be fixed
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> What
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Sure it's fair
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> For everyone same randomness applies
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its not same
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but you can get lucky or not
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its like, jump nto tp
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and it's teleport you to random place
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's fair?
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> which means getting a good rank will become an act of grinding randomness
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Part of the game
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you have to play one ma thousand times
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and grinding isn't fun
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to get perfect run
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's stupid
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> one map
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> *
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's part of bad behaviour
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> which has to be fixed
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why you want to stay with bug lol ðŸ˜„
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, you will call it "feature"
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Do you want to reinvent everything lol
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I think teerace also removed random teleports
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Those are old maps mostly
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> reinvent?
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we don't want to talk about talking about randomness
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but about randomness
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you're going a level higher right now ^^
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sorry !:<
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I mean an interesting question is whether we can agree on the proposition:
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> "randomness in competitive races is bad"
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes !
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and maybe
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> "missing load balancing in race parts is bad"
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Yes ofc, but when it already exist you can't go ahead and just remove it while people had to deal with it for years
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ok, so "changing the rules of races is bad"
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, at the point the "old rules" can be adjusted
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> anything else we need to cover?
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> "client prediction is a good thing"
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for example, if it won't be possible to beat some time beacuse of predicting teleports
15:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we can fix maps
15:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> If some map can't be finished because randomness was a big part of a map, then i don't know. it's hard topic
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Because in my opinion, such map shouldn;t be called "competitive map"
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Not all maps are competitive tho
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then they should has 0 points
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah, this might be a hypothesis we can disagree on
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i guess ?
15:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ddnet ranks are for competitiveness vs not all ddnet ranks should be viewed as competitive
15:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and without times, or something
15:24 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Points are for finish not for good times
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Btw, have in  your mind any map which are not called "compatitive" ?
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Btw, have in  your mind any maps which are not called "compatitive" ?
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Adrenaline 4
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why ?
15:30 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Because you can't really focus on being fast if you want to finish
15:30 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Hard long faily map
15:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, we don't understand each other
15:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> hm. I still think that people want to have a better time than others in there
15:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> people who are more advanced can probably go faster, even if they might not perceive it as fast themselves
15:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> compatitive means for me, maps which works the same for every team/player
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> only depends on your skill
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> without magic force
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Yes I mean something else ðŸ˜’
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> competitive means for me, maps which works the same for every team/player
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> magic force == randomness for example :PPP
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'm leaving you guys for now, don't kill each other ðŸ˜ƒ
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And that's why I think, that 3 options is best. In teams
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> bye
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you have your own gamestate (as heinrich said before). So every run would be the same
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Bye
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> bye ðŸ˜ƒ
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we should warn if a user is mapping and he only places 1 spawn
15:36 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Why would you need to place multiple spawns when starting mapping
15:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and why not
15:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> u can easy place 3 spawns together
15:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nonsense
15:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and still, its only a warn
15:37 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Most maps don't even need multiple spawns if u spawn in solo or it's a solo map
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> easy, detect if it has the solo option
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we can add the warn still
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we could even make it only complain if the only spawn is not in air
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> And why do you have a solo option before placing spawn? xD
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and why not?
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cltr + shift + e
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> new map
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> select
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDRace, Solo
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Xd
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Dafuq I think you aren't familiar with how mapping works ðŸ˜„
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nice joke
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> So you change your idea
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> while mapping?
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like, oh i will do solo
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> OH no, best part for DDrace
15:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nvm, i changed my mind, i will rebuild whole map
15:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
15:40 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> ?
15:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
15:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What's the consequence of adding warn about amount of teleports?/
15:41 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> This solo option goes with a command, and that you don't even have to set in your map, but is enforced by server. So why would you type in that command before placing the first spawn?
15:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and why not?
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for me i could be just switch option
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ddrace<->solo
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yea
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and make indicators
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Because you don't need it
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> enabled by default
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like, for spawn
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and warns for mapper
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like "oh i forgot to add more spawn"
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like "oh i forgot to add more spawns"
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and if u are a pro mapper like jao, disable it
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> All you do is making editor more complicated with no advantages
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> complicated !?!
15:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what's complicated in choosing map type
15:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you doing it anyway
15:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh, wait im warning you about a possible thing wich for sure will be said on testing section but this only complicated things!
15:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
15:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It has advantages, if map editor would suggest you
15:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what you could do
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> You want to throw useless warnings at a beginner because he only place one spawn and force him to select on a map type? He will run away men
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> based on ddnet rules
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it would work great.
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> useless for a begginner? must be a joke
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Beginners on ddnet ?
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in map editor
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you literally assume a begginner mapping which doesnt even know to setup a server will know about the 1 spawn block bug
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> always expect the end user to be... not so smart
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> No
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Yes
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if making it with caps make it fell more important (?)
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I the main rule, that's why youi have tons of "if" statements, and other constraints
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if making it with caps make it feel more important (?)
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to make sure, that the user do right things
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Useless as in the beginner doesn't have to care about 1 spawn while trying to learn plain mapping
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Sure.
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But look, if you create new map, there could be a switch option
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (this time i added a dot :)
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> with ddrace, race
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but "normal" option by default
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> which means, vanilla maps
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just like that.
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> More complicated, as I said ðŸ˜ƒ
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why?
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> cause he says it
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i think it would be a great idea @Savander
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> choosing betwen solo and ddrace map
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> much more easier and less complicated
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> when creating it
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> than writing commands
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> into map config
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you could even put some little tips there
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> You don't need any commands for server types on ddnet in your map
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tips are essential in most IDE's
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like, oh guy
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can press ctrl + p to switch to the file! Looks how cool is that
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can press ctrl + p to switch to the file! Look how cool is that
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and it's simply notifications, informations
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even if you write code, it can show you that
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you missed for example semicolon
15:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it could be the same for maps. You missed spawns ! hello !
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I agree this warning would be good when it gets thrown after finishing the map, but when starting or in mapping process - hell no, please not
17:56 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: eeh this bot really needs colors
17:56 <+Learath2> impossible to read in irc
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> can have an unobtrusive warning on the top right corner that can be dismissed for spawn count, and if we decide to go with one TO tile also for that
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> these are all stuff we can fix, we just need to decide whether removing randomness is k or not
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is not k!
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> weren't you for removing randomness before i left
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @jao what did you do to the guy?
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nevermind
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> he is for removing randomness ðŸ˜„
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I read it wrong
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ;-;
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> ðŸ˜¦

20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't think so

20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> use .test
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im using now
20:01 <+eeeee> makes sense, if i was google i'd also buy localhost and redirect it to google
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> .test is reserved
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> .example as well

20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 4 reserved domains
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> .invalid is probably not a good idea ^^
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it's reserved if I remember

20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.invalid

20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that is from my local computer
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I never changed anything wrt. IPv6
20:06 <+eeeee> wait until google grabs .localdomain, those two would look the same :P
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so the future is now ^^
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ...
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I heard few years ago something like
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "soon ipv6" !! prepare"
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then now is 2017, and still ipv4 is used on top
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ipv6 usage is growing ^^

20:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> a conference about
20:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> css grid
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> So the presenter used emoticons, as a grid
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> first world problems
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> bananas, heads etc

22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> guess its displaying  smth on irc
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> should be fixed
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> mfw discord can do emojis but craps out on unicode
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's not unicode, it's some weird IRC escape sequence
