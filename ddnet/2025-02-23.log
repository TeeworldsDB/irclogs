08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> what is mapbugs.cpp?
08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> or more acuatly what does it do?
08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> and whats it for?
08:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> is the entire momentcap static directory hosted anywhere like on github or as a zip?
08:34 < bridge> <zerolacqua> idk, but i remember there is a command called `/mapbug`
08:34 < bridge> <zerolacqua> > Enable map compatibility mode using the specified bug (example: grenade-doubleexplosion@ddnet.tw)
08:34 < bridge> <zerolacqua> idk, but i remember there is a command called `mapbug`
08:34 < bridge> <zerolacqua> > Enable map compatibility mode using the specified bug (example: grenade-doubleexplosion@ddnet.tw)
08:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah yea that exsplanes it
08:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> with the context it looks like it handles checking if a map has that enabled
08:36 < bridge> <zerolacqua> i think so
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> i'm currently looking at the map editor's code and trying to figure out what `FillSelection()` does.
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> anyone knows what are these variables for?
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> ```cpp
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> // layer_tiles.h
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> class CLayerTiles : public CLayer
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> {
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     // ...
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     int m_Tele;
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     int m_Speedup;
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     int m_Front;
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     int m_Switch;
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     int m_Tune;
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua>     // ...
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> }
09:13 < bridge> <zerolacqua> ```
09:32 < bridge> <Solly> Maybe they're bools or enums pretending to be ints
09:32 < bridge> <Solly> You can find references in the context menu in before if you have cpp plugin
09:32 < bridge> <Solly> @zerolacqua
09:33 < bridge> <Solly> Or otherwise just search for m_Tele
09:42 < bridge> <zerolacqua> i think you're right‚Äîall the assignments are either 0 or 1. but the `<=` in `pLayer->m_Tele <= pBrushLayer->m_Tele` is really misleading. I initially thought it was some kind of counter variable.
09:42 < bridge> <zerolacqua> thank u

09:48 < bridge> <Solly> mwuhuhuhu
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> actually if you remove the second inaccurate line
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> the first also inaccurate line makes less sense
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> i was told we wouldnt be removing the copyright symbol ever so idk
09:59 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1343145196942135316/image.png?ex=67bc34f1&is=67bae371&hm=a413a6c422fcf5aa6b78b2b0f529e8e171f05b9ce45bc8a6aeb8cd216128c4a3&
09:59 < bridge> <Solly> "this" being liscence.txt has been heavily modified in ddnet and doesnt include source files
10:54 < bridge> <zhn> whos teeworlds.net
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think teeworlds.com is meant here xd
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not even sure how legal it is to remove these :/
11:13 < bridge> <Solly> oh yeah teeworlds.net isnt even valid for teeworlds
11:14 < bridge> <Solly> its unlikely anything will come of it because i thought teeworlds guy disapeared and his name forever will be in liscence.txt
11:14 < bridge> <Solly> license.txt only restrictions modification of itself not source files
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> The teeworlds guy wouldn‚Äôt sue us anyway. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs legal at all to remove that
11:16 < bridge> <totar> the license doesn't say you can't remove it
11:17 < bridge> <totar> chatgpt is a good lawyer you can ask it
11:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> he didn't disappear
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> He does show up again every once in a while
11:17 < bridge> <Solly> he became slightly less opauqe
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> he became less opauqe
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> he became less opaque
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> i did, chatgpt says its okay
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> but ^
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1343165096934899814/image.png?ex=67bc4779&is=67baf5f9&hm=fc0ecf602878b975e931ea722530ccba7094976dbbfa26c88f74cb3d5029b7ea&
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> but
11:18 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1343165096934899814/image.png?ex=67bc4779&is=67baf5f9&hm=fc0ecf602878b975e931ea722530ccba7094976dbbfa26c88f74cb3d5029b7ea&
11:19 < bridge> <learath2> See even chatgpt is being cautious üòÑ
11:20 < bridge> <totar> I think the second part about the missing file is ok to remove but it's unclear about the first part
11:21 < bridge> <Solly> its a bit weird that its just tw guy
11:21 < bridge> <Solly> even though its maintained by other people now
11:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we are still a teeworlds mod believe it or not
11:21 < bridge> <totar> well it shouldn't be in files that are not from the teeworlds source
11:21 < bridge> <totar> new files do not need the notice
11:22 < bridge> <totar> I think it's technically considered part of the license
11:22 < bridge> <totar> but new code can be under any license
11:22 < bridge> <Solly> its not mentioned in the liscence
11:22 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1343166162179063828/image.png?ex=67bc4877&is=67baf6f7&hm=86a28c8a7e047b47835bee5a3da95a042309e2214cce42dfce4cfd811876dad7&
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chatgpt dumb again lmao
11:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i do think removing the second line is following the line 2 of that license tho
11:23 < bridge> <Solly> the second line is really silly
11:23 < bridge> <Solly> the first line is slightly silly
11:23 < bridge> <Solly> the second line is really silly (not even valid for tw)
11:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the second line is probably before git and they had tar releases for the source code from the trunk
11:24 < bridge> <Solly> "this notice" refers to itself only and probably the other 2 restrictions
11:25 < bridge> <Solly> the rest of the liscence has been modified in ddnet
11:25 < bridge> <totar> claude says it legally extends to the files themselves, the comment and license are part of the license
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> We should contact all contributors of teeworlds and ddnet ever so we can re-license
11:25 < bridge> <Solly> to what
11:25 < bridge> <Solly> i think as-is is fine
11:25 < bridge> <Solly> tw is big enough that someones not gonna run off and pretend its a new thing
11:25 < bridge> <totar> this isn't really about relicensing
11:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> our license is exactly zlib license iirc
11:26 < bridge> <totar> also that
11:26 < bridge> <totar> it is
11:26 < bridge> <Solly> is it?
11:26 < bridge> <totar> https://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html
11:26 < bridge> <Solly> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/license.txt
11:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it is zlib word for word, since zlib didn't named their license with a title so teeworlds didn't either
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> Something funky, one of those half proprietary licenses so we can charge server hosters
11:26 < bridge> <Solly> oh okay
11:26 < bridge> <Solly> didnt know that
11:27 < bridge> <Solly> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/license.txt>
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> Then I can finally move to the maldives
11:27 < bridge> <Solly> *lack of understanding*
11:27 < bridge> <Solly> half proprietary?
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> Like the one epic games has for unreal engine
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> It‚Äôs open source but if you use it you still have to pay
11:28 < bridge> <Solly> thats a bit sketchy
11:28 < bridge> <Solly> why do you need something like that for server hosters?
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> I‚Äôm messing around, why so serious?
11:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> honestly, if matricks shows up and says it's fine to remove it it'll be gold
11:29 < bridge> <Solly> oop i didnt know u were joking x-x
11:29 < bridge> <totar> he could allow it
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> The notices in the files are probably legally parts of the license, removing it is probably thus against the license in license.txt
11:29 < bridge> <totar> but they're only part of the teeworld license
11:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> add cheat = violation into the license while we are at it
11:30 < bridge> <totar> Magnus Auvinen can give you whatever license to the source code that he likes
11:30 < bridge> <Solly> i dont think they are, they are only in reference to it
11:30 < bridge> <totar> no they are
11:30 < bridge> <learath2> Does he even own a copyright to all the modifications done over the years so he can grant us a license?
11:31 < bridge> <Solly> no but the base is the part which is (should be) referenced by the header
11:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then does he own the right to protect his name being incorrectly used in a malicious software
11:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then does he own the right to protect his name from being incorrectly used in a malicious software
11:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not that we are malicious tho
11:31 < bridge> <Solly> ddnet rm -rfed my home dir""
11:31 < bridge> <Solly> "ddnet rm -rfed my home dir"
11:31 < bridge> <learath2> This is all very complicated. It‚Äôs probably why we never bothered to tidy it up over the last decade
11:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that i do agree
11:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> this whole convo is basically the reason why it was left as-is.
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> I think the only thing we settled was that new files with no teeworlds code don‚Äôt need the notice
11:33 < bridge> <Solly> when you give code to a github repo, unless otherwise specified its probably under the assumption that it is atleast under the same liscence (which is hwy people are angry when you change the liscence), not having the header is "otherwise" even if only by a bit
11:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but i still believe if matricks give us a ok then we can just remove them. because i don't believe any contributor owns that part of the comment.
11:34 < bridge> <Solly> anyone have his phone #
11:34 < bridge> <totar> look at it like this. The license header in all the files only applies to the code in that file which was written by the person who created the license, you can license parts of a file under different licences so if we carefully removed all the orignal teeworlds code lines then we could remove those headers or if the owner of the code that was in those files when the license was first there says its ok.
11:35 < bridge> <learath2> @mtrcks show up again please
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> nameplates.cpp was completley rewritten (i literally ctrl-a del'ed it twice) but that doesnt mean it isnt based of original teeworlds code
11:35 < bridge> <totar> you can remove it then
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> nameplates.cpp was completley rewritten (i literally ctrl-a del'ed it twice) but that doesnt mean it isnt based of original teeworlds code, its just a tiny bit and i think thats enough to make the argument
11:35 < bridge> <totar> we can also remove it from any file we created after forking teeworlds
11:36 < bridge> <Solly> why am i playing devils advocat i want to remove them x-x
11:36 < bridge> <Solly> thats akin to changing liscence if the header constitutes part of the liscence
11:36 < bridge> <learath2> We already shouldn‚Äôt have those
11:36 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean creating a file doesn't exactly means it wasn't teeworlds' code. is `math.c` and `math.cpp` the same file?
11:36 < bridge> <TsPiggy> cuz we've done that
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> If it contains teeworlds code we probably kept the notice
11:37 < bridge> <totar> I don't think we are very careful about it, skins7.cpp and skins7.h have it
11:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but we did created a new file are "reworte" them in cpp :kekw:
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> Hello. Tryin' to set up remote MariaDB server with SSL certificate installed (by domain)
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> 
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> All i get:
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> ```
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> 2025-02-23 10:31:45 I sql: failed connecting to db: (real_connect:mysql:3159): Connections using insecure transport are prohibited while --require_secure_transport=ON.
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> 2025-02-23 10:31:45 I assert: /tw/sources/src/game/server/instagib/sql_stats.cpp(1005): CreateTableThread failed to write
11:37 < bridge> <ninekeem> ```
11:38 < bridge> <ninekeem> 
11:38 < bridge> <ninekeem> What should I do? Does DDNet support MariaDB with SSL?
11:38 < bridge> <Solly> "Connections using insecure transport are prohibited while --require_secure_transport=ON."
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> Whoever made those files may have yoinked code from 0.7 directly
11:38 < bridge> <ninekeem> yes, i see
11:38 < bridge> <ninekeem> but I NEED SSL due to using remote MariaDB server.
11:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think tater means we should not remove them since it was taken from 0.7 even tho it was created in ddnet
11:38 < bridge> <Solly> apparently the server isnt secure
11:39 < bridge> <ninekeem> it secute
11:39 < bridge> <ninekeem> it secure
11:39 < bridge> <Solly> try --require_secure_transport=OFF (im not susre where you put this)
11:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that's insecure
11:39 < bridge> <ninekeem> but i need ssl between ddnet server and mariadb server
11:39 < bridge> <Solly> the error is that it is, if it works when adding this, then the problem is its not using ssl for some reason
11:39 < bridge> <totar> it depends, I'm not really convinced that the file needs it. copywrite only applies to the code itself not the functionality of the code
11:39 < bridge> <ninekeem> i know what error means
11:39 < bridge> <ninekeem> my answer is what can I do
11:40 < bridge> <totar> it depends, I'm not really convinced that the file needs it. copywrite only applies to the written code itself not the functionality of the code
11:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> let me check our transport code, one sec
11:40 < bridge> <ninekeem> disable SSL is **not** an option
11:40 < bridge> <learath2> We probably do not support SSL with mysql
11:40 < bridge> <ninekeem> uh oh
11:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye i think we just didn't
11:41 < bridge> <ninekeem> so how ddnet works with remote db?
11:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it doesn't
11:41 < bridge> <ninekeem> but how? replications?
11:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> only admin knows. so @learath2 enlight us
11:43 < bridge> <ninekeem> i think if ddnet doesn't support ssl for db I should now work with WireGuard on something‚Ä¶
11:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that's what kog did
11:43 < bridge> <ninekeem> nyeh‚Ä¶
11:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wait am i even supposed to know that
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> I don‚Äôt really remember how its set up tbh, perhaps there is a way to coerce it to use ssl
11:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> wtf, my game just crashes after joining a server
11:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> sometimes it just happens
11:44 < bridge> <ninekeem> should i submit an idea somewhere?
11:45 < bridge> <peter0x44> report it?
11:45 < bridge> <learath2> I guess you could create an issue, maybe someone else remembers. I‚Äôll check after food
11:46 < bridge> <ninekeem> okay thank you
11:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw what's your config for the server. (without leaking credentials ofc)
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> ```
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> sv_use_sql 1
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> add_sqlserver r "ddnet-insta" record "ddnet-insta" "<password>" "db.teefusion.net" "3306" 1
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> add_sqlserver w "ddnet-insta" record "ddnet-insta" "<password>" "db.teefusion.net" "3306" 1
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> ```
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> domain is properly set up
11:48 < bridge> <ninekeem> IP doesn't work too
11:49 < bridge> <ninekeem> out other mode 0xf doesn't work too with same errors
11:49 < bridge> <ninekeem> our other mode 0xf doesn't work too with same errors
11:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it looks like there is no way to somehow enable TLS without directly enabling it. it needs to trust a cret too if i'm reading the doc correctly so we need to pass that as well as enabling the `mysql_options`
11:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it looks like there is no way to somehow enable TLS without directly enabling it in code. it needs to trust a cret too if i'm reading the doc correctly so we need to pass that as well as enabling the `mysql_options`
11:54 < bridge> <Solly> why is the heart icon `MAYBE_UNUSED static const char *FONT_ICON_HEART = "\xEF\x80\x84";` that?
11:54 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1343174118471897138/image.png?ex=67bc4fe0&is=67bafe60&hm=1734dba52810301f027de4b996d0ebc7ffad0935d2c766e8cfb595e9f06f860a&
11:54 < bridge> <Solly> (private use apparently)
11:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> font-awesome
11:55 < bridge> <Solly> why not use one of the many hearts
11:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the FONT_ICON is specifically font-awesome
11:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you can just use regular heart if you want in your code
11:55 < bridge> <Solly> right okay
11:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe for the look consistency tho
11:56 < bridge> <Solly> if you change the normal font it will break consistency if everywhere else uses font awesome icon
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> although i think font-awesome icons can only be used one way with a button iirc
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't think we do font fallback to fontawesome, the font has to be manually set while drawing the text i think
11:57 < bridge> <ninekeem> so I gonna write issue
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yes please do
11:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> why am i even here again?
11:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i was playing video game moments ago
11:58 < bridge> <ninekeem> thank ya all
11:58 < bridge> <ninekeem> 
11:58 < bridge> <ninekeem> gonna set it now with WireGuard
12:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> the game just segfaults
12:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> the steam version segfaults and the version compiled by me also segfaults
12:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> run it using `gdb`
12:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> `Thread 43 "DDNet" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.`
12:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> do i need to compile it in some specific way to get more information?
12:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> type `bt`
12:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> i should actually also update my system
12:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you better use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` cmake flag to get better info
12:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> it should be the default tho
12:05 < bridge> <pilonpl> okay
12:05 < bridge> <pilonpl> actually there might be something wrong with my system
12:11 < bridge> <Solly> ive been messing with quad contaienrs for ages trying to get it to not break for unknown reasons
12:11 < bridge> <Solly> when i could just draw the rect myself, theres no reason for me to upload it
12:14 < bridge> <ninekeem> ah, it already here
12:14 < bridge> <ninekeem> ah, it's already here

12:52 < bridge> <chairn> who administrates the tw discord ?
12:53 < bridge> <chairn> there's a nsfw discord post in there
12:54 < bridge> <robyt3> You can ping Dune or heinrich for that
12:56 < bridge> <Solly> does preparestatement need to be freed?
12:57 < bridge> <Solly> out of memory is probably due to accidently having a huge query or memory leak
12:57 < bridge> <Solly> use valgrind for the latter
12:58 < bridge> <filoqcus> I don't know. This is my first time working with databases on ddnet, I just changed the points for deaths and create new table, but I got an error
12:58 < furo> @filoqcus if `PrepareStatement` is true. The function should return true instead of false. You seem to have copied the `AddPoints` function, but changed that for some reason.
12:58 < bridge> <Solly> i dont know anything about this, but try valgrind to see if u have a memory leak
13:03 < bridge> <filoqcus> Yes. Perhaps this is because I wanted to solve this using chatgpt. Overall I'm not surprised)
13:04 < bridge> <filoqcus> But the error remained. 
13:04 < bridge> <filoqcus> 2025-02-23 14:01:55 I system: out of memory
13:09 < furo> Something wrong with your sqlite database, I guess. Try removing it or try searching for "sqlite out of memory error"
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> I deleted it, started the server, it was created, but the error did not go away. Maybe there's a problem with the creation?
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> 
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> ```cpp
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> void IDbConnection::FormatCreateStats(char *aBuf, unsigned int BufferSize) const
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> {
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>     str_format(aBuf, BufferSize,
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %s_stats ("
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         "  Name VARCHAR(%d) COLLATE %s NOT NULL, "
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         "  Kills INT DEFAULT 0, "
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         "  Deaths INT DEFAULT 0, "
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         "  PRIMARY KEY (Name)"
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         ")",
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus>         GetPrefix(), MAX_NAME_LENGTH_SQL, BinaryCollate());
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> }
13:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> ```
13:21 < bridge> <filoqcus> Could the problem be where I'm using this function? Although the error occurs inside the function itself
13:35 < furo> Yes, it would kinda matter. It should be done like it's done in other parts of the code. I made something similar a few weeks ago which is pretty much identical to what you are trying to do. See the `SaveStats` function, https://github.com/furo321/ddnet-bombtag/commit/8e909528a40fa2473ceecbc9192d15236c6bcfcc
13:41 < bridge> <filoqcus> Why did I go into these databases... Everything is so complicated. But thanks, I'll try to do something the same
13:41 < bridge> <filoqcus> :justatest:
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus> Furo, in general, I just wanted to add some lines of code to the Die() function to add Deaths, but you did a lot more)
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus> 
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus> ```cpp
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus> if (m_pPlayer && GameServer()->m_pConnection)
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus>     {
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus>         dbg_msg("system", "I ADD STATS");
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus>         if (char Error[512]; !GameServer()->m_pConnection->AddDeaths(Server()->ClientName(m_pPlayer->GetCid()), 1, Error, sizeof(Error)))
13:44 < bridge> <filoqcus>         {
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>             dbg_msg("system", "Error adding deaths: %s", Error);
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>         }
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>     }
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>     else
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>     {
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>         dbg_msg("system", "I DON`T ADD STATS");
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus>     }
13:45 < bridge> <filoqcus> ```
13:46 < bridge> <_qey> Here we go again. My servers‚Äô maps and mods are being copied, lol. Is there anything I can do about it? I don‚Äôt have a problem with them modifying it, I have a problem with them claiming they made it.
13:47 < bridge> <_qey> And I have a suspicion that those exact people are DDoSing my servers.
13:52 < furo> @filoqcus `IGameServer` doesn't have a `m_pConnection` variable. If you do it like this, you will be calling the SQL in the same thread as the server. Which means you will be effectively halting your entire server waiting for the SQL response.
13:52 < bridge> <filoqcus> I add it
13:53 < bridge> <filoqcus> std::unique_ptr<IDbConnection> m_pConnection;
13:53 < bridge> <filoqcus> ```cpp
13:53 < bridge> <filoqcus> std::unique_ptr<IDbConnection> m_pConnection;
13:53 < bridge> <filoqcus> ```
13:54 < bridge> <filoqcus> Understood. So I made a stupid mistake?
13:54 < bridge> <filoqcus> :nouis:
13:54 < furo> It won't be properly initialized if you do that. Please see how it's done in other parts of the code or the commit I linked earlier.
13:56 < bridge> <_qey> @0xdeen or somebody from the upper echelon, please, take a look and advise.
13:57 < bridge> <_qey> It‚Äôs the second time I‚Äôm being copied.
14:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> not much you can do - you can't keep maps private and people copying your mod code is just something that can happen
14:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> I don't know what server you have, can you send the name and ips of your and the fake server? Also, try talking to the owner of the other server first
14:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki i did register spilling
14:05 < bridge> <_qey> Yes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do at this moment. My servers are currently down, they are being DDoSed if it matters. Do I send it to you privately or just send it here?
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> Don't fix the error just remove the check
15:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @filoqcus: what are you working on? Looks like you could save some time if you would use ddnet-insta. It already saves kills and deaths in the database out of the box.
15:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> your choice
15:02 < bridge> <filoqcus> I would like to do something of my own. I've almost done as furo told me, there's still a little bit left. If something doesn‚Äôt work out for me, I‚Äôll leave my idea (possibly)
15:02 < bridge> <filoqcus> :kek:
15:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you spend less time on solved problems  you have more to build cool new ideas
15:06 < bridge> <_qey> We may have come up with a solution with the owners, they agreed to put up my credentials. Sorry to bother so preemptively, it‚Äôs just that it happens the more often.
15:07 < bridge> <_qey> However, there is still a suspicion about them conducting DDoS-attacks on my servers for my player base to move to their servers. Many IPs come from the same region as their servers, however, service providers differ. If I somehow get the evidence that is really them, should I forward it to you?
15:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which servers do you host gaypidor?
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> You should forward it directly to the police. It's a crime, nothing much we can do.
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> 
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> I guess if you can beyond the shadow of doubt show that the people who host a server are ddosing yours we can masterban them, we've done it in the past
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice

19:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Patiga!
19:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I'm in bed and about to go to sleep but I really wanna ask if you can build the wasm-pack for map-inspect in twgpu master cuz I keep getting a "env" import that doesn't exist in the packaged js.
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> TickSkips (remember the +1) are definite ends of ticks.
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> There are 3 types of chunks that can trigger "implicit" ticks.
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> Those are PlayerDiff, PlayerNew and PlayerOld.
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> The (lets call it) `implicit_pid` starts at `None`, and must be set to `Some(pid)` if you hit one of those chunks. If there was already a value an it is higher, advance one tick.
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> However, set `implicit_pid` to `None`, whenever you hit a TickSkip.
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> Perfect, this is exactly how I ended up implementing it
19:44 < bridge> <patiga> (source: I spend the last few months juggling teehistorians)
19:44 < bridge> <patiga> nice :)
19:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Googled a bit they says it is some external dependency that can't be resolved. I converted the wasm to wat and it was importing some inflate deflate
19:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Annnd, Imma sleep
19:45 < bridge> <patiga> good night!
19:45 < bridge> <patiga> TickSkips (remember the +1) are definite ends of ticks.
19:45 < bridge> <patiga> There are 3 types of chunks that can trigger "implicit" ticks.
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> Those are PlayerDiff, PlayerNew and PlayerOld.
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> The (lets call it) `implicit_pid` starts at `None`, and must be set to `Some(pid)` if you hit one of those chunks. If there was already a value an it is equal or higher, advance one tick.
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> However, set `implicit_pid` to `None`, whenever you hit a TickSkip.
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> did a small correction: higher -> equal or higher, but you prob did that
