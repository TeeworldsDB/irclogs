01:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen regarding the redirect on vote feature I made a proposal last year if I get some ack from a maintainer I might start implementing it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6754
02:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg how did i end up with this one again `` error C2672: 'minimum': no matching overloaded function found `` thats just forgetting the win mean and lean define i thought
02:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato werent u pro regarding that error?
04:15 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> The new mobile client is fascinating, I'm going to delete the old client now
04:17 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> do you play with sound?
04:17 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> oh, havent
04:17 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> Any problems?
04:18 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> sound is broken but other than that it runs fine
04:18 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> sound is broken atm but other than that it runs fine
04:19 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> Really? for me it runs fine
04:19 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> The sound is working without problems
04:20 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> what
04:20 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> At least the SFX is working well

04:21 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
04:22 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> wait
04:22 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> i hear like crackling/garbage on the music and SFX
04:37 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> crazu
04:37 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> crazy
04:44 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> sounds like sampling issue
04:45 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> does your phone do screenrecord?
04:45 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> i posted a screenrecord video earlier but the audio wasn't present for some reason so i deleted it
04:46 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
04:46 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> android screenrecord moment
04:46 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> 🤯
04:46 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i can probably tell what's wrong just by hearing it. i've been dealing with rhythm game and custom audio engine too much.
05:08 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> fixed it
05:08 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> fixed it by changing `snd_rate` to 44100
05:08 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> it was 48000 by default
05:14 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
05:14 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ye. probably a resampling problem (or the lack of resampling)
05:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> actually. no, probably just didn't really detect the correct sample rate of the playback device
05:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> just changing the sample rate and it works so the resampling is clearly working i guess
05:17 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> wait, are we doing double resampling <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
05:21 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> no way...
05:22 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> let me figure out how to compile ddnet in 2024 so i can try something i guess.:kek:
05:34 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
05:37 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> without dependencies :troll:
05:38 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it is possible that SDL is just not getting the correct sampling rate, which idk how we would fix that.
05:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh where are my manners, good morning
05:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277473728116162731/tw_test1.png?ex=66cd4b9f&is=66cbfa1f&hm=f574b6bef2ab8a560a0078a6067a2f6e49d8fec194b7f734c36f32f073c948b0&
05:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh also, how close did I do on properly scaling my Tee in Godot?
05:45 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I learned that the legs are scaled by 1.5x, eyes and shadow legs are scaled at 1.25x
05:45 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I learned that the legs are scaled by 1.5x, eyes and shadow legs are scaled at 1.25x (This is why the legs look more blurry, than the body)
05:46 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Now question, should I keep supporting the 0.6 structure or should I go with the 0.7 style where every part of the Tee is separate?
05:47 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> (I need to fix the eye positions too, since the closer the eye is to the X axis' origin; as in 0, the more separate the eyes become)
05:51 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> norming
05:51 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> :owo: ☕
05:51 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i actually bothers me that 0.6 skin is not 1:1 for every part
05:51 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it actually bothers me that 0.6 skin is not 1:1 for every part
05:52 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> It also bothers me, but whenever I had the 1:1 scale, I felt like it was the old 0.5 feel
05:52 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866> i wasn't here for 0.5
05:53 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277475928011837471/image.png?ex=66cd4dab&is=66cbfc2b&hm=f08cb3c5a790fe001c42c66d0710bbb15e7c8aea70a6f068bc77fe98b9f84759&
05:53 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Welp
05:53 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i knew about teeworlds during 0.5, but when 0.6 drops with truetype fonts i immediately jumped in so I can at least translate the game so my friends can play as well.
05:53 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> honestly i can't tell unless it is default
05:54 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> moment
05:55 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Normally this is how it should look
05:55 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277476523133112412/image.png?ex=66cd4e39&is=66cbfcb9&hm=cc874fa3fe18a5e6257cf3732f95d7b18736244c1bd2f875e5d86d63ba3bd243&
05:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> But then
05:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277476633028067380/image.png?ex=66cd4e53&is=66cbfcd3&hm=24ed7831c84a4e547c8fe1fa2b31e1ad80954b3049de02b7ec26d6ee930fa2d5&
05:56 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> lol
05:56 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> lgtm
05:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> the eyes are soooo small
05:56 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> honestly
05:56 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277476823986475131/splashtee1.png?ex=66cd4e81&is=66cbfd01&hm=c7309f29be274d0c9b4392542a3b9c1ea1325aeb5ca8cbfa2f7d374eea93ab8f&
05:57 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it was supposed to be small (not really
05:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> but the legs too?
05:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> For me, the legs are the only things that need that 1.5x scale
05:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> the eyes are kinda fine
05:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> kinda like this
05:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277477077771092008/image.png?ex=66cd4ebd&is=66cbfd3d&hm=86ae3aaa7bd49053549c1de0e4800e995220c9c40b3d2b83e52d7b14766d007c&
05:58 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> eww
05:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> almost represents the image
05:58 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i mean 0.6 works fine
05:58 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> as in-game characters
05:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> yup :greenthing:
05:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'll intend to use 4k textures anyway cuz I can compress them for memory (by around 70%)
05:58 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> I draw my tees with larger eyes anyway i think.
05:59 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ravie made some svgs of the built-in 16 tees
05:59 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> biggernouis was using those
05:59 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Yes, I'll use them if I'm allowed
05:59 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ask them i guess
05:59 < bridge_> <yutzaff> freddie you are moderator so yk why my friend cant join RUS server? help pls
06:00 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i can only mod CHN servers, sorry
06:00 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> you can open a ticket #✉-create-a-ticket
06:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> @yutzaff #✉-create-a-ticket time
06:00 < bridge_> <yutzaff> okay thanks
06:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> mention that it's from RUS server and need a RUS mod
06:01 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> do ban appeal if he get banned immediately after join. otherwise, you can ask in #questions
06:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Ehm, anyways so back to Tees
06:02 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I decided to use full composition for the player
06:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> fun fact, biggernouis used to have the tee eyes following the cursor. but it become very cursed very fast late game.
06:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
06:02 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Yeah it was weird the first time, for me the eye changes were weird to me
06:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I would like to have more eye changes, not being limited to only 5 or so eyes
06:03 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
06:03 < bridge_> <yutzaff> it says "server not responding"
06:03 < bridge_> <yutzaff> when he joining
06:04 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> What server is he joining on?
06:04 < bridge_> <yutzaff> RUS4
06:04 < bridge_> <yutzaff> cuz copy love box on r4
06:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> the one with the most players? 
06:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> #1 / #2 / #3 / #4?
06:05 < bridge_> <yutzaff> 3
06:05 < bridge_> <yutzaff> 4
06:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Maybe internet problem
06:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Restart router or restart PC
06:06 < bridge_> <yutzaff> kk ty
06:07 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> turn off any proxy or vpn too
06:07 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> turn off any proxy or vpn too if he has one
06:08 < bridge_> <yutzaff> kk
06:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that won't change it
06:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I literally went in with vpn
06:08 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i mean vpn can die
06:08 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> :kek:
06:08 < bridge_> <animepdf> Where is he from
06:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> The only way you get the "no response" message is whenever the server is not available anymore, or if it's full of players
06:09 < bridge_> <yutzaff> i think Kazakhstan
06:09 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
06:09 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
06:09 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that's far away
06:09 < bridge_> <animepdf> No clue then :heheehee:
06:10 < bridge_> <yutzaff> fr idk i asking him hes from kz he said no but when i check his profile "Kz"
06:11 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> welp, wherever that guy is, his internet might not be the best
06:12 < bridge_> <yutzaff> fr
06:12 < bridge_> <animepdf> If he's from Ukraine some of RUS servers might now work, the only way to fix this is VPN, so tell him this if you're not sure where he's from :okSanya:
06:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> @tsfreddie Should I give the skin 0.7 support as well? I think I should ask @chillerdragon instead
06:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> idk
06:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it's really up to you tho
06:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> since he's the so told 0.7 maniac out there and he'd HATE me for it xd
06:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> chiller just do stuff for fun i think
06:16 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> he is a spy afterall
06:16 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Yeah and I might get him to try my prototype, what'll I show him

06:51 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> It's a pity that we can't directly change button commands using bind.
06:51 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> But hamburger menu solves this problem i guess
06:52 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> Using that extra menu button to toggle deepfly
07:52 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> https://youtu.be/-9fEjUUT3gs

18:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> Do you have any related error messages in the console? There was another report that setting sampling rate 44100 fixes it. https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1277452051537727490

18:13 < bridge_> <meloƞ> is it possible to make it default on this version?

18:13 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
18:14 < bridge_> <meloƞ> is it possible to make it default on there?
18:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> Would work as a workaround to change the default for Android, maybe the resampling is broken for some sounds or rate. Looks like some of our sounds are 44100 and some are 48000 so there is always some resampling

19:13 < bridge_> <chairn> i received a SMS saying someone tried to log into my bank account 3 times and my bank account access is blocked till midnight, not scary at all...
19:13 < bridge_> <chairn> any advice ?
19:16 < bridge_> <jxsl13> delete the sms
19:16 < bridge_> <jxsl13> contact your bank and ask
19:17 < bridge_> <jxsl13> don't click any links in the sms
19:19 < bridge_> <chairn> the sms is authentic
19:19 < bridge_> <chairn> my bank account is really blocked
19:19 < bridge_> <chairn> you don't know french banks
19:19 < bridge_> <chairn> they are unreachable by phones...
19:20 < bridge_> <jxsl13> send a message through their app
19:20 < bridge_> <jxsl13> support request
19:21 < bridge_> <jxsl13> use a generated password of 100 characters and use a password manager
19:32 < bridge_> <totar> Reset your email password and wait until midnight to reset bank password.
19:32 < bridge_> <chairn> their pw is 6 digits, you can't change that
19:32 < bridge_> <chairn> talk about security
19:32 < bridge_> <totar> hmm
19:33 < bridge_> <totar> Just make sure any 2fa you're using has fresh passwords
19:33 < bridge_> <chairn> there's no 2fa authentication 🙂
19:33 < bridge_> <meloƞ> depending on where your from, calling them and saying you want new bank credentials might work (atleast works in germany)
19:33 < bridge_> <chairn> maybe i can ask for that, if only there was an agency where i live...
19:33 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :justatest:
19:34 < bridge_> <meloƞ> depending on where you're from, calling them and saying you want new bank credentials might work (atleast works in germany)
19:34 < bridge_> <totar> So anyone can lock you out of your account if they enter wrong credentials 3 times?
19:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'd rather disable online banking entirely with that security :pepeW:
19:35 < bridge_> <chairn> looks like, but they would need the bank account number
19:35 < bridge_> <chairn> then my bank account would be kinda useless outside of credit card
19:35 < bridge_> <chairn> i don't know where people got the bank account number
19:35 < bridge_> <chairn> it's an 8 digit number, maybe they brute forced it
19:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> Probably
19:36 < bridge_> <chairn> and tried most common 6 digits pw
19:36 < bridge_> <chairn> now, could it be a trap to try to log me into so that they can retrieve the true pw?
19:37 < bridge_> <meloƞ> as tater said, change your credentials on your email etc first - also, you really can't call your bank? ._.
19:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's not possible to verify the authenticity of SMS, but if the link is definitely the bank's link then I don't see how
19:38 < bridge_> <chairn> there's no link in the sms
19:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> That makes is less likely to be a scam or phishing, if there is no immediately call to action
19:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> That makes is less likely to be a scam or phishing, if there is no immediate call to action
19:39 < bridge_> <meloƞ> yeah i'd consider it legit just getting a notification like "hey mate your account is locked until X time because you failed to enter the correct credentials"
19:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> Unfortunately the properly formatted SMS does not quite balance out the security issues of 8 digit account number, 6 digit password, no 2FA and the use of SMS in general
19:45 < bridge_> <chairn> welcome to french banking system 🙂
20:20 < bridge_> <robyt3> Someone spamming malware link on every new issue :monkaS: looks like the account is gone after the second report
20:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmao
22:04 < bridge_> <bova0306_86667> аааа
22:09 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> will the game be available on redmi note 8 pro in the next update?
22:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> The APK in the 7z archive should work on all non-ancient phones (Android 4.4+). Does it not work?
22:12 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Yes
22:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> Any error messages? How does it not work?
22:13 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> the game crashes:(
22:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> Immediately when launching or when?
22:13 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> immediately upon startup
22:14 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> I have a video where it shows that the game crashes
22:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> Do you know how to use adb? https://developer.android.com/tools/adb
22:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then you could try to get the crash dump with `adb bugreport ./output.zip` or use `adb logcat` to get the log while the app crashes.
22:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> Just to confirm, you are on the latest OS version for this device?
22:18 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> I don't understand anything about this, sorry
22:18 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Es
22:18 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Yes
22:19 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Yes

22:20 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> what i done ?
22:20 < bridge_> <robyt3> What exact Android device and Android version are you using?
22:21 < bridge_> <k1tblyaat> 11
22:21 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> 11
22:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> Which kind of device?
22:21 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Me too
22:21 < bridge_> <k1tblyaat> Realme 6
22:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> changing graphics backend fixed problems on my phone
22:22 < bridge_> <robyt3> How do you do that without being able to start the game?
22:22 < bridge_> <robyt3> And which phone and android version do you have?
22:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i pasted a file in the game directory
22:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i pasted a config file in the game directory
22:22 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ah, if you still have write access (or root)
22:23 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i don't have root
22:23 < bridge_> <robyt3> So older Android version without storage restriction
22:23 < bridge_> <robyt3> Which phone brand and model?
22:24 < bridge_> <k1tblyaat> Realme 6
22:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> I meant @milkeeycat
22:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'm making a list of all devices that have this issue
22:24 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> You russian people?
22:25 < bridge_> <k1tblyaat> Yes
22:25 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Я тоже
22:25 < bridge_> <robyt3> #off-topic for Russian please
22:25 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> idk what issue u're talking about but my phone probably just don't like Vulkan xd
22:26 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Okay
22:26 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Redmi Note 8 Pro with Android 9
22:26 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> 11
22:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'm seeing a pattern here
22:26 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Im 11 android
22:26 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> we get it
22:26 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> you dont need to say it
22:27 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I'm MilkeeyCat, nice to meet ya 11 android
22:27 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> 😅
22:28 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> I don't know English well, so there may be mistakes
22:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> Thanks for the reports, maybe we can test this in the google device lab
22:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i guess, if i update my phone everything will work but if you need something to be tested, i'll help :DD
22:32 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i guess if i update my phone everything will work but if you need something to be tested, i'll help :DD
22:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> If you know how to use `adb` you could try to get a crash dump, though I'm not sure how useful it is without a debug build of the apk
22:32 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> didn't I already send it :thonk:
22:34 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> .
22:35 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> FNG on discord*
22:35 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> 😅
22:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> ah oops
22:35 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> nothing wrong
22:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> thanks, must have missed the ping
22:36 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> perhaps
22:37 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> guys when i remove one or more of localize and i go to settings my game crash what i do
22:37 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277728674782773300/image.png?ex=66ce390f&is=66cce78f&hm=a0d83eae8b1b5322cc0c9c41b89cddb15b7a01bbf6faf44582bbe3339e166cbe&
22:40 < bridge_> <robyt3> I guess you are removing it from the array `apTabNames` which has a fixed size of `NUMBER_OF_APPEARANCE_TABS`, you also need to adjust that and the other enum literals
22:41 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> bro no way i dodnt see that at all
22:41 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> thx i test
22:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> the odd thing about this is that 48k is hardcoded in some places
22:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> I only see two, the default sampling rate, and the sample rate for opus (which is always 48000 per the standard)
22:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> my guess is android is opening the device at 44.1 even tho 48k was requested and it looks like ddnet doesnt check for it
22:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> That makes sense, `SDL_OpenAudioDevice` returns the specs that were actually applied but we ignore most of them
22:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> But as we are passing `0` for the parameter `allowed_changes` we are probably letting SDL do the sampling again, since this means we don't allow the format to be changed
22:50 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> thx it work i  feel so dumb bc i didnt even see that thx
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I tested on the same graphics family as milkeeycat
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> driver issues
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> robyte that is why i want the dialog popup
22:55 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> make opengl as default and let people roll the dice and select vulkan 😬
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> problem is GLES is buggy on 1 of my phones
22:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Doesn't even need to be a popup, just detect if it's a blacklisted device and use OpenGL instead
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> vulkan on non xd
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> stable graphics backends is gambling xd
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sure if u want to maintain that
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt find a list online yet
22:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think we could add a separate shortcut to the client that you can activate with long-pressing the launcher icon
23:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> Like you can long press the Notes app and it will show items to take notes immediately
23:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> We could show an options to use Vulkan or OpenGL instead
23:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> We could show an option to use Vulkan or OpenGL instead
23:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> Separate launcher would also work but seems more annoying
23:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "skip launcher" xd
23:30 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> @robyt3 several people complain about the hook circle, because it cannot be removed or moved.., I do not know what to answer them
23:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can edit the controls to remove it
23:31 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Okay
23:32 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> now I will try to explain it to them
23:42 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> what is th ecollision of the tee ?
23:43 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> what is the ecollision of the tee ?
23:43 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> what is the collision of the tee ?
