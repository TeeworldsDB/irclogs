09:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Is that tutorial outdated ? I follow every step but end up with a lot of errors
09:12 <@deen> What kind of errors?
09:13 <@deen> there is also https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765 which is a bit more recent

10:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like the python script before didn't run
10:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> milk's tutorial is outdated btw, since it uses bam
10:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and we don't support bam anymore, but cmake
10:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so please try heinrich5991's
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> @deen the error was for the milk tutorial which clone git repo. heinrich5991 tut had lots of errors [coudnt find mutex, atomic] and a few errors with predefined macro definitions
10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like missing stl headers, weird
10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> anyone else running Visual Studio here?
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> If anyone have tutorial on how to use MinGW to compile please let me know
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @mohsen7s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qixm12W4CaM
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should do a writeup for compiling with mingw
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Yes you should. I wasted a full 12 hours research on this field and simply gave up with compiling ddnet! Its really a pain to compile it on windows
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's not a 12 hour process for anyone familiar with compiling things, but I do understand the struggle ðŸ˜„
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes windows is pain lol xd
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :feelsbadman:
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :toptri:
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Finally got it compiled for with VS2019! It was really a horrible process!
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> care to document it? ^^
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no :troll:
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> @heinrich5991 idk might do it at weekend. my issue was that followed the outdated tutorial and installed VS2015 & VC Express 2010 which overrided paths and set Python 2 as default
