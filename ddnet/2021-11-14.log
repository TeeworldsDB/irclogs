00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> `[00:06:33][client]: got pong from current server, latency=150ms`  can we get rid of this again ? in F1 or everywhere
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Can we get rid of f1 spam in general, have some kind of cooldown / spam protection for stuff like starting a ghost / demo, also tiles like solo. Ghost/demo are the worst offenders
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think most people probably use F1 as a chat history, rather than actually using the show chat bind to do so.
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think most people probably use F1 as a chat history, rather than actually using the show chat bind to do so.
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Since f1 has a dark background to make text easier to read, and u can actually scroll up.
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> i do use show chat bind frequently, but when i wanna go back further i use f1 yea
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChÄ«mupurei> Hello. It would be nice if you created an overlay. If you didn't write ebuilds, I can suggest my own. What do you think?
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChÄ«mupurei> Sorry for necroposting

09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> because what Skeith said
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> then the chat history in ingame chat should be made more useful instead of taking away the purpose of the console
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> allow scrolling and text selection in history and allow configurable background color to for readability
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> allow scrolling and text selection in history and allow configurable background color for readability
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like in 0.7?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Where u can use page up/down to read chat history while u hold show Chat or chat is opened
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I don't particularly like page up/down only but yeah
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> mouse wheel and page up/down would be better
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> and another ingame mouse state so you can select text in the chat
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> and another ingame mouse state so you can select text in the chat (history)
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh perfect. I'll give them a read, then I can just try to get them into gentoo, don't need to make our own overlay
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> fokkonauts server says NA in the server browser for me even though it gives ~200 ping
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk if thats a bug or what
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 can you add a hardcoded mapping for that ip? ^
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on it
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmmmm
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't reproduce @louis
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it says EUR for me
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i reset the ping things
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can rename `ddnet-cache.sqlite3`
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and rename it back if you want your old pings back
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it says eur for me now but i'm pretty sure it said na earlier
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe it had smth to do with it having >64 players and showing up at the top? idk
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hello. Is there a way for the server to check if a client has "vanilla only skins" option set?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The issue is that 1) mod requires different skins, 2) some vanilla skins are OK, but some DDNet skins fits better.
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I added a check: if client version >= 11031 (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1218 released in this version) then use those skins, else â€” use vanilla.
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> But some players (who has "vanilla only skins" checked) reported that they got "default" skin for everyone. This is explainable but the question is if I can workaround that on the server side or not.
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe because the ip is american
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nope
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> If not then the question is "is there a way for the client to expose its settings to the server" and if the protocol supports some "client capabilities" then whether a PR with such cap exposed to the server would be acceptable?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> If not then the question is "is there a way for the client to expose its settings/capabilities to the server" and if the protocol supports some "client capabilities" then whether a PR with such cap exposed to the server would be acceptable?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why would you need that? Just force those skins. You can re-build it on the server and if someone has a vanilla skin just send the prefix_name version of it
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, I think the pr u sent was misleading, if someone has vanilla skins only on, he cant see other skins than vanilla, thats to be expected and cant/shouldnt be changed
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Server has no influence on that, also, one could remove all skins other than vanilla skins to achive the same
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I have a check on the server side. Like: if the player character meets some condition, then { if version >= 11031 the skin is 'santa_bluekitty'; else : 'bluekitty' }.
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> This is fine
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> This is fine.
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I woud just go with not caring about such old versions in a custom mod
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> If the client wants vanilla skins, then I want to set e.g. 'bluekitty'. But if the client OK with other skins, then 'santa_bluekitty' is highly preferable.
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, then you should just send santa_bluekitty i think
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You cant solve every case here :/
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I think about a chat command to toggle the skins to vanilla only, but that would be inconvenient for the players.
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You could let a vote pop up for each joining player asking to use customized skins or vanilla ones, F3 and F4 can be pressed then to choose
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am struggling with a similar Problem, i need to know if the Client uses dynamic camera, in order to calculate zoomed-out cursor positions correctly. Currently I need chat command for that too :/
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> There is such a vote is for the language selection ðŸ˜… (toggle between English and <based on flag/IP>).
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Make 2 votes :p
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hmmm. I just realized that I also can add custom votes. E.g. I can add a vote "toggle custom skins" to the vote list. If the client sends such vote start, then I can toggle the skins and ignore the vote.
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The same for the language and many other chat commands.
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Did i break my arch? pacman says my system is up to date since days that cant be right...
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe your mirror is out of date chillerdragon
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea thought so
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that actually happens a lot
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ill look up on how to update em
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just take the second one in the list
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> am i that arch newb still that it never happend to me so far? \:D
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only happened to me once
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah oke
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i found this reflector thing that can be enabled with systemd does it do it automatically?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://archlinux.org/mirrors/status/ shows the delay
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know chillerdragon
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh seems like my mirror list was generated with reflector already according to the comment in my mirror cfg
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah nice thanks bois i got em updates bakk! c\:
