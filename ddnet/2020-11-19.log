07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh man
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778870011695071262/unknown.png
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't want to handle widechar :blobban:
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen if you could give a tutorial how to use this benchmark would be nice,
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the test suit is insanly counter intuitive
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> - i dunno how to add your reposiroty
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> - it always only says invalid argument(maybe bcs above is missing)
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> - email registration doesn't work(tested 3 emails) xD
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do i require a account to benchmark? bcs searching the internet doesnt really give me any useful information
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie windows can't do utf8 on terminal?
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no, the windows api only does widechar which seems like UTF-16
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i pulled the candidate list out of windows so we can draw them.
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> need to convert them to utf8 first.
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ oh, I see. it doesn't work for me either if I'm not logged in. I have to figure out how to upload to pts/ instead of def/ I guess
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :heartw:
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778881625244434442/unknown.png
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen got it working without account
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in /home/jupeyy/.phoronix-test-suite/openbenchmarking.org/
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just copied one of these .index files and renamed it to def
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it worked xD
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2011194-FI-DDNETJSTA08
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we definetily need a more GPU bound benchmark too :D
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> some good looking map, without showall and showothers
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I asked inthe phoronix forum: https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/phoronix-test-suite/1220478-how-to-make-test-profile-available-for-others
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ suggestion for a map?
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Windows10 only sorta can do utf8 on it's console since 2019 iirc. By default it only does ucs2 or ascii/codepages
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also the windows console is not a real file. The mess that is msvcrt makes it pretend to be a half assed file
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought we finally had this joke of a console wrapped properly
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie how did you get the broken output?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> printf some wchar
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> print some wchar
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and those are output in vscode debug console so doesn't really have anything to do with windows's terminal
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah dbg_msg always assumes utf8
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The vscode terminal is probably a console too
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> debug console is probably piped
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, could be, does it support utf8?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think the c++ extension prints a line twice if there's a ascii it think shouldn't be there
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-unicode-and-utf-8-output-text-buffer/ this is a nice read
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778896170482794496/unknown.png
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i just use `WideCharToMultiByte` from windows SDK, windows probably knows better about the string than me.
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What kind of multibyte does it convert to?
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778896510997233674/unknown.png
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i told it to do CP_UTF8üòÑ
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen RainyMore2 from kog xd
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what ddnet maps are resource intensive
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe something like https://ddnet.tw/maps/Lost-32-Story
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno test
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rainymore2 gives me 1k fps max, most maps give me atleast 4k even with design
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1-2k on that map, the beginning is 1k, later 2k
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie I wouldn't trust windows to do anything for my unicode text but I guess CP_UTF8 is maybe safe
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :megathink:
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe do a decode afterwards just to be sure
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Microsoft is well known for not following any standard correctly
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen looked at gpu usage now, the loststorys only gets the GPU to 90%
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the other map 100
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778900655787212830/RaiNyMore2_one_min.demo
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen prefer a map from ddnet or doesnt matter?
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> prefer ddnet üòÑ
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tested some good looking maps from ddnet, but all too less GPU load
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Cosyris
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try Justice 2
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or AIB Quest 2
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> both below 80%
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly ddnet maps often have rocket and ninja entities and they create a cpu bottleneck
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where are the fancy loading screens üòÑ
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where is the space map that released lately
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Orion 95-99%
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but at high fps
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are alot that max out CPU and GPU well
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yun Gu 2
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but cant find any real GPU bound
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778912311103717376/unknown.png
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice u broke 0.7
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk:
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778914330501709844/unknown.png
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah is that IME
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> self implemented
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pulled the list from windows and drew it in teeworlds
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice, is that the way to go? How do other (commercial) games solve it?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i know dota and csgo draw the list in game. don't know how they get the data
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I enabled SDL_SYSWMEVENT in SDL, and handled WM_IME_NOTIFY from windows directly.
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie nicely done ‚ù§Ô∏è
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: Linux probably wouldn't work the same way.
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely not üòÑ
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Neither macOS btw, apparently they removed most if not all hooks into the ime server
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I wonder if macos send it's ime messages through window manager
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nervous: is there any game that does IME well on macos.
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly best bet is to check source engine games, I think they have it working on all platforms
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reverse engineering csgo is easier than digging into apples documentation or reverse engineering appkit
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :watermeron:
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Took me almost 3 days to debug appkit issue with the sdl2 bug
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> aren't some source engine games open source?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Objective c looks absolutely awful in assembly
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think it‚Äôs the engine itself that handles this so unless the engine is open source, I don‚Äôt think so
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie btw, this is the point you‚Äôll notice that the ui code is decidedly unfun to work with üòõ
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk:
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is this it? https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll be fine.
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think their IME solution was quite new, but I‚Äôll check it out, maybe it‚Äôs in here
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish they would allow source access like epic games does with unreal engine
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unreal is barely cross platform so no use looking there ;P
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> hm, why there's big diff when i run clang format on master branch?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778921887945326612/2020-11-19-125438-screenshot.png
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @nori probs clang-format version related
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, sorry about that. I have the same problem currently. Just ignore clang-format at the moemnt if you don't have clang-format 10 on your system
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778947622596509696/unknown.png

16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> does enter no longer cancel joining a server? :(
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> escape
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> chat also uses enter, and that collision is annoying
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well if escape works then fair enough, I'll need to get used to it
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> a wonky keyboard might get you banned if enter key is ghosting.
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh

17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üò¶
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Confirmed, reverting my change fixes it
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Luckily this is not released yet
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would really love to see a RISC desktop chip. want to see if it can get close to x86
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc single core performance
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i'd like to know if a new CISC could be better üòÑ
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder how much apple chip profits from this all in one chip design üòÑ
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I heard apple chips are healtier than potato chips
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I heard apple chips are healthier than potato chips
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i see, vitamins and minerals all in one chip
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't think it's about the architecture for apple
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They can't put x86 inside a phone without huge rnd costs
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> However, with ARM getting very good they can put an acceptable ARM processor in their laptops to finally lock the users down completely into their ecosystem
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant more like, how much would a desktop chip profit from it, better latencys etc
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think laptops are the perfect sweet spot for x86 and arm
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well AMD APUs weren't half bad actually, so atleast having the gpu close helps
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are around the same performance, but arm still profits from the thermal design
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Around the same performance is a bit of an overstatement though, most arm chips are still weaker
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think apple silicon is the first successful attempt at a highish performance arm chip
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure, but aslong arm doesnt clock high and profits from low latencies its performance is quite good, but obviously that doesnt scale to a desktop chip
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and thats why i'd like to see how close (or how far away) they are
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what would be great? Seeing this small core big core design in a modern x86 laptop cpu
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's a brilliant idea to get much better efficiency and lower latency for the UX
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also u rarely upgrade ur laptop anyway probably
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if anyone will do a high performance riscv chip any time soon
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've heard it's fairly common in smaller/low performance stuff
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even in a couple high performance networking cards as a "co-processor"
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats also why i wonder if a modern CISC can increase perf and also efficiency
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> more modern instructions and maybe a different op code processing that doesnt suffer so much from converting
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 intel is working on that
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://www.anandtech.com/show/15979/intel-alder-lake-confirmed-x86-hybrid-with-golden-cove-and-gracemont-for-2021
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And AMD too, but no product announcement yet: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-patent-biglittle--hybrid-computing-implementation
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> good to hear that the idea isn't too far fetched üòõ
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see it be really useful for desktop computing or "gaming" performance though. It'd only make sense to me for low power applications like laptops and tablets maybe
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> CPU scheduler in Windows cannot properly handle even those modern AMD processors where cores and caches are divided into independent groups and you want big.LITTLE... üòÑ
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, numa has been with us for decades, microsoft's fault for not supporting it
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I thought amd got it figured out in ryzen 5k with minimal numa zones
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > They can't put x86 inside a phone without huge rnd costs
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they wouldnt be able  to boast about battery life as much from my understanding
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> my conclusion is, we need a phone with burning fuekl
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> my conclusion is, we need a phone with burning fuel
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> logic of this world

22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 would be pretty hilarious if youtube removed it due to DMCA
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it won't happen to that video because it's famous enough
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd generate a twitter outrage large enough for a human at google to look at it
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a human at google
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that sounds funny for some reason
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a rare sight. if your account gets locked, you'll usually not get lucky to speak to human
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> eh?

22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> odd
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I remove `cl_show_console 1` from my config I can't start ddnet by double clicking
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm what?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Simon'> Just discovered that others see my tee as default skin, but i actually have a skin
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Simon'> I want everyone to see my skin pla fix my ddnet
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if I double click on DDNet.exe and cl_show_console isn't set it doesn't launch
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I start the same executable from console, it works just fine üòõ
