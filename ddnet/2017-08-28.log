05:02 <+sctt_> @heinrich5991: i've finished map_image_replace tool, it works fine! :)
05:03 <+sctt_> @heinrich5991: you think it's worth to make a PR on ddnet for this? maybe it's not so useful for you and you are not interested
05:03 <+sctt_> @heinrich5991: let me know^^
07:04 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes, make a pr
11:20 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: as deen said, make a PR, and if you're super awesome, also fix the map_resave tool :)
18:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] sctt opened pull request #844: Fixing map_resave tool (master...master) https://git.io/v5G2x
18:45 <+sctt_> guys before commiting map_image_replace tool i'd like to clean up the code a bit
18:45 <+sctt_> but there is something i'm struggling with
18:47 <+sctt_> currently i've copied and paste function LoadPNG into image_replace_image.cpp cause i wasn't able to include it from graphics_threaded.h
18:48 <+sctt_> it's not a problem for me cause it works, but for an official commit i guess it's not that great
18:48 <+sctt_> do you know if there is any better solution to integrate LoadPNG into a tool?
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> where u buy ddnet servers?
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> i mean the provider
19:08 <@deen> @Ezy which one specifically?
19:08 <@deen> sctt_: move it to a separate header
19:08 <@deen> include in both places
19:08 <@deen> DDNet.tw, GER, USA: nfoservers
19:09 <@deen> RUS: ihor.ru
19:09 <@deen> Chile: zgh.cl
19:09 <@deen> South Africa: clickworks.co.za
19:09 <@deen> CAN: OVH
19:10 <@deen> but they're just ~10 â‚¬ virtual servers, nothing fancy
19:10 <+sctt_> @deen: ok i will do that, but i'm not an expert of tw structure, can you tell me in which folder would you define that header and with which name?
19:10 <@deen> and we used to jump isps pretty frequently due to ddos attacks, but not so much recently
19:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @deen y thats what i need ty
19:11 <@deen> sctt_: no idea :D
19:12 <@deen> sctt_: but the tools link to game_shared and engine, so those are your options
19:13 <+sctt_> @deen: can it be engine/shared/pngutils.h ?
19:15 <@deen> ok i guess
19:15 <+sctt_> ok :D
20:53 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> Does anyone here have an idea why SDL2 (SDL however not) tries to disable compositing on kde (even most basic SDL2 programs only displaying an empty window) ?
21:01 <@heinrich5991> what is compositing?
21:02 <@heinrich5991> https://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?p=52644
21:04 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> yes, that is exactly what I did too but now I wonder why SDL2 does this and SDL does not
21:06 <@deen> because compositing increases latency with an extra frame or two
21:07 <@deen> SDL2 is frequently used for low latency applications like gaming
21:07 <@deen> so disabling it is vital
21:07 <@heinrich5991> what is compositing?
21:07 <@deen> See people complaining about having 1 more frame of latency on Windows
21:07 <@deen> with vsync for example, or some weird sdl2 behaviour
21:07 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager
21:10 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> I see unfortunately it seems to break some things on kde, switching workspaces seems to freeze the game and results in timeouts for example. Not sure if this is an error of kde or SDL2.
21:16 <+sctt_> @heinrich55991 do you know if there is something special to do in ddnet to add a new .h?
21:16 <@heinrich5991> add it to the cmakelists.txt, otherwise nothing
21:16 <+sctt_> @heinrich55991 i've changed the MakeFile to add the new files
21:17 <+sctt_> oh so i shouldnt touch the MakeFile
21:17 <@heinrich5991> no
21:17 <@heinrich5991> that is automatically generated
21:17 <+sctt_> oh ok
21:17 <+sctt_> i use make
21:17 <+sctt_> is it allright?
21:17 <+sctt_> i see you have bam and also other tools
21:18 <@heinrich5991> yes, that is all
21:18 <@heinrich5991> in fact, cmake will complain if you don't add it, and bam will pick it up automatically
21:18 <+sctt_> i see
21:18 <+sctt_> can i ask why you have two compilation tools? xD
21:20 <@heinrich5991> because we're kind of in a transition
21:21 <@heinrich5991> cmake isn't there yet
21:21 <+sctt_> oh right that's what i thought
21:21 <+sctt_> @heinrich5991 anyway i still have problems after modifying cmakelists.txt
21:22 <+sctt_> i've got pnglite undefined references like this
21:22 <+sctt_> pngutils.cpp:(.text+0x23): undefined reference to `png_init'
21:22 <+sctt_> but in  pngutils.cpp i've included
21:22 <+sctt_> #include <engine/external/pnglite/pnglite.h>
21:23 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: higlight me like this, with a colon instead of an @
21:23 <@heinrich5991> I don't get highlighted by @s for some reason
21:24 <+sctt_> heinrich5591: ok^^
21:24 <@heinrich5991> ahh
21:25 <@heinrich5991> you're misspelt my name :D
21:25 <@heinrich5991> just type hein and press tab
21:25 <@heinrich5991> the pnglite.h file just says "there is a function png_init, somewhere"
21:25 <+sctt_> @heinrich5991 lol
21:26 <@heinrich5991> but @ still doesn't seem to work ^^
21:26 <@heinrich5991> you have to actually add the png_init function to your tool executable
21:27 <+sctt_> heinrich5991: consider it is linking ddnet server
21:27 <+sctt_> Linking CXX executable DDNet-Server
21:27 <@heinrich5991> check line 836 of CMakeLists.tx
21:27 <@heinrich5991> t
21:28 <@heinrich5991> list(APPEND EXTRA_TOOL_SRC ${DEP_PNG})
21:28 <@heinrich5991> that adds the png stuff to the TOOL if it matches the regex the line before
21:28 <@heinrich5991> if(TOOL MATCHES "^(tileset_|dilate|map_extract$)")
21:29 <@heinrich5991> you could add |your_tool_name there
21:29 <+sctt_> i see
21:29 <+sctt_> but how can i add it to the main binaries?
21:29 <+sctt_> cause i've isolated LoadPNG also for graphic_trheated
21:30 <+sctt_> in fact now it's failing when it tries to link DDnet-Server
21:30 <@heinrich5991> hmm
21:31 <@heinrich5991> not sure that we want a png library in the server
21:31 <@heinrich5991> mh
21:31 <+sctt_> yeah that's seem strange to me too
21:31 <+sctt_> :/
21:31 <@deen> @HMH update both?
21:31 <+sctt_> only tools and src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp includes that
21:33 <+sctt_> [ 79%] Built target DDNet
21:33 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: dilate.cpp and tileset_*.cpp also uses png stuff, btu without graphics_threaded
21:33 <@heinrich5991> maybe you can pick up something from there?
21:33 <+sctt_> thats what i did before
21:34 <+sctt_> i copied and changed a bit LoadPNG function
21:34 <+sctt_> but that deen suggested me
21:34 <+sctt_> to create another .h file
21:34 <+sctt_> and include that on both my tool and graphics_threaded
21:34 <@deen> ah, so now the cpp has it too
21:34 <@deen> that's wrong, my bad
21:34 <+sctt_> so that's not possible? :(
21:34 <@deen> you need to put the code somewhere else, so that it's not linked into the server
21:35 <+sctt_> mmm
21:35 <@deen> I guess there is nothing that's linked into client and tools, but not server
21:35 <@heinrich5991> not sure if there's a good way to do this without creating a dependency nightmare
21:35 <+sctt_> i see
21:35 <@heinrich5991> also, the LoadPNG function doesn't really do a lot of work
21:35 <@deen> well, you can make it an inline function in the header directly :D
21:35 <@heinrich5991> argh
21:36 <@heinrich5991> in dilate.cpp, there's a stripped down version of LoadPNG
21:36 <+sctt_> you are the experts guys, thell me if it's better to just copy that function or try to include it somewhere
21:36 <@heinrich5991> essentially:
21:36 <+sctt_> oh
21:36 <@heinrich5991> png_t png;
21:36 <@heinrich5991> png_open_file(&png, filename);
21:37 <@heinrich5991> if(png.color_type != PNG_TRUECOLOR_ALPHA) { /* abort */ }
21:37 <+sctt_> yes i see
21:37 <@heinrich5991> allocate, get_data, close_file
21:37 <+sctt_> so i guess i'll stick with replicating part of the logic inside the tool itself
21:38 <+sctt_> no .h
21:38 <@heinrich5991> yeah :/
21:38 <@heinrich5991> not the best solution, but I don't see a better one
21:38 <+sctt_> yeah well we will live with that^^
21:53 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @deen nah, already running the latest
21:53 <@deen> then look for bug reports I guess
23:34 <+sctt_> heinrich5991: i've added map_replace_image tool, do you want to take a look? ^^
