10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I just created a css directory and move the halloween.css inside, then just : https://ptpb.pw/V-Zo
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yo just saw the ddnet-web repo. Like wtf how does the website even work ðŸ˜„
11:39 <+Learath2> Most of it is generated by python every couple of minutes
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> images and scripts in the root directory, spaghetti code everywhere, random php and js in template files
11:40 <+Learath2> It's a bit of a mess yeah
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> yea ok I understand still as a webdev I feel offended
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> yea ok I understand still as a webdev I feel offended haha
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> better than most modern websites that load 50 MB of code from 30 domains ðŸ˜„
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but if you can improve it, then sure, go ahead
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> true like the cnn website is heavier than the original doom game was ðŸ˜„

16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ninja> \\\\\\\
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Someone messed with the HUD at the bottom right. In 11.5 its working but building the latest GitHub source doesnt show any tees at the bottom right.
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut that's my client side sorting change, strangely enough
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So you are going to fix it I guess?
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> not sure if i have enoguh time
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i'll try now, if i don't push in a few min then not so soon
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, but someone should then do it before we release the next version :D
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> releasing next version: buggy interface ðŸ‘Œ
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's nearly 2019 and there are still spoofed packets on the net
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The mind boggles
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> IPAC
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> u can't spoof a bird
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way to spoof origin with birds? ðŸ˜„

23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice @deen
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh, we have our first lambda function in ddnet? ðŸ˜„
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 it's nearly 2019 after all :D
23:57 <+Learath2> should we maybe start upgrading the entire thing to modern c++ ?
