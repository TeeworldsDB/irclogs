03:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> LOL
03:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> scutlery is this legit
08:27 < ChillerDragon> elo fellow shell enjoyers! let me share this awesome resource with you https://colors.sh/
08:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh you poor thing
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki 
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mold-2.0-Linker
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye its sad
10:05 < ChillerDragon> can we get mold for ddnet instead of gold?
10:05 < ChillerDragon> i hate gold
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can use mold already
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i do
10:05 < ChillerDragon> pro
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also for all rust links
10:05 < ChillerDragon> why not default
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> because its not as portable
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for example mac has no mold
10:05 < ChillerDragon> fakin gold linker spams so much shit warnings and is slow af
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and windows idk
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gold to lld is a massive speedup
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lld to mold not so much
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i recommend u use lld
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its in more distros
10:06 < ChillerDragon> we did have lld as default
10:06 < ChillerDragon> until some trol added gold to ddnet
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no?
10:06 < ChillerDragon> yes!
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet uses ld by default and then u can configure lld iirc
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway check the ddnet readme
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the flag  is
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> -DFUSE_LD=
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can pass
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lld
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or mold
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> -DFUSE_LD=[OFF|LINKER]
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Linker to use. Default value is OFF to try mold, lld, gold.
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it tries mold first
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then lld
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then gold
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so u have neither mold or lld
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nobo
10:07 < ChillerDragon> wot
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well idk if thats right
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i said it out of my ass
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
10:08 < ChillerDragon> indeed thanks
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did u use the flag
10:08 < ChillerDragon> life changing
10:08 < ChillerDragon> no i installed mold :D 
10:09 < ChillerDragon> i dont want flags i want nice defaults and they are
10:09 < ChillerDragon> for whatever reason i only had gold installed as u said
10:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then its ur fault and only urs
10:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nobo
10:14 < ChillerDragon> did i install gold? o.O
10:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it comes probs by def
10:14 < ChillerDragon> a trap
10:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye idk
10:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would change the default to lld
10:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i saw a link report of some rust program that links llvm
10:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gold lasted 12s
10:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lld 6.6s
10:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mold 6.0s
10:16 < bridge_> <raviesenpai> 6.9s
10:17 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 what do you think about spamming redirect message as long as the client is connected and dropping all other network logic
10:18 < ChillerDragon> oh man idk this is a mess
10:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: that's what a vital message already does
10:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it'll get re-sent every 500ms or 1s IIRC
10:55 < ChillerDragon> yea but then i can avoid putting 100 if statements
10:55 < ChillerDragon> but idk its all trash
10:56 < ChillerDragon> this pr is going to add bugs 
10:56 < ChillerDragon> i did manage to stop sending snaps without additional if statements
10:56 < ChillerDragon> and just drop the connection after 10 seconds
11:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: looks good 🙂
11:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I added two more comments
11:14 < ChillerDragon> pog 
11:15 < ChillerDragon> at least one of us thinks its good xd
11:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 😄
11:18 < ChillerDragon> how do i even get the port the server is running on? ``Config()->m_SvPort`` might be outdated
11:19 < ChillerDragon> i guess ``m_NetServer``s binaddr
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/570/view/3640648066072340345?l=english
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a technical dota bloh
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> blog
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with code
11:28 < ChillerDragon> blog ends with "see you on github" axaxax baited me into thinking dota went open source
11:28 < ChillerDragon> but these trols only have a bug tracker there
12:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: added a README.md to libtw2
12:07 < ChillerDragon> poggers
12:07 < ChillerDragon> woah so much text
12:09 < ChillerDragon> thanks for the shoutout uwu
12:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you're welcome, your docs seem useful 🙂
12:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> link?
12:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> readme? https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2 chillerdragon's docs? ctrl-f chillerdragon
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
12:58 < ChillerDragon> it also includes ryo shoutout!
13:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i need to redo my rustyman
13:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my problem was that i tried to generalize it
13:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but tw is a specific impl i think
13:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill just make it tw focused
13:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> still salty that ChillerDragon favors your rust huffman crate over mine 😄
13:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> after your comment I checked, your crate doesn't seem to provide access to ddnet's frequency table currently, so you can't do teeworlds huffman compression out of the box
13:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk why he does either
13:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think it doesnt even work properly xd
13:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think he favours my python huffman one
13:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not the rust one
13:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/TeeAI/blob/master/engine/huffman.py
13:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this
13:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> when i didnt know rust xd
13:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> actually if it doesnt have bugs imho its nice to have as a reference
13:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill use it to redo my rust one
13:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the bubble_sort is funny
13:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk why its there
13:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki here: https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/fundamentals.html#huffman
13:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i see yeah
13:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is making 1req/s to github acceptable?
13:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> to do ~500.000 requests
13:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not the api?
13:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would just check the rate so cloudflare doesnt ratelimit u
13:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but idk if they use cloudflare
13:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the API is fine, too
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting
13:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I want to check whether the top-level directory has a Cargo.lock/Cargo.toml for 500.000 repos
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> User access token requests are limited to 5,000 requests per hour and per authenticated user.
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 1.38 per seq
13:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so 1/s seems to be okay
13:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks!
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
13:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ye
13:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe the api even allows querying multiple at a time
13:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but idk
13:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u probs want to use this https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-repository-content
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yep, also found that 🙂
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I also created a personal access token
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/trees?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-tree
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or maybe this
13:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> only want top-level Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock
13:50 < ChillerDragon> > still salty that ChillerDragon favors your rust huffman crate over mine 😄
13:51 < ChillerDragon> im very shallow
13:51 < ChillerDragon> if it has good marketing im in
13:51 < ChillerDragon> readme all the way
13:51 < ChillerDragon> i have to admit i never tried ryos thing and use your python lib and it works very good!
13:52 < ChillerDragon> > actually if it doesnt have bugs imho its nice to have as a reference
13:52 < ChillerDragon> it has bugs
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pr fix thanks
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:52 < ChillerDragon> i pr the issue :D
13:53 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/edg-l/TeeAI/pull/9
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and cant u pr the fix? xd
13:53 < ChillerDragon> no
13:53 < ChillerDragon> im not a huffman dev
13:53 < ChillerDragon> certified compression developer
13:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: did you read that rustyman currently doesn't provide tw huffman compression out of the box btw? why not link both? :p
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye link to heinrich one
13:54 < ChillerDragon> yes i just saw that message and thats news to me
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mine is not good yet
13:54 < ChillerDragon> ima nuke out buggy ryo
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how is it news
13:54 < ChillerDragon> i didnt know
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i told u several times xdd
13:54 < ChillerDragon> i didnt listen several times xdd
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki below ChillerDragon's changes, you can see
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```py
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> # TODO: this currently hangs
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> # def test_huffman_empty():
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> #     huffman.decompress(b'')
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
13:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess you were already aware of the issue at some point 😄
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh lol
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
13:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how would  you write a github scraper doing 500000 requests to github?
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with rust
13:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> quick python script, probably?
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the rust library is quite good
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its well typed
13:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't need typing, I need a http request
13:56 < ChillerDragon> why u scarping gh
13:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> plus json
13:56 < ChillerDragon> scarping xd
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/xampprocky/octocrab
13:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-repos wanted to update this repo
13:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> due to this: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-repos/issues/65 😄
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> let octocrab = octocrab::instance();
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> // Returns the first page of all issues.
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> let mut page = octocrab
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .issues("XAMPPRocky", "octocrab")
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .list()
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     // Optional Parameters
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .creator("XAMPPRocky")
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .state(params::State::All)
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .per_page(50)
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .send()
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     .await?;
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> // Go through every page of issues. Warning: There's no rate limiting so
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> // be careful.
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> loop {
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     for issue in &page {
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         println!("{}", issue.title);
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     }
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     page = match octocrab
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         .get_page::<models::issues::Issue>(&page.next)
13:57 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 when you script is done and need someone to split the load to i can run it a bit from my ip too
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         .await?
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     {
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         Some(next_page) => next_page,
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         None => break,
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     }
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think it handles ratelimiting
13:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Warning: There's no rate limiting so be careful.
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt read
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just like typed
13:58 < ChillerDragon> cant the api list files of a repo?
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and well i prefer doing my side projects in rust
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im biased
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but python probs has a rly good library
13:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: it can. that's what I planned to do
13:58 < ChillerDragon> also fyi @heinrich5991 githubs new search is super good maybe that also does the job already
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can go the lightweight way and use https://github.com/algesten/ureq
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> without async
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> since its 1 per seq anyway
14:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> basically request https://api.github.com/repos/{user}/{repo}/contents/, check if the JSON contains the files "Cargo.lock"/"Cargo.toml"
14:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> basically request https://api.github.com/repos/\{user\}/\{repo\}/contents/, check if the JSON contains the files "Cargo.lock"/"Cargo.toml"
14:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> basically request `https://api.github.com/repos/user/repo/contents/`, check if the JSON contains the files "Cargo.lock"/"Cargo.toml"
14:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yea, sounds sensible
14:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> let's see what I'll do in the end
14:02 < ChillerDragon> heinrich the thing is that if i link https://github.com/edg-l/rustyman it shows a readme with example and that it is on crates.io on the top right
14:02 < bridge_> <learath2> I've been trying to move to Rust with these but this is one case where not having rigid types makes prototyping much faster. BeautifulSoup and requests is still my goto
14:02 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/huffman
14:02 < ChillerDragon> this has no readme no example no install section and just looks spooky
14:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> seems like marketing is important for a compression function
14:03 < ChillerDragon> also ofc just use ``curl`` and ``jq`` the only acceptable tools for api usage
14:03 < bridge_> <learath2> If you aren't parsing thru html though I'd still go with rust
14:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Or maybe a shell script if it's simple enough yeah. Jq is a beast
14:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not parsing html
14:04 < ChillerDragon> lerato gets it
14:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but parsing and rewriting csv, I think shell is a no-go
14:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, then yeah, no shell
14:04 < ChillerDragon> bash can do csv nativley
14:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i laughed hard at this
14:04 < bridge_> <learath2> If you arent parsing html I guess just flip a coin and pick rust or python 😄
14:05 < ChillerDragon> ``while IFS=, read -r col1 col2 col3; do echo "$col1"; done < file.csv``
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why dont make it fun, do it in nasm
14:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I prefer to use a library for CSV so I don't fuck up quoting
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or lisp
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or nim
14:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> want to get it done as fast and painless as possible
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or zig
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah ok
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then i would do rust cuz its the one i have most recent
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> Doing this kind of high level task in asm is just pure pain
14:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well it indeed can be a learning experience
14:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> try implementing TLS first 😄
14:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wanted to do advent of code in nasm, but i stopped somehow
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> It'll just be a pain 😄
14:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill try this year too
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd definitely just call into a library for that
14:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well using nasm doesnt mean u cant link a library
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> It's a bit of cheating
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it will certainly compile fast
14:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I tried doing it, but I got stuck on microoptimisations I knew a rust compiler would do
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> faster than c i think
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or is nasm slow compiling?
14:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I have no clue
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would guess assembly is quite easy to parse and put together
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it should map nicely right
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the lowering
14:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i see
14:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess I'd need a tutorial on software development in assembly first
14:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> such a thing probably exists somewhere
14:08 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1690459713.png
14:08 < ChillerDragon> get pingerd
14:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> writing the libtw2 repo readme took ~2 hours btw
14:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't think I'm going to write a huffman readme
14:10 < ChillerDragon> omagawd
14:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'dd hope people using rust know how to include a library
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nasm has one
14:10 < ChillerDragon> yes libtw2 readme has a epic extend
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not oficially i mean
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it has tuts around
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://asmtutor.com/
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> those 2 are nice i think
14:11 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 you overcomplicate it by nesting it in libtw2 what do i even search for on crates.io? libtw2 or huffman?
14:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's not on crates.io
14:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this revived my interest in learning nasm xd
14:11 < ChillerDragon> another marketing flop
14:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> seems like heinrich needs to learn dev marketing
14:11 < ChillerDragon> indeed
14:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the top thing to do is put some emojis
14:12 < ChillerDragon> yes
14:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ⛈️
14:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> blazing
14:12 < ChillerDragon> blazingly safe huffman :fire: :rocket:
14:12 < ChillerDragon> FIRST 10 INSTALLS GET AN AMAZON VOUCHER
14:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not a permalink btw 😉
14:13 < ChillerDragon> i know
14:13 < ChillerDragon> it auto adapts to you adding a readme
14:13 < ChillerDragon> :p
14:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it autoadapts to the repo owner moving it around
14:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> to a 404
14:13 < ChillerDragon> you better not
14:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xD
14:13 < ChillerDragon> bad for marketing
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rustyman is a good marketing name
14:14 < ChillerDragon> yes
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> heinrich can use: heinman

14:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
14:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon du bist der ausgewählte man
14:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess u mean as
14:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> "one's best friend"
14:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ones
14:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki man of culture. When do you tell a fun fact about Catalan language
14:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know one
14:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lot of culture for some reason revolves around shitting
14:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caganer
14:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The Caganer, by creating faeces, is fertilizing the Earth. According to the ethnographer Joan Amades, it was a "customary figure in nativity scenes [pessebres] in the 19th century, because people believed that this deposit [symbolically] fertilized the ground of the nativity scenes, which became fertile and ensured the nativity scene for the following year, and with it, the health of body and peace of mind required to make the nativity scene, wi
14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf
14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I didn't expect such a fun fact xd
14:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is also this
14:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%C3%B3_de_Nadal
14:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its like our version of santa
14:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a log that shits presents
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i swear catalan is smth else
14:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Everything is around shitting
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the kids hit it
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with a stick
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xddd
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> atleast u can say we are original
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and didnt copy the american thing
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think some northern countries do smth with a sheep
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
14:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> They hit a piece of tree with a stick.. how barbaric
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdddd

14:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i admit i was tricked into doing this when i was a kid
14:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> actually kids love doing it
14:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Looks bit psycho but if it makes them happy lmao
14:35 < ChillerDragon> lmao
14:42 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topfschlagen
14:42 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> this is what we did at kids when someone had birthday xD
14:43 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> as kids*

14:45 < ChillerDragon> real footage from jopsti childhood
14:46 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i hit the girls early, ya know
14:46 < ChillerDragon> :D
15:31 < bridge_> <teero777> with the stick? xD
15:31 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> with my stick yes
16:43 < ChillerDragon> i wanna build r/place and am wondering how to store the pixels. I went with a relational database and have every pixel be a row with x and y and realized how stupid that is since they should overwrite each other.
16:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> totally right solution
16:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> who would use 2d arrays for that
16:49 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: RGB field = new RGB[Width * Height]
16:53 < ChillerDragon> which then lives where?
16:53 < ChillerDragon> in the ram?
16:53 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> u can put it where u want lmao
16:53 < ChillerDragon> im asking you
16:53 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> but yes, RAM makes most sense
16:54 < ChillerDragon> but is it web scale?
16:54 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> defs
16:54 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> if smth scales on web, then it's ram
16:54 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> xd
16:54 < ChillerDragon> hm i wanted to use a database -.-
16:54 < ChillerDragon> due to sharing
16:54 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> u can periodically save it to a database
16:54 < ChillerDragon> sharding*
16:54 < ChillerDragon> might as well perdiodically save it as a bitmap image to my disk
16:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yes, that's probably better
16:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> xd
16:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> but you wanted to use a database
16:55 < ChillerDragon> that seems to be the flaw here doesnt it
16:55 < ChillerDragon> db is cool for pixel history and metadata such as placer
16:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> ah yeah u need a history
16:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> u can do that in a db
16:56 < ChillerDragon> you mean unrelated?
16:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yes
16:56 < ChillerDragon> hm
16:56 < ChillerDragon> so secure blockchain history
16:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yes
16:56 < ChillerDragon> and blazingly fast webscale ram bitmaps?
16:57 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yes very super fast webscale rust RAM bitmaps
16:57 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> blazingly blaze

17:12 < bridge_> <hus3h> ChillerDragon
17:12 < bridge_> <hus3h> > a row with x and y and realized how stupid that is since they should overwrite each other
17:12 < bridge_> <hus3h> Why not? You can keep a row for each pixel submission and use only the latest for the actual canvas (group by + order by for example), this way you have a history of every pixel at any time and you can also use the data for user cooldown
17:13 < bridge_> <deen> There's some repressed flag usage ambitions in Germany probably since we don't use German flags in every day occurrences 😄
17:15 < ws-client1> <Jupstar > @hus3h but is it webscale to access every pixel in the database everytime someone reads the canvas? xd
17:16 < ws-client1> <Jupstar > i'd at least somehow have a copy of the current canvas in ram
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What, you don't have a ger flag magnet on your door frame like me? xd
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Next to ddnet magnet btw
17:21 < bridge_> <hus3h> Jupstar: all depends on how serious the project is 😄  reading every pixel at some point will become a problem of course, memory + separate log sounds good
17:47 < bridge_> <gumbatw> [feature request] clown emote
18:04 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i fix this
18:05 < bridge_> <yakupie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134154479193817158/image.png

18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so dunno if anybody can help you
18:10 < bridge_> <teero777> you can upgrade for free to windows 10 from windows 7
18:10 < bridge_> <yakupie> my system doesnt good at win 10
18:10 < bridge_> <teero777> then use linux ig?
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont know any pc that cant run 64bit 😄
18:10 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro how can i open linux in 32 bit 🤨
18:11 < bridge_> <yakupie> my pc's can not :8
18:11 < bridge_> <yakupie> if i insult my country president i will get banned?

18:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> average salary is 400 dolar
18:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> and 1 water bottle like 1-2 dolar
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did u get the client from ddnet.org/downloads?
18:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> yep
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> weird, bcs apparently the issue is that vsc redistributables are missing
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but ddnet's official builds dont use them
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.org/downloads/DDNet-17.1.1-win32.zip
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> this?
18:14 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye
18:14 < bridge_> <yakupie> i think in my pc doesnt have any c++
18:14 < bridge_> <yakupie> so i cant open .dll files
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well ddnet itself doesnt need it
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> let me check if its the discord api
18:15 < bridge_> <yakupie> what does it mean
18:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> issues says "api-ms-win-crt-string-l1-1-0.dll" is doesnt have in your pc
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> symsrv.dll is the problem
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> let me see where its from
18:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> what is the symsrc.dll
18:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah
18:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see
18:17 < bridge_> <yakupie> i dont understand anything 😢
18:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 dont we build the dbg stuff in gcc?

18:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> delete exchndl.dll
18:18 < bridge_> <yakupie> in files?
18:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
18:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe there is an issue with linking to the MSVC dlls
18:18 < bridge_> <yakupie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134157957374947369/image.png

18:30 < ChillerDragon> @hus3h yeah like jopsti said its slow. And that not even in theory with 10 pixels set on a 50x50 grid my current implementation query every pixel indivdually
18:30 < bridge_> <yakupie> anyways can anybody says a anime name have cool mc
18:30 < ChillerDragon> thats 2500 sql queries
18:30 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro im 15

18:45 < bridge_> <yakupie> and php
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice
18:45 < bridge_> <yakupie> and html css but ita not a programming language
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> see you know more than most ppl already
18:46 < bridge_> <yakupie> its my dream too but in my country its so hard to make
18:46 < bridge_> <yakupie> listen a 8gb ram average pc is 30-40k Tl

18:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> looks better than anything i've ever done for web xD
18:54 < bridge_> <yakupie> i started a year ago in web
18:55 < bridge_> <yakupie> but in ny country have a big eartquake issues
18:55 < bridge_> <yakupie> i dont make any website for a long ago

18:55 < bridge_> <yakupie> my pcs doesnt good
18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its good enough
18:55 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro i cant openning vsc
18:56 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro i cant open vsc
18:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> use notepad++
18:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> linux uses less ram
18:56 < bridge_> <yakupie> i need use xammp for phpmyadmin
18:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u use i3wm even less
18:56 < bridge_> <yakupie> and ill get issues like .ddl for xampp too
18:57 < bridge_> <yakupie> i have 2gb ram and i think its working slow for win
18:57 < bridge_> <yakupie> windows*
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u dont need xampp to code websites
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> code a game using canvas, javascript, webgl
18:58 < bridge_> <yakupie> i need bcs of php and mysql
18:58 < bridge_> <yakupie> if you need make a login system you ll need xampp
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you can try to code your own webserver using rust
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then u dont need xampp and learn a lot
18:59 < bridge_> <matodor> try laragon
18:59 < bridge_> <matodor> try laragon (https://laragon.org/index.html)
18:59 < bridge_> <yakupie> oh thx
19:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> im gonna buy a new pc like 2 years later bcs of my univercity
19:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> so im trying be better at programming in 2 yeaes
19:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> so im trying be better at programming in 2 years
19:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u start today, u the best in your university
19:01 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro i cant use python or something
19:01 < bridge_> <yakupie> i can use only html css js
19:01 < bridge_> <yakupie> bcs of my pc
19:01 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i be better like this shits
19:02 < bridge_> <gerdoe> write in pure c
19:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> use rust
19:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i started coding with a computer worse than yours
19:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so thats not an excuse
19:02 < bridge_> <yakupie> ow
19:02 < bridge_> <yakupie> i wanna make a website for watch series or film like my projects and upload that github
19:03 < bridge_> <yakupie> but i know front end dev is gonna suck later
19:03 < bridge_> <yakupie> i need know c and java like languages
19:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep
19:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> if you really only have 2GB of ram then using Linux is the best option outright
19:04 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i download that
19:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> do you have another computer
19:04 < bridge_> <yakupie> nope
19:04 < bridge_> <yakupie> and what does rust mean
19:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> rust is a programming language
19:04 < bridge_> <yakupie> i never heard this
19:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe you can buy some ddr2 or ddr3 for cheap. anything that was made with 2GB is probably old enough to have replaceable memory xd
19:05 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro this issues not from me
19:05 < bridge_> <yakupie> its a issues with country
19:05 < bridge_> <matodor> learn php + mysql, you can easily find a job afterwards
19:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://rustup.rs/
19:05 < bridge_> <yakupie> wait i need check best cheap pc in my country and you can understand
19:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> are you saying you can't get more memory in your country or what
19:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> a 2GB stick of DDR3 is probably like $10
19:05 < bridge_> <yakupie> its so expensive
19:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> ah
19:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
19:06 < bridge_> <yakupie> 8gb ram average laptop in my country like 30-40K TL
19:06 < bridge_> <yakupie> and in my country take 10K tl per month
19:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> but what about the memory itself
19:06 < bridge_> <gerdoe> what laptop do you have rn
19:06 < bridge_> <gerdoe> can you add some so-dimms
19:06 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> turkish lira?
19:07 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye i can but im gonna buy a new pc 2 years later for univercity
19:07 < bridge_> <yakupie> yep
19:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> sometimes i forget rust is an actual thing
19:07 < bridge_> <gerdoe> so-dimm ddrX are cheap af
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> btw that are 1350€ lmao 
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what laptop do you want to buy
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> alienware?
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> buy a desktop pc for 200€
19:07 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro in turkiye 1350 euro is insanse
19:08 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro in turkiye 1350 euro is insane
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> even in europe that is insane
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> thats highend prices
19:08 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i was gonna say, i sadly cant atm but find a person from overseas you trust to just buy you one, if i were to buy that here and ship that to you, that would save you (if the 30-K TL are accurate).. 29.500K
19:09 < bridge_> <yakupie> its not trustly
19:09 < bridge_> <yakupie> i know that
19:09 < bridge_> <yakupie> its like fake credit card method
19:09 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> you know how much general shipping from germany to turkey is?
19:09 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i might just sent you old one's i have flying around, i dont need em anymore anyway
19:10 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> if your system supports DDR3 that is
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> when i look at turkish amazon
19:10 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro im 15 years how can i take xd lmao
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i find pcs for 9000 TL
19:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't think he even needs a new pc necessarily
19:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> just ram
19:10 < bridge_> <yakupie> can you send a link
19:10 < bridge_> <gerdoe> yeah same
19:10 < bridge_> <yakupie> no my processor is bad too
19:10 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i think his laptop also has possibility of cpu upgrade
19:11 < bridge_> <yakupie> its not laptop
19:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> huh
19:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> send specs
19:11 < bridge_> <gerdoe> what is it then
19:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> a toaster
19:11 < bridge_> <yakupie> desktop?
19:11 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye its true
19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.amazon.com.tr/Dark-Teknobiyotik-Masa%C3%BCst%C3%BC-Bilgisayar-DK-PC-HB2200G/dp/B09CGT348Z/

19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> from amazon directly
19:11 < bridge_> <yakupie> look that shit
19:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> OMG
19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so no cam
19:11 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> what the
19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so no scam
19:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> not even a duo
19:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> jesus
19:12 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @robyt3 whats the best place to store constants like the max/min zoom levels?
19:12 < bridge_> <matodor> @yakupie just use remote pc )))
19:12 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ywkup just get a raspberry man, that would be easier than upgrading that system
19:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> i believe those are baked into the zoom fns as is
19:12 < bridge_> <matodor> Remote Desktop Protocol
19:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> im gonna it but currently in turkiye 1 dolar is 30TL
19:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> its insane
19:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> Are they used more than once? I think it's fine if they are just magic values passed to the constructor of your zoom helper object.
19:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> imagine in turkiye you can eat a dinnet with 1 dolar
19:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> but we cant
19:13 < bridge_> <yakupie> imagine in turkiye you can eat a dinner with 1 dolar
19:13 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or get smth like this ywkup: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6B26HQD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=U93J19PME8U6&keywords=office+pc&qid=1690477982&sprefix=office+pc+%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1
19:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> we can't anywhere else either
19:13 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> around 2.7K TL
19:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> $1 dinner is crazy
19:14 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i remember going to turkey for vacation, with minimum wage in germany you feel like a god over there
19:14 < bridge_> <yakupie> average a chips for like 0.5 cent
19:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> huh
19:14 < bridge_> <yakupie> so much ppl make it
19:14 < bridge_> <matodor> google: Windows VPS servers with testing period
19:14 < bridge_> <matodor> and setup their as dev machine 😄
19:14 < bridge_> <gerdoe> lga775
19:14 < bridge_> <marmare_314> No they are used more than once, I could also implement a getter though
19:15 < bridge_> <gerdoe> you can upgrade your system if you have any money xd
19:15 < bridge_> <marmare_314> No they are used more than once, I could also implement a getter function though
19:15 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, storing them in the helper objects and adding getters seems good
19:15 < bridge_> <yakupie> i think firstly i need escape this shit country
19:15 < bridge_> <yakupie> i need swim blacksea and im gonna russia .d
19:15 < bridge_> <gerdoe> xd
19:15 < bridge_> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/795332400233578548/815933892493312000/806823636933410846.gif
19:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> come to germany!
19:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> where can i get $0.005 chips
19:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> on all streets
19:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> come turkiye with 1000 euro you can be god in here
19:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have like $42 rn
19:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> total
19:16 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> stop flexin
19:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134172501476388974/image.png
19:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> look that shit
19:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> ouch
19:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> we re running with zimbabve :8
19:17 < bridge_> <marmare_314> they were, but I did some refactoring
19:17 < bridge_> <yakupie> i heard france inflation get +1% and ppl go streets
19:17 < bridge_> <yakupie> why in here we get +74% and still same president wtf
19:18 < bridge_> <gerdoe> some funny factors :troll:
19:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> while you're at it can you make it not do that silly one-way number conversion from a console zoom value to a real zoom factor
19:19 < bridge_> <deen> We do have someone in our community from Venezuela too btw
19:19 < bridge_> <gerdoe> anyway google lga775 replacements
19:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> that poor guy 😮
19:20 < bridge_> <yakupie> what does it mean
19:20 < bridge_> <gerdoe> your motherboard/cpu socket
19:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> get a cheap quad core intel 2
19:20 < bridge_> <gerdoe> waiting another year just to get pc sucks
19:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or a xeon
19:20 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro its 20 euro lmao xddd
19:20 < bridge_> <yakupie> IM GONNA MAKE A TOAST FROM MY PC
19:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> send video when it happens
19:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 🙂
19:21 < bridge_> <yakupie> firstly i need open ddne
19:21 < bridge_> <yakupie> firstly i need open ddnet
19:21 < bridge_> <gerdoe> you can make money out of this year if you will work as webdev
19:21 < bridge_> <gerdoe> (i think)
19:21 < bridge_> <yakupie> and i need salam
19:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> the og is pretty much like `m_Zoom = pow(ZoomStep, g_Config.m_ClDefaultZoom - 10)`
19:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> if `ZoomStep = std::cos((30.0f * pi) / 180.0f)` (about 0.866025, the constant the game uses)
19:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> then u can reverse it w this
19:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> `m_ConsoleZoom = std::log(m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom * std::pow(ZoomStep, 10)) / std::log(ZoomStep)`
19:21 < bridge_> <yakupie> im 15 i think i cant
19:21 < bridge_> <yakupie> if im go univercity i ll make it
19:21 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> you can make a good amount of cheap bucks from overseas even as a 15 y/o
19:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> LOL
19:22 < bridge_> <yakupie> my parents....
19:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> that is genuinely bad advice
19:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> wa
19:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> go to uni bro. get smart
19:22 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i have an ukrainian friend who made some tg play-a-toy bot and now he's earning like 200-500k per month
19:22 < bridge_> <gerdoe> (rubles)
19:22 < bridge_> <gerdoe> he was 15 at that moment
19:22 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro its insane too
19:22 < bridge_> <yakupie> if i have good system too. I ll make it
19:23 < bridge_> <matodor> @yakupie ❗ ❗ ❗ 
19:23 < bridge_> <matodor> 
19:23 < bridge_> <matodor> > google: Windows VPS servers with testing period
19:23 < bridge_> <matodor> > and setup their as dev machine
19:23 < bridge_> <yakupie> i have a project for python
19:23 < bridge_> <gerdoe> yeah thats why we are telling you to check out some ddr3 memory and better lga775 cpu
19:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> btw if u can run ddnet u can run python xd
19:24 < bridge_> <yakupie> on 5fps lmao
19:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> @marmare_314 Want me to review and merge #6923 or #6872 first? I assume it will cause conflicts either way
19:24 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> when i was like 14-15 i roamed forum's for people requesting like web designs and shi. i made like 20-30€ "only" in total
19:24 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6923
19:24 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6872
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u didnt want to fix xd
19:24 < bridge_> <gerdoe> xd
19:24 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> but 20-30€ converted would be a lot for him wouldnt it
19:24 < bridge_> <yakupie> stfu you re hacker
19:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmao
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i never denied that
19:24 < bridge_> <yakupie> no you did it
19:24 < bridge_> <gerdoe> jupacker
19:25 < bridge_> <yakupie> this guy try hack me
19:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Jupstar beeing the founder of every hack client ddnet has ever seen
19:25 < bridge_> <gerdoe> hupstar
19:25 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye he's own of tesla
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'm elon musk
19:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> wait Jupstar you telling me you didnt gift me a tesla out of love, but you own that?
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now it's out
19:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> gawd damn man i thought we had smth
19:25 < bridge_> <yakupie> he s a factory of tesla didnt one
19:26 < bridge_> <marmare_314> They should not conflict, the grid code is just one big block at the start of the the envelope editor function. But just in case do 6872 first
19:26 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye you need send me 100 dolar and ill become rich
19:26 < bridge_> <marmare_314> They should not conflict, the grid code is just one big block at the start of the the envelope editor function. But just in case do 6872 first @robyt3
19:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> marmare did u see my msgs
19:27 < bridge_> <yakupie> so im gonna download linux?
19:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> @yakupie if you're not familiar with it, it might be more trouble than it's worth
19:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> since it's hard to go back. you will have to wipe your drive
19:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> and the installation is usually painless but on such old hardware it would be stupid not to expect some sort of failure
19:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> and with no backup pc to save, you will be screwed if it does mess up
19:28 < bridge_> <yakupie> i think i need go html,css,js for 2 years
19:28 < bridge_> <yakupie> bcs i dont have to make
19:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> u mean compile or what
19:29 < bridge_> <yakupie> my pc doesnt open react or angular like
19:29 < bridge_> <yakupie> only can i go with web dev
19:30 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> vue?
19:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> even if vue did  work that's sidestepping the problem
19:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> hmm true
19:31 < bridge_> <yakupie> im good at html css js too
19:31 < bridge_> <yakupie> i wanna learn other things
19:31 < bridge_> <yakupie> .
19:31 < bridge_> <yakupie> its my projects for web
19:32 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> other things in terms of other programming languages?
19:32 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye
19:32 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> try out lua/luascript?
19:32 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Not sure what you mean
19:32 < bridge_> <yakupie> what does it for
19:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> luascript is a pretty lightweight scripting language
19:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> has C like syntax aswell, so easy to get used to
19:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> when you do `zoom+` or `zoom-` in the console, it takes your number and puts into a function that outputs a better number for math when rendering (`m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom`)
19:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> but that's silly, this number should be calculated & cached by the code using it & m_Zoom should instead be that console value, imo
19:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> but a way to sidestep the problem is to apply this other fn whenever you want the console zoom value, using m_Zoom as input
19:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> i needed this when showing zoom level in the hud for example. but it would be good in general if you are refactoring zoom code
19:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is the math
19:35 < bridge_> <yakupie> what can i make with lua for web dev
19:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> ❌
19:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk why you suggest something like luascript which the industry doesn't know or care for at all. python would probably be your best bet given your current experience
19:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's not gonna be fast but it should run
19:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> as someone looking for a job you want the lowest common denominator skills
19:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> you can always get into niches later
19:36 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i suggested it because his system is garbage and lua is actually embedded in a lot of stuff 😮
19:37 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Oh sorry did not see that message either 😄 you have to ping me xd
19:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> understandable
19:38 < bridge_> <marmare_314> It was a refactoring to make the code reusable, I did not change much of how it works
19:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> i see
19:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> if you are doing setters and getters, maybe you could do GetRawZoom/GetConZoom using this math?
19:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> there is probably not a need for it anyway
19:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> i just think the way the game does atm is bizarre
19:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> the more i am in this channel, the more i get that i suck at simple c++
19:43 < bridge_> <learath2> It's ok, the first step to proficiency in C++ is to acknowledge you don't know C++
19:43 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lol
19:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> that is so true
19:44 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> you have rawzoom and console zoom, and you want to update both whenever the zoom changes, did i get that part right? lol
19:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> not really i just want con zoom to be available
19:44 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ah
19:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> without having to reverse some dumb math
19:45 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Im not really sure thats the best way since the current implementation is more like a smooth value and less specific to zoom. For example in my envelope zooming code this value represents the valuerange which fits on screen, while in the mapview it represents the inverse of something (which is probably where the logs come from). So imo SetConZoom is too specific in order to add it to this class
19:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> niches are what pay the most tho
19:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe we are talking about something else
19:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which is why im glad i know mlir
19:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is true but it's much harder to even find a position for a niche, let alone be hired for one if you're 15 and have no experience (or more realistically, a few years older and fresh out of college)
19:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true true xd
19:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u also need basic xp
19:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
19:46 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> how dare you be 15 without 20 years of experience
19:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe we are not talking about the same thing
19:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> I wouldn't think of working at 15
19:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> I would learn ye
19:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
19:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i would think more about going out
19:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> friends wtc
19:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
19:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
19:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> those guys just disappear
19:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur 15 only once
19:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i started coding with 16, and now i am old with no friends and still cant code
19:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sounds sad
19:51 < bridge_> <marmare_314> You want a function to get this value right? `m_ConsoleZoom = std::log(m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom * std::pow(ZoomStep, 10)) / std::log(ZoomStep)`
19:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i can code and still got like 5 real friends
19:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> stop flexing 😦
19:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> not necessarily, just a way to get the console zoom value after it's set
19:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> the best way may just be to rename `m_Zoom` to `m_RawZoom` (or leave it) and add `m_ConsoleZoom` to `CCamera`
19:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> i used that math to avoid such a refactor
19:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it's not ideal
19:57 < bridge_> <marmare_314> oh alright, seems like a lot of effort to keep two values with the same information
19:57 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Also I refactored the editor zooming code btw, I think these are separate
19:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
19:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> i thought we may be talking about different things
19:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> had i done this from scratch i probably would have preserved m_Zoom as the console zoom & used `pow(ZoomStep, g_Config.m_ClDefaultZoom - 10)` whenever i needed to do math using this value
19:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> having 2 values for the same thing stinks
19:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> but reversing a formula to get a number we previously had also stinks
20:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> store the scaled consoleZoom seperately?
20:02 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> idk if i understand anything here btw
20:02 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> im just trying to throw my shit in
20:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> it would be the same amount of overhead to calculate & store this value locally as it is to calculate it & store it that way rn. difference is then we wouldn't need to reverse it when getting the con zoom
20:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea this is that idea @blaiszephyr
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can't ping you easily lol
20:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> yeah my name sucks
20:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i am changing it the moment i reach 3K ingame lmao
20:04 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> aight so.. just leave it? 😄
20:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> i guess
20:05 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or you might just dump it all and have conZoom calculated on the getgo by multiplying the rawzoom by the math factor lol
20:05 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> no 2 vaules of the same thing i guess
20:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's what i did
20:05 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> well fuck me then
20:05 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Lol
20:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> and it's not a factor necessarily it's a whole function
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> it stinks
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> to have seemingly irrelevant math like that just chilling in your code
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> would much rather have it in the camera code but w/e
20:07 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> understandable
20:09 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> only thing i could think of is to have a lookup table mapping rawZoom to ConZoom, but that seems like to much i think lol
20:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> i would be content with a getter w/ this fn. but ideally m_Zoom would be console zoom and it would be turned to the way it is already only as needed
20:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> but this is like really not relevant or needed atm, and such a small amount of overhead to calculate con zoom as needed (which is nowhere in ddnet code atm lol)
20:14 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lol
20:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> its fun having a thought process about it tho
20:15 < bridge_> <chairn> you heard shit then, inflation is around 7% and people went to street for defending retirement system, not for inflation
20:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> having an irritating data tearing issue it seems
20:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> i went through and looked and it seems that anything i'm doing on the other thread(s) would be entirely function-local and, if using game APIs, wouldn't access any persistent data
20:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> but the one place that i do have cross-thread data access, i am locking and still getting data tearing
20:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> not to mention it is terribly slow. i may have to rethink it instead of just mutexing and praying
20:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> actually it might not be a tearing issue but it's either a runtime panic or a mysterious crash originating from graphics code. which makes me think heap corruption or something
20:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> error in memory allocation may be?
21:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> like what?
21:04 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> game crashing because it tries to keep the brush for some reason with an externally added tileset, which gets removed upon creating a new map
21:04 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> so it rips itself apart
21:04 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thinking it could be that because it doesnt happen with embedded game tile's for example
21:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think we are talking about different stuff
21:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> sweet
21:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> this should also allow for probing file size larger than short max
21:25 < bridge_> <robyt3> short max? should be at least int max right now?
21:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't remember exactly
21:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> there's some limitation
21:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah i think it is int max
21:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk why i thoought short max
21:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> `fseek` limitation is `int`
21:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> `SetFilePointer` has a really weird interface to handle 64 bit size
21:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can't see any use of lock_trylock from system xd
21:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can't find any existing uses of lock_trylock from system xd
21:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> the system lock functions should probably be removed if they're not being used anywhere, in favor of stdlib locks
21:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> They probably are mostly wrapped with `CLockScope`
21:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> i looked for references but none came up outside of their defs & declarations system cpp/h
21:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe i should double check
21:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> also could be code model issue
21:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh it seems only lock_trylock is unused
21:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Which one? `lock_trylock` is indeed unused, there other ones not
21:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
21:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> my bad i didn't look thoroughlyt
21:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> my bad i didn't look thoroughly
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> i didn't look, what is CLockScope?
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> is that like lock_guard?
22:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, it's a RAII wrapper for `lock_wait` and `lock_unlock`
22:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> cool
22:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> though idk why you would bother making such a thing
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> @ ryo how to get into mlir
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> do i need to write noob compiler first before my brain can benefit from that kind of stuff
22:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> is there a graphics mutex already
22:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> hoping i can make this easy on myself
22:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> is there a graphics/textures mutex already
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No
22:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> cool
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> This is also not really desired tbh
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't want to complicate things further
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> it is tricky to offload gpu texture upload to the main thread though
22:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> with how the skin loading works atm
22:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But if the skin textures are prepared on a thread that is already really good tbh
22:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The texture data
22:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> i was very relieved when i found the global namespace LoadPNG
22:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> just had to copy some guts from Graphics' LoadPNG
22:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> the `LoadSkin` overload w/ `CImageInfo` is a life saver as well
23:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> how is the server browser thread(s) indicating to the main thread that their loading has finished?
23:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> or is it just checking every frame
23:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> The main thread has a `shared_ptr` to a subclass of `IJob`, either the sub-thread does the its finishing operation on its own (probably with some synchronization) or the main thread checks if the job is done and then uses the result
23:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> Server browser uses the `OnCompletion` handler I think
23:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> Editor saving uses the other method
23:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> ishould have done a derivative of IJob from the start tbh
23:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> The main thread has a `shared_ptr` to a subclass of `IJob`, either the sub-thread does the finishing operation on its own (probably with some synchronization) or the main thread checks if the job is done and then uses the result
23:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> interested in whether in can make use of OnCompletion without using a job
23:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can run a job blocking
23:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> especially if the listening code isn't a component & can't receive messages or w/e
23:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> it would be cool to be able to notify something in the main thread when another thread exits, though idk if pthread can do that
23:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> looks like OnCompletion is exclusive to http request. hmm
23:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> wdym
23:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ah, yeah I see it right now
23:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can tell when the loading is finished from the other thread, but the problem is that (usually) in order to notify the main thread i'd use whatever subsystem's message implementation
23:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> the finished function now has to be on the main thread so i can upload the textures from the main thread
23:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can tell when the loading is finished from the other thread, but the problem is that (usually) in order to notify the main thread i'd use whatever subsystem's message/events implementation
23:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can keep the data on the job and use in the main thread when the job in finished
23:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk how to use jobs
23:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am using the system threads directly
23:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am using the system.cpp threads directly
23:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> true
23:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> although i can't check for it since there's no listener as this is just a floating class
23:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> not a component or anything
23:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> Check how `m_WriterFinishJobs` is used in the editor
23:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> xd
23:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134236740593389619/image.png
23:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> Your search must be broken
23:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh i had the space in there by mistake
23:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> actually, doesn't make a difference
23:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> what's  a file i can find it referenced in?
23:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you do a text search?
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> In editor.cpp and io.cpp
23:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> that is a text search
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'm just using Sublime Text where it finds this
23:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> game/editor/editor.cpp?
23:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> no dice
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> yes
23:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> weird
23:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> how new is this
23:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> you have been doing editor refactors right
23:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> my fork is a little bit behind atm
23:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think it was released in 17.1 already
23:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> But maybe it was renamed in a later refactoring
23:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Search just for `WriterFinishJobs`
23:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> my editor.cpp is at fcaab778ca8a54a1c71a0d1888030705b92ef736
23:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> from May
23:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> i suppose i will just look on github. i haven't tried their new code model too much
23:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> This creates a job: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/1bb7414b0292f96a074c155cfb80824a8db22efa/src/game/editor/io.cpp#L424-L427
23:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> This checks if the job is done (although it just prints the filename): https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/1bb7414b0292f96a074c155cfb80824a8db22efa/src/game/editor/editor.cpp#L7811-L7814
23:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> ah i didn't want to have to move it over to a job
23:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> okay
23:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think otherwise i'm SOL
23:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh i forgot i'm working in the skins class atm, so it's a component. is there a way to send a 'generic' message & handle it as a component
23:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> well, it works without any tearing in my test (where i manually call the texture upload fn from the main thread using a console command)
23:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> just gotta get it working like how the editor does and it'll be good to start the next step
23:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Che
23:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ...
23:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> So true
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> seems there's still a problem. loading the textures all at once creates a tremendous lag spike w/ my 2000 skins, i guess this should be expected but this is exactly the sort of thing i was trying to avoid. but instead of it happening in the loading screen, now it can potentially happen while in the game
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> i need to load them one-by-one
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> and i know 2000 skins is an edge case but it's bad anyway
