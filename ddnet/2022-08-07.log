02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I finished some final touches! Can anyone here do a double check to see if the SVG matches close enough with the base image? I'll dm the file to whoever
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Love you thanks. That was so fast
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Cool! So you did a svg remake of emotes? Would be nice to add it to the ddnet data svg collection
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Voxel)
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Who do I give the file to for them to add it in/
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Who do I give the file to for them to add it in?
08:27 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel you can give it to Jupstar or me or even upload it your self if you know how to use github https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i can give it to you, since i dont want to do a pull request just for this
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how *can* i give svgs to you
08:29 <+ChillerDragon> i would also just open a pr just for this :D but sure
08:29 <+ChillerDragon> just send it here
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well... fine
08:31 <+ChillerDragon> so? :D
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'm doing it right now
08:32 <+ChillerDragon> a
08:32 <+ChillerDragon> make sure to put it in a new folder and add a license.txt mentioning your self
08:33 <+ChillerDragon> like here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/blob/f37c1bfbf180a0a63a7482fc5d7f9cfd3fa246f1/mapres/license.txt
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i didnt    see you   do that until    i sent the request
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ugh let me update everything rq
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and now for charin to bark at me for having too many commits again :DDDDDD
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I can squash merge so nvm the amount of commits
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh yea, tommorow i think i'll also do particles.png
09:25 <+ChillerDragon> the questionmark emote looks odd
09:25 <+ChillerDragon> its so thin compared to the original
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> isnt that how it is in the original
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :what:
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait.. nooo i forgot to rasterise the question marks
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ill do that tommorow when i also do particles
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> :) 
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> how do you create those btw? You are so fast o.O
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> took me forever to create mine
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> The speech bubbles are pretty much the same except different sizes
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the font is Komika Axis, which i forgot to convert into actual lines with the ???
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> i see
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> but also the mountains and game etc
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh those? i simply traced them in inkscape
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> chillerdragay
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also just a general question, out of curiosity
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how easy would it be to merge the GUI images together? like `demo_buttons`, `demo_buttons_2` and `file_icons`? would it break anything and/or would it be smaller?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> We can probably replace some with font icons
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Then we don't need to care about them anymore
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah, maybe. but right now if we put all 3 files next to each other, i think it looks clean
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005802915769897060/unknown.png
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what font do we even use for icons anyways?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Salmon> looks very nice when the full-fledged merch :poggers:
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Salmon> I think I've already seen pets in one of the clients
