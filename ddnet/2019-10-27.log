00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> @onby ok
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> it says :

00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> and if I Debug it says:
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> " There is no executable File:

00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> I dont understand xd
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Deathman because theres no function in CConsole named Printf
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and no str_find_rev anywhere
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so u should copy these functions too from the console code and idk but probably system.h/system.cpp
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so u should copy these functions too from the console code and idk but probably system.h/system.c
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> @onby
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> @onby oh thx
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> now it debugs and starts but after adding $currentdir nothing happens
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> whats supposed to happen
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> normal start ?
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> only console window open until $currentdir
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> but the game window not opens
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> no error
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk what uve done so xd

01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> idk should i upload to github i dont understand xd
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> hm if i open the exe in out/build/x64debug it closes after i click the texture button
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> is it crashing
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> i think? i just closes
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> i upload to github so you can see.
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> how i upload? xd  i get error 403
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> everything works normal expect it closes when i click the texture button i tried to add
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> am i not allowed to upload to ddnet or so?
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> xd
05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> the crasj error is Exception thrown: read access violation. this was 0x10
05:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> am i not allowed to upload to ddnet github or so?
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> the crasj error is Exception thrown: read access violation. "this" was "0x10"
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> oh ok worked
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I was planning on also adding smart zoom
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and also a feature i thought would be cool
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> depenidn on speedß
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a team zoom
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it zooms out depending how far each meember is
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the camera is centered
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based on players
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if one player is too far then its ignored
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> depending on speed would also be usefull
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u want too see far if u fall down a big part for example
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> to *
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omf why i always put random amount of 'o's in my tooo's
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by team zoom i mean
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> team spec
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you spec a whole team
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the camera smartly shows all players
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they arent too far
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by zooming and centering based on all player positions
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy sounds good
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 idea: if you rework teams, remove the team identifier completely. you join by saying who you want to join or saying that you want to create a new team
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I can do that, after you take a look at my commit and help me address the concern i have with the performance hit of creating a new world
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> blurb
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a negative time budget right now
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 getting rid of the team identifier is a good idea though
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a /teamcreate and a /join
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do you choose the team to join then
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> (team from someone else)
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao you do `/join <the person you want to join>`
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then you can’t have a quick team bind if you play dummy maps anymore
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm yeah that is true
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /teamcreate;/join <mainname>
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dummy switch in between
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then youre forced to play with that name
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, rn you're doomed if you try to join a team which is already occupied
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you also need a seperate dummy team bind
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about making /team with no argument put u in the first empty team
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see no reason to keep team ids
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can have something like a team password or so, but exposing the raw team ID to the players seems like no use
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. you could do /teampw abcdef or so
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but its simple and easy to use
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's awkward and exposes weird server details to the user
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how is it awkward
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do we display a weird number with each team?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why are we only allowed to pick between team 0 to 63?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it was the easiest implementation
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like you cling to it right now instead of trying to improve it(?)
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. the thing I proposed is strictly better, no? "11:10 PM] heinrich5991: e.g. you could do /teampw abcdef or so"
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think its weird
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> same as how team blue and red in vanilla isnt weird
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not team 0 and team 1 ^^
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's how it's implemented
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about arbitrary team identifiers?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but having ddrace teams named after colors would be way too confusing
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because too many options
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A hashmap lookup is O(1)
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or as we'd implement it in teeworlds, O(n^2) is still fine 😛
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm not shying away from stl in this fork 😛
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> next big thing would be "team UI" but that's already doing to much to be viable right now
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *too much to
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I'll touch the client for 0,7 ever
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might try see if I can get the protocol changes into the client we have now
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I don't really see it working out, I don't really feel like developing an entire new client
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd have to revert thousands of lines of UI changes to begin with
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 team ui?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like something to manage the players in your team and stuff? Sounds unnecessary to me tbh
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you go to the menu and see all the teams and click on the one you want  to join or an empty one to join a new one
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why do we have to make everything complicated? /team <number> is fine
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with learath2's hashmap that continues to work to satisfy the users whose workflow has been broken
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with learath2's hashmap, that continues to work to satisfy the users whose workflow has been broken
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For someone saying we have to migrate to 0.7 to get new players, you are clinging onto a rather unintuitive way to join teams 😛
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> New players won't know about the /team command, but an UI is usable by anyone
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't have to have shitty UI 😛
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah a hashmap should work, then we can keep the /team command and use it to create teams and add a new /join command to join the player you want to join
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 If you ever get out of your negative timebudget, help me figure out the cheapest way to populate new CGameWorlds without lagging the server
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> consider caching what it does on initialization and just create them on the fly afterwards
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of having a reference world from which I'd deep copy
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before deciding the command names we should maybe change the vanilla client side command /team
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way oy changes that for us 😄
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oy isnt deciding alone
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> next big thing: remove all chat commands, because they're ugly
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> remove teeworlds
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (not gonna happen as well, but would be nice)
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @Learath2 the client does a deep copy like that for the prediction btw, and it seemed to be quite fast
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love chat commands
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm okay
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gives games that authentic feeling and nostalgia
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> too polished and it feels insincere 😛
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eyewheel literally sends "say" messages 😛
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> timeout aswell
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> timeout is bad, but that's the only implementation deen could go with back then I guess
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when ddnet client wasn't as ubiquoutous
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now, with 0.7, we can make timeout better from the beginning. We cant change it for 0.6 anymore, as mods based on ddnet will probably wont update to this
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd love to get some very big networking changes done, but it's so much work
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> focus on the essential – otherwise it'll never get done
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like all my projects 😉
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like proper session resumption
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or encryption
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my answer to this would be "just use quic" these days
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh I can't get the networking changes in 0.7 anyway, vanilla ppl refuse to break compatibility 😄
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably the perfect match for it
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *teeworlds
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> quick unrelated question, @heinrich5991 do you ever cook?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> built-in encryption, session resumption, reliable and with an extension unreliable questsions
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'm not good at it
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *messages
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not questiosn
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as a proper german, would you fry or boil your bratwursts?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> boil
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know english verbs
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> joke
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a pan
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> boil = kochen
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but fry = braten?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ja
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fry is better
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you wouldnt boil it i guess
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, then bratwurst literally means frying sausage @Learath2
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> think about it
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Kochwurst:lol:
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now that I used half an hour of my negative time budget, I'll go to sleep I guess
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good night
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> night @heinrich5991
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> お休みなさい
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it even survived the IRC bridge
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oyasuminasai indeed
