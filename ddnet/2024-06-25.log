00:45 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @egyt when send klingon and braille translations?
00:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 Today at 0:31
00:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > chiller, you doing sick stuff
00:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thank
00:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> (epic irc reply)
00:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I like the ddnet infrastructure! And imo the ddnet-scripts repo is easier to understand than kubernetes! A bunch of bash and python to run bare matel is the best way to run blazingly fast prod systems.
00:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The biggest problem I have with the ddnet infrastructure is that it is closed source.
00:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I mean yes ddnet-scripts is public but its not the ddnet infrastructure. Its a bunch of randomly hand copied scripts that are never synced correctly.
00:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Interestingly avo claims that the kog infrasturcture is very clean. Everything tracked in git and the credentials are separate. So kog could go open source smoothly :D 
01:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But nobody of the ddnet admins wants to take the time to properly wire the ddnet-scripts repo up so it reflects the actual state.
01:03 <+bridge> <learath2> it is actually pretty close nowadays I think 😄
01:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> manual is still manual
01:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send links to all the crontabs then :p 
01:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/crontab
01:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are those all the complicated crons that make everything work? 
01:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Initial commit 10 years ago
01:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just put the source of truth into the ddnet-scripts repo and sym link it into /etc/cron.d/ddnet on prod
01:06 <+bridge> <learath2> LOL that crontab is not even close indeed
01:06 <+bridge> <learath2> just looking at the crontab hurts my eyes, so many things we have set up
01:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> let the community look to!
01:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when foss ddnet
01:08 <+bridge> <learath2> the only thing truly closed source in ddnet is the antibot I guess
01:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> without propriatary internal scripts without steam and discord spy sdks in the client and without the requirement for discord accounts to submit maps!
01:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> proprietary* wat a word
01:10 <+bridge> <learath2> I wanted to make a web based tool to move map testing to so we could remove the discord requirement, but the testers and I already don't get along, can't change their workflow
01:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> discord sdk :feelsbadman:
01:11 <+bridge> <learath2> I mean atleast you can play without those two
01:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the fact that its even in the code and shipped in official releases makes it a non foss game imo
01:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> i dont think your opinion holds water compared to the definition of foss
01:12 <+bridge> <learath2> 😄
01:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> more like some sketchy open core human rights violating evil conglomeration software
01:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like telegram
01:13 <+bridge> <learath2> Just run the no-proprietary-blobs version
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think all that stuff should exist in another repo but then you can't integrate it very well unless things are more modular
01:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> actually i do game 99% of the time with self compiled custom clients (totally legit open source forks**)
01:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but once in a while i get my rands on an official release from a package manager or similiar for testing or out of convinience 
01:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan you mean shell scripts and config files such as crontab should be two repos?
01:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> no
01:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> steam and discord sdks
01:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
01:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well if it is in the official release it doesn't really matter which repo it is in
01:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> no
01:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> makes ddnet.org a redistributor of freedom violating spyware
01:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> it can provide foss builds
01:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh on ddnet.org a foss version as download?
01:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it could already do that
01:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> exactly
01:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> that would be good
01:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cmake allows toggeling all those features
01:18 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess we could also provide clean builds, but I have a feeling with your hardline stance that wouldn't be enough either
01:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i do `apt install ddnet` which version do i get?
01:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `yay  ddnet-foss` xd
01:18 <+bridge> <learath2> Whatever options debian maintainers decide to compile it with. I'd guess you won't get any proprietary blobs since they put those in non-free
01:18 <+bridge> <learath2> Unless we are in non-free on debian, idk 😄
01:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am actually often using non-free <:justatest:572499997178986510>
01:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got my needs
01:19 <+bridge> <learath2> tfw the audacity to call us an evil congolmerate while using non-free
01:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ._.
01:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am a abused nvidia user
01:22 <+bridge> <learath2> use nouveau
01:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah right
01:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nouveau does not have the best gaming fps
01:23 <+bridge> <learath2> it's good enough for foss games 🙃
01:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> no such thing as good enough when ur talking about fps
01:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I can feel fps differences on gnome desktop mouse movement
01:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and for sure in ddnet xd
01:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:24 <+bridge> <learath2> is it really worth loading nvidia spyware blob into your kernel running at ring0?
01:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
01:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats me on the left
01:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1719271546.png
01:26 <+bridge> <learath2> interesting, we are not marked non-free on debian, but they don't seem to disable steam and discord
01:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> classic debian trying to sneak out some malicious blobs
01:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Soon Jian Tan top 10 ddnet contributors
01:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Jia*?
01:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Okay enough trash talk! Time to get some coffee
01:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> wtf
01:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> jensen huang writing on someone's boob
01:29 <+bridge> <learath2> time to go sleep
01:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan he is into silicone they say
01:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> hopefully not as much as silicon
04:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I became a huuuge unit test enjoyer!!!!! Mentioned it before can't mention it enough its epic!
04:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But sometimes even unit tests can't save me
04:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``sv_emoticon_test.go:89: expected: 999, got: 999``
04:40 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 maybe self rolling a testing framework came at a higher cost than expected xd
05:09 <+bridge> <bingbong669> when did strong hook and weak hook happen
05:09 <+bridge> <bingbong669> did it start as a bug?
05:32 <+bridge> <mian_ku> My DDNet server will crash when I connected my db and change map. It's strange, I can't find it crash reason.
05:33 <+bridge> <mian_ku> Is database need some map infomation?
06:09 <+bridge> <mian_ku> Oh, actually server will crash in second player join.
06:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @mian_ku did you edit the server code?
06:36 <+bridge> <mian_ku> I think i don't edited code about score and map
06:36 <+bridge> <mian_ku> maybe?
06:37 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @bingbong669 I don't think it was ever meant as feature. Also it does not matter tooo much in vanilla anyways. I assume it took a while until anybody noticed. It was first reported in 2011 and fixed in 2020 xd
06:37 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/530
06:38 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2478
06:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @mian_ku if you edited the code its likely you who introduced the issue. Check your changes and revert them until it works again. Or use a debugger to get the line which it crashed in and then look closely.
06:52 <+bridge> <mian_ku> how to get the line with it crashed?
07:15 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Run it with a debugger
07:16 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> For example gdb on Linux or visual studio on windows
07:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> gdb on windows pls
07:16 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s a thing?
07:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
07:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> do u know what msys2 is
07:16 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> on windows or msys2?
07:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> both
07:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> i use msys2
07:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> All of you trying to massage your windows into some fake Linux clearly are using the wrong os :D
07:19 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> You are meant to use the bing search engine, edge browser and visual studio
07:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk
07:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> i can develop proficiently and still play whatever i want and use whatever software i want
07:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> not have nvidia driver issues
07:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
07:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Neither do I
07:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> At mostly
07:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Sometimes
07:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay it’s time to get Xcode running on Linux to have the ultimate cursed dev environment
07:50 <+bridge> <teero777> I don't have NVIDIA driver issues either :D
07:51 <+bridge> <teero777> The solution was to buy an AMD GPU xd
07:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> sounds pricey
07:53 <+bridge> <teero777> Travel back in time and prevent yourself from buying NVIDIA xd
07:53 <+bridge> <teero777> Well you should buy their stock but not their GPUs xd
08:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Disagree. I would recommend selling their stock because its priced high. And buying their GPUs because they are the best performing ones.
08:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> morning from gym
08:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have issuws
08:26 <+bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon you might to add more information about the type try adding %T to those format strings.
08:26 <+bridge> <jxsl13> as those values might also differ in what type they are
08:58 <+bridge> <headshotnoby> https://youtu.be/RcGyPrGhljQ
09:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 thought about it but then was too lazy xd
09:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in that case it was enum and int not sure if i want to see every enum annotated as such anyways
09:28 <+bridge> <0nathan47> hi chillerdragon:
09:29 <+bridge> <jxsl13> it is a different type when you do type EnumBlub int
09:29 <+bridge> <jxsl13> it's not a different type when you do an alias like this: type MyInt = int
09:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> elo nathan
09:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah cool to know maybe i should do aliases more often the enum casting is so weird
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Patiga sos how to install twmap on intel macs?
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `pip install twmap`
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement twmap (from versions: none)`
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon>  `ERROR: No matching distribution found for twmap`
09:35 <+bridge> <jxsl13> don't do aliases
09:35 <+bridge> <jxsl13> fot enuns
09:35 <+bridge> <jxsl13> for
09:41 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do i use aliases for then?
09:55 <+bridge> <jxsl13> generic type instanciations
09:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> and when you use libraries that define a type which you want to "import" a little bit in your project
09:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> or for migrations and refactorings
09:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> of libraries
09:59 <+bridge> <patiga> I haven't figured out the cross compile method for macos yet, easiest for you would be to just clone the repo and manually compile
10:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga manual compile doesnt work either see the issue i opened :( 
10:04 <+bridge> <patiga> can you try the macos branch?
10:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> twstorage also lacks mac support hope thats not a problem
10:08 <+bridge> <patiga> that should be alright for the python bindings
10:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> epic macos branch works
10:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that was fast!
10:08 <+bridge> <patiga> (as long as you don't use embed_images_auto)
10:08 <+bridge> <patiga> :D
10:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :D 
10:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do i install the python bindings after cargo build finished?
10:10 <+bridge> <patiga> rename libtwmap.dylib to twmap.so, thats your python module which you can put anywhere you want
10:11 <+bridge> <patiga> to import it from anywhere, you'd need to put it into the python path somehow, tho I have no experience with that
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so `import twmap` works if im in the same dir?
10:11 <+bridge> <patiga> yea
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah i assumed there are some python wrappers invovled
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like actual .py files
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and some python package metadata file
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no wonder my type checker freaks out when using twmap
10:11 <+bridge> <patiga> heh, well I *should* figure out some package metadata stuff someday ^^
10:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks kernel 6.9 has a new amd pstate driver feature
10:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Linux 6.9 debuts AMD P-State ‘preferred core’ support in the AMD P-State driver for AMD Zen 2 and later chips.
10:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Preferred cores reach a higher maximum frequency than other cores, and this kernel support allows Linux scheduler to pass high priority tasks to those cores specifically.
10:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think arch doesnt have amd pstate enabled by def on the kernel
10:12 <+bridge> <patiga> e.g. I the module also depends on numpy, which pip doesn't know about
10:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Imo that information should be in the readme @patiga as a pyson nob i would have never tried to import a non pyson file
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cool, i hope i get some fps back xdd
10:14 <+bridge> <patiga> I do have a section for 'Manual Building (on Linux)', but fair, the other systems are missing ^^
10:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even on linux i would not know what to do
10:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because im certinally not using podman and some weird tokens for a local install
10:14 <+bridge> <patiga> thats another section in the readme
10:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Ah there in the inline code snippets
10:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still thought there was a step missing
10:15 <+bridge> <patiga> are the steps too simple? :p
10:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess i was missing the ```>>> import twmap``` code snippet
10:16 <+bridge> <patiga> good point, that would probably help
10:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe even this
10:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``` import target/release/libtwmap.so```
10:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is it with dots
10:17 <+bridge> <patiga> btw if you want to help with the type hints, you could take a look at https://pyo3.rs/v0.22.0/python-typing-hints
10:17 <+bridge> <patiga> I'd happily accept a pr :)
10:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i spend half a day tryint to write stubs for twmap then i rq
10:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> python ecosystem is just too big for me
10:18 <+bridge> <patiga> ow
10:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> every single thing has 100 totally different ways of doing it
10:19 <+bridge> <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255074881146720316/golang-super-gopher-prints.jpg?ex=667bcf11&is=667a7d91&hm=a6f0a74b1f68797cc899b1faff836adab32cd1054b00ea1da360e19f47c342f0&
10:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I made it work partially but it would break in different contexts i forgot. Something like neovim pyright would refuse to work at the same time as mypy cli
10:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But that seems like a good starting point https://pyo3.rs/v0.22.0/python-typing-hints maybe ill look into it some day ill open a issue in the repo to bookmark the link xd
10:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and the other one can be closed right? or is something blocking the merge of macos to master?
10:22 <+bridge> <patiga> yea I'll quickly merge it
10:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> twmap is epic
10:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and twmap techsupport is even better
10:22 <+bridge> <patiga> <3
10:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that was a smooth fix ;) 
10:23 <+bridge> <patiga> yw, glad that you like twmap :)
10:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Building my own package manager turned out to be more useful than i thought
10:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `crackman install twmap-py-src` 
10:50 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: is it in bash?
10:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use it to get bleeding edge software on debian, now for python packages on mac and also for custom projects
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `crackman install term-ux-src`
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `crackman install wireshark-src`
10:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its installed on all of my machines anyways since its part of my dotfiles setup
10:52 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> i need to make one for installing neovim
10:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it manages my PATH. So if i encounter any manual step to install something i slap the 4 commands in some shell script and the next time its just a `crackman install package`
10:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which then also offers uninstall and updates
10:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep @milkeeycat `crackman install neovim-src` is useful
10:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Stuff like `crackman install greensward` is just epic or also installing the teeworlds font system wide xd
10:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1719305676.png
10:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I can highly recommend doing that. I know there are a bunch of package managers out there. But none will ever manage to install EVERY little thing you need for all your systems in the exact version you need it in.
11:15 <+bridge> <egyt> I don
11:16 <+bridge> <egyt> I don't know not Klingon neither Braile
11:16 <+bridge> <egyt> I don't know not Klingon neither Braille
11:16 <+bridge> <egyt> Also Braille is not a language
11:22 <+bridge> <mian_ku> actually it happend on every single `pSqlServer->GetString()`.
11:32 <+bridge> <mian_ku> and same `GetInt()`
11:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who needs strings and ints anyways
11:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> database with strings attached hihihi
11:36 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> foxonaut u here?
11:38 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut
11:38 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yup
11:55 <+bridge> <learath2> Do any of you use btrfs?
13:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
13:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i heard valve is a lot into btrfs and develops it
13:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ie sends patches to upstream
13:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> TIL https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.byte_add
13:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it was added in 1.75
13:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
14:07 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm considering btrfs for my laptop, just was curious if anyone was already using it
14:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just do it
14:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is ur laptop a modern zen4?
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> use a ~amd64 kernel
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 6.9
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> has nice stuff
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> btw i also have a gaming laptop
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> with a 4070
14:10 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes :Celebrate:

14:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> don't, i quit my job to not do VR
14:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not really
14:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I do have tons of idea for VR games. but i'd rather die with them to develop for VR companies
14:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just like a slightly better crypto company
14:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I do have tons of idea for VR games. but i'd rather die with them than to develop for VR companies
14:44 <+bridge> <pathos3005> Hey, where can I see the physics math for the hook? I mean the formulae for hook to wall and hook to player?
14:45 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> charactercore.cpp
14:46 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ah no
14:46 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> gamecore.cpp
14:46 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> the class is CCharacterCore

14:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's rare that chiller is excited to see someone
15:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> hmm
15:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255146060062654494/image.png?ex=667c115c&is=667abfdc&hm=96965cd1abef0145fc954acfb11bb461c2a3abee485c11eef3c89d5af8a4166c&
15:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I feel like i should know this guy\
15:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> why can't i recall
15:03 <+bridge> <archimede67> Let's make our own company <a:anime_wink:1000382140699123762>
15:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm making my own, thanks for the offer
15:03 <+bridge> <archimede67> :poggers2:
15:04 <+bridge> <archimede67> But not VR games then
15:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no
15:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no competition clause wouldn't allow me to make VR games anyway
15:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also who are you again?
15:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
15:05 <+bridge> <archimede67> Oh
15:05 <+bridge> <archimede67> I'm just a rando
15:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> investigating
15:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255147094398734336/image.png?ex=667c1252&is=667ac0d2&hm=c644ea407066f5dae961581ee708d6322a5936383c560134022f219ad4ff4122&
15:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye idk
15:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @tsfreddie: Pathos legend https://youtu.be/skafAu28xuQ
15:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ok then
15:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i think i'm in a weird multiverse thing
15:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> everyone feels unfamiliar to me suddenly
15:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12146
15:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 
15:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I wouldn’t be surprised if this movement god would need to read code to optimize his vanilla gameplay
15:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 2024 is a great year i guess
15:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> The year of the Hannna Montanna Linux desktop
15:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> chillerdragon: thanks for accepting the invite btw
15:13 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Can’t promise anything. But I’m here waiting for your orders sir.
15:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, it was supposed to be public but i don't feel like making it public before i have any code down
15:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> you can just lerk
15:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> hi Souly
15:27 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> @tsfreddie help
15:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> wutup
15:31 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> @tsfreddie you made that teeworlds pvp repo on github right?
15:31 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> which
15:31 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> the one with multiple gamemodes in one mod
15:31 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> yes
15:32 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> if you are talking about ddnet-pvp
15:32 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> yup yup that one
15:33 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> @tsfreddie what modes does it support?
15:33 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> cuz theres no info on github page
15:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> every standard
15:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> including the two lms
15:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was suppose to be the bare minimum for people to develop other mods
15:33 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> so its just vanilla gamemodes on ddnet source?
15:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> so i just recreated every vanilla
15:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh also catch probably
15:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> let me double check
15:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i think catch and instagib might be in a different repo
15:34 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> ooooh
15:35 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> cuz i have a small request regarding instagib
15:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> there wasn't any info cuz that is not really finished
15:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
15:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i basically adandoned the project
15:35 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> T_T
15:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what's that tho
15:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye there is catch and instagib in the ddnet-pvp repo
15:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i wanted to ask if you could somehow port this mod features to 0.6 https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12618
15:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> its just about laser jumps and shield
15:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly, should be super easy
15:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but i don't want to
15:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i couldnt find any 0.6 version of this
15:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> and this mod is goated fr
15:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i tried to ask around for people to pick up ddnet-pvp
15:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but i think people just prefer to fork instead of contribute
15:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not that i provided any guide for contributing tho, so probably my fault
15:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> either way, instashield should be pretty easy to make
15:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> you can ask if anyone wants to.
15:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>  ddnet-pvp is not gonna add any gamemodes even if I continue
15:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was supposed to be the base mod for other pvp mods
15:41 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i asked some people but noone wanted to code this ://
15:41 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i have no more people to ask at this point
15:41 <+bridge> <learath2> yeah, why not, I'll give it a go, btrfs on LUKS it is
15:41 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> that i know could code
15:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, then you are probably out of luck
15:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz i sure am not doing it
15:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe in 2017
15:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not now
15:43 <+bridge> <meloƞ> keep us updated!
15:43 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> 😭 😭 😭
15:45 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @soulyvevo: go you do it
15:45 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> cant
15:45 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> brain to smol
15:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I promise you it isn’t
15:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But it might take some time
15:47 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> my brain is neurodivergent
15:48 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: when ddnet coding tutorials
15:48 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> cuz u only made ones for vanilla
15:48 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think anyone here learned ddnet coding via tutorials
15:49 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> are there even any?
15:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> there is one for vanilla made by chillerdragon according to you
15:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
15:50 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i did watch chillers videos
15:51 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> ye he has some series of vanilla tutorials lmao
15:51 <+bridge> <mian_ku> I'm try to make a query by stages, but is didn't work well, it's only show point of first stage.
15:51 <+bridge> <mian_ku> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255158407015567411/image.png?ex=667c1cdb&is=667acb5b&hm=3dbaf9df8d7404711b678a9aad68cad5329e5245b70e2dc0107bb4e0be127e73&
15:51 <+bridge> <meloƞ> (i simp for his voice big time) - chiller when vc again
15:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> is it just a german thing
15:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> he voice chatted me once and I find it a little bit diffiult to understand really.
15:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
15:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i think he forgot that I was chinese
15:53 <+bridge> <meloƞ> XDD
15:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> just a little bit tho, i managed to understand nonetheless
15:53 <+bridge> <teero777> doesn't chiller know Chinese?
15:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> just haven't heard any english in a few years let alone a german accented one
15:54 <+bridge> <teero777> lol
15:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> idk

16:16 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> understandable
16:17 <+bridge> <meloƞ> you can join #off-topic through matrix tho :o
16:17 <+bridge> <melon> *dabs*
16:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm too tired today to write. but i'm afraid of giving up tomorrow.
16:17 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I didn’t see
16:17 <+bridge> <meloƞ> oh wow - matrix pings wont show up on discord?
16:17 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> deen was in china?
16:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye

16:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't just walked up to him randomly
16:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It was planned right? Xd
16:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
16:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Cool
16:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but i did walk up to him knowing that he won't recognize me
16:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
16:19 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Was it your first irl meet?
16:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> with deen? ye
16:19 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> With tw players
16:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not really
16:20 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> if thats what it takes
16:20 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i met a few teeworlds players irl
16:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Pro
16:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> We for sure need a website to swipe tees near by
16:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And have a big tree of who met who
16:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> maybe graph is a better word than tree
16:21 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> teender
16:21 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> teekemon go
16:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yep
16:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yep
16:22 <+bridge> <meloƞ> temegle.tv
16:22 <+bridge> <meloƞ> teemegle.tv
16:22 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> rip
16:22 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> that site would abuse underage tees
16:23 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes that is a concern of mine too
16:24 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i only really met some random people who just happen to play tw too
16:24 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> but i never met anyone i know from teeworlds irl
16:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No way
16:24 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i just have chiller sitting on my desk
16:24 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> ye thats kinda rare too i guess
16:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> How did you find tw player irl
16:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s not a thing xd
16:25 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> well all tw players look like tees irl
16:25 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> so its not that hard
16:25 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
16:25 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Round?
16:26 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> ye
16:26 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> and they have no legs
16:26 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> just feet
16:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> How do you know it’s not Kirby gamers?
16:27 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> because kirby music is not playing when ur near them
16:27 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah smart
16:27 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I will try tomorrow to find some
16:27 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> now that i think about it
16:27 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i kinda sound like a tee
16:27 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> when i talk irl
16:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Sure
16:29 <+bridge> <meloƞ> **muffled teeworlds screams**
17:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice post
17:01 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i really want to write some articles
17:02 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> discord is so dogshit man
17:03 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> i actually feel like doing a chiller type move
17:03 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i would if i'm not in china
17:03 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> matrix is a bit weird to setup here.
17:03 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> the app just keeps finding ways to work worse and worse every day
17:03 <+bridge> <yrrr_> where do ddnet error logs go
17:07 <+bridge> <teero777> yo what causes these (connecting) players?
17:07 <+bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255177561118343219/image.png?ex=667c2eb2&is=667add32&hm=86609f6ce63589fddc8d3cdee6b4205a67c0003495892e9237cccef000f5e343&
17:18 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> oh wow i never thought about this
17:18 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace
17:19 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i've been using famitracker, never thought there would be a tracker that just includes all the chips...
17:27 <+bridge> <gumbatw> how restricted are u? cant u just vpn and get evrything u want?
17:27 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> lets just say, vpn usually just doesnt work here
17:28 <+bridge> <gumbatw> https://tenor.com/view/road-trip-drive-spiral-gif-16448004
17:28 <+bridge> <gumbatw> so they blocked known vpn servers?
17:28 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> and vpn protocols
17:28 <+bridge> <yrrr_> https://tenor.com/view/pumuckl-es-hat-geklingelt-klingel-schlagzeug-galileel-gif-13284651
17:28 <+bridge> <gumbatw> i would move away tbh, that sounds scary
17:29 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> we use obscure proxy protocols that some random dude made and hope it doesnt die in 2 years
17:29 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> new protocols constantly drops tho
17:30 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i dont know why thats scary other than just annoying
17:34 <+bridge> <melon> chiller i lost our chat history gg
17:34 <+bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255184414854479975/image.png?ex=667c3514&is=667ae394&hm=33832bae6d92df0a0130d0bfe181f00a2fb9024aed7dd3de19f317b270d44657&
17:35 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> why you don't do end-to-end encryption just willynilly
17:36 <+bridge> <melon> i encrypt all my private messages - and i may or may not have lost the decryption key
17:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
17:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> encrypt my heart
17:36 <+bridge> <melon> already did
17:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> had the same issue :C
17:37 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> does matrix remind you to backup decryption keys?
17:38 <+bridge> <melon> afair the actual decryption key can be either a generated security key or a set password
17:38 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> I'm thinking of setting up matrix for company uses, but i don't know if the technical and security side would r eally clicks for regular people.
17:38 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> I'm thinking of setting up matrix for company uses, but i don't know if the technical and security side would really clicks for regular people.

17:39 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i use cinny as a client - which i like very much
17:39 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> imagine a regular office worker seeing E2E room keys
17:39 <+bridge> <meloƞ> well actually downloading and joining it is the same as any other clientside chat platform
17:39 <+bridge> <meloƞ> you sign up and log in :D
17:39 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
17:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> you dont have to bother about encryption
17:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> but its neat if you care
17:40 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> does it not encrypt by default?
17:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i think its end-to-end encrypted by default
17:41 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i think losing access to chat history could be a thing that frustrate people?
17:41 <+bridge> <meloƞ> meh - iirc i asked chiller a question, he called me dumb and then we went 180° and talked about old youtube videos we both made and laughed about it
17:42 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
17:42 <+bridge> <meloƞ> oh wow that was 9 months ago
17:42 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:

17:42 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> for company uses i'd like a self-hosted chat platform that is just self contained. not really need to be that secured, as long as the hosting is secure enough i think.
17:43 <+bridge> <meloƞ> look at me - playing 8 years ago doing youtube videos!

17:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im sure there are
17:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> btw u can make ur own irc server with whitelist based on local network or ips
17:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> there was also a discord open source alternative
17:43 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, but image hosting and voice would be neat to have at least
17:43 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> ye thought so too, but i haven't really looked up any
17:44 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i know godot uses rocket.chat for collaboration not sure where that one stands
17:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://mattermost.com/
17:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this
17:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> open source
17:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> also host your own git cloud
17:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> !
17:45 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i already had my own gitea instance
17:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont use gitea
17:45 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> that seems cool
17:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> use forejo
17:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> check out https://git.edgl.dev/
17:45 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> why
17:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my instance
17:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> written in Go
17:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ggwp
17:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> forgejo is a gitea fork
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> with more stuff
17:46 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> oh ok
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and truly open source
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and federated
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well federation is experimental
17:46 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and opt in
17:46 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> what is federation again?
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but the dark theme is cool af
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> better than gitea
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> federationn in this case is being able to use ur account in ur own instance and comment on a instance of another in a repo for example
17:46 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i always wondered, are you able to create Pull requests cross-cloudservice?
17:47 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i never tried
17:47 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> so matrix
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> most federation is based on activitypub
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://activitypub.rocks/
17:47 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i actually haven't really find any problem with gitea yet
17:47 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i'll migrate once i have
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> booo
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i even have ci runners
17:48 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> gitea has that too now?
17:48 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> plus i was a drone ci user anyway
17:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie https://forgejo.org/compare-to-gitea/
17:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Forgejo was created in October 2022 after a for profit company took over the Gitea project. It exists under the umbrella of a non-profit organization, Codeberg e.V. and is developed in the interest of the general public. In the year that followed, this difference in governance led to choices that made Forgejo significantly and durably different from Gitea. You will find below the most important reasons to choose Forgejo over Gitea. For an exhaustiv
17:48 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> you don't have to copy, i can click
17:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Forgejo is developed using Forgejo, tested and released using Forgejo Actions.
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Gitea is developed on GitHub, tested and released using GitHub Actions.
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this is a big statement
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> forgejo beleives in their own software
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gitea not
17:49 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
17:50 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
17:50 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe you can break mine so i have to migrate
17:53 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> https://c.tsdo.in:20020/explore/repos
17:53 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
17:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why use non default port
17:57 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> 443 is banned by ISP
17:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
17:58 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> enterprise link is like 1000 times more expensive than home internet
17:58 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> so they obviously don't want you to just buy home links to host websites

18:02 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i love firefox
18:06 <+bridge> <learath2> How do they even detect protocols, even with deep packet inspection it wouldn't really look much different to any other encrypted traffic
18:12 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> no idea
18:12 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe they just tried really hard to block services so no openvpn servers are left
18:12 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> or wireguard
18:13 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> also there are literal research papers about detecting encrypted protocol traffics
18:14 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> and patents apparently
18:14 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> https://archive.org/details/CN109981485A/page/n5/mode/2up
18:20 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> otherwise i have no idea why i have to use vless, shadowsockr, brook, hysteria2, trojan or snell or any of the weird ones.
18:20 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> :owo:
18:21 <+bridge> <learath2> interesting, I'll have to research this later, I was under the impression that encrypted traffic is pretty much opaque and your only hope is to gather stuff from traffic pattern
18:21 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> even then that is not that stable, i used to host my own instances for brook, but it started to just cut off after a while and comes back three hours later
18:22 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> now i just buys from randos that rotates servers and ips daily
18:22 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> so technically i can be MITMed
19:24 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> is neovim a new thing or i'm just stupid back in 2014
19:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> now new but more relevant now
19:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dev was stalled in 0.4 for a looooong time and now it got fast dev
19:25 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> thats what i thought
19:26 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i learnt vim in 2015 iirc. but since i switched to colemak since 2010, i have to maintain a weird binding myself and keep finding issues with it every time i tried to pick vim up later
19:26 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't even know where was my old vim config now
19:27 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> anyway, just thinking maybe i should get back to vim
19:27 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> probably not tho
19:29 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> one of my coworker had vim keybinds in his jetbrains... i realized immediately but failed to locate the I key on a qwerty layout in less than 0.2 second and got the standard "ye, just hit I". now i'm ashamed
19:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
19:30 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> didn't tell him what i was really struggling with tho, cuz i'm nice
19:30 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> :owo:
20:40 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> how i can make a KoG server?
20:42 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe ask kog. they have their own discord
20:43 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> can you send me KoG discord?

21:27 <+bridge> <meloƞ> the letters Freddie, what do they mean
21:28 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> chinese phonetic symbols (or zhuyin / bopomofo)
21:28 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i always thought you guys had some crazy keyboard layout
21:28 <+bridge> <meloƞ> but thats just regular qwerty
21:28 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> mainland phased these out in favor of pinyin using latin alphabet
21:28 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> so our keyboard is literally just US

21:29 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i really wish we had cool symbols on our keyboard
21:30 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> does anyone really prefer ISO over US. does europe use ISO mostly

21:54 <+bridge> <teero777> how can i set a timeout for something like `net_tcp_recv`?
