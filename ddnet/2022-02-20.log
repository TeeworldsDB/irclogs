00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> cool video 😄

00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
02:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> working on winter_mountains2!
02:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is this weird white alliasing line supposed to be in the asset or is that a mistake?

02:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> no they are individual atoms of snow for realism
02:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> (its probably a mistake)
03:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1801
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> he deserve it
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h_1jTOSzKU&t=39s
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It could be done client side only, i cannot see this feature anywhere
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not good to do it clientside.
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1. Client doenst always have own tee position
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2. not every other Client can use that feature then.
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 3. pr is closed, not merged
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> small box ad somewhere can't be  annoying
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> why do you even do this discussion xD
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> what is your motivation
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i clearly said funding is not a problem
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> feel bored 😛
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but we have a lot space in website ddnet use it
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I hate advertisements, they steal people's attention and brainwash them, so no ads on ddnet
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if you leave it empty it's like wasted money
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ddnet isnt created to make money tho
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> its a community game
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so you can make it for ddnet
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> And if you walk past someone on the street and don't steal their wallet it's also wasted money 😄
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> xDDD
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> illegal
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so if it was legal you would do it? 😄
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> haram 😛
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> for me both are bad, independent of whether they are legal
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you still can choose good ads don't put anything
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if you want to help ddnet, then chat up some streamers, reviewers, game websites to cover ddnet, that would be nice
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> as @Not Keks already said, there is no funding problem
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I think ads wouldnt even fit ddnet site 🤔
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> don't wait problem come
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if you all hate it i can't say anything more
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> have a nice day
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> thanks, you too
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Btw, stupid question, but do people on ddnet developer channel do little js code reviews 🤔 :justatest: ?
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But actually you're not the first one to suggest this recently, not sure why this idea of commercializing on the internet is becoming more popular. Are you guys studying Economics or is this because of Influencers and YouTubers trying to earn money?
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @RadziSzop for something ddnet related yes, otherwise you can still post it, but no guarantee
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i study accounting maybe we have something about wasted money
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Not for ddnet, just was wondering if someone would be interesting of giving it 3 mins of free time
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Should disable kick/specvotes on all maps with teamforce like on dummy
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and i am youtuber trying get money 🙂
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> You wont get money from ddnet ads tho 😩
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its annoying to get banned on a full server because only 2 people have to vote in t0
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> maybe change it to /spec?
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> No, u dont need those votes at all on maps with teamforce
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like you still stay in race but spec
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u either are in a team or having fun in the playground
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> somepeople sleep there
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> will be nice if there way without kick them
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> You need a way to kick spammer/troll
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway i am not developer or something why i talking here
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> about ads. it's just we love this game and Donations can't work forever if ddnet can finance himself this will be awesome
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 👋 bye bye i will make some tea
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> DDnet wouldn't have such problems in future if brazil wouldn't cost 1000$ :nouis:
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> DDnet wouldn't have such problems in future if brazil wouldn't cost 1300$ :nouis:
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> so as long as donations work, there is no need for ads 😛
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> How many people even visit ddnet.tw 🤔 ?
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl are masochists
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> demanding ads
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what a world to be alive
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just post it
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://dontasktoask.com/
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Yes yes, i know, just need to finish it first
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944920970676809778/unknown.png
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this website is so good
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> From Cloudflare, not sure how accurate
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944922524918120528/screenshot-20220220124426.png
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> So maybe ~400k people a month
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is for wiki.ddnet.tw for january
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944924689191550976/unknown.png
12:57 <@deen> ChillerDragon: can you stop afking on Multeasymap all the time? We'd like map to restart at some point
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just ban him
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at that point he is taking up slots of ppl who want to play
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i don't know what he's doing, apparently some kill counting bot in playground
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and we have enough servers, so taking up slots is not an argument
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> if nobody is racing just restart feature?
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta restart to update server
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> 62 people are racing
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but usually it would sometimes go empty at night, then it can restart, but not if ChillerDragon stays there always
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah thats what i mean
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> if nobody racing just restart
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> with racing i mean crossing start line / not being afk since 8h
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> whatever
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> its just annoying, u cant even contact chillerdragon
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> email him
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xfce> chillerdragon is gigachad
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> what do you mean...?  400k visitors in one month? Even if half would be bots... didn't expect 10% of that
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> we have wiki :poggers: ?
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Steam also reports that we get ~30k new players every month
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> 29k from it are chinese ones i think
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> #wiki
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> i remember when few years ago i was sad that from ~1000 active players there are about 600
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> 10k
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944934068569641000/screenshot-20220220133023.png
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> unexpected
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> but still good news
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Alexa has a website(traffic) tracking system
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> its pretty accurate afaik
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944946640723247174/unknown.png
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> https://github.com/RadziSzop/colorPicker
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Who can I contact for DDNet Korea, Japan, and Singapore servers? From https://ddnet.tw/status
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Somepeople good
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> add_foe name
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its actually never empty. I could be afk 1week and it always people were playing xd
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Real news
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have several econ friends who keep telling me we should monetize ddnet/teeworlds:D
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can i run ads on my maps?)))
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> me? why
15:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Don't put all your eggs in one basket :greenthing:
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> If the eggs are donated you don't need them in one basket
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> see bro its nice that you care so much for ddnet
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no ads wtf
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> from 2013 until today in the end of the year the costs were always covered
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i vote developers-managers or idk what your name guyscan take 10-20% of money this will help you take it more seriously and trying earn more money for you and for ddnet
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont want ddnet to become capitalistic ..
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this help it to become biger
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluni> 10€ onetime payment for ddnet client
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluni> Would pay
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> here saudi arabia now doing this
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> you are going into a philosohpical direction
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> just bcs something works, it doesn't need to be done
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> just like deens example with stealing a money bag
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> universities now cash feed by Government but they will start make his money or fail so will be better or this they idea anyway
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can see how that could motivate us to work more on it, but 10-20% of what we'd make on reasonable ads is like nothing compared to a proper salary :D
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It wouldnt even be living wage
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> imagine ddnet get a million
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> now it's deserve it
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd need to put dick pill ads all over the site and between map runs to just fund deen to work on this full time :D
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Finally good idea...
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> no just small box
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's beginning  you don't have get a lot of ads
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think a small box ad generates enough revenue to fund a developer salary, let alone a team?
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to monetize ddnet the better direction to go is definitely microtransactions
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like if ddnet cost money (need buy it) this make a lot
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> butif you want buy it you need make accounts inside ddnet
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> cost but get result too
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Please stop, nobody want's ads. DDNet is already able to sustain itself by donations.
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> (@hussainx3)
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> small box no hurt
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> i dont want porn ads on my game
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> thats also the best way to lose 90% of your playerbase
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like what i said it's just begin not need be enough for anything
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, exactly. We just dont need it. The only reasonable thing is maybe the money could motivate some of us to work more on it. But honestly, we'd make such a negligible amount with any reasonable ads
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> omg it's example just
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i wouldn't agree on that, ads are designed to get attention, and ppl's attention is already very bad in modern society
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can example take ads of channels ddnet only
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I opened discord to ask something else here, then I forgot :/
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> not have to be porn or something far of ddnet
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Capitalism is bad for my attention span
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Just post some ads about ddnet
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reasonable ads don't pay well. That's why every site puts "HOT MILFS IN YOUR AREA"
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> reasonable ads not hurt even if was not well we talking about money without hurt
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> game is still open source so people would probably mod the client or use old version
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> pay 10 dollars to put a hat on your tee and 25  dollars to have an animated tee body 🤩
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Website ads, not ingame 😨
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pay 0 have everything and donate if you want
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what u have right now
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u want to lose it
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nonsensical
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think of it more as an ideoligical position. None of us believe in monetizing this project. Nor the amount we'd make would change anything for us. Thus there is no point
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Then where are my hats?
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> exactly. its how i want it
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> just use ad blocker
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> those are skins
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> even better
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have over 600
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/skins/
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> example this video in the mine page
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if someone want put video about ddnet even if not good enough if was not porn ofc and still about with ddnet you can put it if he pay 10$
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 579*
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> still
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> hats to actually go over a tee's eyes would be nice
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't need money :P
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> adding ads is the fastest way to kill a game lmao
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> f3
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's in website not game omg
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> does it matter
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ads are added i would stop helping ddnet, not like it matters much
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets atleast have a decent place in the internet while it dies
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do understand the grindset tho. It's capitalismgang. It hurts to see possible profits going unextracted
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i sure you not have video every day to put in this main page
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If people make good videos, we put them on the site, without charging them for it
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Maybe we could make "ads" for ad blockers and other useful FOSS software/open source games without monetizing/tracking in it.
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok another idea
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> another idea: leave it as is
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> make clothes or something and sells in website=ads of ddnet to ddnet
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> so nfts
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Zwelf those wouldnt pay anything, they are open source, it would more be like a shoutout or a see also
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> create actual twinbop OnlyFans
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> OH WAIT you meam merch
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The point is these won't generate much of anything. Even with ads that pay a lot we'd not make any significant amount
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, we don't need it and all of the maintainers and contributors seem to agree on that by a landslide. So these profits will have to stay unextracted
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Yeah, its not about profit more like giving visibility for other projects.
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> make clothes and sells it's too free ads when people wear this clothes
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and i sure this make enough money
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> or deserve it anyway
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Tee plushies
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> how about you make a million $ and donate it
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> then ddnet also got your money
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> listen i wanna do stuff here not for the money
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i wanna do it because its Fun
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> ChillerDragon plushies 🤔
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> :chillertroll1:
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> clothes very fun thing  and like dummy louis or something
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ppl want tees in really life
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know something more useful that you can do?
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> contribute to the ddnet wiki
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i wish but so poor
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the best way to help ddnet rn
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ☕
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> imagine i get something free and spend money :kek:
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Imagine you get ddnet for free but dont want to spend money on donation, pethetic
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u even donate
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if you sell dummys tees i will buy
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> poor
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> much of the money spent goes into the company that produces these
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't have to donate anything. If you want ddnet to keep on existing, you can donate to keep the servers running
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> or do you also want to create the factories? XD
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen used to sell t-shirts iirc but no profit
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah but he wants it to get money
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was a print company, they took all profits iirc
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> GF louis can make for us XD
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Freeze
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new wiki page poggers
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We obviously hire slave labour to hand sew them
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ez

16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> btw ddnet license allows you to make your own game based on ddnet's work
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> Go ahead and make your ads
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Should done it way before
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> bear me guys just one week and my holiday finish
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Whos dennis
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> deen

16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> btw there no game like ddnet
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's hard for noobs like impossible
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> put tutorious work when you first time run this game
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> why only 5? how many years do u play?
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I did not have more on paypal
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Um... 7? But for me it was 23PLN🤔
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Also it was money reservated for BTD6, i hope it was worth it
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> xdd
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> at least something 👍
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Only to be on list :toptri:
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> there list !
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> if you like to play a game you can also leave money there, it still donate relatively few people which is sad 😄
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> some ppl play for years and never leave a little bit money
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Yes
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> So i am better than them

17:32 < Update_> Hi guys.
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Hey!
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Sorry for the late response. Coke found me in game I have him access to the bot so he can restart it. Since I am not farming runtime anymore feel free to shutdown the server if there is only me online. Or add a password and kick me \:)
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@deen)
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u know, u can disconnect urself
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Bot is programed to always vote  :f4:.
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> So make a vote "keep server alive?"
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It will vote :f4: and you can restart 🤣
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> smart
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if nobody in serverr or there sleep just vote will work
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> pass
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks!
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> lol, don't shame people for their donations...

18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> lunch and dinner
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> I just said so because he posts here big that he has donated 5 euros 😁
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's big
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I could do 5e total for lunch + dinner here
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if u buy rice and only eat that then u can
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could indeed buy rice
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can also afford some yogurt
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> lunch cost 2.5 rice and Quarter of a chicken with some red pasta and green vegetable
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> dinner 2.5   2sandwich Shawarma 
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> both can cost less if i cook in kitchen
