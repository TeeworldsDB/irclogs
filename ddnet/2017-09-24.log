01:08 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> This seems to be a rather bad idea: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp?#L1240 I guess we should think about how to handle tees in a team that already finished whereas the whole team did not yet finish again.

01:17 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: could be put into engine, yes
01:41 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> how to use cmake to build only the sql server without having libraries for the client installed?
01:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> cmake -DMYSQL=ON -DCLIENT=OFF ..
01:46 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> whats the target for the server with sql? it says `DDNet-Server_sql` doesnt exist
01:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> just DDNet-Server
01:46 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> ah i see
01:50 <+Learath2> @HMH why do we have kill immunity in the first place?
01:51 <@heinrich5991> because without it, people would 1) not get ranks because they got killed before the race finished or 2) get the whole team killed because it is locked
01:51 <@heinrich5991> it was done because old maps typically had kill tiles directly behind the finish line
01:52 <+Learath2> 1) sounds about right no? if you die before the finish you don't get a rank
01:52 <@heinrich5991> you could perhaps actually kill them and not let them respawn until the team finished
01:53 <@heinrich5991> no, everyone has to finish before anyone gets a rank
01:53 <@heinrich5991> in a team
01:53 <+Learath2> ooh i see what you mean
01:54 <@heinrich5991> "you could perhaps actually kill them and not let them respawn until the team finished"
01:54 <@heinrich5991> I think that is actually the solution, right there
01:54 <@heinrich5991> maybe post an issue about that
01:54 <@heinrich5991> make them "paused" so they can watch the others
01:54 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> just save names of tees who passed finishline in the teamobj maybe ?
01:54 <+Learath2> that would work, or could have a pending rank in team, so when the team finishes even if everyone is not there everyone who crosses the line gets a rank
01:56 <+Learath2> btw now that we have C++11 are we also upgrading to STL?
01:56 <@heinrich5991> I don't really understand. the team should only get a rank if everyone inside it has finished, right?
01:56 <+Learath2> or still avoiding stl like the plague?
01:56 <@heinrich5991> sounds unrelated to c++11 tbh ^^
01:56 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> well we will likely pull in threading
01:57 <+Learath2> when thou crosseth the finish line in team your name gets added to an array
01:57 <+Learath2> inside the team object
01:57 <@heinrich5991> don't think about it in terms of code plz ^^
01:57 <@heinrich5991> but in the behavior
01:57 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> rather save the name of finished tees if they kill
01:58 <+Learath2> you die, it doesn't matter because everyone who were in the team at any point and crossed the line at any point gets the team rank
01:58 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> if you just save all names right after finish and someone still alive changes name not the thing they expect will happen
01:59 <+Learath2> but what happens if you die and rejoin the same team
01:59 <@heinrich5991> you can't rejoin a team that has started
01:59 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> does not work
01:59 <@heinrich5991> yes. and where do you go? you go into spectator mode or where?
02:00 <+Learath2> wait, what happens if you kill after you cross the line normally?
02:00 <@heinrich5991> you get removed from the team
02:00 <@heinrich5991> and don't get a rank
02:00 <+Learath2> hmm can't really handle it like that nvm :P
02:01 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: you'd go spawn in team 0 like normally in that proposal
02:01 <@heinrich5991> hm.
02:02 <@heinrich5991> I'd probably prefer the spectating variant where you have to wait for the whole team to finish before you can start a new race
02:03 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: what happens if they disconnect while waiting?
02:03 <@heinrich5991> same as usual, don't get a rank
02:03 <@heinrich5991> or reconnect within timeout protection
02:05 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> btw. we might also need to think about what /save stores if we change anything here
02:05 <+Learath2> well i don't see any difference in the proposals, one let's them respawn one doesn't
02:10 <+Learath2> btw, one of you will need to do the condition variable thing or tell me what you mean because I'm not quite familiar with C++ let alone C++11
02:11 <+Learath2> i prefer using C++ as C mit classes :P
02:11 <@heinrich5991> mit = english-german(with)
02:11 <@heinrich5991> interesting
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Can anyone help me now, to update my ghost ?
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i am faster than my ghost, but the time wont update
12:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> try deleting it?
12:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or moving it to a differetn folder
12:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> thx, worked
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> <heinrich5991> I'd probably prefer the spectating variant where you have to wait for the whole team to finish before you can start a new race
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You will be pushed to spectate after crossing line, or after jumping into kill tile ?
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if the first, i can't agree
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause, very often people helps each other
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on the end
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what if team has 3 players, and one of them stay at the bottom of hammerfly ending part?
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> kill tile
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and about learath idea, maybe instead of saving nicknames
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> save id's ?
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then you can change nickname, without unexpected behaviour
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> don't think in terms of implementation ^^
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, but it sounds good
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like, if you cross line you are saved into temp array for team
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> say "we should take the names at the time when the race is finished"
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can help them, and do whatever you want
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> not "we should save ids instead of names"
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but if you die, you will not break the run for others
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> after finish-line obviously
13:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Then if last guy cross the line, ranks are saved and everyone are happy
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, forcing spectating can be weird. Maybe the guy would like to start new "round". But then he has to wait for the rest of the team, since he finished map
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> currently they also have to wait
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I know, but now they can go through the kill tile
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and i talkin about this
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and waiting for the rest of the team is good manners, starting a new round definitely isn't ^^
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I didn't say that current behaviour is good
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> did I? ðŸ˜„
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you'd encourage people to finish instead of helping others
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> because then they're done
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> We shouldn't tell people what they had to do in that moment
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if they stupid, they wouldn help
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> at all
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it encourages it
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> encourages ? I don't think so
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Trolls won't help, kind guys will stay with teammates
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> world isn't good/bad
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I know it would tempt me ^^
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so I'm in favor of helping everyone help each other ^^
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, if they started play in a team, they know what they have to do. I mean, i prefer to give people choice instead of forcing
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or at least, give them option while spectating
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to "kill me please"
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like ./kill command now
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> is starting a new race while your team hasn't finished a use case we should support?
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we can give them a choice
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, or we can nudge them in the right direction
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'd like to be nudged ^^
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> afk 20min
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> We can nudge, but then we we have to force spectating them? ðŸ˜„
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why we have *
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "we we" ;-;
13:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 now noticed that this also alters behaviour for old maps that have killtiles right after finish
13:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> in the ddnet version of those e.g. you are 3 people, finish is after a hf, you go up with 2, one goes back gets the last
13:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but after we apply this, 2 goes up they both  die the 3rd cant possibru
13:55 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> we might want to fix these maps then I guess
13:56 <+Learath2> sure but are we okay with possibly invalidating ranks?
13:57 <+Learath2> they might become impossible to reproduce after the patc
13:57 <+Learath2> h
13:57 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> Does removing killtiles after finish really alter things that much especially if they do not kill anyways ?
13:59 <+Learath2> i guess not, atleast I see no legit reason
13:59 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> same, maybe someone else got complaints otherwise I think it is a good idea
18:11 <@heinrich5991> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestagswahl_2017
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> is there any clientside tracking of what tune zone you are in?
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, it's sent by the server
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> AFAIK
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> you can always check the tiles tho and use mapconfig
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> but that is currently not done, in theory it enables prediction I think
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> K
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 @deen ^
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> linux manjaro, never heard of that
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its windows-like
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> manjaro linux is a variant of arch linux
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @deen is blazingly fast ðŸ˜„
23:05 <+Slishtee> Anyone online currently?
23:05 <@heinrich5991> ask you question...
23:06 <@heinrich5991> there's always someone who will see your question in a couple of hours
23:06 <+Slishtee> alright thanks, but euuhh yea
23:06 <+Slishtee> was testing something on server with dummies and i think i got a master server ban none of my friends can see my server when they refresh
23:07 <+Slishtee> im going to restrict this usage anyway was just wondering if i could get my server unbanned
23:07 <@heinrich5991> ask in #teeworlds, ping minus
23:07 <+Slishtee> alright, thanks
