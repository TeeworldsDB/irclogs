12:04 < ddnet-commits> o/
12:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> bot fixed? /o/
12:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> \o\
12:10 < Learath2> yep
12:10 < Learath2> should get a patch send it upstream :P
12:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> great üòÑ
12:23 < Ryozuki> nice
12:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> @irclink
12:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ha! I can mention you!
12:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea
14:37 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> does it support images? üòÉ

14:38 < Ryozuki> it gives a link on irc
14:38 <@EastByte> oh, I thought it would create an ascii art
14:38 < Ryozuki> xD
14:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> haha
14:38 < Ryozuki> that would be cool
14:42 < Learath2> that would be horrid :D
14:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I gonna do it!

19:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #745: Fix indentation (master...dd_pr_indent) https://git.io/v9TO1
19:11 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> that's more changes than just indentation lol
19:13 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> no?
19:13 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i actually have no idea where that getchar came from
19:14 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wasn't even working on that file
19:15 < Learath2> i'm pretty sure that's just indentation fix, the diff viewer seems to be confused

19:16 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> how to fix whitespaces tutorial:  1) Open Visual Studio  2) Open the file you want to edit 3) CTRL + K, CTRL + D 4) ??? 5) profit
19:16 < Ryozuki> love the ??? part
19:16 < Learath2> i'd like to run everything through clang-format maybe
19:17 < Ryozuki> allman style
19:17 < Learath2> :(
19:17 < Ryozuki> :)
19:18 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> discord > irc
19:18 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> @Ryozuki can't decide ü§î
19:18 < Ryozuki> irc > discord
19:18 < Learath2> irc > discord
19:18 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> what if I edit message
19:18 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> kaaaaaaaaaaaaapa
19:19 < Learath2> discord can take it's proprieprietary shitware and leave
19:19 < Ryozuki> freedom o/
19:19 < Learath2> i'll go work on my spelling now
19:19 < Ryozuki> hf  then
19:20 < Learath2> proprietary*
19:20 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> slack > discord ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
19:20 < Learath2> is slack also proprietary garbageware?
19:20 < Learath2> yep even worse
19:21 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> don't want to insult you, so i won't answer
19:21 < Learath2> feel free to lay some insults
19:22 < Learath2> ##C teaches one how to not care
19:22 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> @CookieMichal i prefer discord over slack
19:22 < Ryozuki> you mean #C
19:23 < Ryozuki> ?
19:23 < Learath2> slack literally looks like an overengineered ircd
19:23 < Ryozuki> it is
19:23 < Learath2> unofficial channels in freenode get another #
19:24 < Learath2> the searching features look cute tho
19:24 < Ryozuki> slack is for business
19:24 < Ryozuki> companies
19:24 < Ryozuki> idk
19:25 < Learath2> i did want to work on a chat protocol of my own, but im no good with marketing wank so i'd end up the only person using it
19:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> XD
19:26 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> ever heard of telegram?
19:26 < Learath2> some whatsapp kind of thing iirc
19:26 < Ryozuki> Signal has encryption
19:26 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> make better UI for group talks and u r done
19:26 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> everything for u is irc XD
19:27 < Ryozuki> iirc != irc
19:27 < Learath2> i also use whatsapp and teamspeak
19:27 < Learath2> iirc = if i recall correctly
19:27 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
19:28 < Learath2> teamspeak and whatsapp b/c friends refuse to migrate to mumble and xmpp
19:28 < Learath2> apparently open source is gay and for communists
19:28 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> because they are not stupid
19:28 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> maybe they prefer user friendly interfaces? üëÄ
19:28 <@deen> to resolve this conflict I propose that we switch to good old BBS 
19:29 < Learath2> user friendly? you mean granny friendly?
19:29 <@deen> since ddnet is already using a taiwanese domain, I'll ask the popular PTT BBS if we can have a channel
19:29 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> ^ üòÉ
19:30 < Learath2> so b/c i enjoy a simple interface i'd enjoy a unusable bbs?
19:30 < Learath2> thats some slippery slope
19:30 <@deen> telnet ptt.cc
19:30 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> huh?
19:30 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/305395024156295170/unknown.png
19:31 <@deen> big5 encoding, no modern unicode shit
19:31 < Learath2> not even surprised that you are using windows 10 :D
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> ay right
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> wait I will change to windows 95 like u
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> it's working
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> it must be good
19:32 <@deen> luit -encoding big5 telnet ptt.cc
19:32 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> irc is so much spam lol
19:33 < Learath2> irc is generally calmer then discord
19:33 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> irc is so cool that u have to be online 24/7 to know what ppl were talking about
19:33 < Learath2> i have a bouncer that takes care of being online
19:33 < Learath2> so does many other people
19:34 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> so I need to spend money on 24/7 vps that will do it for me
19:34 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> even better
19:34 < Learath2> i'll host it for you, i'm pretty sure anyone else here would be happy to provide aswell
19:34 <@deen> maybe this irc - discord bridge can't bridge the cultural divide
19:34 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> haha
19:34 <@deen> instead of telnet you can also "ssh bbsu@ptt.cc"
19:35 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> help me with encoding thing deen :v
19:35 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/305396184481267722/unknown.png
19:35 < Learath2> and if you want i believe there are some newfound wanksites that act as your bouncer for free and give you a cutting edge web8.0 interface
19:35 <@deen> CookieMichal: Use ssh instead, it's a utf8 server
19:35 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> @CookieMichal looks like Dwarf Fortress ^^
19:35 <@deen> ah, you might not have the correct font
19:35 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> that screenshot was taken on ssh connection :v
19:36 < Learath2> if only i knew that language
19:36 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> deen, who is in charge of the ddnet backend?
19:36 <@deen> yeah, font missing, use a different terminal app or find out how to get chinese fonts
19:36 <@deen> what's a ddnet backend?
19:37 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> well
19:37 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> the backend of ddnet?
19:37 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> I think he means website
19:37 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> yes
19:37 < Learath2> the new website stuff looks really nice
19:37 <@deen> how is the website our backend? that's a frontend
19:37 <@deen> which new stuff?
19:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> THE BACKEND OF THE WEBSITE
19:38 <@deen> it's a bunch of html files
19:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> I see chinese üëç
19:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/305396890223247360/unknown.png
19:38 <@deen> nginx?
19:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> wow
19:38 < Learath2> i saw some screenshots somewhere on discord
19:38 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-django
19:39 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> he means: Who is responsible for the server running website? :v
19:39 <@deen> i am
19:39 <@deen> i mean, i pay for it
19:39 <@deen> and the admins and I have root access
19:39 < Learath2> i think it was SPECTRUM in #general who posted the screenshots
19:39 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> yes
19:41 < ddnet-discord> <sorgaxD> does anyone knows where can i found a default autoexec_server.cfg?
19:41 < Learath2> Should be in the repo
19:41 <@deen> I should have made the ptt channel on april 1 and posted a tutorial, while shutting down ddnet forum
19:42 < Learath2> Great idea deen
19:42 <@deen> too late, damn
19:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> next year
19:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> just 11 months and few days
20:13 < Ryozuki> hi HMH 
20:14 < HMH> Hi Ryozuki
20:14 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> HI both
20:15 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> hi M&M
20:19 < Ryozuki> what would you think about having lua as scripting language for ddnet, so maybe some things can be done more easily
20:19 < Ryozuki> and you  can modify lua scripts without recompiling
20:19 <@deen> hell no
20:20 < Ryozuki> :(
20:20 < Ryozuki> why not
20:20 < Ryozuki> most of games do that
20:20 <@deen> why would you want to change stuff without recompiling?
20:20 < Ryozuki> why wouldn't you want?
20:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it would give botters new ways
20:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÑ
20:20 <@deen> to ensure that every server runs the same code
20:20 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> all the haxx client
20:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> haha
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, it would be great
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> to have some kind of core server
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and plug-ins
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÆ
20:21 <@deen> also, performance
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then, you could  have always up-to-date your server
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with security fixes
20:21 < Ryozuki> plug-ins allow easily customization
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and your own plugins
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÆ
20:21 < Ryozuki> plugins*
20:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> woaht, it would be awesome
20:21 < Ryozuki> i mean only server sided
20:21 <@deen> not a good idea imo
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> very bad
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> very unsecure
20:22 < Ryozuki> it's not that bad
20:22 < Ryozuki> wut?
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> what?
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> why not?
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Core server -> security first
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and plugins for administrators
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it how it works everywhere üòÑ
20:22 < Ryozuki> yes
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Bukkit (minecraft)
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> AMXX
20:22 < Ryozuki> gmod for example
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> CS1.6
20:22 < Ryozuki> uses lua
20:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Gmod yes
20:23 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> gmod ‚ù§
20:23 < Ryozuki> u dont ‚ù§ cuz it uses lua so by ur logic its insecure
20:23 < Ryozuki> xD
20:23 < Ryozuki> and no, its the other cookie
20:24 < Ryozuki> well, big changes in ddnet are always hard
20:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh. Lua or another script language support would be great. But it would be hard to implement
20:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> as well
20:24 < Ryozuki> so i guess this will be forgotten into the abism
20:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> funcitons which you can use etc
20:24 < Ryozuki> c++ + lua is the best combination imho
20:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but then you have to add support, a lot of code?
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> wait
20:25 < Ryozuki> i think thats not a problem
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> you want client scripting or server scripting?
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> or both
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> server scripting
20:25 < Ryozuki> server scripting
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> like plugins for server in other games
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it should be as a standard teeworlds server core
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> not like a ddnet
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> imo
20:25 < Ryozuki> yeah
20:25 < Ryozuki> well idk
20:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then if you want to build  and ddrace, you can
20:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> download plugin (haha)
20:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> for score system
20:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and freezes, and here you go!!
20:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÑ
20:26 < Ryozuki> well maybe ddnet wouldn't use it, but other people maybe would
20:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup
20:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> definitely, they would.
20:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe more people would write plugisn. It's easier to use documentation with built-in funcitons, than
20:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> learn how to teeworlds-code works :V
20:28 < Ryozuki> yeah
20:28 < Ryozuki> would be easier to documentate also
20:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÉ
20:29 < HMH> well but i guess if hacking into ddnet becomes that easy we get even more spaghetticode
20:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe another branch
20:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or even repo.
20:30 < Ryozuki> why would it be easier to hack into ddnet
20:30 < Ryozuki> me no understand
20:30 < HMH> using some documented lua api vs c++
20:30 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> make a rest api first
20:30 < HMH> no need for compiling
20:31 < Ryozuki> you mean ddnet as the server software or ddnet as the whole servers
20:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Rest API first? for what?
20:33 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> Skin Database and Finished Maps
20:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or, .dll as a plugins
20:43 < HMH> dll is windows only
20:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
20:48 < Ryozuki> lua
20:48 < Ryozuki> python
20:48 < Ryozuki> .a is for linux
20:50 < HMH> do you also know the one for macOS :P ?
20:50 < Ryozuki> idk never had one
20:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> python sounds
20:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> the best
20:50 < Ryozuki> lua is better with c++
20:51 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> they lua :V
20:51 <@EastByte> .a is a static lib though, you probably mean .so
20:51 < Ryozuki> h yea

22:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
22:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with tee-ish shop
22:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I win
22:27 < Learath2> the only acceptable use of lua in tw code would be gamecore imho
22:28 < Learath2> i've really thought about whether lua scripting would be of any use, but its just useful for botters
22:29 < Ryozuki> server sided?
22:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> for botters
22:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> server sided?
22:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ;O
22:29 < Ryozuki> i mean lua only for server
22:29 < Ryozuki> bots cant use that then
22:29 < Learath2> yeah but what plugin would you make?
22:29 < Learath2> i tried to think of some
22:29 < Ryozuki> and they already can use ath client to bot with lua
22:29 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> none, it's useless
22:29 < Ryozuki> you could basically make all ddnet gamemode in lua
22:30 < Ryozuki> maybe would be more maintainable
22:30 < Ryozuki> idk
22:30 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> hfhf
22:30 < Learath2> well we are maintaining it just fine :P
22:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I guess
22:30 < Learath2> without the performance overhead aswell
22:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> People has ideas
22:30 < Ryozuki> and would also allow new programmers
22:30 < Ryozuki> easier doc
22:30 < Ryozuki> xD
22:30 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> omg the spam
22:30 < Learath2> tbh i don't want new coders if they are going to half ass it
22:30 < Ryozuki> you can write some core parts in c++
22:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but don't have knowledge about teecode
22:31 < Ryozuki> teelang
22:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and, it should be (in my opinion)
22:31 < Learath2> as i said the only thing that would be nice would be gamecore
22:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> used in clear teeworlds(as a core), rather than ddnet one.
22:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> give real idea, because so far there is nothing
22:31 < Learath2> so you can upload a gamecore to the client
22:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> If you wanna make add-ons, make a merge request, no need for an extra scripting lang
22:32 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> imo
22:32 < Learath2> could have really nice gamemodes if one can modify the gamecore without completely breaking prediction
22:33 < Ryozuki> "In games, game logic and configuration are typically contained in script files. These scripts can easily be updated by non-programmers (like the designer) to tweak the gameplay. Script languages are easy and act in a forgiving manner for that purpose."
22:33 < Learath2> well our gameplay is mostly in maps and they are easily edited by non programmers
22:33 < Learath2> game logic as said would be cute
22:33 < Ryozuki> cute xD
22:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Idea ? New programmers, new posibilities. Someone would make a plugin to i.e. store scores/times whatever. Then another plugin could add another features
22:34 < Learath2> do you remember Nodes?
22:34 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I do!
22:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> the gamemod?
22:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea
22:35 < Learath2> was really fun but it died off cause people needed a new client
22:35 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> true
22:35 < Learath2> we could do things like that if we had a way to send gamecore to clients
22:35 < Ryozuki> mods that require new client are usually going to die
22:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't understand?
22:35 < Ryozuki> why you would need that?
22:35 < Learath2> need what?
22:35 < Ryozuki> send gamecore
22:36 < Learath2> that way you can modify/add new physics and mechanics all the while keeping perfect prediction
22:36 < Ryozuki> yeah
22:36 < Ryozuki> then
22:37 < Ryozuki> break vanilla compat
22:37 < Learath2> wouldn't even need to break vanilla compat if you don't really want to with lua gamecore
22:37 < Ryozuki> :o
22:37 < Learath2> new servers could send NETMSG_PLXGETCORE and we could have the default gamecore ported over
22:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> <Learath2> that way you can modify/add new physics and mechanics all the while keeping perfect prediction like.... tune zones?
22:38 < Learath2> tune zones modify physics that is already there
22:38 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> you can modify much more
22:38 < Ryozuki> i think tunes had a limitation because pred
22:39 < Learath2> a more accurate example of what i was thinking is adding a dash
22:39 < Learath2> adding a proper wall jump
22:39 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I tangled up.
22:39 < Learath2> anyways even that is not a good enough reason to invest manpower in lua stuff :P
22:40 < Ryozuki> sad
22:40 < Learath2> the amount of work required to do something like what you propose is ridiculous
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> true
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> It would be great, if teeworlds would be that big as a minecraft is
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> haha
22:41 < Learath2> first you'd need to modify teeworlds core to have lua plugins, and then you'd need to port over ddnet to lua
22:41 < Learath2> and lua is a pretty meh language
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you don't need to port ddnet to lua
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> What else then? Than lua?
22:43 < Learath2> well lua is the best choice in this case
22:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Or just convert from another language to lua
22:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> after writing the plugin :
22:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> TeeLang
22:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> hahah
22:44 <@heinrich5991> "whitespace fix"
22:44 <@heinrich5991> literally the third line is already wrong
22:45 <@heinrich5991> extra space between if and (
22:45 < Learath2> well i really don't know what i'd make in a plugin if we are keeping ddnet itself C
22:46 < Learath2> heinrich5991: that file is full of stuff that is off in style
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe you nothing, but it gives possibilities to others, if it would be good interface between plugins and teeworlds-code
22:46 < Learath2> wasn't sure if i'd touch it
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> "<heinrich5991> extra space between if and (" u treat if like a function? :v
22:47 <@heinrich5991> tw does that
22:47 <@heinrich5991> the missing space
22:48 < Learath2> there shouldn't be a space there imho
22:48 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> u crazy
22:48 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't matter
22:48 <@heinrich5991> :D
22:48 < Learath2> and there shouldn't be paranthesis in a sizeof
22:49 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> CookieAlex slaps Learath2 around a bit with a large trout
22:50 < Learath2> ikr not a popular stance on style :P
