02:18 < bridge> <reitw> if you are home hosting you have to open ports
02:19 < bridge> <_oropher> I mean it is in a hosting and the ports are open, the strange thing is that when I compile it in a docker and I gave him if for the sql is when the register fails, if I compile it in sql off if it registers it.
02:48 < bridge> <Ewan> if you are paying for a vps there may be a web control panel you can access to see their firewall
02:48 < bridge> <Ewan> make sure it's accessible through both your OS's firewall and your host's
02:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you will usually have neither by default
03:36 < bridge> <_oropher> and query, I have been looking for the kog maps, with the voting configuration, does it exist in any repository ?
04:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @.a0040 to build with debug symbols go to your build folder and run ``cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && make`` then you can run it with gdb again and the gdb `bt` command should show you details you can then report to fokkonaut here https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/issues/
04:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @_oropher no kog is quite closed
04:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean the maps it self you can download in game or on their website https://kog.tw/#p=maps but their infrastructure is fully closed source
04:38 < bridge> <teero777> The download doesn't work I think xd
04:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trol kog

09:23 < bridge> <reitw> @heinrich5991 what's the current state of bans command ? Pagination still temporary?
10:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what bans command/pagination you're referring to
10:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ingame rcon?
10:42 < bridge> <avolicious> Sadly you cant rotate the confetti üò¶
10:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> no confetti rotation D:
10:49 < bridge> <patiga> Hey, could I become code owner of src/game/editor/mapitems/map_io.cpp? I tend to miss changes to the map format, but would like to have a say whenever changes happen. I also try to be compatible with twmap, which I was now often behind on after some changes (e.g. the most recent change: empty quads/sounds layers)
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> ```json
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> {"response":"failure","message":"Order could not be created","data":"Failed"}
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> ```
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> 
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> I love this shitty api
11:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do these APIs usually communicate this through the HTTP status code, too?
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> Depends on the error. This api returns a 500 on invalid json, 200 on that failure above (missing field in valid json)
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess the first one should be 400 instead?
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how would you design such an API wrt. HTTP status codes?
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> 400 for both imo
11:09 < bridge> <louis> wait whats bad abt that üíÄ other than the redundant failure message
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nonspecific error
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's unclear what's wrong
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> It took me 40 minutes to figure out why the "order could not be created"
11:10 < bridge> <louis> what you it rather do?
11:10 < bridge> <learath2> The correct error message should be `"Order could not be created: Validation failed: Missing field 'currency'"`
11:11 < bridge> <louis> oh
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or even just "couldn't parse input"
11:11 < bridge> <louis> oh like a shop order or something i see
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> (which it correctly does for some other fields, so someone manually added the correct error return for some cases and not others)
11:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it doesn't even tell you that it's the input that's wrong, rather than some external API it couldn't contact
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> I diffed it against a payload that I knew worked as a last resort
11:13 < bridge> <learath2> Then I started adding fields until I found the one that is actually required, (the api docs mark "currency" optional)
11:13 < bridge> <learath2> And the docs are for an older version of the api, we just got an updates document that only reports changed paths but payload changes are like surprise eggs, you figure them out when your old requests don't work through the new path
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> If this is the state of apis in the wild I'm starting to see why people need backend engineers üòÑ
11:15 < bridge> <louis> is there any shortcut to click the editor layer eyeball so that only that layer is visible and everything else invisible?
11:33 < bridge> <reitw> Yes, bans command showing the ban list
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not aware of any, but also haven't looked at the code
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> Probably permanent. It does make sense to paginate long results even if we fix the underlying protocol shortcoming
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> since playing modded minecraft i have the urge to do mods
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> and looks like there is more mod loaders nowadays
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> forge was forked into neoforge
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> and there is fabric
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:30 < bridge> <reitw> Alright, it seems like you can do `bans 1200` and will not print out that the page does not exist. Also doesn't print the number of available pages
12:46 < bridge> <reitw> I should learn how to pull req, never done it before. Maybe I can make bans better
12:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> @reitw call me, i'll teach you the ways of githubbing
12:47 < bridge> <reitw> I'm not home but later why not
12:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> üëç
12:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> thought you were big githubber :0
12:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> gitlabber :(
12:48 < bridge> <reitw> I'm what we call the worst and laziest githuber
12:48 < bridge> <reitw> master only pusher
12:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> oof
12:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> force pusher?
12:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> the only right way of pushing
12:48 < bridge> <reitw> Ah not that one
12:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> are you a jedi?
12:48 < bridge> <reitw> But spam pusher too
12:49 < bridge> <reitw> Well only on my repo, should learn to be clean lmao
12:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'll show you basics, fork, new branch, PR, squash, (how to be nice so your stuff gets merged) etc etc!
12:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> "how to be nice"
12:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> put that one at the end
12:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
12:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> cuz that will take a lifetime
12:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> i played CoD with Rei, trust me.. i know :(
12:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
12:51 < bridge> <reitw> Lmao, first game top1
12:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw: true
12:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> can't have everything
13:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41187470
13:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds pretty bad
13:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (see also https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/09/core_python_developer_suspended_coc/)
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> interesting
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> github does not disable the auto merge when force pushing
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds rather dangerous
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i already saw that on the pr that should not be named xd
13:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> lemme fuess
13:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> chiller's pr
13:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> guess
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still dont understand how confetti are that much less controversial than the colored broadcast
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> protocol decisions being merged without a clear plan or discussion
13:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only for people with write access to the repository
13:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> AFAIK
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the name whos name should not be merged was chillers
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the pr whos name should not be merged was chillers
13:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> speaking of the devil
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga you have my vote as code owner xd. What does being code owner even mean? Is there a github feature that can give you notifications if parts of the code are touched?
13:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the confetti is a simple net object, and it's even used in ddnet directly
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the pr whos name should not be said was chillers
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i was so sure it would
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the broadcast thing invented a text markup language for a thing that ddnet had no use case for
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (so far)
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also broadcast how you want to use them sound like they must be kinda stable.
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the confetti can simply be removed again
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i had known it does not abort the force push i would have closed the pr. But i was soooo sure it would abort the merge. It did with bors iirc
13:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, this concludes my guess ._.
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ why can confetti be removed and broadcast cant?
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs u rely on it logically or not
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want to abuse it for your mod
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> same applies for confetti?
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure, but that mod has yet to be invented xD
13:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, we made it kinda clear that it's the finish effect
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ddnet its just visual rn
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 we didnt its now also the birthday effect xd
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats my point
13:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> already fixed, see my PR from an hour or so ago
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i think the color broadcast use case for ddnet was pretty clear imo. 
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ok 
13:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> how about a net object for broadcast color
13:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> ._.
13:14 < bridge> <patiga> yep, is part of the review thing https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
13:14 < bridge> <patiga> I hope to stay up-to-date with map format changes with this
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you got the role? @patiga 
13:15 < bridge> <patiga> yes
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> CoC suck, indeed
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki r u in holidays?
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki do you compile mesa with high optmizations?
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> flags
13:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> having no rules sucks as well. I don't think you can take one malfunction to declare that CoCs as a concept don't work
13:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but this example looks very bad indeed
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i Guess o2
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki do ppls say "I use neoforge BTW" ?
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ppl*
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
13:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> it doesnt disable it when the person forcepushing has write access*
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 2nd time i requested a protocol change on a pending pr and got ignored until it was merged but then the change was applied after that -.-
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is true, but apparently also for those without xD
13:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah man why is it that autoscrolling isnt working
13:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> i always answer to things that have been asnwererd already XDD
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where can i obtain a maintainer role to be taken seriously :p 
13:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> huh? i forcepushed like 3 of my PR's that cancled the auto-merge
13:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> doesnt sound like intended behaviour at all
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it must be some kind of bug xD
13:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> and really damn dangerous XDDD
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the epic 0.7 bug
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deen force pushed before you right?
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u just changed the author again
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ouuu
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if that is the reason
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does maintainer force push unlock the epic bug?
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github 0d
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe, dunno xd
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or github didnt see it as "real" change
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ayyy
13:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> such a feature would sound very dangerous
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet 0.7 by deen -.-
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will cry forever about this xd
13:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> still sounds horribly abusable if it works with actual code-changes aswell, when you're then able to just git rm *, force push it and annoyingly delete the repo for a short amount of time :kekw:
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ismt there force push with leasw
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> lease
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723548374.png
13:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> dennisdragon who?
13:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD wtf
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> imo it should cancel the auto merge even for repo members.
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can easily forget to disable it, if you happen to add something last minute
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then all go sleep and u have it in xd
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye thats crazy
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û no it did not merge the forced pushed things. It merged the things before the force push. So it will be missing the latest fix or the unaudited malicious change.
13:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah okay, i see - thanks!Q
13:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah okay, i see - thanks!
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait wat

16:41 < bridge> <.a0040> yeah
16:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> then it's not the firewall

22:30 < bridge> <reitw> mysql shouldn't cause the issue
22:37 < bridge> <reitw> what happens if you disable sixup
22:37 < bridge> <reitw> sv_sixup 0 I think
22:39 < bridge> <joaquocl> same,

23:19 < bridge> <zhn> @patiga im sorry for ping, but is there a way to iterate over layers to do same thing for underlying `Array2` field without matching it? im trying to reshape all physics layers from on dim to another, didn't find any other way (but there is, i guess?)
23:23 < bridge> <nouaa> I think he means for F-DDrace entities
23:24 < bridge> <.a0040> yeah
23:24 < bridge> <.a0040> does anyone have invite for fokko discord ?
23:24 < bridge> <nouaa> which is true, the client displays no explanation for all gamemodes except ddrace
23:24 < bridge> <nouaa> mp
23:24 < bridge> <.a0040> yeah i checked the source
23:25 < bridge> <nouaa> looks like there are for fng
23:28 < bridge> <patiga> you can do generic programming with this trait: https://docs.rs/twmap/0.12.4/twmap/trait.TilemapLayer.html
23:32 < bridge> <zhn> le god patiga üôè
23:32 < bridge> <totar> I'm not really a fan of #8542 adding legacy 64 client support forever, but I guess it's already mostly done so it will get added.
23:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8542
23:33 < bridge> <totar> protocol is so bloated D:
23:34 < bridge> <patiga> @gerdoe that was the briefest explanation ever, ping me on things I should elaborate ^^
23:35 < bridge> <zhn> 18 loc into 4 :owo:
23:35 < bridge> <patiga> (btw feel free to ping me whenever you have anything twmap related, I'm glad whenever those libraries/tools are of use)
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> hm, i can't just do
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> ```rust
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> fn clear_layer(layer: &mut impl TilemapLayer) {
23:45 < bridge> <zhn>     layer.tiles_mut().unwrap_mut().fill(Default::default())
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> }
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> map.physics_group_mut().layers.iter_mut().map(|layer| clear_layer(layer));
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> ```
23:45 < bridge> <zhn> since `physics_group(_mut).layers` is just a vector of `Layer`
23:46 < bridge> <zhn> there's no way to divide them into physics layers and other layers i guess
23:46 < bridge> <patiga> you still need to match the layer, but on each tilemap layer, you can then call that function
23:46 < bridge> <patiga> here I define a function that uses the trait
23:46 < bridge> <patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/a7ed9ac7fbc27544610b0211158ad9c86adc627b/twmap/src/map/edit/mirror.rs#L134
23:46 < bridge> <patiga> here I call that function on the layer with matching
23:46 < bridge> <patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/a7ed9ac7fbc27544610b0211158ad9c86adc627b/twmap/src/map/edit/mirror.rs#L66
23:47 < bridge> <patiga> ah you asked for smth without matching
23:48 < bridge> <patiga> there is no function without matching. but with this trait, you can access the `Array2` of any tilemap layer, and do stuff with generic programming
23:48 < bridge> <zhn> hm, what if you divide `Layer` into `Physics(PhycicsLayers) [which is another enum :/]` and `Design(DesignLayer) [same here]`? another layer of abstraction and not quite useful
23:49 < bridge> <zhn> but easier for using with `TilemapLayer` xd
23:49 < bridge> <patiga> I don't quite see yet how that makes it easier
23:49 < bridge> <zhn> hm, what if you divide `Layer` into `Physics(PhycicsLayer) [which is another enum :/]` and `Design(DesignLayer) [same here]`? another layer of abstraction and not quite useful
23:49 < bridge> <patiga> you'd still need to handle all the different tile types
23:50 < bridge> <zhn> not since all physics layers are tilemaps, arent they
23:50 < bridge> <zhn> design layers are just for tiles, quads and sounds
23:51 < bridge> <zhn> and `PhysicsLayer` will implement `TilemapLayer`
23:51 < bridge> <zhn> what do you think? i just don't know if it fits in twmap
23:51 < bridge> <zhn> what do you think? i just don't know if it fits in terms oftwmap
23:52 < bridge> <zhn> what do you think? i just don't know if it fits in terms of twmap
23:53 < bridge> <patiga> it can't really implement `TilemapLayer`, as it can't give a concrete type `T` for which it will return `Array2<T>`
23:54 < bridge> <zhn> dead
23:54 < bridge> <patiga> that can't be done dynamically with such a trait
