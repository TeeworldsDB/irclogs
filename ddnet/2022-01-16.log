09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does anyone know how the bug where someone falls directly into 2 ppl hammerflying and skips into the middle of them works?
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Logically, probably similar to skipping through doors with speed.
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> tick-based
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Never done it before / seen it happen though, I think
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It would just require far more speed, since the tee's hitbox is far less forgiving.
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Sounds unrealistic to do without some form of gaining speed, grenade, reverse speedfl, or something of the sort

13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @murpi you guys just need a entity design for the live freeze?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> probably, not sure if deen already received any submissions
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If i have two clients open and download the same map at the same time how is it made sure there are no conflicts? Is the tmp download file containing some pid or something? I think iv seen such code but can not find it anymore

15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nvm got it
17:25 <+breton> would anybody be so kind and ban blockers from ddnet-rus - novice, the one on port 8301?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ok
17:35 <+breton> yykkle too please
17:36 <+breton> thank you
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a\: buse
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need a new terminal emulator because the author of urxvt is racist against gentoo users
18:21 <+breton> if anybody from moderators is still kind enough, could you please stop the name changing spam on the same server? A player changes a nick every 5 seconds, and even muting them does not prevent a message about it
18:22 <+breton> the whole chat looks like this: *** 'D1mple' changed name to 'elpm1D'; *** 'elpm1D' changed name to 'D1mple'
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ñ•Î±âˆ‚â„“ÏƒÎ½Ñ”ðŸ–¤> hi is it legal have a ddnet with 3 dumies?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> alacritty
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made in rust
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ive been using it for long now
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no problems
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also has a vim like mode itself
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho i never used it
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is alacritty the terminal that is gpu accelerated?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well it uses opengl
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u show the drama
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used kitty on macOS for a while, I wonder how it is
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need my weekend dose of it
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i used kitty before
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think alacritty is faster
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its rusty so
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not really drama per se. I'm just jilted enough by the way he typed that to look for a new terminal emulator

18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i have drama for u, the multimc author uses open source licenses but doesnt like other ppl using the software as they like
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/riitbs/multimc_is_dropping_all_support_for_aur_packages/
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> multimc is a minecraft launcher to handle mods
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These people are all like very stupid...
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/wiki/FAQ
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you not read the license before you put it on your code?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so this fork was made
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The maintainer of MultiMC has been hostile to other people packaging it, and has taken an anti-user approach removing features from the software to make it harder to package for a system install. Therefore, this project was made to allow anyone to distribute this as they please, without needless obstructions that the MultiMC maintainer seems to deem necessary. Additionally, this allows for full-system installs, building from source (and y
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a huge similar drama I just remembered, the sshfs drama
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the reason he chose this is cuz he wanted other ppl to provide patches, but alwayus under his control
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clueless
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah it was osxFUSE
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He made the thing closed source and he only provides binary releases now
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Someone can't even take over because apple won't give out kernel extension signing certificates anymore
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> literally holding us all hostage using power vested in him by apple

19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh i was wondering when you started that PolyMC that it sounded so similar to MultiMC. Yea the aur package always seemed outdated maybe itâ€™s time to switch. But isnâ€™t PolyMC then lacking the main maintainer?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ñ•Î±âˆ‚â„“ÏƒÎ½Ñ”ðŸ–¤> pls
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hey, I need some help. I am trying to delete an element from a vector and I am doing it the same way I have always done it.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I get a vector erase iterato out of range somehow. how is that possible?

19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i have a question, when im holding keys and press the text button those keys keep being held right
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can not call erase(begin()) either. what kind of witchcraft is this
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no matter if cleared before, or adding size checks... Its wicked
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen i need you
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :(
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ye you can use 3 dummies
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Very funny: I can output values from the vector element DoorNumber even. Also, it works as it should, just this erasing does not work. Weird af
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try ASAN, maybe some memory is corrupted?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make a small example?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Is this related?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32293516/increment-begin-of-a-list-in-c-stl-doesnt-work
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i've added a vector to CDoorTile so that multiple doors can be on one spot. right now the size of each tile is either 0 or 1, depending on whether there is a door or not on that tile
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i push them back, and iterate over them to find the index, then i use the index which i can also access and get values from, and then when i try to erase the index when i remove a door, this error occurs
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It doesnt seem like
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when i hover over m_pDoor

21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is the size different?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut you shouldn't erase from a vector while iterating over it, that won't work in c++
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1. why?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2. i dont even do :D i iterate over it once to know the index, which i then can remove (one at a time)
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> funny thing is, I couldnt even get erase(begin()) to work, it just says iterator outside range
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you erase from the same vector that you used begin on?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> erasing with index should work as long as you don't use the iterators afterwards
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as I said, make a small example in a single cpp file, then others can check
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can, sure, but I dont get it at all you know, because I do this behaviour more than 2 or 3 times in my code
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And it works, just in this case noz
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not*
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I even tried to delete it instantly after pushed back, it didnt work :D
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hard to debug without seeing all the code
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i can invite u if you'd like. I doubt a small code example would help because it would probably not happen :D
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways, about what you said; I see the complications about iterating and removing, but how would it be done then if needed? (unrelated rn)
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I think you are for-looping over the vector. 
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If you remove an element from a vector, you are changing also the size of the vector. 
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Index is now pointing to next (if exist).
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> For loop will increase index in any case and loop will skip one element each time one element  is erased.
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> We are supposing some code that we cannot see ðŸ˜…
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't loop with iterators and delete, it's just not possible in C++
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can iterate with indexes and delete if you are careful, just need to update the end index of the loop when you delete
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> will doing it while reverse iterating work?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or you can do it the C++17 way, `std::algorithm::remove_if`
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As far as I'm aware, the standard says all iterators are invalid after a `std::vector::erase`
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually just checked it and it says it only invalidates iterators at and after the one you delete
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> oh, ok. it has worked the times I've tried it, but wasn't sure if it was always guaranteed to work
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just took a look at the standard and it seems you can erase going forwards but you need to be careful how you do it, you can't just do a range based for loop
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `for(auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end();) { it = condition(*it) ? vec.erase(it) : it + 1; }` should work(tm)\
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Notice you can't cache the end iterator, nor can you just it++ after every iteration
