00:09 <@heinrich5991> yes. it's the first mention of indentation today :)
08:32 < necropotame> I've added two new labels: todo and toreproduce. That way we can have a list of boring things that must be done. We have more than 80 issues, which is far enough to forget a lot of things that must be done :)
08:37 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: what is todo?
08:39 < Learath2> didnt we already have "need info"?
09:13 < necropotame> Todo: no more discussion needed, someone just need to do it (it's for small things)
09:15 < necropotame> Need info is for which kind of info? I would like to add todiscuss too, but maybe it's too much ^^
10:17 < MagicLau> I wanna build a Chinese website for Teeworlds, and I see the status can automatic update in ddnet.tw, how can i do this ?
10:18 < MagicLau> QwQ should i read and learn code of ddnet's client?
10:22 <@deen> MagicLau: it's kind of hacky, you might not want to copy that
10:23 <@deen> MagicLau: basically we have a python script running to recreate the /status site every 2 minutes
10:23 <@deen> and it just sends the udp packets to all servers and checks how many players they have
10:27 < MagicLau> So if I want to check our Chinese servers, i could use script send request to server?
10:28 <@deen> yeah
10:28 < MagicLau> (Sorry i dont know how server works yet ;()
10:29 < MagicLau> Where should I start to solve the problem?
10:35 <@deen> MagicLau: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ddnet.py#L553
10:35 <@deen> that's our code
10:35 <@deen> i think there are easier to use tools for that in php
10:35 <@deen> maybe someone else in this channel knows
10:38 < laxadedi> MagicLau: there is an old php that does it
10:39 < laxadedi> https://ddracepro.net/status
10:39 < laxadedi> that's live status, and not cached
10:39 < laxadedi> I can give you the PHP code, but that's probably doing what deen script is doing but it's hooked directly on the page
10:53 < MagicLau> woah, thx

12:31 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: btw, you don't need to make static definitions top-level
12:31 <@heinrich5991> they can reside in functions as well

12:35 < necropotame> heinrich5991, I know, it's just that I see text/localization as top level elements :)
12:37 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: yea, but it's only used once :)
