02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <drek> Hello, I opened my ddnet with vulkan to try it out and it bugged the entire client, now every time I press to open it without vulkan it's all buggy... the buttons are there but there's nothing written in them like it just disappears the text
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝓑𝓲𝓵𝓵𝔂> what

02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <drek> and every time it opens with vulkan even tho I don't want to open it with vulkan
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝓑𝓲𝓵𝓵𝔂> Try fix it on the files or reinstall it
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <drek> I already reinstalled it and it didn't fix it
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝓑𝓲𝓵𝓵𝔂> Or is your pc
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <drek> no, I was running it just fine earlier today
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝓑𝓲𝓵𝓵𝔂> Ok, idk how fix it
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝓑𝓲𝓵𝓵𝔂> :justatest:
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <drek> all good, ty for your time

04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Discord Mod
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> uhh can you even remove bridge messages?
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like do you have permission
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @murpi @Zwelf we're getting memed
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> welp, we can
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you use an AMD card update to a stable driver from 2022 from amd.com, then it should work:
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. it should say:
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "Adrenalin 22.5.1 Recommended (WHQL)"
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <drek> ty
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks bump
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt we'd get an answer before the new driver leaves beta, but it might be a good idea
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i've no idea, i just used the bug report tool that shipped with the amd drivers, but if you find one it's a good idea probably
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is a amdhelp subreddit xd
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did post the forum link there
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> how does it feel to have a recommendation to disable SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading) on AMD's processors :giga_chad:
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like a direct line to actual proper staff and people seem to get a proper internal ticket within like a month. Maybe we'll get lucky?
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess its worth a try
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in fact disabling SMT might slightly increase single thread performance
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but decrease single core performance
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's a new side channel vulnerability called Squip
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> on amd zen 1 2 & 3
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there are new vulnerabilities every day now xD
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> possibly apple's chips too
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> possibly apple's chips too (not sure)
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wonder when the first hardware fixes come in
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> feels like processors completly suck, if all vendors are hit by these^^
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> We're lucky to have researchers finding that tho, can't imagine myself being able to find 1% of their work lmao
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you are in the topic u probably just think about edge cases and then find stuff like that
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its really lot about having the knowledge of whats going on
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> cybersecurity isn't my main, but it looks cool
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How on earth do they come up with these??
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk lmao
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> next few years they'll find an atomic vulnerability to collect data for sure :sue:
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> They tryhard so much
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> could be interesting to know the time spent to find that side chann vuln
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i guess since spectre there also is quite some money flow for these researches
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or whatever the first one was called
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> meltdown?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the proper fix to this will probably be so annoying. Having to ditch your multiple scheduler scheme or having to make all schedulers "indistinguishabke" somehow probably has big performance consequences
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is also this https://www.hertzbleed.com/
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not to be confused with heartbleed

10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> @Discord Mod
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga send help on map formats. What needs to change in ddnet client for 0.7 maps to be loadable. As of right now it seems to just crash the client when oining a 0.7 server. Do you know what changed in the map formats?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ChillerDragon: I think its mostly the 0.7 tilemap decompression https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/b0d979db037e6ef509d99de33b592cf187a0cb68/doc/map.md#layers search for "0.7 compression" or "skip"
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 0.7 also has a new envelope type, bezier. I'm not sure if that causes a crash, but it is very possible
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> bezier would only affect maps that actually use them though
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> anyone know a map with so many sounds that the editor list needs to scroll?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probs vali
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> among the official ddnet maps "Binary" has the most with 7, in my downloadedmaps folder the Warioware/Teeware map has the most with 35, it just barely creates a scroll bar in the editor
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1008317841721798696/WarioWare_a0f465ed.map
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe try a smaller resolution?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> thanks
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I think the UI will just get smaller then
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but I can just duplicate some sounds to add more entries
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could also just create such a map yeah
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shouldn’t be too hard
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but adding 40 entries by hand would have been annoying
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you can append a map to itself to do it efficiently ^^
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> ah, true, does this allow sounds with the same name though?
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄 exponential growth ftw
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I would think so, am not sure though
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Robyt3 are we finally getting CScrollRegion? :Celebrate:
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> doesn't appear to duplicate the items
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yes, it's almost ready for the editor layers, images and sounds lists
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> gimme a sec
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do you quickly have a small opus file?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the one I used to get 100 sounds resulted in 12 MB :/
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> the smallest one I have is 1.2 MB itself
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> ah, sorry, wrong target
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah got one with 30K
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> @Chiller I can make a PR later to port some map format changes to we can load compressed tile layers
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1008320166549012541/many_sounds.map
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```py
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> >>> import twmap
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> >>> map = twmap.Map("/usr/share/ddnet/data/maps/dm1.map")
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> >>> for i in range(100):
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ...     s = map.sounds.new_from_file(<path-to-opus-file>)
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ...     s.name = str(i + 1)
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ... 
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> >>> map.save("many_sounds.map")
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> thanks
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Thanks. Joining a map without envelopes fixed the crash \:)

16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does anyone uses msys2 ?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> cmake installed from there is not using bundled lib
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do, but not very often
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even with the use bundled libs option?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1008376796984659968/message.txt
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but cmake installed manually does work
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I bet it has sth to do with pkg-config being available in msys2. I had similar issues on macOS trying to get bundled libs used
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, even if i remove pkg_config, it still fails
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like, it's not even trying to find the lib at all
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can run cmake in its most verbose mode to see where it's going astray. I had a lot of trouble figuring this out so I gave up on it. I just dynamically link to whatever the fuck it decides to link to, then I use install_name_tool to replace it with bundled or self compiled libs
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only @heinrich5991 master of all cmake can save us from this predicament
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i don't want to install all libs into msys
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> btw, if you know how to purge pacman, im also interested 😄
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The message looks like it failed on vulkan stuff, do we even bundle that?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ofc we do
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it works fine on my manually installed cmake
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it failed on all libs
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you try a cmake --trace?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will be extremely verbose and I'm on my phone, but I can try to spot a couple things, maybe you could too
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats atleast how I debugged the macOS issue back to pkgconfig
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it sets system name to MSYS and not Windows
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which probably fails later
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That could do it
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lemme try to change cmakelist to see if it fixes it simply 🙂
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe add a if in the cmakelists to set to windows if its msys?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, now it finds vulkan but not other libs yet
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it doesn't find vulkan but still builds shaders
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, it does set dependency on:
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `/e/Teeworlds_DDNet/DDNet-fork/CMakeLists.txt(104):  set(AUTO_DEPENDENCIES_DEFAULT ON )
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is there a way for trace to expand variable instead of just printing the line?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> trace-expand 🙂
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, `--debug-find` is the magic switch i think 😄
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, `--debug-find` is the magic switch i think
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmmm: ```shell
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>  find_library considered the following locations:
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>     /e/Teeworlds_DDNet/DDNet-fork/ddnet-libs/curl/windows/lib64/(lib)curl(\.dll\.a|\.a)
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why it doesn't just consider .dll ?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> other cmake also considers .lib files
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> .lib is a msvc thing, gcc on windows just allows this, doesnt mean its the "usual" way
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in the gnu ecosystem
