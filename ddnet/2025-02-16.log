20:16 < bridge> <chairn> yes it is
20:17 < bridge> <chairn> but why do you need one ?
20:17 < bridge> <meloÆž> discord making me madge
20:17 < bridge> <learath2> Let's host a ddnet mumble server
20:17 < bridge> <chairn> actually, laxa's dead
20:17 < bridge> <meloÆž> Guilded would be an actual competitor if it werent for that roblox signup
20:17 < bridge> <learath2> Wait what? Really?
20:18 < bridge> <chairn> no, joked, sorry
20:18 < bridge> <chairn> he did break his leg though
20:18 < bridge> <chairn> and he finally got his driving license
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> Wooo
20:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> i'm now in the best teamspeak community there is
20:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1340764741789945927/image.png?ex=67b38bf8&is=67b23a78&hm=d79c7a84d57dcc00b6b5d97f4c3a626884c6a2dcd92935baeb9b7b7454e5b249&
20:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> house music radio
20:21 < bridge> <meloÆž> okay but its actually crazy how useless teamspeak is nowadays, kinda makes me sad, it looks good :/
20:21 < bridge> <learath2> Wow that's an upgrade
20:22 < bridge> <learath2> This is what it looked like last I used teamspeak
20:22 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1340765230891925545/image-9.png?ex=67b38c6d&is=67b23aed&hm=a080536a76adce6e4279a711894a22b24809fa988f7273cc67dab2d3ad8d417e&
20:22 < bridge> <meloÆž> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571> yep - sounds about right
20:22 < bridge> <meloÆž> when you had to ping your friend ingame 3823923 times so he finally tells you the password
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> huge...
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i would love a teamspeak
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> ain't now way ðŸ˜­
20:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> i would follow to whatever platform - i just dont want to use discord anymore xD
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean teamspeak may as well be IRC for text chat purposes
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> we have a matrix
20:29 < bridge> <learath2> This is a lost war, discord and the NSA won this round
20:29 < bridge> <learath2> We can at most take the developers back to irc, but there is no way the rest of the community migrates
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> if we get ddnet on teamspeak i might be able to ditch discord ðŸ˜‚
20:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> When ban?
20:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1340774456204988537/image.png?ex=67b39504&is=67b24384&hm=58f37e48aef5790a9ea52b9c5f016de00bfe7720f45df07ec27e40fba9e2fc8c&
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> is it because it has ddnet in the name?
21:06 < bridge> <meloÆž> HvH -> hacker vs hacker
21:06 < bridge> <meloÆž> also their site promotes shit
21:07 < bridge> <meloÆž> i assume they just host their own masterserver now, iirc they were banned before
21:08 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet hacker vs hacker :kekw:
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i didnt realize that was banned from the master
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought e.g. block servers allowed cheat clients
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> some
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> and i have seen them on there not labeled as HvH
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> so really which is more of an issue?
21:22 < bridge> <alw5> what did discord do to you
21:22 < bridge> <alw5> why does it look so diffrent
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ts5 vs ts3
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> good old Qt
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1340782455162011689/image.png?ex=67b39c77&is=67b24af7&hm=72ed7d8c45e537db48629abe26f81a89f35c0d45a6abcc50443164777634b5a7&
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> u can make it look more or less good without it being a web app
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> because it's made in Qt
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1340783895922344007/Untitled.png?ex=67b39dcf&is=67b24c4f&hm=dcd528cbae670828fccda1ab645d1b17f4793da38dab87e3ed1eb3b7fd66bf7b&
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i love gnu image manipulation program
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> what would i do without my wood grain fill brush
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> and without it crashing discord every time i try to paste into it?
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> teamspeak had nice plugins for in game radios
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> like arma 32
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> arma 3*
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> proximity stuff
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and channels
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> or was it arma 2
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:08 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
23:08 < bridge> <Ewan> it's dead in that regard
23:08 < bridge> <Ewan> needs video share as well
23:08 < bridge> <teero777> just accidently delete this discord
23:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> havent checked yet what the crashing inputs are
23:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> thanks ill look into that
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> Iâ€™m wondering why youâ€™re working on this thru wsl, didnâ€™t notice that before
23:36 < bridge> <robyt3> For maps it's not really interesting at the moment though. There are basically no checks so it's expected that most invalid maps crash. I'm already working on adding checks for the map format
23:36 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i dont have a native linux
23:37 < bridge> <Ewan> so what
23:37 < bridge> <robyt3> On Windows alone it wouldn't make sense without ASAN and I guess AFL++ doesn't easily compile on Windows natively
23:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Also, it avoid randomly messing up your host system if you do it in a VM because fuzzing could do unpredictable things
23:37 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea that too
23:38 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> though that is unlikely unless you are fuzzing a system program
23:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought that was a just for funsies thing didnâ€™t know thatâ€™s what the end goal was here
23:38 < bridge> <Ewan> just thinking about the map stuff
23:38 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea for the most part its just for funsies
23:38 < bridge> <robyt3> What if the random fuzzing input causes a function for file deletion to be called? :justatest:
23:38 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> and lerning
23:38 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
23:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> then rip me. though at least then i have rce
23:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also given that im running it with ASAN it would crash when the return adress was overiten anyways
