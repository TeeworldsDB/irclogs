00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> that's how you use the variable
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> your actual code would probably look something like this 
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> // in CDiscord
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> IGameClient m_pGameClient = nullptr;
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ...
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> // in SetGameInfo
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> if(!m_pGameClient) m_pGameClient = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> m_pActivityManager->update_activity(m_pActivityManager, &Activity, 0, 0);
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> if(pGameClient && pGameClient->m_Snap.m_LocalClientID >= 0 && pGameClient->m_aClients[pGameClient->m_Snap.m_LocalClientID]->m_Afk) {
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan>   str_copy(Activity.assets.small_image, "idle", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_image));
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan>   str_copy(Activity.assets.small_text, "Idling", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_text));
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> } else {
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan>   str_copy(Activity.assets.small_image, "greenline", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_image));
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan>   str_copy(Activity.assets.small_text, "In Game", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_text));
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> }
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> your actual code would probably look something like this 
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> // in CDiscord
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> IGameClient *m_pGameClient = nullptr;
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ...
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> // in SetGameInfo
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> if(!m_pGameClient) m_pGameClient = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> m_pActivityManager->update_activity(m_pActivityManager, &Activity, 0, 0);
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> if(pGameClient && pGameClient->m_Snap.m_LocalClientID >= 0 && pGameClient->m_aClients[pGameClient->m_Snap.m_LocalClientID]->m_Afk) {
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan>   str_copy(Activity.assets.small_image, "idle", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_image));
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan>   str_copy(Activity.assets.small_text, "Idling", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_text));

00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> }
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> your actual code would probably look something like this 
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp

00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> }
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry chiller
00:46 < bridge> <stormaxd> why with dots? xD
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> because they go in different places
00:46 < bridge> <stormaxd> fair enough
00:47 < bridge> <stormaxd> ok why are wo using pGameClient here?
00:47 < bridge> <stormaxd> ok why are we using pGameClient here?
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> because your player's afk value is stored in a CClientInfo object stored in an array in the game client
00:49 < bridge> <stormaxd> Alr then, 2nd question is wtheck this wont workhttps://i.imgur.com/ERiJqWT.png
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> oh mb
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> your actual code would probably look something like this 
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> // in CDiscord
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> IGameClient *m_pGameClient = nullptr;
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> ...
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> // in SetGameInfo
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> if(!m_pGameClient) m_pGameClient = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan>     m_pActivityManager->update_activity(m_pActivityManager, &Activity, 0, 0);
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> 
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> if(m_pGameClient && m_pGameClient->m_Snap.m_LocalClientID >= 0 && m_pGameClient->m_aClients[pGameClient->m_Snap.m_LocalClientID]->m_Afk) {
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan>     str_copy(Activity.assets.small_image, "idle", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_image));
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan>     str_copy(Activity.assets.small_text, "Idling", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_text));
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> } else {
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan>     str_copy(Activity.assets.small_image, "greenline", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_image));
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan>     str_copy(Activity.assets.small_text, "In Game", sizeof(Activity.assets.small_text));
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> }
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> updated
00:51 < bridge> <stormaxd> i mean, is might looks dumb from my side
00:51 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171235530810339338/image.png?ex=655bf117&is=65497c17&hm=66a44f147b39b4f0027d79100ef298c204f71e0c8be1485bc25a595852dea6fc&
00:52 < bridge> <Ewan> missed another
00:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but it should be fairly obvious
00:52 < bridge> <Ewan> m_pGameClient instead of pGameClient
00:52 < bridge> <Ewan> since it's a member
00:53 < bridge> <stormaxd> now m_Snap `No member named 'm_Snap' in 'IGameClient'`
00:54 < bridge> <stormaxd> hell, the most hard staff i made for today, was cracking discord
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i have no idea why it isn't in the IGameClient interface
00:55 < bridge> <Ewan> this is against all OOP wisdom but i don't think there's any other class inheriting from IGameClient so you should just be able to cast your IGameClient pointer into a CGameClient pointer
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> so in CDiscord class def do this instead
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> `CGameClient *m_pGameClient = nullptr;`
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> 
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> then in SetGameInfo, do this instead
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> `m_pGameClient = static_cast<CGameClient *>(Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>());`
00:59 < bridge> <stormaxd> now i can say that discord made me braindamaged
01:00 < bridge> <stormaxd> 1st day of making own client 
01:00 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://i.imgur.com/N5sSzMH.png
01:00 < bridge> <stormaxd> 4th day of learning c++ without chatGPT
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ðŸ˜ƒ
01:01 < bridge> <stormaxd> and some discord rpc https://i.imgur.com/p3eb2Jf.png
01:02 < bridge> <stormaxd> idk looks cool as for relatively 1st day
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> did u test if it works yet
01:02 < bridge> <stormaxd> what exactly?
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> the afk
01:02 < bridge> <stormaxd> its not
01:03 < bridge> <stormaxd> i give up for today
01:03 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
01:03 < bridge> <stormaxd> its 2:am
01:03 < bridge> <Ewan> oh wow
01:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> noticed that if im logged in f2, in any way my name will be = sc_player_own_color
01:05 < bridge> <Ewan> well i need to see the code
01:05 < bridge> <Ewan> to know what the issue is
01:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ðŸ˜ƒ
01:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't consider that an error tbh, it's a bit weird that you have to special case the empty case
01:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps try looking at it in wireshark
01:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, temperature scales are kinda arbitrary
01:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a friend of mine hasn't recovered from covid and still can't do any straining things or work
01:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but "long covid" doesn't really mean anything AFAIK, it's just "long-term consequences of covid", nothing precise
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a hunch that there was an infrastructure change somewhere which introduced some sort of variability in the latency
01:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> AFAIK avocado is lengths better than meat
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> because now when i'm not lagging i get 8-10 fewer ms in latency. but obviously i have the micro lags
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> thing is i never traced the route before i had this issue so idk
01:37 < bridge> <stormaxd> let me sleeep
01:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is this the EU mandated CA thing?
01:38 < bridge> <stormaxd> @mpftimagine awake and see 100500 bug report xd
01:38 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://i.imgur.com/JhISxCd.png
01:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, we're doing accounts discussion ðŸ˜„
01:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i can already see heinrich walking out the door LOL
01:40 < bridge> <stormaxd> btw
01:40 < bridge> <stormaxd> hmm
01:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> whyd you screenshot your entire client
01:42 < bridge> <stormaxd> do you want me to?
01:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what
01:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> banning versions sounds futile. once ddnet starts doing it, they'll change the version number
01:43 < bridge> <stormaxd> nvm, to sleepy for understand english
01:43 < bridge> <stormaxd> gn
01:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> goodnight
01:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no mentioning bot client names
01:45 < bridge> <yekrm> I know but a kog mod already did that so
01:45 < bridge> <yekrm> :owo:
01:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> that just makes Them in the wrong
01:47 < bridge> <yekrm> +1 At least is already known to be a malicious client
01:53 < bridge> <yekrm> I know but a kog mod already did that so... *I won't do it again*
02:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> grahh im trying to find good shader tutorials but all im getting is javascript or unity
02:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> also wait wtf vulkan and opengl are owned by the same group? LOL
02:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
03:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> LOL
04:57 < bridge> <sedonya> Put the ``OwnPlayer`` check before the ``AuthedPlayer`` check, and do ``else if``
04:59 < bridge> <sedonya> Although, in this case ``AuthedPlayer`` will not work, it is easier to just add to the check for ``AuthedPlayer`` also check for ``OwnPlayer``

13:12 < ChillerDragon> ops my bad i thought im in my dev environment
15:31 < bridge> <Zwelf> chillerdragon: It seems like https://schildi.chat/ is a functioning matrix client on mobile for android (dont remember rn whether you are on android or ios)
15:31 < bridge> <Zwelf> even the custom reactions are working
15:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im on ios :( 
15:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yo, ive got a question. I have 2 projects. They both have the same folder. Can i somehow yoink a folder from one repo and use in another or the only way is to create a separate repo with those files and use as submodule in those projects?
15:42 < bridge> <learath2> Wat?
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> You can copy them if you just need a snapshot. Otherwise use a submodule
16:42 < bridge> <Zwelf> ChillerDragon: u could try https://fluffychat.im/ I remember it being a good client, it probably works better than element on mobile (element is definitely shitty in combination with the discord bridge)
16:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yeah this client seems nicer!!! Thanks zwelf uwu
17:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @ryozuki did you know @milkeeycat is a fellow gentoo enjoyer?
17:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ryozuki is the own who guided him through iirc xD
17:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> explains the way they act too
17:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> its gentoo thing not ryo

18:49 < bridge> <learath2> I looked at this chat for a second. You hilite me
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> its  coincidence rly
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> Yes I did know. Why?
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> C++20 has barriers too btw
18:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you use it for?
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt know, iguess i never had to use it
18:52 < bridge> <learath2> When you need the workers to start working at the same time
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> why would u need that
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> benchmarking cores? xd
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 rust has had them since 1.0
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u think c++20 added them cuz rust influence?
