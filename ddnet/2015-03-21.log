03:10 < shorefire> ms saavik banning me for "hooking her" while she is afk at spawn
03:10 < shorefire> kek :D
03:52 < eeeee> maybe shes just in a bad mood today
03:53 < shorefire> deen picks the best mods lol :p
03:53 < shorefire> Shes totally a stable person who should totally have power over other people /s
03:53 < shorefire> She tried to ban maple to for hooking her but he logged in as mod lol
04:01 < eeeee> she did a lot for ddnet. and it's in your best interest to find a way to reason with her. like talk to her, explain yourself and maybe you'll come to an understanding and everyone will be happy!
04:01 < eeeee> how about that
04:03 < shorefire> I dont think "she did a lot for ddnet" justifys her being insane
04:03 < shorefire> "oh I know she causes more issues than she solves, but she did a few nice things before"
04:04 < shorefire> Not a great argument lol
04:04 < eeeee> i'm not saying you should tolerate her current behavior
04:04 < eeeee> but you have a lot of power in your hand to try to talk her out of it
04:05 < eeeee> and it's gonna be more effective than just shifting this problem over on deen who already has a fukton of stuff to worry about
04:05 < eeeee> in the long run would benefit everyone as there's still a good chance she will keep doing useful things if you don't make her hate ddnet
04:06 < shorefire> Hm
04:06 < shorefire> I disagree
04:07 < shorefire> I view it as a problem that people just choose to keep dealing with because its easier
04:07 < shorefire> when in reality she shouldnt be a moderator
04:07 < shorefire> we all know just how unstable she is
04:07 < shorefire> but hey, I hate ddnet anyway.  Lol
04:10 < eeeee> when most of active players are kids it would be a challenge to find a better moderator. and she can probably do fine if you just ask her not to do stupid shit.
04:11 < eeeee> and why do you even msg here if you hate ddnet? go away.
04:11 < shorefire> haha
04:11  * eeeee wishes he could ban shorefire 
04:11 < shorefire> now you sound like saavik to
04:11 < shorefire> Good to know you are all mature
04:11 < eeeee> yes i need the power
04:12 < eeeee> a day would come and you'll feel my wrath
04:12 < shorefire> This place sure is toxic
04:12 < eeeee> nah it's not that bad
04:13 < shorefire> not for you, you are one of them.
04:13 < eeeee> one of whom

19:10 <@EastByte> resolves to:
19:10 <@EastByte> setpixel_104020((&pbuf_104112), 7, 7, ((NU8) 240), ((NU8) 0), ((NU8) 0), ((NU8) 255));
19:10 <@EastByte> nim macros are awesome :)
19:32 <@deen> cool
19:33 <@deen> that's a pretty nice and convenient use case of macros
19:33 <@EastByte> yea, I think so too
19:39 <@EastByte> oh, f should probably resolve to 0xff instead of 0xf0
19:42 <@deen> yeah
19:42 <@deen> otherwise you can't have real white
