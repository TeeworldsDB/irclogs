11:37 < Tobii> Shiki: when you stand on a ddrace start line it spams the StartGame event
11:37 < Tobii> oh he left
12:15 < Shiki> found the root cause of the problem -- it's about ddnet server sending new round flag on each tick when player is standing in the start zone
12:15 < Shiki> and implementation starts demo recording after each new round
12:16 < Shiki> is there a way to tell if we're standing in this start zone so we can ensure that demo recording starts only once there?
12:46 < Tobii> race demos are already handled in race_demo.cpp
12:59 < Shiki> setting cl_auto_race_record to 0 doesn't seem to have any effect
12:59 < Shiki> demo recording is still started and stopped several times per second
13:02 < Tobii> i meant you dont have to start the normal autorecord at all if the player passes the start line
13:04 < Shiki> hm, so how do I tell if player passes the start line?
13:15 < Tobii> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/d7e5a7b9abfdfd1da032df6a5b19896e0c0e15af/src/game/client/components/race_demo.cpp#L30
13:16 < Shiki> so TILE_BEGIN is that start tile?
13:17 < Tobii> yes
13:17 < Shiki> thanks!
