00:02 < laxa> I am on teamspeak with crayonic :)
00:02 <@deen> map was immediately fixed, but mapper sent me unfixed version again...
00:02 <@deen> so i had to fix it again when i realized 1 day later

00:23 <@deen> the teerace mod uses dirty tricks to get around recording too much on their serverside autorecord
00:29 < Savander> wow
00:29 <@deen> Savander: hi
00:29 < Savander> DDNet Ger back
00:29 < Savander> ;3
00:29 <@deen> yes, and i'm working on serverside autorecorded demos for each player
00:29 < Savander> hi :)
00:29 < Savander> Wow
00:29 < Savander> nice, like
00:29 < Savander> teerace?
00:29 <@deen> yes
00:29 < Savander> awesoem!
00:29 < Savander> awesome!
00:29 <@deen> i'm not sure if it will cause lags, but we will see
00:30 < Savander> ye, so many peoples
00:30 < Savander> ye, so many people
00:30 <@deen> i have a feeling it should be threaded and that would lead to problems
00:31 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went down!
00:31 < Savander> wut?
00:31 < Savander> Chile down?
00:32 <@deen> all the time, not sure if it's bad connection to europe or chileans have the same problem
00:33 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went back online!
00:34 < Savander> don't know, but also amount of ppl on chille is 1 now
00:34 < Savander> so maybe chileans had problems too
00:34 < Savander> or it was just serverlist, nvm
00:35 < Savander> btw.. i have to go :) Goodnight
00:35 <@deen> i see 50 players on a single chilean server :P
00:35 <@deen> good night
00:35 < Savander> ye
00:35 < Savander> but i saw 1 
00:35 < Savander> when chilean servers went back 
00:36 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went down!
00:36 < Savander> it looks like problem xD
00:36 < Savander> btw, on serverlist (in teeworlds)
00:36 < Savander> same problem?
00:37 < Savander> In showing chile servers?
00:37 < laxa> deen: nice, quite happy that you work on serverside demo record
00:38 <@deen> well, the connection Chile - Europe is just bad currently
00:38 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went back online!
00:38 <@deen> happens rather often
00:38 < Savander> ok :), have a nice night! :P :D
00:40 <@deen> good night
00:46 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went down!
00:46 < Maple> hey
00:46 < Maple> have you guys heard about shellshock
00:46 < Maple> http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html
00:48 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went back online!
00:49 <@deen> Maple: yes, we just shared logs about how they tried to attack us^^
00:49 <@deen> 89.207.135.125 - - [25/Sep/2014:11:10:56 +0200] "GET /cgi-sys/defaultwebpage.cgi HTTP/1.0" 301 178 "-" "() { :;}; /bin/ping -c 1 198.101.206.138"
00:55 < Maple> scary
00:56 <@deen> nah, i don't think we were vulnerable
00:56 <@deen> and i updated before that
00:56 <@deen> i don't even like bash :P
00:57 <@deen> all these vulnerabilities recently, but DDNet has no problems because we don't use any of this weird stuff like SSL or bash
00:58 <@deen> but demo recording won't work with save
00:59 < Maple> what does demo recording and /save have to do with it
01:00 <@deen> nothing
01:00 < Maple> are you thinking of saving the demos on the server?
01:00 <@deen> yes
01:00 <@deen> currently implementing it
01:02 < Maple> hawt
01:06 < laxa> deen: I found a remote shell with bash vuln
01:07 <@deen> huh?
01:07 < laxa> Serveur : wargame.newbiecontest.org 
01:07 < laxa> Port : 22222 
01:07 < laxa> Login : level01 
01:07 < laxa> Mot de passe : level01 
01:07 <@deen> is it supposed to be like that or did you hack the newbiecontest?
01:07 < laxa> it's not supposed
01:08 < laxa> they haven't patched
01:08 < laxa> I'll contact them asap
01:08 < laxa> so they fix it
01:08 <@deen> http://www.newbiecontest.org/forums/index.php?topic=4217.msg57012;topicseen#new
01:08 <@deen> don't think you're the first to notice :P
01:09 <@deen> i don't know, i would never have trusted bash enough to use it for something connected to the internet
01:09 <@deen> whenever i use shell scripts something goes wrong with string handling
01:15 <@deen> these demos grow like crazy
01:16 <@deen> i'm alone on the server and it's 8 KB / s
01:22 <@deen> ah no, that was the client demo
01:22 <@deen> the server demo is much nicer
01:58 <@deen> i think demo recording works!
02:02 <@deen> the writes are without flush, so it might just work
02:03 <@deen> i think I'll try enabling it on FRA

04:16 < _KinG> hi all
04:16 < _KinG> deen:  hi u here?
04:17 <@deen> _KinG: I'm just going to sleep
04:17 <@deen> hi
04:18 < _KinG> ok deen  parham just left and we couldn't pay for vps without parham but chucky and F1rst helped can u write it in news?
04:18 < _KinG> i mean persian is going to be up because of chuky and f1rst
04:19 <@deen> in what news?
04:19 < _KinG> persian server news
04:19 <@deen> there are no persian server news
04:19 <@deen> there are just global ddnet news
04:19 < _KinG> the motd
04:19 < _KinG> ow
04:19 <@deen> it's the same everywhere
04:20 < _KinG> well
04:20 < _KinG> can't u somhow write it somewhere that they helped our servers to stay up? ^^
04:20 <@deen> I can write it on http://ddnet.tw/
04:21 <@deen> i could also write it in the global news i guess
04:21 < _KinG> i think that will be enough
04:21 < _KinG> ok i just wanted to inform people that without them ddnet was going to be down in iran ^^
04:21 <@deen> DDNet Persian staying up thanks to KinG, bor, chucky & F1rst?
04:22 <@deen> like that or what?
04:22 < _KinG> yes 
04:22 <@deen> ok, done
04:22 < _KinG> thanks dude

05:05 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went down!
05:06 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went back online!
09:21 < pause> Charlie is down, i repeat, charlie is down
10:24 < pause> laxa: tor
10:48 < laxa_work> pause: <_<
10:49 < pause> laxa_work: >_> <_> <_<
10:49 < pause> >_<
10:50 < laxa_work> I am in a rush can't spend my day on IRC :)
10:50 < pause> laxa_work: LOL coffee machine rush i bet
11:06 < laxa_work> admin sys rush about web hosting
11:10 < _KinG> hi all
11:10 < _KinG> deen:  u here?
11:10 < _KinG> check out the www.ddnet.tw/status  idk what's going on ^^
11:13 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went down!
11:13 <@deen> oh
11:13 <@deen> hi
11:13 <@deen> what do you mean?
11:13 < _KinG> look at the ram usage ^^
11:14 <@deen> yes, they have overbooked their server
11:14 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went back online!
11:14 <@deen> and now we don't get enough RAM anymore
11:14 <@deen> i checked and we use about 100 MB of RAM, but they show that we use 450
11:14 < _KinG> u mean it's shared?
11:14 <@deen> yes
11:14 <@deen> they sell 500 MB RAM to 100 people, but only have 2 GB
11:14 < _KinG> servers are so laggy and it's not net lag it's the ram thing
11:14 <@deen> or something like that
11:15 < _KinG> i'll call him late ^^
11:15 < _KinG> later*
11:16 <@deen> it's not just the RAM, the CPU is also shared and it's too weak for even 1 full DDNet server
11:17 < _KinG> i think we should change vps if they just keep doing this
11:17 <@deen> yes
11:17 <@deen> but from what I've seen many do that
11:17 < _KinG> is there any pagefile now>?
11:17 <@deen> it's called swap on linux and yes, there is a swap file and the server is swapping all the time because of low RAM
11:18 < _KinG> that's why server lags
11:18 <@deen> this and the slow CPU
11:19 < _KinG> we can change datacenter but i'm afraid that the vps we will buy next can't handle the requests
11:19 < _KinG> i mean the reverse proxy
11:20 < _KinG> portlink is fine with this one but ram and cpu ... ram and cpu is fine on other but portlink...
11:33 < savander> http://www.afranet.com/
11:33 < savander> _KinG:  you understand this?
11:33 < savander> ;D
11:34 < savander> btw
11:34 < savander> http://www.datacentermap.com/iran/tehran/
11:34 < savander> checkout
11:34 < _KinG> savander:  w8 a min
11:34 < savander> check this * 
11:34 < savander> lol
11:34 < savander> "checkout:
11:34 < savander> or this
11:34 < savander> http://www.datacentermap.com/iran/
11:34 < _KinG> Pars National Data Center (PNDC)
11:34 < savander> 2 more localisation
11:34 < _KinG> i wanted to buy vps from here
11:34 < savander> localization
11:35 < savander> check, 8 different 
11:35 < savander> hosters
11:35 < _KinG> look this one Pars National Data Center (PNDC)  it gives 2% UDP packet loss at nights so what do you think?
11:35 < _KinG> others suck
11:35 <@deen> that means you can't play at all then
11:35 < savander> http://atenahost.ir/ ?
11:36 < _KinG> they suck much more blieve me i tried all ^^
11:36 < savander> lol okay
11:36 < savander> so where
11:36 < savander> the fuck 
11:36 < _KinG> afranet
11:36 < _KinG> is good
11:36 < savander> Persian pro server
11:36 < _KinG> but
11:36 < savander> has servers?
11:36 < _KinG> so much expensive
11:36 <@deen> Parspack is also good, but high bandwidth cost
11:37 < _KinG> persian pro is using asiatech
11:37 < _KinG> that gives udp loss too
11:37 < _KinG> the server we have is fine from net side it gives 0.00% packet loss but the ram and cpu is shared
11:37 <@deen> does the same hoster offer KVM servers?
11:38 <@deen> or XEN?
11:38 <@deen> those would have the same net, but exclusive ram and cpu
11:38 < savander> ye
11:38 <@deen> but also more expensive =/
11:38 < savander> but more expensive
11:38 < savander> ahm
11:38 < savander> ;-;
11:38 < savander> xd
11:38 <@deen> well, all ddnet servers are KVM i think :P
11:39 <@deen> i enabled demo recording on GER as well, please report if it lags
11:39 < savander> okay
11:39 < savander> i'll try
11:39 < savander> ;D
11:39 < savander> btw. KVm
11:39 < savander> i have KVM i guess? idk, its "CloudVM"
11:40 < savander> but i always (in all hostings)
11:40 < savander> have problem with ping
11:40 < savander> with unstable connection :(
11:40 < savander> even if its kvm
11:40 < savander> :/
11:41 < savander> but yes, filemedia now is the best from all of servers i tested.:)
11:42 < _KinG> deen:  i'll buy a test server from parsonline (Pars National Data Center (PNDC)) for some hours so we can test if it laggs or no 
11:42 < savander> https://www.filemedia.de/features.php
11:42 < savander> oh yea
11:42 <@deen> _KinG: nice
11:42 < savander> i think, its KVM :333
11:43 < savander> deen: question
11:43 <@deen> "We use for all of our products the Linux KVM hypervisor"
11:43 <@deen> yes it is :P
11:43 < savander> SSD - HDDD
11:43 < savander> in teeworlds
11:43 < savander> A difference?
11:44 <@deen> it depends
11:44 <@deen> when you're logging, the log file is flushed after each write
11:44 <@deen> then a hdd causes lags with many players
11:44 <@deen> or with high disk IO
11:44 <@deen> but i fixed that in ddnet server so it doesn't matter for ddnet :P
11:45 < savander> ahm
11:45 < savander> for mysql?
11:45 < savander> Is better i guess
11:45 <@deen> maybe, but i don't care whether it takes 0.5s or 1s to show the ranks
11:45 < savander> Hehe okay, :)
11:45 < savander> So i don't care 
11:46 <@deen> and mysql is threaded anyway
11:46 < savander> if it's hdd or SSD
11:46 < savander> because my servers are not really popular
11:46 < savander> :P
11:46 <@deen> so no lags are caused
11:46 <@deen> do you log?
11:46 < savander> yup
11:46 < savander> every server
11:47 <@deen> then you can try going on your server and simulating high disk IO on your server
11:47 <@deen> that always caused lags for me^^
11:47 < savander> but, how?
11:47 < savander> command in conosle or?? xD
11:48 <@deen> nono
11:48 <@deen> not teeworlds console
11:48 < savander> ahm
11:49 <@deen> on the server write some files
11:49 < savander> you mean
11:49 < savander> benchmark?
11:49 <@deen> maybe dd if=/dev/zero of=somefile bs=4k
11:49 <@deen> yeah,for example
11:51 < savander> haha
11:51 < savander> YEA
11:51 < savander> i make it
11:51 < savander> and when i join to server
11:51 < savander> i have a lot of lags
11:51 < savander> :D
11:51 < savander> http://pastebin.com/4Upzg7PC
11:51 < savander> :)
11:51 <@deen> that's a HDD btw :P
11:51 < savander> ye :)
11:51 < savander> but, not bad..
11:51 <@deen> ssd would be faster
11:52 < savander> ye ofc
11:52 < savander> but, now.
11:52 < savander> i don't need i guess
11:53 < savander> 80mb/s
11:53 < savander> not that bad.. :D
11:53 < savander> still better than my other test servers
11:53 < savander> soo :P :D
11:53 < savander> im happy ;3
11:53 <@deen> last ddos on GER was 20 gbit/s when they shut us down
11:53 < savander> ;o
11:58 < savander> 20gbit/s on teeworlds server
11:59 < savander> yeah.. those guys are fucked up :D
12:00 < laxa_work> deen: that's nice, you have autorecord, but no one yet can access them ?
12:00 <@deen> laxa_work: yes, mainly testing if it lags so far
12:00 < laxa_work> ok
12:01 <@deen> and if the recordings are fine
12:01 < laxa_work> are they stored in ram ?
12:01 <@deen> nope, on disk, but without flushing
12:02 < laxa_work> ok, back to admin sys now, need to install redmine on the VM :)
12:02 < laxa_work> and configure a vhost for apache2
12:02 < savander> http://pastebin.com/ng7hJurr
12:02 < savander> apache?
12:02 < savander> why not nginx
12:02 < savander> :(
12:04 < savander> deen
12:04 < savander> don't know but
12:04 < savander> i feel lags
12:04 < savander> on ger :)
12:04 < savander> maybe its me
12:04 < savander> you can test too
12:06 < laxa_work> savander: I don't choose the subject, I do that for the school
12:07 < laxa_work> savander: give me your script, I wanna test my server :p
12:07 < savander> but

12:51 < savander> if its -1?
12:51 < savander> and then "return"?

16:36 < laxa_work> EastByte: what tuto you followed to use ssl on your server ?
17:12 < savander> meh
17:12 < savander> don't understand :(
17:13 < savander> http://pastebin.com/AgZxMqPE
17:13 < savander> :(
17:43 < savander> FUCKING SHIT!!!!
17:43 < savander> :c
17:43 < savander> im angry
17:43 < savander> :c
17:47 < EastByte> laxa_work: who needs a tutorial for that :D
17:51 < laxa_work> me ? :D
17:52 < laxa_work> Where you got your certificate oO ?
17:52 < laxa_work> going back home now
17:52 < EastByte> generate your own and send the csr to the provider (startssl for example)
17:52 < EastByte> they will send a crt back
17:53 < EastByte> and you have to create a crt based on three others
17:53 < EastByte> and I don't understand dat shit
17:53 < EastByte> but it works
19:02 < laxa> xD
19:02 < laxa> why you need SSL for a webserver with nothing on it ?

23:49 <@deen> hm?
23:49 < laxa> difficult ~ 3 minutes xD
23:49 < laxa> oh !
23:49 < laxa> 4 minutes
23:49 <@deen> i think it works, but the code is a mess anyway
23:49 < savander> im noob
23:49 < savander> really...
23:50 < savander> 0x0000000000463c14 in CRanking::Server (this=0xb051100730314)     at src/game/server/ranking.h:37 37                      return m_pServer;
23:50 < savander> have no idea, what's wrong with this return, same on DDnet
23:50 < savander> but here it not works :D
23:50 < savander> Meh, i go die
23:50 < savander> :/
23:50 <@deen> maybe m_pServer is not set
23:51 < savander> 	CGameContext *GameServer() 	{ 		return m_pGameServer; 	} 	IServer *Server() 	{ 		return m_pServer; 	}
23:51 <@deen> Yes, maybe m_pServer is 0
23:51 < savander> but.. :o, 
23:51 < savander> what :D
23:51 <@deen> in the constructor of CRanking you have to set m_pServer to the passed parameter 
23:52 < savander> CRanking::CRanking(CGameContext *pGameServer) : m_pGameServer(pGameServer), 		m_pServer(pGameServer->Server()), 		m_pDatabase(g_Config.m_SvSqlDatabase), 		m_pUser(g_Config.m_SvSqlUser), 		m_pPass(g_Config.m_SvSqlPass), 		m_pIp(g_Config.m_SvSqlIp), 		m_Port(g_Config.m_SvSqlPort) {
23:52 < savander> it is ?
23:52 < savander> m_pServer(pGameServer->Server())
23:52 <@deen> yeah, looks good
