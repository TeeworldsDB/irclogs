03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> can somebody make my life easier and link me a github link into the code of the tee movements please? im trying to replicate it with some of my newest methods of coding i suppose
05:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well i found it, but it doesnt tell me that what values are gonna be replaced with the correct codeset
05:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> without it, i could manually "tip" the numbers that way, but it could be like a month or so
05:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> after that you guys might help me out with some gravitation shit im gonna apply to that movement system
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there are tunes @Cellegen xd
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who asked for tunes m8
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i want codes do you understand me?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i understood u want gravity
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and gravity can be tuned no need for code
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @ChillerDragon nob u can't understand he wants code
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why would want code to build something thats already there
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Idk ask him
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does someone else have the bug with Info files, where sometimes the beginning of the line is not printed? Like 10-15 characters are just not printed
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Tested on Linux with DDNetPP (based ok 9.0.2) and BlockDDrace (based on 11.9)
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @ChillerDragon do you even know what i wrote? i want to replicate it in an easier method i created on a different engine
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so i can apply much easier and effective motions to it
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> U wanna do teeworlds v2?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no, but a different option to make it better
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> With a different engine? xd
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like godot or unity or unreal engine
