12:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #334: Only clear the error string if none is given (master...pr_error_string) http://git.io/vZuZC
13:02 < Shiki> problem with stats being retained after restart: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/335
14:46 < chairn> 22:10 < Learath2> go on a planet mercury server do /top5 says 11335 i think it should be 1122334455 incase a position has multiple people in it
14:47 < chairn> At Olympic Games, if you're tied with someone and first, there's no silver medal ^^
14:47 < chairn> So the podium looks like (empty)-11-3
14:50 <@heinrich5991> I think that's the most common way to do it
14:54 < chairn> Seems opinions diverge on my pr heinrich5991 
14:55 <@heinrich5991> it seems people other than me like it :)
14:55 < chairn> but you can disable it so, i think it will not disturb people who doesnt want it ;)
15:01 <@heinrich5991> personally, I'd rather have it activated for everybody instead of introducing new configuration options :)
16:04 < Shiki> heinrich5991: but why wouldn't you use (introduce) a configuration option?
16:07 <@heinrich5991> Shiki: I dislike it when open-source projects just make a configuration for each controversial feature, instead of settling for a good default. I guess in this case the config variable would be fine though...
16:16 < chairn> personally, i like having the choice ^^
16:18 < Shiki> thanks for clarification, but why can't we make it a default option if PR is accepted? I mean -- it doesn't look bad or distracts user and having to "turn it on" in settings seems rather redundant
16:24 <@heinrich5991> Shiki: I think it was going to be introduced as a default
16:27 < Shiki> yep, sorry, I misread your last message :)
16:39 < chairn> heinrich5991: ehm, i've set cl_eye_wheel to true by default
16:39 <@heinrich5991> chairn: yea, that's what I thought.
16:59 <@EastByte> "No need to, already merged it locally - just had no time to finish it yet." ~Oy
17:00 <@EastByte> I already know how the repository will look like one day before 0.7 release^^
17:04 < tyurd> well
17:04 < tyurd> javascript is quite awesome
17:07 < chairn> search bar for editor incoming soon
17:10 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I wonder how many of these commits actually make it into the tree. it might be a stripped-down version of that
17:13 <@EastByte> hopefully he keeps the session token...
17:14 <@EastByte> chairn: search bar in editor? what for?
17:15 < chairn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/318
17:15 < chairn> *function
17:15 <@EastByte> ah, for the map browser
17:16 < chairn> yeah, its done, but if you have few result, you can scroll like if you had all the files
17:16 < chairn> trying to fix it
17:17 <@EastByte> kk
