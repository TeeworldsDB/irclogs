02:12 < bridge> <trexic> Does anybody know where the rendering for the player names happens?
04:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: where did the jetpack projectiles go?
04:06 < bridge> <teero777> It's all a fake demo

04:07 < bridge> <teero777> They don't exist by default
04:27 < bridge> <teero777> Quick question. Can you make differently coloured laser from the serverside?
04:28 < bridge> <teero777> Quick question. Can you make differently coloured lasers from the serverside?
06:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
06:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or wait idk i think fokko for sure proposed that
06:40 < bridge> <louis> question for everyone: are the shopping carts in your local markets 4 wheel turn or 2 wheel turn?
06:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 after quickly reading this i think the server can only determine the type and the client then picks a color per type https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5639/files
06:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @louis my local market has no shopping carts o.O
06:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also #off-topic? xd
06:44 < bridge> <louis> i feel like developer is also the off topic for english at this point
06:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you suggest tabs over spaces here heinrich will censor your ass
07:37 < bridge> <teero777> ah okay so no full rgb? sadge

07:46 < bridge> <mian_ku> how to get player's chat message?
08:07 < bridge> <teero777> press F1. You can copy the messages from there
08:07 < bridge> <mian_ku> nonono
08:07 < bridge> <mian_ku> i mean get it in code
08:07 < bridge> <mian_ku> but thanks you
08:07 < bridge> <mian_ku> i know now
08:07 < bridge> <teero777> ah lol
08:07 < bridge> <teero777> wait
08:08 < bridge> <teero777> serverside or clientside?

08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> 2
08:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> As chiller said, I added that yes
09:02 < bridge> <zhn> 4 wheels
09:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> How Dare you Use voxels colored Lasers! Have some respect given He wants it fully removed (i'm Joking please dont punish i have family)
09:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ik that's a joke, but besides that I helped him creating that thing
09:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 2, iirc
09:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont think i have seen 4 wheel turn yet? :D
09:35 < bridge> <screeeny> supermarket 4 wheels turning, hardware stores usually just 2
09:36 < bridge> <screeeny> we talking the amount of wheels without a fixed direction right?
09:39 < bridge> <manikoo> 4
09:40 < bridge> <learath2> You will be jailed
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pretty sure only saw 4 in my life. else u couldnt go sideways
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't trust these ppl that say 2
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.zoernig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lidl-einkaufswagen.jpg
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> similar to these most look here in my region
09:46 < bridge> <archimede67> 2 wheel turn
09:52 < bridge> <louis> yeah
09:52 < bridge> <louis> i've used both 2 in the US and 4 in korea
09:53 < bridge> <louis> 4 is a double edged sword, so much harder to turn
09:53 < bridge> <louis> 4 is a double edged sword, so much harder to turn if you have a heavy cart
09:53 < bridge> <louis> you can, it just turns like a car
09:54 < bridge> <screeeny> maybe im stupid but i find it rly hard to use one with 2 xd
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't lie, in murica you simply directly drive your car into the stores
09:54 < bridge> <0xdeen> @uniformgeist Thanks!
09:55 < bridge> <screeeny> These are the ones i know with only 2 in germany:

10:39 < bridge> <mian_ku> sorry, english not my parent language
10:43 < bridge> <louis> cool ^^
10:44 < bridge> <louis> you should try displaying it in broadcast, it might look a little less messy
10:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well the responses belong to the attempts I think the chat history makes perfect sense for that
11:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is dereferencing a pointer faster than accessing value from an array? :thonk:
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what kind of array?
11:05 < bridge> <zhn> not really
11:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> of pointers
11:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> :kek:
11:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> artay of pointers
11:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> array of pointers
11:05 < bridge> <zhn> compiler can optimize array iterating afair
11:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's not iterating, I guess
11:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> is it?
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> array of `u8`s
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> const sized?
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or inside a Vec?
11:06 < bridge> <zhn> compiler could vectorize read/write instructions if size is known in compile time
11:06 < bridge> <zhn> especially if you are iterating over it xd
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which language are you talking about btw? rust? C? C++? assembly?
11:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `malloc` is used
11:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> C
11:07 < bridge> <zhn> ah then it doesnt matter xd
11:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be easier to understand with two minimal examples pointer access vs array access
11:08 < bridge> <zhn> unsure though, maybe ryo or jupsti have better things to say
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean if the ptr has no offset and your array has an offset, you have to calc that offset.
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But i can assume that on most arches this doesnt take an extra cycle
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not you can never know for certain
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you can never know for certain
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-virtual-machine.html i was just reading this part and was interesting is it really :p
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1267408776944947300/image.png?ex=66a8ade7&is=66a75c67&hm=066f3c0f4b4b66c7b29375a3d6a20964b1f8ccb2e0022acc6bd2f24e73c7a481&
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you have a pointer vs a pointer + index, then just a pointer will be faster in the very general case, because it's saving some memory
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Its type is a byte pointer. We use an actual real C pointer pointing right into the middle of the bytecode array instead of something like an integer index because it’s faster to dereference a pointer than look up an element in an array by index.
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://godbolt.org/z/W9ce3j3d3
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks like both things will take a fraction of a cycle
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe even the same amount of cycle fractions
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbh i dont even understand what they mean
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it sounds like they also do a array access just manually
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah they emulate instruction pointers
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, sure? Most architectures have offset addressing for free, no?
11:15 < bridge> <louis> ahh its like multiplayer i see now
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @milkeeycat is your language already usable?
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like can i code stuff in it
11:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can do mafs in it
11:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you have to access two words from memory or carry around two words, then that's going to use a cache line or some register
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the cost isn't in the instruction itself
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but tbf the cost here is really minimal, and you should be optimizing meaningful stuff first ^^
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I see, yeah that would make sense
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10633
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i found this:
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/fereidani/kanal
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which is insane (the benchmarks)
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What i often dislike about such libs is, that it's so hard to guess what weaknesses such libs have.. e.g. what bottlenecks

12:19 < bridge> <learath2> https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2015/pdf/papers/p57.pdf can someone take a look at this data structure? Do you see how it would handle a shorter prefix and a longer prefix both existing? Hole punching is not exactly uncommon in ip routing, but it seems only leaves have routing data
12:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> 14 Pages? Let me give my apprentice some stuff to do and i can read through it, that way i atleast look busy lmao
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> 3 and 3.1 are probably where this information is stored
12:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's a lot of smart words :justatest:
12:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its really interesting
12:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Hard to understand tho :justatest:
12:35 < bridge> <zhn> @teero777 yo
12:36 < bridge> <teero777> xD
12:36 < bridge> <teero777> yo
12:37 < bridge> <zhn> xd
12:58 < bridge> <loseost> аххаха, чекай какого бота нашли   https://t.me/NudesPlusikbot_bot
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do longer and shorter prefixes exist somewhere?
13:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (in IP routing, I mean)
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> I think so, they even mention the hole punching issue in the paper
13:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hole punching means something related to NAT to me. first time I hear it in this conttext
13:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hole punching means something related to NAT to me. first time I hear it in this context
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, first time I've heard of it used like this was this paper too:
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> > Hole punching is an event such that a longer prefix divides a shorter prefix’s address space, necessitating the routing table to deal with the address space as three distinct divisions
13:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching doesn't know it either)
13:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> I think I need an augmented trie of sotrs, with data in some internal nodes too, then I can just consider the very last data I get when traversing to a leaf.
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> I think I need an augmented trie of sorts, with data in some internal nodes too, then I can just consider the very last data I get when traversing to a leaf.
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds about right
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could also treat it like in your quote:
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > necessitating the routing table to deal with the address space as three distinct divisions
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. expand the shorter prefix to a bunch of longer prefixes
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> Ah hm, I could
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> While I have you here, do you have any idea how multiway tries handle data that's not divisible by their chunksize?
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Say you are inserting a 10bit prefix, but this poptrie thing is 64-ary, so 6 bits per chunk
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Where do you put the leaf even? 😄
13:13 < bridge> <mn08kl> аххаха, чекай какого бота нашли   https://t.me/NudesPlusikbot_bot
13:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in each of the the children that fits?
13:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> idk
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> AH, that would make sense actually I was wondering what they meant in 3.3 with redundant leaves
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe I will just do a 16-ary trie, that way both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses are completely divisable
13:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't help, prefixes might still not be divisible by 4
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> Hm true, in that case might aswell use all the bits available
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: can you also sed for file uploads in irc, or do you not even get the msg for it?
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> grep me "version"
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: can you also search for file uploads in irc, or do you not even get the msg for it?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or txt
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> author is deen
14:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to crawl, there's https://archive.strct.cc/ddnet/
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah found it xd
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> back then there were no mobile players at all
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how come we have 4000 now
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> different counting probably?
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is our current counting accurate?
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean we have barely 3k players
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on average, how can 4k of these be mobile
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like the 4k are counted differently. how did you obtain that number?
14:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> File uploads usually arrive on irc as discord cdn links. They actually still do but are now unauthorized. The file name and extension is contained in the urls. So grepping deen txt would work.
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi used some script that looked like it's is used by ddnet admins xd
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^
14:23 < bridge> <murpi> Because the 3,000 players aren't the same players all the time
14:23 < bridge> <murpi> Because the 4,000 players aren't the same players all the time
14:23 < bridge> <murpi> Because the 3,000 players aren't the same players all the time
14:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> dunno how deen counted the concurrent players. can't think of anything right now
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but even if it's on one day
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3000 unique mobile players
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be completely insane
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just alone finding that shitty 9.3 apk xD
14:31 < bridge> <murpi> it's more than one day
14:31 < bridge> <murpi> We keep logs for 2 full days (some servers even stay up for even longer)
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if it's 10 days
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and they all play on mobile internet xD
14:32 < bridge> <murpi> I.e some of the multeasymap servers are alive for more than 2 weeks
14:34 < bridge> <murpi> Yeah, thats if you keep assuming that the 3k players are the same people
14:34 < bridge> <murpi> then it'd insane
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no unique would be more insane to me
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> than the same persons
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it would not be insane to me if the app would be on the play store
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then ppl try it, uninstall again
14:36 < bridge> <murpi> You're telling me you really believe the we only have 3k players in the entire world?
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3k mobile players
14:36 < bridge> <murpi> You're telling me you really believe we only have 3k players in the entire world?
14:38 < bridge> <murpi> This is false too btw
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> avg
14:39 < bridge> <murpi> not even avg
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then let it be the double amount
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not like i cannot believe that there are so many mobile players. i simply assume the increase of mobile players must be very recent event
14:40 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, our steam charts look so weird, I wonder what happened there?
14:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://steamdb.info/app/412220/charts/#max looks ok to me
14:40 < bridge> <learath2> I truly can not believe 3k people play mobile ddnet. That's insane, the only available client is barely functional. Where is this data from?
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> What is the oscillation at the end?
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1267461896873705543/image.png?ex=66a8df60&is=66a78de0&hm=51a0e1b834626e8d9d421ae397c3c295e49efd19e3ea3505bd892f57ec8eaec7&
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which zoom level is that?
14:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> chinese players switching to mobile
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> 6 may to 29 jul, not a set level
14:42 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps they aggregate old data so it doesn't have the resolution for the oscillations to show
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1267462197085343828/image.png?ex=66a8dfa8&is=66a78e28&hm=275c943d084277496b235419c86a69b906c9df34f2b53df90cb4442a3b43ab75&
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like a bug
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah If I pick 3m it disappears, I guess picking a small zoom then zooming it out in the bottom doesn't resample the data properyl
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah If I pick 3m it disappears, I guess picking a small zoom then zooming it out in the bottom doesn't resample the data properly
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can reproduce. seems like a bug
14:44 < bridge> <louis> why not just run the player version script aggain and see how many mobile are online currently
14:44 < bridge> <louis> or were there 3k online at some point?
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know whether we have a version script or where it would be
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the one posted above doesn't only count *currently* online players
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks where did you read 4k mobile btw?
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in the script output from murpi
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> In that message you linked the only common version seems to be 15091, that's not mobile
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> here: https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1265660475480346644
14:47 < bridge> <murpi> Including CHN* cuz I used all-locations apperantly
14:48 < bridge> <learath2> 4252 sounds like an insane amount of mobile players using a client we don't have on any store, support or advertise
14:49 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if it's a bot epidemic hoping it confuses the antibot instead 😅
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi i'd be interested in the count of mobile players if we remove the IP from the uniq check
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder many attempts total were made on the servers
15:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> headbot also uses ddnet 9 for his console ports maybe half of those players are playing on a Nintendo 3DS
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe the 3ds marketshare is also 4000 players
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apparently it's not about how hard it is to download the version
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
15:27 < bridge> <murpi> So basically just how many times `ddnet: cid=2 version=<version>` occurs in our logs? ^^
15:28 < bridge> <murpi> (don't remember the mobile version again)
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 903
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:30 < bridge> <learath2> Another interesting count would be how many times that line occurs for any version overall, so we could say what percent of joins is with a mobile client
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru
15:38 < bridge> <murpi> ```sh
15:38 < bridge> <murpi> for i in $(cat ~/servers/all-locations); do ssh $i.ddnet.org "echo $i; grep 'ddnet: cid=2 version=903' servers/servers/*log*" | wc -l; done
15:38 < bridge> <murpi> ```Out:
15:38 < bridge> <murpi> ```70
15:38 < bridge> <murpi> 3

15:39 < bridge> <murpi> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the hype is gone
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:39 < bridge> <murpi> Indeed
15:39 < bridge> <murpi> It's still quite a lot though
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the total count?
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wait. why are we only looking at `cid=2`? ^^
15:40 < bridge> <murpi> Oh
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what even is cid=2?
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> client ID 2
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and what is that xd
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like in the server code
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow, so many client id 2 mobile players
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is sus again too xD
15:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😄
15:41 < bridge> <murpi> I noticed we also have duplicates of certain logs now
15:41 < bridge> <murpi> Let me redo the check
15:46 < bridge> <murpi> How do I grep files named `*.log` and `*.log.old` but not `*.log.tmp`?
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: tell us
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use chatgpt for such stuff 😬
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `*.log *.log.old`
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `servers/servers/*.log servers/servers/*.log.old`
15:51 < bridge> <murpi> ah, so I can just chain multiple paths
15:51 < bridge> <murpi> there's also --exclude apperantly
15:51 < bridge> <murpi> there's also --exclude=path apperantly
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am also interested in a current version of this:

15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if someone with steam access can generate that
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> esp now that many russian ppl joined
15:55 < bridge> <murpi> ```ddnet for i in $(cat ~/servers/all-locations); do ssh $i.ddnet.org "echo $i; grep -E 'ddnet: cid=[0-9]{1,2} version=903' servers/servers/*.log servers/servers/*.log.old" | wc -l; done

15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now with all versions or what? 😄
15:58 < bridge> <murpi> :pepeW:
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it says 1 million... then man would be epyc
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it take so long?
15:59 < bridge> <murpi> Fake Info
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @0xdeen please if u find time, or put onto your todo list 😄
16:07 < bridge> <murpi> with chatgpt I get random jibberish
16:07 < bridge> <murpi> I guess I could just run my old script without uniq
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```bash
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet for i in $(cat ~/servers/all-locations); do ssh $i.ddnet.org "echo $i; grep -E 'ddnet: cid=[0-9]{1,2} version=[0-9]+' servers/servers/*.log servers/servers/*.log.old" | wc -l; done
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> shouldnt that work
16:08 < bridge> <murpi> That'd just return every line and doesn't actually count the occurances of each version
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt that what we want xd
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah u mean every version separatelly
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah that would be cool too
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you use gpt4? xddd
16:14 < bridge> <murpi> Whatever version is free at https://chatgpt.com/
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use your old script but dont use -A 3 but instead only as many lines as needed to have ddnet: cid= ...
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also in your old script you input a version and then it shows the count of that version only
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where do you even have that script from
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was actually quite good xd
16:18 < bridge> <murpi> I wrote it for Robyte xd
16:18 < bridge> <murpi> Don't remember the context
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah it really only needs the -A parameter adjusted i think
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so this isnt true
16:20 < bridge> <0xdeen> @jupeyy_keks 2 million people own DDNet on Steam! Crazy to me to have 1.6 million users and the average player played 1 hour! I can't take a screenshot that large: https://ddnet.org/steamhardware.html

16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc thanks
16:21 < bridge> <murpi> I wonder why this info isn't public
16:21 < bridge> <murpi> steamdb doesn't seem to show all-time unique players
16:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> SteamDB can't access it, only the game owners can
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf.. is this a VM or what xD
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1267487483969671281/image.png?ex=66a8f734&is=66a7a5b4&hm=1ac0be6990117cfc04682264cf89e103214ea91397f1e25dfe563e9fab6569e2&
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 cpu core
16:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yeah, or disabled cores in BIOS/Kernel
16:23 < bridge> <murpi> Yeah, why don't they make this public
16:23 < bridge> <0xdeen> Game owners might not want that public
16:23 < bridge> <murpi> That's a lot more interesting to me than concurrnent players
16:24 < bridge> <murpi> Hmmm
16:24 < bridge> <murpi> I guess it could expose total sales
16:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1722263163.png
16:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a bunch of random logs from servers i host on my vps

16:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``193``
16:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``175`` * xd
16:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait what?
16:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does that mean someone with mobile client joined 175 times on ma servers? xd
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> compared to this:
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> less ppl with <4GB RAM: 0.19% (before: 1.04%)
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only very few ppl less with <1GB VRAM: 3.91%
16:30 < bridge> <egyt> Just make it opt-in or something?
16:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's opt-in now ^^ deen can share it
16:32 < bridge> <egyt> Yey!
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more ppl with 1280 x 1024 resolution...
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that must be the new russian players :lol:
16:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also would have expected that FullHD increased its marketshare
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> very few players with non-windows, just ~2%
16:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, rip

16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:35 < bridge> <sedonya> What is this?
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who of the devs uses steam in german? 😬

16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use kde in german but steam is english xDD
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.org/steamhardware.html
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's steam survey but only for ddnet users
16:36 < bridge> <sedonya> WoW, thanks!
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the actual amount is higher
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only read it statistically
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035503720861016094/Screenshot_2022-10-28_at_12-41-37_Steam_Hardware_Survey_-_DDraceNetwork_owners_-_September_2022.png?ex=66a8c37d&is=66a771fd&hm=24bceaa90df06c9ba8cf78c49716aedb4dbd4147418da1b2c2423b5071e74287&
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is the one from 2022
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you want to compare
16:36 < bridge> <egyt> Melon and deen?
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> deen 100% english
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> melon is a windows enjoyer
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> I do `*.log*`
16:38 < bridge> <egyt> I thought he is German, but it turns out he is Great Britainian? Oh well.
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no but he uses his software in english
16:38 < bridge> <murpi> That'd do *.log.tmp too
16:38 < bridge> <murpi> (new change)
16:39 < bridge> <egyt> Oh.
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: why is indonesia not in the list xdddd
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, didn't know this exists now
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u should do more advertising
16:40 < bridge> <murpi> `--exclude=*.log.tmp` if you want to keep the ending wildcard
16:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rip I mean there was the one guy from Jakarta who posted in \#developer but his steam might be English
16:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or he is gangster and has no steam
16:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> He playes from irc
17:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> It's not supposed to be there, I forgot a `rm -f` 😄
18:11 < bridge> <chairn> rm *.log(!.tmp)
18:12 < bridge> <chairn> grep *.log(!.tmp)
18:12 < bridge> <chairn> or something like this
18:12 < bridge> <chairn> grep *.log!(.tmp)
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or `grep *.log{,.old}`
18:18 < bridge> <archimede67> what happens to a player if the player crashes while changing maps?
18:18 < bridge> <archimede67> for instance i crashed while changing map and when I connected my name is (1)archimede67 and does not change back
18:20 < bridge> <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1267517138227302482/image.png?ex=66a912d3&is=66a7c153&hm=e3144ba60d4194f99bd2b25aaec47dd40ca1149c3e9daabe31292eea271385b5&
18:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> workaround: change name twice
18:23 < bridge> <archimede67> oh thanks!
18:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> No i am Not you rude:(
18:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> I am on nixos
18:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> And i am on english 98% of the time
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you have windows on english or what
18:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yes, Not Sure If my nixos is on German or english tho lmao
18:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Easier to get Tech Support If all settings are english on Default
18:35 < bridge> <trexic> Hello again. I have a question.
18:35 < bridge> <trexic> Does anybody know, where the event for a hammer hit on the client side is called? I need the sender id and target id....
18:35 < bridge> <trexic> I just couldnt find it on the clients side...
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think there is target or sender id
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's simply an event with a position
18:37 < bridge> <trexic> But how does the client know that it was hammered?
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs its velocity changed
18:38 < bridge> <trexic> To calc the new velocity?
18:38 < bridge> <trexic> Ye
18:38 < bridge> <trexic> Oh
18:38 < bridge> <trexic> And it receives no hammer hit event at all??
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it does, that is the visual effect you see when it is hit
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but sadly our network code doesnt add lot of information to it
18:39 < bridge> <trexic> Oh... okay than I have to make a workaround ig
18:40 < bridge> <trexic> Where's the effect and is the Player near by or something like that
18:41 < bridge> <trexic> Thank you anyway 😃
