16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> How is possible that 2022 cost only is about equal to half of nine years cost (2013-2021)?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Is there any reason?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> More players now, so costs are higher
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen is drinking a few more coffees lately
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I even wrote down some of the old costs per year:
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2018: 917 â‚¬
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2019: 1327 â‚¬
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2020: 1118 â‚¬
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2021: 2612 â‚¬
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2022: 3275 â‚¬

16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have 5-10 times the number of players, and only 3 times the cost, I think that's ok ðŸ˜„

18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > In 2022, Turkey's authorities decided to rebrand their country's international image. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan issued a communiquÃ©, tweaking the country's internationally recognised name from "Turkey" to TÃ¼rkiye.
