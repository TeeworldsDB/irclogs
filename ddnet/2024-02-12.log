06:42 < bridge> <remakepower> I found there is a unused ninja sound: wp_ninja_attack-04
06:49 < bridge> <remakepower> Also vo_teefault_sledge-01 vo_teefault_sledge-02 vo_teefault_sledge-03
06:50 < bridge> <louis> yes i think some mods might use it though
06:50 < bridge> <remakepower> Also vo_teefault_ninja-01 vo_teefault_ninja-02 vo_teefault_ninja-03
06:50 < bridge> <remakepower> No, these sounds couldn't be use, because they didn't add into the sound list.
06:50 < bridge> <louis> ah
06:51 < bridge> <remakepower> Else a mod client

07:35 < bridge> <miguilim> Hello guys, is there any documentation on how .map file works and how can I decode it for server-side (collision, spawn...)?
07:35 < bridge> <miguilim> A pure teeworlds 0.6 would be better for me, as I know nothing about the map file XD
07:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What do you need it for @miguilim ?
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and yes there is https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/map.md https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/datafile.md
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @miguilim you can also use Patigas lib to turn maps into json and then parse that. Its probably less performant but much easier to do.

14:08 < bridge> <ar1gin> I mean, it tries to fetch some library from steam runtime but fails
14:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> Github version is different from steam version?
14:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why does it fail
14:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk if they are different. Are you missing something?
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need steamapi ddl
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> dll
14:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> It crashes on startup so i tell steam to run the terminal beforehand and it gives me this. I got rid of it by resetting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` but why does it crash anyways?

14:26 < bridge> <ar1gin> its the era of lua mods???
14:28 < bridge> <kekomonter> I think no, cuz a lot of dudes here hate lua xd
14:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> ah gg
14:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> lua is cool tho üëç
14:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> covers all of your scripting needs
14:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> except maybe for syntax....
14:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> Syntax in lua is nice, but have a lot of problems
14:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> For example continue, lua don't have continue :(
14:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> I think I need to fork LuaJIT and add continue
14:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> arrays start from 1
14:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> And this xd
14:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> And for's
14:31 < bridge> <ar1gin> the most annoying thing is that you can call functions without parenthesis
14:31 < bridge> <ar1gin> the most annoying thing is that you can call functions without parentheses
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont worry edlang is coming
14:38 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'll watch how u will implement mods with shared libs in ddnet :owo:
14:38 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Do you use https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/lua-srv for your work? I'm trying to use it for some server-side modding (it partially works, just need some more hooks).
14:38 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Have you read https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7042?
14:39 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nope, I done custom
14:39 < bridge> <kekomonter> https://github.com/Myr-13/mmoteexd
14:39 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yea, I checked this 5 mins ago xd
14:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Oh! I have similar ideas and goals, though I want to do it in a technically different manner. IMO LUA is the ~~most ~~only reasonable way to do it. 
14:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I wrote my own code with luacpp but it was a dead end due to the bindings limitation. I discovered the referenced lua-srv, which uses luajit + luabridge, and it looks much better.
14:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Unfortunately, client-side LUA is a no-go for DDNet devs, I thought we'd have to reinvent the wheel and use something custom for client-side UI.
14:52 < bridge> <kekomonter> Creating UI with lasers :gigachad:
14:53 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I've seen such UI.
14:53 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I've actually seen such UI.
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> btw are serverside laser colors now supported?
14:54 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I have similar plans for 'multi-world' and some RPG-style stuff, though I considered use of many server instances to also update them independently. OTOH it would require server-to-server communication..
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wasm > lua
14:54 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Yes
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> nice
14:54 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yao
14:54 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yap
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lua can be used inside wasm
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> time to remake the portal mod
14:54 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Do you mean that WASM is much heavier than LUA? So true.
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> luasuxs
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's more powerful yes, but also much faster
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also still allows you to use lua by compiling a lua interpreter for wasm
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and pyson
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and rust
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and fortran
14:56 < bridge> <teero777> please no
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm is lang agnostic
14:56 < bridge> <teero777> well you can compile pretty much anything to wasm
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought a nice idea
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe make something like WASM but for games smth like GASM, game-assembly, a compilation target for use in games for scripting capabilities, unlike wasm, it doesnt try to be sandboxed like it maybe or opt in
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks new startup idea gogogo
14:57 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Oh, I also made a 40 minutes prototype for that, based on DDNet, with an idea to maybe sometime continue it. It is a bit of challenge to keep the right feeling of impulse, like when you fall down to blue portal and thrown out via orange portal on a wall. It is tricky to compensate the gravity.
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but being sandboxed is the cool thing. it allows to download the wasm module from the server
14:58 < bridge> <teero777> there are portal servers online rn
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks true but maybe some games dont need it
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> or local mods
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
14:58 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I failed to found any. üòÑ Won't even try otherwise.
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's true, but for those u could also use native libraries. or use the WASI (https://wasi.dev/)

15:01 < bridge> <kaffeine0> No way! They invented everything? lol
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ram and disk doesn't matter, we speak about a few mbs
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what exactly do you mean with bundled WASM?
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @kaffeine0 nice pfp btw just noticed the tux on the head
15:01 < bridge> <teero777> come play
15:02 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Unfortunately I'm on a working PC and won't have time to play today.
15:02 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I have some time to chat between compilations after a big rebase tho üòÑ
15:03 < bridge> <teero777> compile time is free time, nice
15:06 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I mean that OK let's assume I want to use it (I find LUA syntax weird, and I'm used to some js flavor). How it will affect my build time if I build deps from sources? I'd actually prefer it but as I understand it is too bloated for teeworlds servers, for many reasons.
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you have a js interpreter compiled to wasm?
15:09 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Oh. I misunderstood. I thought you're suggesting to use JS instead of LUA, and WASM is a runtime to it.
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i use wasmer, which is written in rust and has no js runtime at all
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm is independent of JS
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> make  no mistake
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm will deprecate the usage of js in browsers
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> hopium
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> :hopium:
15:10 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Now I recall, yep.
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the way dd-pg is built works like this:
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you use an interpreter, no matter if JS or LUA inside WASM, it will work just like u wouldn't have the WASM module at all.
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The wasm manager will have a hot-reload feature that pushes the LUA or JS files into the WASM memory
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> everything else is as writing rust (in case your interpreter & host stuff is written in rust)
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the cool thing about this way is, you could even compile to native libraries and load these instead of WASM modules. it will just work. (because wasm is so similar to "normal" libs)
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in case ur server needs full performance xd
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks one question
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u using llvm 18?
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> if so, u are using my code :EZgolden:
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, i'm nightly enjoyer for llvm
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> llvm is really pretty stable even in nightlies^^
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not like mesa code which is often broken üò¨
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but writing tests for graphics stack sounds extremly hard tbh üòÑ
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
15:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> So. I need a script language because it makes no sense to use C++ for high level, probably map-specific logic (you don't code tw maps in C++, do you?) For now I use LUA, which has a small runtime, small overhead, and allows me to work with <mapname>.lua files which are readable text documents.
15:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> What is the idea, how I can replace LUA with something modern? Bringing a whole **compiler** sounds like a huge overhead.
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know the funny thing
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm has so many commits goign in that u could keep running the compilation in a loop
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and everytime u would get another commit
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> monorepo for ya
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206606021787914242/image.png?ex=65dc9e6d&is=65ca296d&hm=64658380af9bd63df423555431987d89216d208b401e991600608451cc2f3cb9&
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you compile your LUA scripts to binaries?
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else u have an interpreter.. and interpreter __kind of__ is a compiler
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah he is using a compiler he calls from cpp code
15:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> lua interpreter is super light-weight, as the language is quite simple.
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt hide the complexity of lua
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm is simple too
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok idk how long the lua spec is
15:23 < bridge> <kaffeine0> If we're about LLVM then it is super far from being simple.
15:23 < bridge> <kaffeine0> If we're about LLVM (used as a backend, etc) then it is super far from being simple.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the WASM modules itself are also pretty light-weight, and wasm is a binary representation
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm is not a llvm thing
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if u have a c compiler like clang u already have wasm support
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the compiler is not light-weight, but IMO it doesn't matter, because the 3MBs extra ur binary will have simply don't matter.. that's like 2x 4k textures xdd
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> yo what exactly are you ppl of the internet discussing`
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> yo what exactly are you ppl of the internet discussing?
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> lua vs modernity
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ur fault
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> someone mentioned lua
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> what would you be using those for?
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ;(
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @kaffeine0 the compiler itself is not slow.. compiling tw physics happens in milliseconds, because it's not a lot of code.
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> compiling rust code to wasm is ofc not the fastest, but as said if u need interpreted langauges u could still compile a LUA interpreter to wasm
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the interpreter would not need to be recompiled every time ofc
15:26 < bridge> <kaffeine0> What if I don't have a compiler in the production environment, it is often a no-go from the security PoV.
15:26 < bridge> <kaffeine0> And no, I definitely don't have clang there. (OTOH I use a nightbuild of llvm for its clang-tidy with new checks)
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so your point is, you want to include a lua script and directly want to execute it?
15:27 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Oh, indeed. I also don't have rust there (or in the server codebase).
15:27 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Sure. It works like that right now.
15:29 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > if u need interpreted langauges u could still compile a LUA interpreter to wasm
15:29 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Yep, I just don't see why I need WASM.
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah then u should use a lua interpreter in that wasm module.
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the cool, IMHO, thing is that u can do both
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can rewrite the whole tw physics and the client will have perfect  prediction, as well as writing a plugin system with lua.
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> writing the wasm support is not a lot of effort actually, because it feels like u simply load a native library (with smaller restrictions like not file system support etc.)
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> because with WASM u can litereally rewrite the whole game for your mod
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u ever wanted custom physics for your tw mod, u can just do it
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's sandboxed, rust is safe. no fear
15:30 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Oh, I didn't see I need to rewrite the whole game. Are we about teeworlds mod server working with DDNet clients?
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @kaffeine0 u dont need a compileri n prod
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just send the wasm file
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u just add "random" lua scripts u have to be careful that your whole logic is safe on untrusted input
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it works for server & client at the same time
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> same wasm module üòÑ
15:31 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I just say my moderators/mappers/content-makers to send wasm files, I see. It does not sound like a huge advantage though.
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/WAVM/WAVM/
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> wait, you want remote lua/wasm code execution?
15:31 < bridge> <kaffeine0> True.
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want wasm execution for physics at least, as physics seem to be _relatively_ easy to sandbox
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dd-pg also supports overwriting the whole graphic code, but since i don't trust GPU drivers, that would require the code to be open source & checked by a human
15:33 < bridge> <kekomonter> Why we need run VM inside VM inside ddnet-server? xd
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that then would allow completely custom rendering code üòÑ
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> and no malicous code?
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> and no malicious code?
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it must be human checked
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> well then every gamemode must be opensource..
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> well then every gamemode must be opensource...
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it wants custom rendering, yes
15:34 < bridge> <remakepower> Did you say like NetGui?
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not if it wants custom physics
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> thats annoying asf
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. KoGs moving tiles would probably work
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why that?
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> well if i just want to test a newly made gamemode with some friends. to get accepted from the masterserver i have to opensource my code and then make some sort of application??
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> and who checks all the code?
15:35 < bridge> <remakepower> I heard someone says it used TeeUniverse Code
15:35 < bridge> <kaffeine0> So. I see that WASM is a nice thing but it seems that you're insistently selling it for wrong reasons. LUA is right tool here, and WASM does something very different.
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but as said, physics will work closed source
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> i dont think someone willingly wants to check my 2000loc lua custom physics and gui
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's about rendering code
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think u underestimate how complicated graphics drivers are
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> is the physics code not just as exploitable as the rendering?
15:36 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I know how to do it but as the UX won't be good (e.g. no proper prediction) I don't see its value for now.
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> huh? when did i say that?
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not at all, what can you possibly exploit here. it has no IO at all
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well to rephrase it:
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it sounds like u underestimate it
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> i said no one will want to check my 2000loc code for exploits....
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it would enhance tw modding by ALOT. and making mods like fng and infection much more attractive, because it would allow greater modifications
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc it's not simpler than custom modifications inside your code base
15:38 < bridge> <teero777> well ig then no realtime solar system mods that get info based on some websites
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but what is your point then xd
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want untrusted input on the client or what
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> LUA + GUI will probably not easier
15:40 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Custom modifications are limited by the protocol and "no client side scripts/UI/whatever". The argument will be valid only when we have it in the "default teeworlds client" AKA DDNet.
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, that's the idea
15:41 < bridge> <teero777> every single change must be reviewed by someone has the authority to check it. And who is that? i assume only few people have that authority. it would push a lot of work onto them which will result in long waiting times for mod developers. There needs to be a diffrent solution.

15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i dunno, u don't have to check code quality, only if it makes "weird" stuff
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can only tell you, i can easily crash my PC with webgl
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not directly a security problem, but it should at least concern you XD
15:43 < bridge> <teero777> exactly xDDD
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it shows that just giving away the GPU to the wild word is not a trivial task
15:43 < bridge> <teero777> youd need to debug their code for undefined behaviour
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if a human says "it might crash, but it's not a virus or similar"
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say that's already a good start xD
15:45 < bridge> <teero777> "yeah it might break your gpu but dont worry joining our servers"
15:45 < bridge> <teero777> xddd
15:45 < bridge> <teero777> crypto market is goin high
15:45 < bridge> <teero777> let the mining begin!
15:45 < bridge> <kekomonter> DDNet miner
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but let's also stay realistic, trust builds upon time
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we suddenly get 1000 new contributors that want custom code, i'd be sceptical.
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But if tater wants to make some changes, then it's probably likely to get "less" review time
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think that's very pessimistic tho xD
15:46 < bridge> <remakepower> Security problems are always the main problem for modified servers.
15:47 < bridge> <teero777> i just wouldnt like to have all my code reviewed every time i want to change smth. im embarrased
15:47 < bridge> <teero777> jk my code is golden
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
15:48 < bridge> <teero777> any cool compression algos to convert sound into text?
15:48 < bridge> <teero777> for sending across the wide world of web
15:49 < bridge> <teero777> any cool compression algos to convert sound into strings?
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want to encode sound as string?
15:49 < bridge> <teero777> y
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BASE64
15:49 < bridge> <teero777> k thx
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc we could also think about allowing manually installed mods here.
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just like we can't prevent ppl from downloading custom clients
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not safe, but it's also very hard to prevent anyway
15:54 < bridge> <teero777> yea that would be an option.
15:54 < bridge> <teero777> so if you join a server the server tells you to install a mod from www.website.com and it is to your own choice to install it.
15:55 < bridge> <teero777> or some automatic install via a confirmation
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically yes
15:55 < bridge> <teero777> that sounds better
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's already pretty edge case xd
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> grey zone*

15:58 < bridge> <teero777> it just forces u
15:59 < bridge> <teero777> my skills as a professional screenshot editor are unrivaled
15:59 < bridge> <Bota> I dont like what I see
16:00 < bridge> <teero777> and maybe some notice about if the mod is officially verified or not. via a checksum of the mod
16:00 < bridge> <teero777> and maybe some notice about if the mod is officially verified or not. via a checksum of the mod calculated by the client
16:01 < bridge> <teero777> man im not that good at doing art ;(
16:01 < bridge> <Bota> I don‚Äôt mean the art i mean the mod thing
16:02 < bridge> <Bota> For some reason I got a bad feeling in my stomach
16:02 < bridge> <teero777> ok cool
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it'd probably be need to be "This server wants you to install graphics mod XY. DDNet can not entirely prevent these mods from containing viruses or similar, If you are certain you still want to continue on your own risk without any chance of acusing DDNet for your action, please write 'I understood the above text'"
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> <text input field>
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
16:04 < bridge> <Bota> Someone can read my mind üòÆ
16:05 < bridge> <teero777> well i was too lazy to write that out. but its what i mean
16:05 < bridge> <teero777> dont specialize something not yet implemented
16:05 < bridge> <teero777> so ig lets make a mod system yay!
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> so the mod files are just like compiled .so files? xd
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> or you want smth with wasm/lua
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could say they are .so files but as wasm modules xd
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> okay. so just create a lot of hooks and a loading system
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> first i need to finish proximity chat tho.

20:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> im using win 11 SDK and msvc 2022 build tools, tried using clion and visual studio
20:13 < bridge> <diariesvexar> let me see my vs installer give you my installed \packages list maybe help you
20:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> yes that would be great thank you - i've been using linux for years and i just hopped onto windows 11 - i am so fucking lost
20:14 < bridge> <teero777> do you have ddnet-libs in libs folder?
20:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> im always cloning with --recursive yes
20:14 < bridge> <diariesvexar> well I have both as dual boot and I'm fine on both for compiling ddnet
20:14 < bridge> <teero777> oke
20:14 < bridge> <diariesvexar> did you use cmake GUI or command prompt ?
20:15 < bridge> <diariesvexar> did you used cmake GUI or command prompt ?
20:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> tried both

20:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> is that everything?
20:16 < bridge> <diariesvexar> cuz it's want to force you using click features on windows
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> worked for me.
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> install cmake, rust, vs community, git
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> 1. git clone ddnet recursive
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> 2. go cmake-gui and generate
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> 3. open vs community and compile
20:17 < bridge> <diariesvexar> no I send that to show you my vs version
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> hate mouse
20:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> a

20:27 < bridge> <reitw> tf
20:27 < bridge> <kekomonter> Why vs have so much components
20:27 < bridge> <diariesvexar> +
20:27 < bridge> <diariesvexar> Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22000.0)
20:27 < bridge> <kekomonter> :justatest:
20:27 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I think because of supporting c/c++/c# and etc
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> #define TIME_CODE_BLOCK(block) \
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> do { \

20:28 < bridge> <teero777>     block; \
20:28 < bridge> <teero777>     auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now(); \
20:28 < bridge> <teero777>     auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start); \
20:28 < bridge> <teero777>     dbg_msg("Timer", "Time taken by code block: %ldms", duration.count()); \
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> } while(0)
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> ```
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> if only there was a better way to profile ddnet code :feelsbadman:
20:28 < bridge> <diariesvexar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206683200097878097/image.png?ex=65dce64d&is=65ca714d&hm=c1c957fe1fcccf0846ee359517c2d4a04b06d73b3d14dab56cde3c5d03589943&
20:28 < bridge> <reitw> perf tool
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> one that doesnt slow code down to the point it takes 3 min for ddnet client to start pls
20:29 < bridge> <diariesvexar> emm your mmo mode required it's own client right ?
20:29 < bridge> <reitw> perf tool
20:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nope
20:30 < bridge> <diariesvexar> is it 0.7 ?
20:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> Server will support custom client and default
20:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nope, ddnet based
20:30 < bridge> <diariesvexar> hmm interesting
20:31 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that wings and crows that I saw on your discord's server
20:31 < bridge> <diariesvexar> is that client side features ?
20:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yap
20:32 < bridge> <diariesvexar> like that
20:32 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that's private right ?
20:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> Fully client side, works on every server
20:32 < bridge> <teero777> okay lemme try i tried valgrind before which was terrible
20:32 < bridge> <teero777> mb
20:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yea
20:32 < bridge> <diariesvexar> other player with same client able to see that ?
20:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yea
20:33 < bridge> <teero777> ok im officially amazed
20:33 < bridge> <teero777> very cool üëç
20:34 < bridge> <diariesvexar> so every one have it at same time or for example can i turn wings off ?
20:35 < bridge> <diariesvexar> my English knowledge are shit
20:35 < bridge> <diariesvexar> don't know how to explain better myself to you üòÑ
20:35 < bridge> <kekomonter> Client just sending "hello, i'm IGN and here is my uuid(taken from system and used md5 hash)" to IRC server, and IRC checking db and sending packet like "look, this dude have item_id and his name is IGN"
20:36 < bridge> <diariesvexar> ohh I see you connect your client to irc as API to connect all client together
20:36 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that's was my question cuz you can't send custom data to other someone else server to spread information across clients about wings or lablablablalbab
20:36 < bridge> <kekomonter> My English is bed too, I'm just learned English from ddnet chat and some coding forums xdd
20:37 < bridge> <diariesvexar> exactly me too
20:37 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I just watching english series or movie to learn English
20:37 < bridge> <kekomonter> My English is bad too, I'm just learned English from ddnet chat and some coding forums xdd
20:37 < bridge> <diariesvexar> You are from Russian right ?
20:37 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'm talking in chats xd
20:37 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yea
20:38 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I really liked your client's feature really glad to see that wing and crows before I die
20:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> You need verify? xd
20:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> In my client
20:40 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I prefer to have your wing and crows code that's awesome
20:40 < bridge> <diariesvexar> let me send you my own client
20:40 < bridge> <diariesvexar> can I send you DM ?
20:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> Aa, you about this xd
20:41 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yea why not?
20:41 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'll talk with my friend about this
20:42 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that would be great to help  me in that case I really like it like a lot
20:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> @diariesvexar the issue persists, i fucking hate it here
20:42 < bridge> <diariesvexar> sending video to you
20:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'll go dual boot, fuck it
20:43 < bridge> <reitw> you can have a flame graph with https://profiler.firefox.com
20:43 < bridge> <diariesvexar> can you see what you doing during compile ?
20:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> its a zlib issue
20:43 < bridge> <diariesvexar> well we use prefered libs on windows
20:44 < bridge> <diariesvexar> so it's not accually zlib issue i think
20:45 < bridge> <diariesvexar> so it's not zlib issue i think
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> Zlib isnt included in ddnet-libs
20:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> Anyways, Arch Here i come again

21:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> u got a nice cpu use gentoo bro
21:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
21:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> also u got new gen amd right
21:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has AV512
21:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> AVX512
21:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will only get to use that ifu  self compile
21:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> yes
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512
21:38 < bridge> <kekomonter> And correct spaces
21:38 < bridge> <kekomonter> :troll:
21:38 < bridge> <kekomonter> Do your backend in C++
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> üíÄ
23:03 < bridge> <learath2> Excuse me sir. Do you have a moment to talk about gentoo our lord and saviour?
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> @ryozuki two of you guys? oh lord you gonna make me install gentoo
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> only install gentoo if you enjoy doing system maintenance
23:07 < bridge> <Ewan> which i can get behind but personally am not a fan of
23:09 < bridge> <learath2> Most of the time the "maintainance" is just `emerge --sync && emerge -uDUavt --deep --with-bdeps=y @world`
23:10 < bridge> <learath2> Unless something goes very wrong with your system, arch has pretty much the exact same amount of hands on work
23:11 < bridge> <Ewan> well sure but you also have to account for the fact that gentoo is compiling every package from source
23:11 < bridge> <Ewan> and it's much more involved to set up stuff like use flags
23:11 < bridge> <Ewan> even on my 7900x a system upgrade took at least an hour
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i bet the average person's cpu takes all day to even compile smth like firefox too
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it's cool if you're into that
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but im not
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> also arch system upgrade is way more brief than this
23:21 < bridge> <Ewan> just pacman -Syu if nothing is broken
