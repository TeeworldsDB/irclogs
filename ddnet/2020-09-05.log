00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ask for permission*
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we would need an old_hash for each version that ever existed
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My idea was that we have a single md5sums file and that stores the current expected hashes for all files in data/
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and when updating we compare against that, then we update everything in data, asking user on files that are changes, then update the md5sums file
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would we need an old_hash for each version?
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> md5sums would basically be a file that contains all old_hashes, no?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, now I understand what you meant. Why does it need update7 support though?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, doesn't really matter I guess, an old version will always destroy everything anyway
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, you mean to have an intermediate update without destroying
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, can do that
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it doesn't change much, it'll still overwrite everything we changed from the current version until the end of update6
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, yeah, that's basically everything
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was hoping the next iteration of the updater would be a rewrite, but I guess this is something we can do fairly easily
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could also rewrite it if you want to
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't want to promise anything, I've been rather busy and rather unmotivated lately
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> what about steam version ?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should be putting the custom stuff in the config directory anyway, I doubt steam has anyway to do this check
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so we might warn user ingame in case if it is steam version
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> warn on game started
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't, updates happen way before the game starts
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean warn once we detected changes
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not before update
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, we could keep a list of hashes we compare to at start, but after the files are overwritten, there isn't much point to knowing that they are overwritten
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the point is to tell user that he overrides the files he should not
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> and the overriden data might be lost
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> and blah blah blah - do override cfg files
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> and blah blah blah - do override cfg files instead
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem is we can't detect that 😄
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, I misunderstood then
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Storage system makes that kind of overriding invisible to us
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I thought each version would have predefined hashes we compare to
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Steam has this kind of check built in
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, we could modify the storage to have a check for `$DATADIR` integrity
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen is it something we can query?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Settings -> Properties -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Files
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, it will rewrite your files to initial state
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 maybe that's the easier/cleaner way? Warn users when they overwrote anything in data/?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its like recover my files to server state
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and tell them to put it in config_directory instead
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what, I think that does sound better
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so, why we dont calculate hashes before release and compare this hash to users files?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On launch we can hash everything in data, and we can match it to a precalculated hash
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, works for Steam version too
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the warn before replacement in updater could be a second step improvement
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And just show a big popup that these files were changed, can be overwritten by update and should be in config_directory instead
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the warn before replacement in updater could be a second step improvement (but works for non steam only -()
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> when I set up V-sync the pointer is way behind the real (OS) mouse pointer (windows). is it possible to use OS pointer in game ? I dont mind missclicks but brain can not work with such delay.
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Disable vsync? Enable fullscreen?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> borderles
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ah
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it helps ofc
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I tried to play on geforce gtx 1050 but I was not able to due this issue
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its not important just comes out of my interes
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I set fsaa smaples to 0 as well and it  was almost playable but on integrated intel is way way better to play 🙂
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> why does entities not work on noby fng in the new version
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> the only spike that shows up are the red spikes
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ingame entities or in editor? what is noby? Can we have a screen?
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ingame entities or in editor? what is noby? Can we have a screenshot?
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @abcqwerty what is noby :troll:
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh yea, the same for me in steam version
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> just reproduced in steam version AliveFng on ger ddnet server
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> just reproduced in steam version AliveFng on ger ddnet server (windows)
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well, obviously it happened because fng players treats pause and zooz as a cheat. No other explanation here
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :troll:
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dumb fix - delete everything from data\shader
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> smart fix - I dont know, I am not smart, ask @Jupstar ✪
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> actually forget it, I did it and it become working but maybe helped something else
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> knows zooz, doesn't know noby
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :tee_thinking:
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > dumb fix - delete everything from data\shader
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dont do it, its wrong way but I have no idea how I fixed it for my self
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @abcqwerty I have found a solution for you. Just reconnect to the server xD
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> HMM
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lol it works
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes fng players karma is not that bad
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> Hi! I am trying to build the javascript client of DDNet in this project: https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet. And I get stuck at the last stage of linking. It seem that the wasm binary file can not link with dynamic library in linux64. Should I compile all dynamic library which ddnet client used to wasm binary with emscripten by myself?  or there are another simpler way? Any help would be appreciate.

08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> @Eki morning good night
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @TsFreddie 🌈 it is 14:50 here, good night for you
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I think we have a bundles mode but can't look up rn
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Look in cmakelists
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> There are not cmakelists in  https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet, do you mean cmakelist of ddnet offical repos https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt . It seem thar cmake will find the library from
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751697779864240148/unknown.png
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> from ddnet-libs
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> but there are not wasm build in ddnet-libs so i think it won't work even I use cmake instead of bam.
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your best bet to get wasm building would be to wait around for eeeee
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> but the last commit of eeeee in https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet is already 5 years ago,
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is still around on irc
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> ah, maybe I should ask he for help in irc.
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This channel is linked to the irc and iirc he has a bouncer so he'll see when he is around
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> That is nice, thank you for telling me about that.
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki that's very cool to see you trying to build teewebs 🙂
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh the crawler that provided teewebs with serverinfo is sadly long dead though :?
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki to me it looks like libGL.so should not be linked in at all since that's a Linux executable, not wasm
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yes, and the servers don't support websockets anymore
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> teewebs is a really cool stuff but unfortunately I am not smart enough to build it 😛
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki maybe you could try modifying the last linking command to just  remove the GL and try to run that line in command line
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> ok, i will try it
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Unfortunately I never built it as well. But you should have some libgl.so equivalent in emscripten
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> >  I am not smart enough to build it 😛
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> bruh you're like 10 times better than me
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki you did use the js branch, right?
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> I think so. if remove the GL not work maybe i have to build libgl and othen library to wasm by myself...
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> yes i use js branch
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also did you build following eeeee's instructions?
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet/blob/js/BUILDING_JS
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to apply the patch, then use the script to build it
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> yes, i following his instructions but get stuck at step 6 runing ./compile_to_js
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> i have not apply the patch but use the newest emscripten sdk, maybe that is the reason
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the patch probably won't apply to new version
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and no, the patch is not about linking
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> maybe wasm binary file can just can not link with dynamic library in linux64
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> maybe wasm binary file just can not link with dynamic library in linux64
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not supposed to link with linux libraries anyway iirc
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's GL file should not end up in the linking line
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki I get `/usr/bin/python3: can't open file '/tmp/gcc_mocks/g++.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> i do some change to the compile_to_js, which is also link the emcc.py to /tmp/gcc_mocks/gcc.py
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> and link the em++.py to /tmp/gcc_mocks/g++.py
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you trying to build the repo as is or are you trying to update it to a new version?
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> emcc.py and em++.py can be found in the same path of emcc
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it'll work that easily with cmake
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, works
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Next error: `other/freetype/include/freetype/freetype.h:1671:3: error: '__declspec' attributes are not enabled; use '-fdeclspec' or '-fms-extensions' to enable support for __declspec attributes`
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > Are you trying to build the repo as is or are you trying to update it to a new version?
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @Learath2 i will perfer to build the repo as is
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @Eki u need to apply patch for emscripten
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > Next error: `other/freetype/include/freetype/freetype.h:1671:3: error: '__declspec' attributes are not enabled; use '-fdeclspec' or '-fms-extensions' to enable support for __declspec attributes`
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @deen ah, i dont encount this error..
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki it would probably work out-of-the-box with the same version of emscripten that eeeee used, but we don't know which one that is 😄
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > @Eki u need to apply patch for emscripten
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @m!ki yes, i will try it later
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Also I think that its outdated, and needs latest version
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> So, needs to change code
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> but i dont know what versionof emscripten he use..
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you try to link a simple gl example with emscripten?
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See how it links to GL, is there -lGL even present in the link line?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> that will be a good way to debug the problem, i will tryp to find and build other simple gl example with emscripten
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, one step further, now the linking also fails for me: `wasm-ld: error: unable to find library -lGLU`
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> :frozen:
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I feel like you need these libraries, like opus, compiled with emscripten before
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Yes
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> that may will be a big work if we need to build every libraries we need to link with emscripten by outselves
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Or maybe just compile ddnet client with Cheerp
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> i know it but maybe it will may this problem more complicate
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> https://medium.com/leaningtech/porting-a-c-multiplayer-game-to-the-web-with-cheerp-webrtc-and-firebase-29fbbc62c5ca
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> it seem lots of work have to do if we want port ddnet to web using cheerp.
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> and they have not open source
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> Does anyone else have the problem where you use the pause button after pressing escape and then when you say join game you are stuck in pause still?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> > and they have not open source
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @Eki so write one 😉
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> Can only unpause when I use pause bind
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > @Eki so write one 😉
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @m!ki i just want to compile this repos successfully first of all😫
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @Eki i tried to compile that repo too, but how deen said, it requires emscripten compiled libs
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> So i gave up xd
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> maybe there are more smarter way to do it. i am not that familar with emscripten.
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 on what server? official ddnet servers should be fine, KoG has not updated
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> deen woke up:justatest:
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :konstitroll:
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :nobyisthebiggesttroll:
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @deen not sure if I was on ddnet or kog sorry
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 but yeah, it's a bit annoying that we have this problem on KoG now. Not sure how to detect it
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> actually I have an idea now that I think about it
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will fix for next release
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen can you build that guy on steam a nightly?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he seems resposive
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> building now
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> my little server is really weak for all these builds 😄
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok ty
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if they still pass the analysis
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i need 300 iq to fix their pcs
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ We believe in You
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think if the nightly fails too, i'll disable OpenGL 2.0
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just cant imagine it fails in 2.1 with shader analysis
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i'd have one of theses PCs i could just lookup everything i need to get a feeling for the issue xd
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get awful autocompletion for python on vscode and it's so annoying...
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm quite okay with not having any autocomplete, but when it sometimes works sometimes doesn't it's quite annoying
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> for me its working
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ there are probably some scrapyards where you can get such a pc for free 😄
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD yeah
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would actually be interesting to see if DDNet would run on some 15 year old GPU
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah for sure
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> NVidia or ATI
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not intel
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not that practical after all
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> theoretically we have opengl 1.1 support
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so even <2000 GPUs should work
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as long they dont lie about their version string and ignore basically everything from the opengl spec xD
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao can you try```py
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> from pathlib import Path
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for p in Path('.').rglob('*'):
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   p.```?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't infer the type of p for me so I get no completion...
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751726709895594064/unknown.png
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great, it's only me
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet it's python's absolutely retarded module system
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what python version
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe u dont have it selected
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3.8.5
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its selected in vscode?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> weird
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It won't infer the types of anything I declare
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It won't even try it seems, unless I shove it in it's face with a hint
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's only completely broken for pythons own modules, works fine for things I install from pip
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't wait for the day python dies off, hopefully sometime in the next 50 years so I can celebrate it
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> python is love
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd spend all my fortune on creating and marketing a python alternative that doesn't look like it's designed by a 5yo thinking he is a computer scientist
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is if I had any fortune
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Python is so lucky that guy that thought he was qualified to make all the decisions stepped down
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u always have problems
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It actually makes me furious when I have problems with stuff like this that's supposed to be plug and play
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like I feel like breaking this laptop in half right now
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever I give python the benefit of the doubt, whenever I decide to give it a chance it makes my blood pressure sky rocket
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then dont use it lmao
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly it's what we decided to use for teeworlds
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it was up to me, I'd probably be using perl
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks much more sane
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ur pc is rly slow and vscode cant index and show u the autocomplete list
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one forcing u to use it for teeworlds
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u are a free man
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a free man in a free world
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> america
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> may god be with you
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> murica
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki nah ```Analysis of scripts.data_hash (User) on depth 0 completed in 0.47 ms.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IntelliCode identified no likely completion items.```
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 lol, after years of coding in Ruby every time I get back to Python I get same sympthoms
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > whenever I decide to give it a chance it makes my blood pressure sky rocket
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> code in rust
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ruby also looks nice
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do u go back to python then
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if u dont like it
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust also looks nice
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone and their mothers are using python, we can't just decide to commit a script in another language
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> right now I use python bot that other person coded for me
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish there was a good interpreted scripting language that can be used lika lua or python in games
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coding in lua is even worse
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> lua is plainly awful
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its statically typed
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that u can provide types
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really? lua was quite pleasant to me
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u can code mods for games
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with sane autocompletion
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's like a blast from the past. From Forth times
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can decide to not commit the script at all if its not fun for u
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lua is nothing like Forth lol
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or are u doing it for work
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it doesn't even have 2d arrays
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u dont need that
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao It's usually for ddnet
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it has matrixes but this is not the same and I've seen devs emulating 2d on 1d arrays all the time
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats wrong with that
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if its for ddnet then u can just not do it
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's so low-level
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one is forcing u to do it for ddnet
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if its really so annoying for u just dont do it, no one will be mad
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what r u trying to do btw
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the issue with matrices? They worked fine for most anything I needed
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont think lua is low level
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he thinks using 2d arrays in a 1d array is low level
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast thats what i interpreted
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 it's not only about matrices. I've wanted to make structure like array of hashes of arrays and it was too complex.
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 it's not only about matrices. I've wanted to make structure like array of hashes of arrays and it was too complex to implement.
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw, neither C nor C++ has multi dimensional arrays either. It's all array of arrays
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 it's not only about matrices. I've wanted to make structure like array of hashes/maps/dicts of arrays and it was too complex to implement.
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c# has them iirc
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why on earth game scripting language has to be like C?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> technically c does have multi dimensional arrays tho?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> int[,] array = new int[4, 2];
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i mean whats char a[5][5];
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its laid out in memory as  dimension but defined as 2d
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Ryozuki ok, tell me how to do array of dicts of arrays
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its laid out in memory as 1 dimension but defined as 2d
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> bonus for safely iterating it
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> that's five char a[5]
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I'm doing the data hash thing, honestly don't need the autocomplete for it, it just pisses me off when people say python is for my 3yo niece to code in and it just doesn't work out of the box
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why it doesnt work for u
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u  misconfigured
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> in ruby it's just a = [{[], []}]
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby The standard says nothing about multidimensional arrays, it's just how the syntax works out
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or a = Array.new(Hash.new(Array.new)) if you fancy that
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> is that possible in lua?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> isnt the syntax supposed to simulate how a multi dimensional array would work tho
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> even if it doesnt stay that way thru passing it
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bro
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a array in lua is also used with {}
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> those are very basic and common structures
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it looks like {{},{}}
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u iterate it with ipairs
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> this!
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby well that wasn't really the intention
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i guess it's more about type checking
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that!
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> doesn't really matter in c
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what is the intention of array[][] then
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby it's just an array of arrays
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> to iterate in pairs to emulate hash on array
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> right
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> to iterate in pairs to emulate dict on array
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> isnt that all a multi dimensional array is
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751734120169865236/unknown.png
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why the language don't have proper semantics for common structures?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it does
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the same
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby eeeh, an array of arrays is a common way to implement it but it's not the only way
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> other ways like double pointers and stuff ?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Ryozuki thanks for an example. And this is why I don't like lua. High-level language is supposed to know and check the semantics of data structure, not a programmer.
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also hate lua
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im using it rn to mod factorio xd
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: this conv is really pointless
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> need a pointer
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> int *pFreddie = nullptr;
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have it
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the pointer
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> thx
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> np
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> *(--pFreddie)
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> array1.each do |dict1|
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck>   dict1.each do |key, array2|
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck>     array2.each do |el|
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck>     .. something useful with key and el
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck>     end
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck>   end
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> end```
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby sure, not only that but syntax can be different too, for C# it'd be `arr[4, 2]`
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and that's in ruby, much more concise don't you think?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 use neovim with coc-nvim with the python plugin
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> o.0
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might be implemented as an array of arrays under the hood, but it's not really an array of arrays nor can you access it as such
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> arr[4][2] is a syntax error
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I was shocked to find that
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so i said it is more about type checking..
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I was shocked to find that ^
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In Ada it'd be `arr(4,2)`
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nevertheless I've moved from lua to yaml as a configuration and moved all dynamic logic to C and get all data structures I've wanted.
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's all the examples I have in mind for languages with different implementations for multidimensional arrays, but I'm sure there are more
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And dropped lua in my mod.
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nevertheless I've moved from lua to yaml as a configuration thing and moved all dynamic logic to C and get all data structures I've wanted.
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nevertheless I've moved from lua to yaml as a configuration thing and moved all dynamic logic to C and got all data structures I've wanted.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://arewegameyet.rs/ecosystem/scripting/
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool stuff
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It puzzles me greatly why lua is popular in 2020. It's really lowlevel.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> scripting languages that have a syntax like rust
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/pistondevelopers/dyon
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a love for all things low level
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mun-lang.org/
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this also looks cool
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope mun replaces lua
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The simplicity is just so elegant
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> 🙂
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The best way to replace lua would be a language that compiles down to lua
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its to stop using it
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The lua vm has seen so much work, it's extremely efficient and there are many JITs around for it that perform great
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751736226654191646/unknown.png

11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You won't get people to migrate to something that has bugs every week and has 1/5th the performance of lua
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what's great for performance? wasm
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats for the web
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and yeah mun compiles to wasm too
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can run a V8 or any other js vm that can do jit and get amazing performance, it doesn't have to be for the web
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I had to develop a mod system for a game, I'd either use wasm or lua
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe mun will one day be stable enough and we can use that. It does seem to have some nice features
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i just ask for a language that is static and you can have good autocompletion when modding
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it just helps to not look docs every 5 secs
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, it'd be nice to have a statically typed language
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you know what compiles to wasm and has types? Typescript 😄
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never seen a game use it tho
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can be the first \o/
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751736255783632936/unknown.png
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> button size does not depend on text size?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Matodor no
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> :feelsbadman:
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there a way to get the buffer size for an opened file in python?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Matodor not sure, do you want to shorten the text in your language file?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or instead should we try to make the buttons bigger again? But then we need 2 rows on 5:4/4:3 resolutions
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> make 2 rows on 5:4 and responsive buttons on >= fullhd 🤔
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should probably still be fixed size so the text fits for everyone or not
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and not depend on resolution or translation
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, no constexpr unordered_maps in C++
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so funny, how these russian guys with their problem stop answering once we give them a nightly xD
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I explicitly wrote to report if it works 😄
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the Chinese people with problems also say it's too much work to try out nightly
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd, unzipping and start the exe wow
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt steam have nightly
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they can just set it there
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes that too xd
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 2020 and ppl still dont know how to use a pc
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but alot of these players are probably still young, so its ok xd
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> This is probably known but I'll report it anyway.
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The steam overlay isn't properly working on my end when playing the steam ddnet version.
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I think there's something wrong with the overlay resolution, it looks pretty.. I don't know what to call it, dull?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It hurts my eyes looking at it <a:aniblobsweat:455715193855672321> 
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Also it's not possible to move windows opened in the overlay e.g the friendslist, or steam browser
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 could you test https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-videorecorder-osx.dmg ?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hao2?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The UI is a little messy
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751790257464148048/Screenshot_2020-09-05_at_16.05.46.png
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It opens 3 windows for some reason, though not sure if that has anything to do with this
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751790640983179324/Screenshot_2020-09-05_at_16.06.38.png
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I have absolutely no idea where it saved the demo it rendered 😄
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, I can't believe it, it works \o/
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something working on macOS the first try is unheard of
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's also kinda outputting it's own stuff in our console, which might or might not create issues since we are outputting to it asynchronously
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> str_next_token is one of the ugliest things I've created...
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> LTO finds the bugs u didnt expect xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen does it have a linux version?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen 
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > could you test
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> does it have a linux version?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen responsive UI would be way better idea, since in one language the buttons will be unnecessarily long, while in others they will not be long enough to fit the text.
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Also, instead of additional space on the sides of text and making button longer, it would be better idea to spend that space in between the buttons so that it's harder to missclick around the button edges.
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-videorecorder-linux_x86_64.tar.xz
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for me on Linux the resulting mp4 is bad, but on Windows it is good
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might also just be a problem with my desktop though
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will try it later
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have problems with the audio
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ same, if you can fix that would be great
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you're on Linux too?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am, but i havent looked into it yet
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `fs_listdir` not returning full paths is kinda annoying
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, and my custom ffmpeg build is quite small, the video recorder only adds
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 1-2 MB to the file size
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the original one added 20 MB
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I get no sound on the rendered demo at all
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, I never tested sound
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is there some error message in console maybe?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, nvm I had sounds disabled in the client 😄
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It works just fine
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yay
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm having a little bit of a brainfart, can you tell me how I can recursively traverse a directory?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 in python use walk
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/os_walk.htm
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if thats what u meant
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, in ddnet code
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 should we get it in for beta testing at least?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In python I just did `Path('data').rglob('*')` works surprisingly nicely
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/recursive_directory_iterator
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (the ffmpeg bundles)
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u can use c++17
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use the filesystem api
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen if it works fine in windows and linux, sure. It works surprisingly well on macOS, though it's rather slow
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```c++
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #include <filesystem>
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using recursive_directory_iterator = std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator;
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ...
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for (const auto& dirEntry : recursive_directory_iterator(myPath))
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>      std::cout << dirEntry << std::endl;

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki C++11 :/
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from stackoverflow
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 we might be using only 1 thread, I'm not sure
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I guess I'll just pass around a prefix that I add to each time I descend down
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you can choose a different preset
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u probs have to use OS dependent apis
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki system.h already handles that, the issue is that the returned path is relative
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tested with wine and linux, both worked
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen `[aac @ 0x7fc0eebda200] Too many bits 32768.000000 > 12288 per frame requested, clamping to max` this was in the log, might want to look into that too
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, we had these problems forever in the video recorder, i didn't fix them
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be nice to use framebuffers with GL 3.3, could speedup the creation of the video
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get why u have to see what ur recording
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki ur homework go
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt solve the problem of recording externally and waiting 2 hours for a 2 hour demo
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah converting sounds better
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now the question is do I use a std::string inside a tuple and change it when heinrich reviews it or do I create a struct with a char[MAX_PATH_LENGTH] inside for the prefix
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use char
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki we could probably play it back much faster than the 50 ticks per second we have in real time
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The issue is probably sounds
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean you just need to capture the sound when u capture the frame
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant be impossible xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah but changing the playback speed of a sound isn't lossless
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With 1000 tps, you'd need to speed it up 20 times for it to be correct 😄
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats a problem
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we can generate the waveform separately
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, before thinking about this I need to finish up this data folder integrity thing
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another feature I'm looking forward to in C++20 is `std::format`...
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> When I tried to disconnect dummy after
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> When I tried to disconnect dummy at 60 minutes into a run, menu disappeared and I can't open menu anymore
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> has smth to do with the warning message maybe?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> and it didn't disconnect dummy too
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> but dummy_disconnect in console works
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm,
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds like something to do with the warning popup yeah
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats why i didnt want to touch it xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> Im still in this state so should i test stuff?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> was the warning shown btw?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> no it wasn't
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ Well you technically didn't I did 😄
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> i opened another client and bug is easy to do
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> i opened another client and bug is easy to replicate
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how xd
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> cl_confirm_disconnect_time 0
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it happens when a popup is open but you manage to deactivate the menu
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> the normal disconnect works normally
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> only the dummy one makes you bugged
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was easy xd
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> and kill/spectate may need confirm popups too?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> found it i think
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> removed the message popup somehow
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf xD
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> copy and delete
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok doesnt fix, but still a bug xxd
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `    if(Client()->State() >= IClient::STATE_ONLINE)`
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> state_quitting maybe?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should i say == online or == demo playback
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where is that even?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its in the render function and dopesnt matter
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i really dont get it
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> was smone else working in the menus?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ... well yes deen xD
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont think its by the warning popup
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you tell me how to reproduce it?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_confirm_disconnect_time 0
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> conenct dummy
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> disconnect dummy
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yep not by my commit, it was always asking if you want to disconnect the dummy, then
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen 
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_confirm_disconnect_time 0
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> conenct dummy
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> disconnect dummy
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably a bug when you changed the menu
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does that fix it?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats just some stupidy from me
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but indipentend
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `69e6a8fa41b2a8fce0b6ffbf12a5a41229a3d3ae is the first bad commit`
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see the bug 😄
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks @Anxton
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> thx
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> to you
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pf, something is broken in windows and I have no idea what, nor do I have access to windows to check
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2754/checks?check_run_id=1075697169 can someone with windows check what's wrong with this?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no matter what map u vote it always shows this on serverinfo tab

18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen we have the first tester
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and it seem to fallback
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yay, where? Another one: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/2952628008350861354/
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen see #general
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen its the same person xD
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik fixed next time it reloads in 1 hour
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think the chance is high that it works now
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/2952628008348582573/
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what does it say
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that the game renders bad
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that he thinks its due to the last update
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll see
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen will create a patch now
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i love how aggressive they always are xD
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they need more magnesium or smth like that
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ its not like they paid 60€ to play the game xd
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> jupstar DLC 60 bucks
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> > that the game renders bad
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @Ryozuki  that's propaply because of the old borderfixed tilesets
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> most likely
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think he was more likely one of the ppl with 100 years old pc xd
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi can you provide a screenshot? ^
