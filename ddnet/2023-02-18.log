08:13 <+ChillerDragon> freenodes?
08:22 <+ChillerDragon> I keep getting crashes in my ddnet server fork no idea how to debug it. It says "Broken pipe" full crash here https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/oD
08:25 <+ChillerDragon> The way i understand it is that it timeouts while doing masterserver stuff for whatever reason and then the socket dies and it somehow keeps trying to send there. Does that make sense? But then this is not a official ddnet bug is it? So it means it somewhere got introduced during merges hmm
08:46 < bridge> <Faulty> Do you run your server with gdb or in debug mode? What version of curl is it used?
08:48 <+ChillerDragon> i build in debug mode and then run the server with gdb does it print the curl version? Anyways when running ``curl --version`` it says ``libcurl/7.74.0`` so i assume thats what the server uses too
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> whatever my debian 11 repos currently offer
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Is the stderr missing? Maybe look in a debugger where it wants to write to
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's either file io or network or logging i guess
09:06 <+ChillerDragon> Idk how to look that up only thing i see is ``fd=19`` but that file descriptor doesnt help me much does it?
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Guess no
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Stack trace
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> ah i see when i get the backtrace i should see that yea missed the chance ill check again in 
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> idk a few weeks when it happens again :D 
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> from a old backtrace i know its here but not sure which line because its outdated trace https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/cd8991efa291dd8e74354ce3635426403721d77b/src/engine/shared/http.cpp#L188-L308
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> wait pretty sure its here https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/cd8991efa291dd8e74354ce3635426403721d77b/src/engine/shared/http.cpp#L295
09:11 <+ChillerDragon> but no idea whats the problem w curl i mean thats basically the same code ddnet uses so the issue has to be somewhere else

10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> im doing this cuz i don't like the way ddnet does the rounded corners & it works for the GUI but persistent things like some components of the hud are rendered responsibly & don't update without being notified of a change
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076439078419046420/image.png
10:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> You are not using ddnet. `ui_rounded_corners` has never existed for ddnet. And if it did, I would advocate for its immediate removal.
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i made it
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm not trying to pull request or anything
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know how that was not obvious by my statement
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> edgy
10:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> Then you basically answered your own questions: check if the variable was changed and then update the rects
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> get it? cuz edges
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> rect
10:55 < bridge> <Learath2> I can't think of an easy way, you'll just have to pepper some if statements everywhere
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> bummer
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> lerato sprinkling italian pepper
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> is there an existing mechanism to fire a callback on a settings change
10:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> yes, but for this you probably need to remember the old value wherever you render a rect and then check if the old value != the new value
10:57 < bridge> <Learath2> I think you can add a conchain. We do it for sv_map e.g.
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> why would i need to do that?
10:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Doesn't the conchain happen before the actual callback?
10:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> otherwise how to you "push" the updated value to all components that draw a rect? you'd first need a list of all components drawings rects
10:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> otherwise how to you "push" the updated value to all components that draw a rect? you'd first need a list of all components drawing rects
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i wanted to do a graphical refresh for this reason
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> because it shouldn't really require a restart. it would just be that
10:59 < bridge> <Learath2> It shouldn't but it does :/
10:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe you could hack it together by calling `OnWindowResize`, which should invalidate all cached quad and text containers
11:00 < bridge> <Learath2> I was just about to say that ðŸ˜„
11:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe that would work
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> not worth it. i'll just store its first value forever & require a restart (so it's at least consistent)
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> im doing this because the way ddnet does rounded rectangles is weird. they're absurdly large and they don't pad the contents to accommodate. you just have to kinda hope it doesn't clip lol
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and they're not antialiased for whatever reason. could be a number of factors but any way i don't like it
11:02 < bridge> <Robyt3> nothing is antialiased except round corners AFAIK, but you need to enable MSAA
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah this is different from in-game AA & should be handled as such
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076443661996404776/image.png
11:02 < bridge> <Learath2> Absurdly large? Hm iirc they fit exactly inside the rect you pass to the function
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i just mean the radii are too large for my taste
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing broken about the size
11:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> just multi each corner radius by 0.5f before drawing :nouis:
11:03 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah, yep it's an old teeworlds thing, back then it was the cool trend
11:04 < bridge> <Learath2> I wanted a sharper ui but iirc people said it lost character so we kept it as is
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan> sad lol
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> are there docs for conchain?
11:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Nope, but it's not very hard to use, just grep for `Chain` or `ConChain` or maybe `sv_map`
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rk5bXUPhlE
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> video docs poggers
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i agree but it's not for me
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't have that kind of attention span lol
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> ill grep
11:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> Check how it's done in the code, e.g. search for `ConchainFriendlistUpdate`
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> what's the highest level CComponent?
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that i could call `OnWindowResize()` on & have it trickle down
11:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> Call it on CGameClient, which should propagate it to all components
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a global instance or is it static
11:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> All components have a pointer to it with `GameClient()`
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> void CMenus::ConchainRoundedCorners(IConsole::IResult *, void *,
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan>                                     IConsole::FCommandCallback, void *) {
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan>   GameClient()->OnWindowResize();
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> }
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> 
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> this is weird, i'm getting a can't call member w/o instance error, as if CMenus didn't inherit from CComponent?
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> void CMenus::ConchainRoundedCorners(IConsole::IResult *, void *,
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan>                                     IConsole::FCommandCallback, void *) {

11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> }
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> 
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> this is weird, i'm getting a can't call member w/o instance error, as if CMenus didn't inherit from CComponent?
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> and sorry if this is bad form & i'm not populating something i need to or whatever. i see some pfnCallback action above but im trying to get it laid out first
11:22 < bridge> <Robyt3> Did you also add it in `menus.h`?
11:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
11:22 < bridge> <Robyt3> You need to call `pfnCallback` so the config value is changed (the original command handler)
11:22 < bridge> <Ewan> oh this is my bad
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i copy pasted & the def in the header is static
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> got it working. thanks
16:11 < bridge> <Kaffeine> @ChillerDragon I didn't get if you found the issue. The thing is that I had the same ('crash' with exit code 141 after SIGPIPE received). It turned out that DDNet does not handle SIGPIPEs.
16:11 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Maybe what you need is this commit: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/199da2410df05ccdce4f98d41628725699c41080#diff-83a6b32fd0c42ef297d20d7ffbca30bd6945a6a78dc48a8df0d1130375477011R76
16:11 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Also note that some tools catch the signals before the application, thus e.g. if you run `gdb ./DDNet-Server` you can get a stop on that (or another otherwise suppressed) signal.
16:16 < bridge> <Kaffeine> (Thanks to `@heinrich5991#9827` for giving me the clue about the signal ignoring, I could spend a lot of time trying to find the "fix" (in quotes because IMO it is not a proper fix). I was running the server via `catchsegv` and it seems (but I'm not sure) that the tool catches SIGPIPE before the app could ignore it.)

16:44 < bridge> <Vy0x2> True could have asked this guy thx
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> @Kaffeine interesting thanks. But the fix you sent if from jan 2021 pretty sure my servers were running with that patch already since i merge with upstream more than once a year
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> is from*
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut pretty overkill readme for a project where like what 3 people have access and one of them is you :D sorry idk where to dm you these days
17:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Maybe it becomes opem source in the future (?) ðŸ¤­ :o
17:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> a readme is supposed to help understand a new person interested to the project what the project is about
17:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> you could add one more to the project anytime in the future
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> wowo leak
17:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> or as fokkonaut said, open sourcing it
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> thats basically what i wanted to hear hehe :)
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> poggies fddr open src
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> confirmed
17:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> A small readme/documentation has been planned for years already
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
17:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk never was motivated but started today
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> im surprised u actually did it hehe
17:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> A little
17:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> a readme is supposed to help a new person interested in the project understand what the project is about
17:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
17:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Usually I am good at writing, Im just lazy
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> okok mr nobel winning author
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> closed source bad
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> btw i saw you started typing out cmd docs i highly recommend automating that
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> i think ddnet or vanilla even have tools for that
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076545330058899546/IMG_0491.png
17:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea I know, thats why I didnt start it yet
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
17:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> just for the look of the table
17:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But Im not sure whether I want to document it in detail or simply the desc from ingame
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/client_wiki/commands.py
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> i think dis
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> and dis https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/client_wiki/settings.py
17:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lol cool
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> but what do i know i typed out 10k lines html for network docs eventho network code is generated with py scripts that could also spit out html if changed xd

17:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/confused-meme-girl-uhmmm-what-gif-25262488
17:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nein
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats just security via obfuscation
17:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> not even obfuscation
17:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> obfuscation is hiding the information behind cryptography
17:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> antibot can't be deobfuscated
17:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> *insert villager sound*
17:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> antibot can't be deobfuscated (because it isn't obfuscated)
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> is there a difference between open source and closed source onbgy anti bot?
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
17:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: cant imagine its been 5 years coding now
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> half decade pro haxor
17:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lul, open sourcing it would lead to obfuscation
17:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> still secure
17:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> no I think what he meant was
17:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> that if it was good it wouldn't need to be closed source
17:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Nono xf
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> ye fddr bad so it closed src
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax
17:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ongby src code = hf reading
17:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> hardcoding detection vectors of public clients is bad
17:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> He is trolling
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> nobys c looks like assembly
17:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
17:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> f3
17:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> optimization
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> its new language
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> its NobyC
17:58 < bridge> <ReiTW> don't steal my memes
17:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> but I understand why you do it
17:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> it's hard to come up with a 100% detection method that doesn't rely on that information
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> @ReiTW ok lemme think of susmin new: "obi wan c noby" meh only works in german :D
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> well doesnt rly work in eng or ger xd
18:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lul
18:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> kenoby works in germany
18:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> or broken english
18:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> kenoby works in german
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> A B KE
18:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> He aint using the ABC, he has his own NoByC
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> watrfak
18:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Thats why no one can read it
18:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ax
18:02 < bridge> <Ewan> obfuscation doesn't imply cryptography
18:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ob-Ewan C noby
18:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> you know what I mean though
18:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> you can't deobfuscate something that isn't obfuscated
18:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Chuck Norris can
18:02 < bridge> <Ewan> damn it
18:02 < bridge> <Ewan> LOL
18:03 < bridge> <Ewan> fokko are you ever going to have a server for the US?
18:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> donate for one
18:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Hmm, probably not in near future
18:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I would need to re do some things on the serverside to work with MySQL
18:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> otherwise no db con
18:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
18:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I wished I could just set one up rn
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> netfs + txt db > mysql
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
18:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol
18:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just use mails to send the data and later scan the data and paste it into txt documents and use fifo to tell the server new data arrived
18:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> scan the letter
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ll
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
18:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> stonks
18:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 80ct porto
18:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> xd
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> computers were a mistake my db is a unpaid intern that has to remember all data
18:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> in what units is the m_Vel?
18:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> is it in pixels?
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> in what units is pixels?
18:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> int
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> xd no i mean what are pixels how long are they?
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> i assume m_vel is in the smallest unit of m_pos
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> which was like what 32 a tile or something?
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> 64?
18:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 32 yeah
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> pixel seems screen resolution dependend idk how that would work
18:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Not necessary screen pixel
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> i do not for a fact but i highly assume vel is measured in the smallest unit a tile has
18:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but pixels still could get used
18:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> what you see on screen is affected by the zoom factor
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> thats just confusing to me :D
18:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> I at least could list a few games that do that
18:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> i wouldn't use it for velocity though
18:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> velocity in most cases got no unit
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> according to ddnet wiki a tile is 64x64
18:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> but is just representing your position change in a specific time
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> so i assume a vel of 32 makes you travel half a tile per tick?
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> idk
18:23 < bridge> <DefaultO> it's a vector that gets affected by gravity too
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> isnt velocity measured in distance unit per time unit?
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> generally speaking
18:23 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> pixels, yup, but what if m_vel doesn't represent pixels kekw
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait no
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> 60x60 units xd
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> wat
18:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> what
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> > Solid tiles (unhookable, hookable, hookthrough) have a square hitbox of 60x60 units.
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Collision
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> is that even true
18:25 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> kinda of misinformation?
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> internet never lies
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> wiki always facts
18:25 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> X years old wooker
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> I mean that was written by nondevelopers that try to explain collision
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's why I did my research first before trying to explain why shotgunfly works
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> is it non devs?
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> wiki can be edited by anyone
18:26 < bridge> <DefaultO> so likely?
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> why are you asking about units anyways?
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> whats ur mission?
18:26 < bridge> <DefaultO> @Reteah
18:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> My mission is to haunt BOO. BOO. BOO.
18:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> in seriosness though it's because I have problems with the KoGAI
18:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> if you need help with coding hacks, I can help

18:28 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> real size of tee is a box of 56x56
18:28 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> and tile should be 64x64
18:28 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> can't find any proof
18:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> what is the cause of the 64 again?
18:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> i only see 32 in the code
18:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ```// We show the speed in Blocks per Second (Bps) and therefore have to divide by the block size
18:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> float DisplaySpeedX = VelspeedX / 32;```
18:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes
18:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> and where is 64 used?
18:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> or what causes that 32 to turn 64?
18:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> ticks?
18:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 32 * x = 64 <=> x = 2
18:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Result 2 is the impostor
18:32 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> wait
18:32 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/686b2657eeecc00fb49c7e8203fb48f32c1469bc/src/game/collision.cpp#L937
18:32 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> seems tile is 32x32
18:32 < bridge> <gotroyb> @Reteah it was originally been 64 per tile but later dropped for performance reasons
18:32 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> and tee is 28x28
18:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes
18:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> where tf did you get 64 from
18:32 < bridge> <gotroyb> says that in the wiki? we need to add that
18:32 < bridge> <gotroyb> half misinformation = half true
18:33 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> source code states that tile is 32x32 and tee is 28x28 xd, did my work to spread misinformation also
18:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's why everyone should do their research. see this? I did mine.
18:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076557146734460939/image.png
18:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> i even provided the variable name
18:33 < bridge> <gotroyb> we must do anything we can for the purpose
18:34 < bridge> <gotroyb> jokes aside, gamecore::GetTile uses / 32
18:34 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> i'll edit wiki
18:35 < bridge> <gotroyb> actually `src/game/collision.cpp::GetTile()`
18:35 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> have said it already xd
18:36 < bridge> <gotroyb> true misinformation can't be consistent lol hahaha
18:41 < bridge> <louis> tile is 32
18:42 < bridge> <louis> a solid block is 60x60 relative to a tee
18:43 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> what
18:43 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076559496664592404/Screenshot_20230218-114231.png
18:43 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> i mean, why this is true
18:43 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> based on what xd
18:43 < bridge> <louis> just like how kill tile has more than 32x32, unhookable etc. has larger hitboz
18:44 < bridge> <louis> i tested it ingame before, im pretty sure its correct
18:44 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> nope, kill tiles have the same hitbox as any tile have
18:44 < bridge> <louis> no
18:44 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> tee changes his hitbox based on tile interaction
18:44 < bridge> <louis> not relative to a tee
18:44 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> this one for example
18:44 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> 
18:44 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/686b2657eeecc00fb49c7e8203fb48f32c1469bc/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1292
18:44 < bridge> <louis> thats why it says relative to the center position of a tee in the wiki
18:45 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> ah okey
18:45 < bridge> <louis> ppl will care about that much more than code specjfics
18:45 < bridge> <louis> i think
18:46 < bridge> <louis> i didnt know that tee technically changes hitbox
18:46 < bridge> <louis> if so then someone can add that in, but it should basically describe it in similar ways
19:15 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> tee-kill tile collision in a nutshell
19:15 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076567671073677332/image.png
19:16 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> 9.33 is approximately 1/3 of 28
19:17 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> and there is 0 unit interaction with all ddrace tiles afaik
19:18 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> you need to have center of your tee in tile to interact
19:18 < bridge> <DefaultO> not with freeze tiles
19:18 < bridge> <DefaultO> ah
19:18 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes
19:18 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> server literally gets tile index by mapping tees position
19:24 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> @louis so yeah you are right
19:24 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> like 32 + 9.33 * 2 is kinda 50
19:32 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> don't get why do solid tiles have 60x60 hitbox btw
19:33 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> ah wait
19:33 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> 32 + 14 * 2
19:34 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> and also server checks if tee's grounded by checking center.y + radius + 5
19:34 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> so tee's walking in air xd
19:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its a feature
23:11 < bridge> <Vy0x2> When did you guys remove https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779761780129005568/1076621164425793536/image.png and why?
