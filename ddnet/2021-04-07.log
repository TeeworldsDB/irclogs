00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man these formal documents really are bad
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a margin that takes half the paper
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also kinda makes it harder to read i think

14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how did you fix the @everyone from irc?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Empty allowed_mentions: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/mysql.py#L26
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, you mean from the ddnet bot
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk about that, but deen posted it
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean from the ddnet bot
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eh
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> irc
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> *
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know if it's bullet proof, hence: why?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have an irc bot on my server to
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> o
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll PM you
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay!
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Additionally we also did this in the channel permissions for everyone
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/829325800662761472/screenshot-20210407140419.png
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not sure if this helps against webhooks, I'd guess no
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It doesnt
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Â·âœ¯Â·> Its possible to add to show arrow keys like when you enabled "show other player key preses" but for current tee? Sometimes it will be helpful if you not sure wat key currently locked.
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Â·âœ¯Â·> Or locked accidentally.
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen || @heinrich5991 did we change our package name somehow?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> CI seems to fail to find the tar.xz
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 weird, i don't think so
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just tested and it seems the package isn't even getting generated :/
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 i already looked
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its cmake that doesnt build the tar anymore ðŸ˜„
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> some cmake update fucked it up maybe?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is some package missing to build the archives, or would cmake report this
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me run cmake verbosely and take a look
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> great waited 5 mins for the run and verbose didn't get me any new info ðŸ˜›
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, can't figure it out, would be nice if you could take a look @heinrich5991
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> oh i thought that was my ci storage limit 
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 looks like a bug in cmake 3.20
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't seem to do anything with the target flag in --parallel mode
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, hm
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yeah: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21966
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reordering the command line args helps
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> --parallel has to go last
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll make a pR
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> PR
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Why do i have 2,5k fps with my dummy und 500 with my main?
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> If i timeout to my main i also get this shit fps down to 300
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ok the bad fps always Come when i hit startline, related to demos maybe?
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Turned off automatic demos and cleaned my demos folder, still fps drop when start any map
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have no clue ðŸ˜¦
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only when dummy is connected?
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> turned off all kinds of demo?(cl_replays, race demo, auto demo)
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> no its not related to dummy, it always drops when i go through startline
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> When i kill its normal again
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> save current config and try a clean one, maybe its a specific setting
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> hm its especially on full servers when i leave solopart
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Its even worse with /showall 1 but it happens also with showall 0
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Too much Information to the client?
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with more than like 10 active tees inside your range it can defenitely start to decrease the fps
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> but its extreme :monkaspeed:
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i dont have so many tees in my range
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does zooming in and out fix it?
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe its the zoom feature or smth
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> There were 3 tees and it dropped from 2500 to 300
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Zooz makes zero difference
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on what client are you btw?
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The latest one but i tried an older one and its the same thing xd
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, then its probably some cpu limitation
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just tried it on grandma but i dont get these massive drops when leaving the solo
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ok its only related to out of solo, and idea how to fix?
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well probably a setting then
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ok probably not using /showall 1 helps
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes xd
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> but i dont remember having this problem before
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually if you dont record demos or smth, you dont need showall anymore, since the zoom feature makes all tees always visisble
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> no it doesnt
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Without showall i always have tees randomly appearing in my screen
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> probably because of my strange resolution
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then the zoom option should be improved
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and also send screen ratio
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Actually i dont see it happening now, but it was when the feature was new
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Im on 3840x1080
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno how its implemented, but its defenitelly possible ðŸ˜„
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> DDNet doesnt even support this resolution :monkalaugh:
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> personally i've nothing against supporting such wide ranges, we'd need a zoom command that can change in floating point steps then probably, so ppl playing ddrace can get a zoom level, that will look good for them to play, if the zoom steps are too big
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does more granular zoom have to do with wide ranges?
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it doesnt look too much zoomed out
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since tw zooms everything in with such resolutions
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it would be better to fix that? ðŸ˜‰
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that would create cheats for vanilla mods tho
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably needs to be fixed either way, maybe only show part of the screen on these mods
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I remember seeing it so much zoomed in that it wasn't really playable
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably yes, part of the screen would work, but also create confusion probably. but i dont have any good solution for it
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª where do these weird line breaks come from? clang-format? looks really out of place
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cannot remove them
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe some clang-format config?
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno i just use clang-format-10 now
23:55 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> is def- here?
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen
23:56 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> ok anyway
23:56 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> https://github.com/headshot2017/teeware-mod/commit/f630ae1c7245e6c2bdd199d27220c04e61caffa5 - can we tell which ddnet commit this corresponds to?
23:56 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> https://github.com/headshot2017/teeware-mod/tree/f630ae1c7245e6c2bdd199d27220c04e61caffa5 will be easier to look at i guess
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i (think) its ddnet 9
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u can just ask headshot
