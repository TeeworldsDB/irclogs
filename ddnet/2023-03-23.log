04:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> huh, discord sdk is open-source
04:59 < bridge> <судный день.> wow
05:01 < bridge> <судный день.> imagine casually creating pr with rebranding ddnet
05:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably just a mistake
06:06 < bridge> <Voxel> What type of client is that, anyways?
12:12 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Regarding Accounts-Issue#3411, I created a *very* rough summary of the conversation since it's quite a long discussion.

12:12 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Perhaps it may be beneficial to have a document that is easier for admins to edit/update. Or maybe heinrich5991 could edit his first comment at the top of <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411>.
12:12 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> 
12:12 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> I'm assuming there is still interest in the topic, not quite a "season 2", but some derivative that may be beneficial?

12:28 <+ChillerDragon> nice summary
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we'd finally need to decide if we want it to be decentralized or not.
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for heinrichs half decrentralized approach i have no sympathies. The gain that having a cache of account mappings sounds not too useful to me, that can also be done by a game server itself. And u have your password stored on your computer all the time
12:45 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://youtu.be/TSCzC-WECw8?t=87
12:45 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> wouldn't be a good idea to implement raycasts on every step the player makes in high speeds to see if it collides with an entity that should trigger something? Like kill for example
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before we do that we can also do simple password with auth tokens
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it does smth like that
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just not for kill tiles
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> start etc. is unskippable
12:47 < bridge> <Learath2> Honestly I like the decentralized stuff but I also know that it's just completely incomprehensible for the average user
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem is, its not even decentralized anyway
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we want real decrentralized we can do this:
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet has a account manager (for non it ppl) that saves the private key which the client downloads. but its a one time key. once its stolen or somehow lost, u done
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the sha of the pub key would be the account ID
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and IT ppl could gen this key pair themself
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats also why i feel like the half decentralized approach is almost not worth it
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has imho not really many adnvatages over classic authing
12:54 < bridge> <Learath2> The one major advantage (which I think is honestly a disadvantage) is that it allows for creating accounts instantly on the client side
12:54 < bridge> <Learath2> I think that is actually a bad thing since it means our accounts will be useless in moderation
12:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Except for people that care for their points, which we already can punish using name_bans
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess the ddnet account mapper could still reject such accounts, but maybe its harder yes
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> central authing could also geolocate authes to an acc.. and the session could be ip/ipregion bound
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the other type would really just need the keys
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno. but i feel like we going in a circle about the account system
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe ddnet has to be more ego and simply do accounts for ddnet first
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before caring about the community
12:57 < bridge> <Learath2> The freeform discussion in that issue didn't help much
12:58 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe we should have people make complete proposals and vote on those instead
13:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> another gain is that we don't have to handle insecure passwords by users
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and if they want to change the key?
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if its done by email, email also has a password
13:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but we don't manage it
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what if i lost my email and want to change it?
13:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why take responsability for insecure user passwords?
13:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its their own fault
13:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because they'll come to us and ask for their account to be restored
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well u can also make requirements for passwords
13:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> requirements don't work
13:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what would work is generating the password for the users
13:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> requirements can't force good passwords
13:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it just doesn't work
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but saving the key file on the computer works?
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i feel like we try to achieve to much and it wont lead us to do any thing
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw what about a simple email password auth on a per network basis, other networks require registering there, but with oauth they can verify this account is linked to x ddnet account
13:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree with you that it has the problem that a malicious client can fetch it
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not only that. i actually assume ppl will leak it by being stupid
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. if we name the dir keys
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt sound like password related
13:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wanted to hide it from the user. you think it'll still get leaked?
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well the attacker will ask to send maps/skins and keys dir
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need it
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for the epic game play
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with private keys, it's comparatively simple. the server has secure auth before the connection is established
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> name the folder "DO_NOT_SHARE" and put it in a separate dir than usual config
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> .config/ddnet-secrets/
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. I thought about storing a key used to encrypt the key in the registry, on windows
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought that'd make it harder for people to tell you to fetch it for you
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or maybe in windows' built in password manager
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that probs requires admin right?
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the registry?
13:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> user has their own registry
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> HKEY_CURRENT_USER
13:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what about linux
13:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe some keyring there
13:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i legit havent seen a game do pubkey auth yet
13:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is the password your main motivation for the key approach?
13:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that and that it can also work for other networks without us
13:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the offline capabilities, i.e. that you can have retroactive auth
13:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when the auth server is down
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that also only partially works doesnt it
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. by having a previous list
13:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which part?
13:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does teamspeak3 work?
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean if u use the pubkey hash as account id, u probably want it to be changable?
13:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd have multiple public key hashes that can be associated with a single ddnet account
13:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd have multiple public keys that can be associated with a single ddnet account
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if u do a full recover
13:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the public keys can be verified even if the auth server is down
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean he lost his account
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and afterwards, the linked ddnet account can be fetched
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now he gets his email
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> creates a new key pair
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is all done by the ddnet account mapper
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or whatever u call it
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so its only partially doable offline
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so 99% of the time it has to be online anyway xD
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't think so
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> say you deleted your keys
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> auth server is down
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you generate new keys
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you play on a server (it notes your public key)
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> later, when the auth server is up again, you associate your public key with your account
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the server can then later associate your run with your account
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the auth server outage wasn't bad in this case
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah but then u could also say there is simply a fallback id for every client
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> similar to timeout code
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the advantage of the public key is that it cannot be copied by the server you connect to
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and not MITMed
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> etc
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> auth tokens don't have that advantage, with them, you even have to verify the server as genuine, I think
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you could do some zero-knowledge proof or so on them, but that sounds more complicated than doing public key auth
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but even then, if the auth key would be done for 2 days the runs might be lost again
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u changed your keys twice
13:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
13:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you change your keys before you authenticate, stuff might get lost
13:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I wouldn't show the not-linked-to-an-account state as "authenticated" to the user
13:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I wouldn't show the not-linked-to-an-account state as "logged in" to the user
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok and about all the edge cases, did you think about account creation spamming and similar stuff.. are emails a must have with verification. ip bound account creation?
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> can the challenge be computationally hard for the client?
13:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not in a way that stops our current day-to-day spammer
13:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but we could more easily introduce some "initial chat delay" that doesn't hurt users who already have a positive reputation
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also if its an offline list u probs dont want it to be a few GBs?
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dead accounts etc
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and ofc spammed accounts
13:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I would keep around accounts forever for now
13:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the good thing about accounts is easier heuristics to battle bad actors
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a little bit of social score kek
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dota 2 has that
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but knowing how hobbyless the script kiddies in this community are
13:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think we can afford to save tens of bytes per email address or discord account or steam account that users create
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when u reach a low score u cant chat
13:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like in dota
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean yeah
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i said dota
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> haha
13:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure but every game server that fetches from ddnet has to keep in sync
13:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> didn't see that
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he means dota 1
13:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the game servers could potentially forget it after a while
13:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I meant dota 2 ^^
13:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> dota 1 was more brutal
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never played it
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wasnt even born
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u were
13:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "what's the price of boots of speed?"
13:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 3.
13:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 2.
13:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 1.
13:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> kicked ryozuki
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bad ryozuki
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 450
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
13:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> too late, already kicked you ^^
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> actually dota 2 trivia asks stuff like this
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in the client
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw we need a janitor like in dota 2
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> our dev mascot
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Shitty_Wizard
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this would be robyt lately
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah that the connection is directly secure between server client and even client client is nice
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So i assume for the later, the client needs to fetch this information too. and somehow the server's information cannot be trusted for this either (they pubkey hash of the client that the server might send as server info or smth similar)
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Already thought about such things?
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i already thought about such concepts for ddnet playground
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but only in theory
13:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how the server can prove to the masterserver that a specific client is online?
13:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't thought about that yet
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> because if we have accounts we basically want friend lists anyway
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and friendlist kinda must be secure too
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is there a way to exchange pub keys between users in a server
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my objective would be private encrypted chat between 2 users
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for whispers
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can make a community server
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as trusted authority
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also we would need to add some handling for encrypted data right
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah u need some kind of authority
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it would be nice to have it transparently on the game side, but the engine handles it
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do ya mean?
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just encrypt everything
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and decrypt in network
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean that the engine encrypts and decrypts packets transparently
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before its a game msg
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think we should encrypt everything
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur position etc is not needed
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> quic does that
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we kinda need to encrypt anything
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and its prob overhead no?
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, I'm working on quic
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nvm then
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which encrypts everything
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is definitly a compatiblity break right?
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who finishes first, heinrich with account system or me with ddnet playground?
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> place your bet now
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what r u doign on the playground
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vulkan stuff?
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everything
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i break what cant be broken
13:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, I don't like compat breaks ^^
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im not doing anything, im a lazy bastard
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so u would support plain old udp too?
13:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> doesnt quic allows better ddos protection
13:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
13:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not opposed to stuff like "drop old-style connections when server is DoSed"
13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it's beneficial
13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I'm not sure if quic is good for ddos protection
13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd enable us to use steam relays without trusting them though
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw the funny thing is, i also implemented a quic backend
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i use quinn for it
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> heinrich uses the other
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very competitive
13:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is it easy to implement?
13:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the auth took the longest time, I think ^^
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well generally yes, but i dont have any real key exchange mechanism yet, since im not connected to a master server or smth
13:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> currently I'm refactoring and adding backcompat
13:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> poggers
13:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also missing is: test on systems other than mine
14:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks btw are u working irl?
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i am employeed?
14:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i ignore that time
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i feel like lately i waste too much brainpower on my job to do anything xd
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and act as if i simply have less time now
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep thats hard
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but somehow over the last 2 months i leanred to do both
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
14:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is it in rust ?
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
14:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pff ddnet pg is also in rust
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100% except the annoying deps that need c libs
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> compiler*
14:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/11yxx7g/gigachad_ken_thomson/

14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u r already far. did you use cxx for the packet compability then?
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, I want to use the rust impl that I have lying around
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah ok thats the libtw2 advantages probs
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> although I'm a bit anxious about bugs in there
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it hasn't been tested in a widespread manner
14:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Why would he refuse? It'd be a good time to  flex on the zoomers
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is 80y old
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> boomer flexing on da zoomers
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im surprised he can work
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wanted to only refactors graphics first, but mixing rust idea of variants over enum structs and our way of putting stuff in a fat buffer and giving it IDs looked like a huge mess
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i spent way too much time for this
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u thin its possible to forget details about ur own language
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> think
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean he is old
14:12 < bridge> <Learath2> I have this feeling that we'll end up with an account system that users don't understand at all, with features that are only appealing to the technically inclined, that has no use in moderation since we don't want to make it even a tad bit annoying to create accounts, has no use in detecting fakes because names are not singular, has no use in getting an accurate point count for people since we refuse to reset the ladder
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah thats my fear
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well we'll make the account system look like a normal one
14:13 < bridge> <Learath2> details, probably
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it all happens under the hood
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we don't want to expose any of that key mumbo jumbo to users
14:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> c is full of subtle details
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should just look like "log in"
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and "log out"
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like the users are used to
14:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> brb
14:14 < bridge> <Learath2> A log in button which requires no credentials, a log out button that abstracts away an interesting key cycling scheme, and a way to associate a key which is supposed to be completely abstracted from you to an email
14:15 < bridge> <Learath2> It's honestly bizarre to say the least
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a log in button that logs you into your email address without a password
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's maybe a bit alien for the user
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I wouldn't describe it as "users don't understand it at all"
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they can also click "log in with steam", which doesn't even need any kind of interaction
14:17 < bridge> <Learath2> Even if it doesn't feel alien I feel it doesn't address much of any problem we have
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it allows us to attach reputation to players
14:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Which they can shed by just clicking log out
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> allowing us to temporarily exclude new accounts from writing stuff when somebody is being funny spamming the servers
14:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Since we don't want to make it any more annoying to play without an account, we can't do much with reputation except maybe giving them an initial chat cooldown
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well we will see
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u so far anyway it doesnt matter anymore
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it generally feels more complex
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the edge cases sound more scarry
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yes from secure connection point of view its the cooler approach
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I really don't want to have annoying account creation, because I love the way I can let new players just play the game
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but even that can be slapped on top of the public/private key idea
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basically make the association with an email address annoying
14:22 < bridge> <Learath2> Also what do you have planned for names?
14:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> discord-style
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sha256 hashes xdd
14:23 < bridge> <Learath2> How does that work for people that want to play without an account?
14:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they don't get an account name
14:23 < bridge> <Learath2> So we still get an account name AND an ingame name?
14:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't thought about this a lot
14:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but currently I'd say yes
14:26 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Perhaps accounts are mandatory.
14:26 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> e.g. Old username is: Aoe
14:26 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> New account name is: Aoe#1234
14:26 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> 
14:26 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> If the main part of your new account name matches an old username, then you can opt-in to include those points with this account (but they're marked as "unverified")?
14:27 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Perhaps accounts are mandatory.
14:27 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> e.g. Old username is: Aoe
14:27 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> New account name is: Aoe#1234
14:27 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> 
14:27 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> You can opt-in to include the points of your former username with this account (but they're marked as "unverified")?
14:28 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Donators get to customise their #1234 number :trollet:
14:28 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1234
14:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I think it'd be in our best interest to get rid of ingame names. It'd be extremely confusing to figure out if `Aoe#1256` with ingame name `Aoe#1265` who is claiming to be the `Aoe#1652` with the ingame name `Aoe` you played with last night is the real Aoe which you are supposed to know from another registry has the account name `Aoe#1255`
14:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Even writing that sentence confused me and I'm sure our resident rat can make it much more annoying than my non troll brain can come up with :konsti:
14:29 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> $5/month to get blue tick :trollet:
14:31 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Will account names be on a first come first serve basis, then?
14:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Account names would be `Nameyouwant#random-4digit-discriminator`
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> observation: discord and steam allow you to change your nickname arbitrarily, even on a per-server basis
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm... why does it work for them?
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think your example is confusing, too
14:33 < bridge> <Learath2> But discord isn't a game, as soon as you click on my name here you'll get my real account name and discriminator
14:34 < bridge> <Learath2> It also has clearly visible account creation and server join dates
14:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since recently
14:35 < bridge> <Learath2> And the per-server rename is annoying enough that we disabled it in this server
14:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> true
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but pls
14:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Steam idk, maybe faking isn't an issue there since no leaderboard would display your ingame name?
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> keep display names
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i can never be annonym
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would be huge downer
14:35 < bridge> <Learath2> If you want to be anonymous I think you should be forced to log out
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bad design
14:37 < bridge> <noby> it is difficult to determine whether something works without deciding what the goal is
14:37 < bridge> <Learath2> So you want the ability to hide your account name from everyone else, I guess that's only possible if ingame names also exist
14:37 < bridge> <Learath2> But that makes it extremely annoying to have a friend system of any kind
14:38 < bridge> <noby> its probably not possible to make a system that prevents faking, allows anonymity, tracks points, is convenient to use, etc. but picking only a few of these is possible (?)
14:39 < bridge> <Learath2> allows anonymity without logging out is where my brain goes logical contradiction
14:40 < bridge> <Learath2> I can't think of a way to have one set name while also allowing anonymity
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The game server simply doesn't expose the name
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The non display name
14:41 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Would someone still be able to report that player?
14:41 < bridge> <Learath2> It's easy to do technically, but then you don't have one set name, which means we can't have friends lists that guarantee that you are talking to the same person
14:41 < bridge> <noby> i assume reporting would be the same as it is now by using ingame name or other descriptions, and the admin could see the account name
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I mean either you're anonymous, or other people can find you in the server browser
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can't see how to do both
14:42 < bridge> <noby> maybe there could be an indicator for when someone is using their "real" name but no indicator otherwise?
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see how to do both
14:42 < bridge> <noby> that way it would allow for verification and anonymity
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Problem is pros need a anon button
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In this game nubs and pros play same server
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is cool
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But also sucks hard
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They ask u the whole day
14:43 < bridge> <noby> they could just use a different ingame name and lose the indicator but still the ranks would get logged t the same account? idk
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah
14:44 < bridge> <Learath2> The account name would also have to be not displayed
14:44 < bridge> <noby> right
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The game server should know but not expose
14:44 < bridge> <noby> i think thats how it works for bw server accounts
14:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Which creates an even more confusing situation. `Aoe` that is logged in to an account, but you are not allowed to see the name
14:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Is this really Aoe?
14:44 < bridge> <noby> the account could be associated with one "real" ingame name
14:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then I register an account with the real "noby" name
14:45 < bridge> <noby> so if its real Aoe's account and he is using name Aoe  it would show that
14:45 < bridge> <Patiga> isn't that 'anonymous' mode that we talk about quite close to the offline or 'invisible' mode in steam?
14:45 < bridge> <noby> :thonkery: mh
14:45 < bridge> <Learath2> Associating with one "real" ingame name is immediately back to the very start where konsti registers all the names
14:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Even if you are offline or invisible in steam most games will still report your steam id on the scoreboard where you can go to peoples profiles
14:46 < bridge> <Patiga> true
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true, they have a underlying real steam id behind
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think how this cant work here
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> see*
14:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe if we make it extremely clear who is logged in, display real discriminators in a very distinct way only when the scoreboard is open, then maybe it's easy enough to spot fakes and lets people be anonymous too
14:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> faking initially will be a issue because we start from a blank state, trust is then formed when you make ur friendlist network
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe a unique username is better
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Discord approach I'd say sucks
14:49 < bridge> <Learath2> You can't even make a friendlist if the server never reports the account name
14:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like most gamers do
14:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tell ur id via discord
14:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to ur friend
14:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to add you
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'll also be able to see who's real by their points
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It can. Opt out
14:49 < bridge> <Learath2> Can't have that either, if the server is hiding the account name you can't do anything with the account name
14:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean the name displayed is just vanity, i mean the account unique id
14:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that is jut numbers
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We need a way to disallow wildcard friend requests and we need anonymous gameplay
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't see where the problem is
14:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> steam calls it friend code xde
14:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well friend codes can be secret unless u share em
14:51 < bridge> <noby> ppl would be able to see their own account id though?
14:51 < bridge> <Learath2> The problem is that it's extremely confusing when there are two sets of names and 4 states a person can be in in which the names mean different things
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It works for CSGO players
14:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just add key signing kek
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can't be too hard
14:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i sign ur key and saying ur u
14:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gpg in tw
14:52 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Allow players to hide their account name (`Aoe#1234`) in-game.
14:52 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> While that option is enabled, they lose the ability to add friends and other features that need the account name etc.
14:52 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> But they can still finish maps that can count towards their points.
14:52 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> 
14:52 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> If someone has their account name hidden to impersonate someone, then you can just automatically assume that its an impersonator
14:52 < bridge> <Learath2> You are never anonymous in CSGO, right click on the scoreboard and I can have your unique steamid
14:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> are u new unlucks? or hiding behind anonimity
14:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never seen u before
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CSGO has no servers that are public as tw tho
14:53 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Newly active in the discord
14:53 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Newly active in the discord, but been playing on/off since 2012
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And spectators chat is off
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So ifu follow a pro u cannot chat with him
14:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, this is about what I'm thinking if this is a hard requirement, but we need extremely clear UI/UX to make it obvious who is in what state
14:54 < bridge> <noby> that option would also probably have to disable showing ranks for that player in scoreboard + allowing people to /points them
14:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, when you are in that mode you'll appear as if you have no ranks
14:55 < bridge> <Learath2> The server will treat you as if you are not logged in for all intents and purposes except mods who can see everyones account names
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It would already be great but being searched over the server browser
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Not
14:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> how so, there's a srv browser
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Community servers
14:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Pros mostly just play ranked on valve servers anyway
14:56 < bridge> <Learath2> (you can't guarantee to be matched with them by using their steamid)
14:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they play on faceit
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Surfers might rename for the same reason.. but u usually play solo in surf anyway
14:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Whatever, either way, you can't force an encounter with them where you can type at them
14:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, it is sort of doable now that I think more about it but it'll need some UI/UX thinking, maybe finally time to make the scoreboard clickable or atleast hoverable
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, as we see they is still so much discussion
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we have a complex account system + complex requirements
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats gonna be fun
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with our 2 and a half devs around here
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:00 < bridge> <Learath2> I really should have bolted on a central account system back in 2015
15:02 < bridge> <Learath2> Another question would be whether we even expose the account names in the serverinfo. I think we should otherwise we'd need a very complex solution for friends lists where they'd have to be serverside and require actual friend requests and stuff
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we need a complex solution for friend list anyway
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably a community server
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u cannot trust a game server ever
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "community server"?
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it could lie around
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what would it do?
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a server that u tell, "hi i am on this server"
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "hi i want to add this friend"
15:06 < bridge> <Learath2> This can be solved by including a signed snippet from the person on the server but it's annoying to set up indeed
15:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> who would have said, security is complex
15:06 < bridge> <Learath2> it's not that complex when you follow a well known recipe 😄
15:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
15:07 < bridge> <Learath2> What we are doing here is probably one of a kind
15:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> teamspeak3? ^^
15:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we would also need atleast some sensible plan for security issues
15:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or what to do in case x happens
15:07 < bridge> <Learath2> iirc doesn't bother with friends or if it does I think just lets p2p exchange of the keys to handle it
15:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Also has no central authority with names and emails
15:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what about activity pub
15:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> isnt it a proven decentralized protocol at this point
15:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mastodon uses it
15:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://activitypub.rocks/
15:09 < bridge> <Learath2> there is a reason a total of 10 people use mastodon 😛
15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it bothers with friends, but yea, p2p and no identities from the point where you remove your client data
15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mastodon doens't have strong auth AFAIK
15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it just trusts the server
15:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, I'm fairly certain what we are trying to accomplish here is pretty unique and that comes with many challenges that require a lot of thinking time
15:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, it is pretty unique
15:10 < bridge> <Learath2> You can solve most of these problems with just biting the bullet and having a central auth server that contains all the friends lists and lets people do friend requests over it and stuff
15:11 < bridge> <Learath2> but is that really the best solution? I don't think so
15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> central auth is certainly the fast easy way
15:11 < bridge> <Learath2> Do we do an n-way group key exchange when people join the server, I don't like that either, that's extremely heavy
15:12 < bridge> <Learath2> key exchange as in literally exchanging keys btw, not the cryptographic sense
15:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how does whatsapp handle encrypted group chats
15:12 < bridge> <Learath2> they do a literal n-way key exchange
15:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
15:12 < bridge> <Learath2> establishing a common secret
15:12 < bridge> <Learath2> https://z-p3-scontent.ftrn2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/328495424_498532869106467_756303412205949548_n.pdf?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=U4DvVcBy2c0AX8ENoR2&_nc_ht=z-p3-scontent.ftrn2-1.fna&oh=00_AfCkkiuVL45cuKww37X3Csdr_XZgjYGz0CdMAyhXMaDaZA&oe=64218EFC
15:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if we have some source of timestamping, the clients could sign the the server's public key + a timestampg
15:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if we have some source of timestamping, the clients could sign the the server's public key + a timestamp
15:13 < bridge> <Learath2> There is some magic sauce in there to allow key recovery with proof of phone# ownership and some key rotation magic to allow people to join late and stuff
15:13 < bridge> <Learath2> and the server then broadcasts that?
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye, ah, it's still n²
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but wait, telling the names of the other players is also n²
15:14 < bridge> <Learath2> Also more magic to keep rotating the key so one leak doesn't allow all past messages to be decrypted
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think they use the signal protocol, pretty much
15:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in whatsapp
15:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how did we get to encrypted chat btw?
15:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that also on the wishlist?
15:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's okay for the server to be able to read the chat
15:15 < bridge> <Learath2> I think ryozuki wanted it but I think that's a little beyond our scope
15:16 < bridge> <Learath2> e2e encrypted whispers are just too much, maybe just take your private convos off teeworlds if they are that sensitive, or use OTR over whisper 😛
15:16 < bridge> <Learath2> Wait why is it O(n^2)?
15:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because you have to send (n-1) keys to n people
15:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, don't you just have to sign something and send it back to the server?
15:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mentioned it, its something i always wanted if accoutns happened
15:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i guess definitly not a priority
15:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Do you want to have the clients know other peoples pubkeys btw? I never asked that one
15:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want my client to verify someone is the same person i added beforehand, not relying on the server if we go the decentralized way
15:20 < bridge> <Learath2> I was thinking the user can sign a rotating token, which the server can put in the serverinfo and the master can verify that the token was indeed signed by the pubkey associated to the `account#discriminator` the gameserver is claiming is on the server
15:20 < bridge> <kio> Someone know how to include a new directory with inside other dir and files .h and .CPP? Because I have an error and I think that is because I didn't wrote nothing inside CMakeLists.txt
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, I think this isn't something that is in the plan atleast for now. But I can see how that would be very very desirable
15:21 < bridge> <kio> Someone know how to include a new directory with inside other dir and files .h and .CPP in the project? Because I have an error and I think that is because I didn't wrote nothing inside CMakeLists.txt
15:21 < bridge> <kio> Looking at the MAC address of the player or ip or what
15:22 < bridge> <Learath2> But it's also very heavy, each client would have to verify each other client
15:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Actually I don't think it's even an option to keep peoples ips safe and not rely on the server at all :/
15:26 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't even know how to properly handle people leaving the server, if we have clients sign a piece of data to prove they are who they are, how would we stop the server from using that after the client leaves?
15:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> verify on request? xD
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> eeeh, I guess but then we have the janky unfamiliar UX that I was initially scared of
15:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> they don't get the mac address through the internet protocol
15:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> they would have to add code to check for your mac
15:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> and deens point was that you can feed fake information to that server
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Like do you know anyone who actually makes sure whatsapp is e2e by using the provided keys and checking with their friends irl?
15:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😅
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the thing is, you could ask the other player to solve a challenge thourgh the server, but the following can happen:
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> - the challenge is solved and u know he is real
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> - the challenge is solved, but the server turns it into garbage and you cant know he is real
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> - the chalenge is not solved, you cant know he is real
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my point is, if they solve it you know its them, but if they dont solve it, you dont know its not them, you just havent been able to confirm its them
15:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > - the challenge is solved, but the server turns it into garbage and you cant know he is real
15:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the server can't really turn it into garbage
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he can
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> by not sending u ever a valid response
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean, even you don't tbf, I changed phones 3 times since I added you on whatsapp, and I used the whatsapp web beta which kept changing your key when you logged in, I think you asked me only once if it was really me and  we didn't even compare keys then 😄
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my point is, the server can decide to not let u verify another player
15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> trie
15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can't really do anything about that. the server is the connection between you
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> I think verify on request is a no go, if the server is advertising an account name is on the server it should be verified already, how we can do that idk
15:32 < bridge> <Learath2> If we get a signed piece of data from the client to prove it really is them, how do we expire that piece of data
15:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a signed timestamp?
15:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with expiry
15:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I guess it could be acceptable, it'd let servers fake people for at most x minutes after their departure
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or maybe
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we can hook it somehow to the disconnect packet
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
15:34 < bridge> <Learath2> Since the server is the conduit it can just refuse to tell other clients and the masterserver about our departure :/
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
15:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, I think youses initial idea with the timestamps is about the best we can get
15:35 < bridge> <Learath2> without involving a central arbiter that is
15:39 < bridge> <Learath2> anyway enough accounts brainstorming, I'll go back to learning statistics
15:39 < bridge> <Learath2> What on earth is a super reaction???
15:39 < bridge> <kio> better
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> more animation
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you only get 5 per week
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and you're special!
15:40 < bridge> <kio> same idea
15:40 < bridge> <ReiTW> did any of you see the 5.2 update of UE ?
15:40 < bridge> <ReiTW> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj60HHy-Kqk
15:40 < bridge> <ReiTW> amazing af
15:40 < bridge> <Learath2> Seems you can only do it on some servers too
15:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Okok enough distraction, mean square value awaits me
15:49 < bridge> <kio> teeworlds 3d incoming
15:49 < bridge> <kio> full raycast
15:49 < bridge> <kio> 15k
16:44 < bridge> <kio> @Learath2 can i write to u in private 4s?
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for ass
16:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Eh if it’s development related and not private just ask here so everyone can also know
16:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> send nudes
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nais
16:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look his discord bio
16:47 < bridge> <Learath2> LOL
16:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Why do we get such colorful individuals all the time? 😦
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think for how big we are its low
16:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @kio please change your discord bio so I don't have to kick you
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and get a better hobby of all one quadtriollion possible hobbies
16:54 < bridge> <Iza> When ddnet on unreal engine
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when unreal engine on ddnet
16:55 < bridge> <kio> Mlml
16:55 < bridge> <Voxel> ASS?
16:56 < bridge> <kio> I don't want desturb all
16:56 < bridge> <kio> My bio is history, my bio is life, my bio is love, my bio is in Italian
16:57 < bridge> <Voxel> do you even know who you were talking to
17:00 < bridge> <kio> as hobbies what do you mean?  I plan as a hobby, I go to the gym, I do pen spinning, I play the piano, I do Rubik's cubes and calisthenics competitions, I do tricks with the Butterfly knife and that's it I think
17:01 < bridge> <kio> as hobbies what do you mean?  I code as a hobby, I go to the gym, I do pen spinning, I play the piano, I do Rubik's cubes and calisthenics competitions, I do tricks with the Butterfly knife and that's it I think
17:01 < bridge> <kio> 😭
17:02 < bridge> <Iza> And what has all this to do with developing
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you have enough to fill ur bio
17:03 < bridge> <Iza> You were provided an ultimatum, no need for something else
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instead you join the endless spire of useless unbreakable hate
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all intelligence, all the skill obtained and this is your answer. the best you could force your brain to think of
17:07 < bridge> <kio> Nobody want to read that
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i liked that more
17:09 < bridge> <kio> I like u more 😳😏
17:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks for changing the discord bio. make sure it doesn't appear again
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:11 < bridge> <kio> I changed it although I think it's my right to put what I want, however I wouldn't want to change it again so it won't reappear
17:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, you have the right to put in anything that conforms to discord TOS (which yours probably didn't). ddnet can also ban you if it doesn't like what's in your bio

18:10 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I like how his linked reddit user goes to an 18+ account
18:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> i think you forgot to close your tabs from yesterday evening
18:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> it doesn't do that for me
18:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> i just see a bunch of numbers and letters
18:20 < bridge> <murpi> > kio: I program for fun, if I had to make cheats inside the client I would do them for sport but it would only be a personal goal, **I would not use them and I would not spread them**, however my goal now is to make a decent client with nice graphics, so don't worry
18:20 < bridge> <murpi> Guess that was a lie. His linked Reddit profile showcases a tutorial on how to cheat using aimbot in TW :kek:
18:20 < bridge> <DefaultO> oh is he the guy who made that video?
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/sad-upset-violin-sponge-bob-mr-crab-gif-3530280
18:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> you could take it down in theory
18:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> the video I mean
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good luck
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> youtube totally cares
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just like the police cares xd
18:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> they do
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> i would do it myself. but I don't have a ddnet email
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeaaah
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> so in my case it would be abuse
18:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> and I never abused youtubes dmca claim option :troll:
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mail@ddnet.org
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> go ahead
18:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1088514357924733018/image.png
18:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> ah if you insist
18:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> on behalf of a ddnet contributor I go claim this video now
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and what was it? child porn?
18:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> to prevent further spread of hacking learning material
18:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> hacks
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> about?
18:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> games I played and did hacks myself in
18:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> basically cleaning other hackers
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you were stricked?
18:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> nah
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> games of high interest?
18:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> sometimes
18:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> it usually was 3 per channel
18:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> so I could get them terminated without them being able to react
18:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> because it indeed was some kind of abuse. and they can't do poop if their account was deleted.
18:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> if you give me permission his channel is gone.
18:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1088515606816501902/image.png
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont have access to it xd
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i only own a subdomain
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u could also kindly ask as a first step i guess
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the channel owner
18:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> who
18:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> why would I have to ask him
18:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> you can ask him if you want to get rid of a tutorial on how to hack this game
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs he is a human and understands human language
18:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> and I only know how to burn places down
18:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> @kio they don't want your videos to be up. private them or delete them or your channel is gone.
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very kind formulated
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would totally convince me
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i wouldnt feel pressured and put into a corner
18:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> if it doesn't convince them. their channel is gone.
18:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> i warned them beforehand
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> psychologically 11/10 i'd rate this
18:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> wasn't that what you wanted me to do
18:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> ask them to take it down
18:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> gotta have to steps in case he just unlists them
18:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> then you need the links to the videos or you don't see them
18:40 < bridge> <DefaultO> gotta have to do precautions in case he just unlists them
18:42 < bridge> <kio> Lol
18:42 < bridge> <kio> The big 13 followers channel
18:42 < bridge> <kio> I'm an influencer
18:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea
18:43 < bridge> <kio> I asked for post the video
18:43 < bridge> <kio> Nobody told me nothing
18:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> well you see
18:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> now they force me to take your videos down
18:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> you can private it for some time. then they forget about it. and make it public again in a few months.
18:45 < bridge> <kio> first I would like to know how would you like to cancel the account, just reporting?  then, I can make the video private, but I don't know how you think, the game is open source, what I did was the most basic cheating thing I could have done, there are myriads of videos related to this on other games, think that if someone wanted to reproduce what I did, they wouldn't be capable of it anyway?
18:46 < bridge> <kio> who forgets?  Do you have the mafia on your tail?
18:47 < bridge> <kio> however being a human person and understanding human language I will private the videos from my famous 13 subscriber channel before it goes viral and 6 people in total start playing this game
18:48 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Seems like offtopic, move to #off-topic for non-teeworlds conversations or #general for teeworlds related convs
18:50 < bridge> <kio> Good moderator
18:51 < bridge> <kio> the conversation is over, after I make the video private
18:51 < bridge> <kio> ..
18:51 < bridge> <kio> the conversation is over, after I make the video private
18:52 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Last warning or you get timed out for longer
19:01 < bridge> <судный день.> this game so p2w that nitro booster gets privilege
19:28 < bridge> <louis> dont be weird
19:29 < bridge> <louis> if anyone wants to find out how to do it they can anyways
19:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> everyone else would have to figure it out though
19:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> client is open source anyways
19:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting, I didn't know there was a way to get rid of yotube videos for cheating 😮
19:41 < bridge> <bencie> I'm pretty sure we got a yt short of a bot client removed within 30mins of the first report
19:42 < bridge> <bencie> By just a few people reporting it
19:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> I don't use the report method
19:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> I just DMCA claim the videos
19:45 < bridge> <louis> dont abuse dmca claim thats cringe
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> inb4 heinrich on a report spree
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wish llvm switched entirely over rust
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the C apis they expose are so barebones
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont get the niceties of the c++ api
19:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> releasing cheats is
19:56 < bridge> <louis> so?
20:09 < bridge> <kio> Ses
20:09 < bridge> <Voxel> among es
20:09 < bridge> <Voxel> ohbwair shit this is developer
20:10 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf people are STILL trying to upload bot client vids on yt?
20:26 < bridge> <kio> Wtf
20:32 < bridge> <kio> if you talk about me it was not a bot client and it was a personal goal to do so
20:32 < bridge> <kio> anyway it's my right to publish what I want, but ok end of the speech I've archived it, good life to all
20:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> Should we remove websockets support? Seems like they work with neither Linux (#2853) nor Windows (#5625).

22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> whih
22:43 < bridge> <Voxel> god ive been neglecting shadertoy since forever
22:46 < bridge> <Chairn> oO, that's not really new?
22:46 < bridge> <Chairn> i believe it is known since the 70's with Penrose work
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not the same
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> read
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://archive.is/iqBHP
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > The most famous aperiodic tiles were created by mathematician Roger Penrose, who in the 1970s discovered that two shapes could be combined to create an infinite, never-repeating tiling. Now, Chaim Goodman-Strauss at the University of Arkansas and his colleagues have found a single tile shape – which they have called “the hat” – that does the same job.
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a single shape
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/
22:49 < bridge> <Ravie> Chairn Goodman
22:50 < bridge> <Chairn> ok, Penrose is 2 shapes, this is single shape
22:50 < bridge> <Chairn> now i wonder how they found/designed it 😄
22:50 < bridge> <Chairn> (i know the article says computer, but that doesn't explain how)
23:05 < bridge> <louis> i recall myself drawing that same shape in kindergarten actuall
23:06 < bridge> <louis> i recall myself drawing that same shape in kindergarten actually
