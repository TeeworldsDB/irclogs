12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gg
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <N9mkOik> @Deeper +
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont really understand this web thing
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/www/_layouts
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shouldnt it be duplicated here?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Deeper thanks, fixed
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon it's from ddnet-scripts, which is just a manual mirror. we have an internal repo for this stuff :/
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I don't think we should publish that since it contains passwords and all maps and configs etc together
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> configs and maps are private?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just create a pass.secret file and ignore it
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> would be cool to have whole web public so all can participate c:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah that would be cool
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not that im saying i could help somehow i suck at web stuff but i mean for potential contributers c:
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would help but idk what to improve
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is one issue
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but imo the website is really good c:
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trip | Trimy Studio> VoiceStateUpdate(guild_id=null, channel_id=null, self_mute=true, self_deaf=false, self_video=false)
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any prediction guru here? There is this new adventure mod and it is unplayable with ddnet client because it somehow has jetpack predictions there on the gun ._. how is this possible
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they have a multiple world feature and the prediction for jetpack gets activated on swapping the world (downloading a new map and stufff)
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo! Does someone know how the ``^=`` operator is called in c or how it behaves? It is tricky to search te web for it because it consists only of special chars. And yes i tried putting it in " 
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I know that the ``^`` is a bit wise xor but i have the feeling that these two lines behave different:
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> int z = x ^ y;
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> x ^= y;
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> x ^= y would change x
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ya x ^= y is the same as x = x ^ y
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh so z should be x then ?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh thats actually true idk what went wrong in my testlab before when i got different results
