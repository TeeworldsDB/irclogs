00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> where are our biologists in this chat btw
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we have everything, we need those too
00:01 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
00:02 < bridge> <Ewan> brb going to medical school
00:06 < bridge> <Ewan> actually nah
00:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i think that only ends in disaster for me
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Since when is literally anything just 7% return :D
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You should see my portfolio haha thatâ€™s full of anything and not very 7%
00:38 < bridge> <learath2> VWCE has been returning about 7-6% historically, SXR8 9-10%, SPYI 13-14%. Sure past performance does not indicate future performance but getting to around 7% shouldn't be rocket surgery
00:49 < bridge> <learath2> This is not investment advice, I'm no investor
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> 7% yield for anything is a dream afaik
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> any reliable investment is going to be low yield
01:15 < bridge> <learath2> 7% before inflation is not too insane. When has the snp500 even had negative real returns? (Ignoring the entire financial sector falling apart in the very early 2000s). 7% is just 3%-4% over inflation
01:18 < bridge> <learath2> Just holding like 70% of your portfolio in SXR8/VWCE and the rest in bond etfs should gave 7-8% returns for the last decade. Or at least thats what my backtrading experiments showed

01:25 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
01:29 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta figure out how to do that
01:32 < bridge> <louis> just throw it in s&p 500 and come back to it in 30 years
06:14 < bridge> <totar> android build step that I copy pasted directly from the ddnet repo did a flake in this run for some reason.
06:14 < bridge> <totar> <https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet/actions/runs/13024882051>
06:14 < bridge> <totar> It seems really rare so maybe no one cares, hasn't happened in like 80 other runs it's done.
06:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> flake mentioned
07:02 < bridge> <Ewan> nix brain awakened
07:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
08:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning peeps
08:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> morning
08:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki I'm gonna yoink so much stuff from your compiler :santatrollet:
08:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: haha â€žrocket surgeryâ€œ
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> haha i love partial support for standards
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++20 gcc 10 doesnt support reverse_view
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> everyday im reminded why i dislike cpp
08:58 < bridge> <0xdeen> sup?
08:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> There is not enough info in the logs to figure out what failed
09:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> Maybe just a transient download failure
09:31 < bridge> <Solly> w/ lib asan + debug on multimap easy zoom=-15 i got 60fps (barely) but then the next time i join and wait 15s its 30... and wont go up
09:38 < bridge> <teero777> morning
11:24 < bridge> <0xdeen> maybe an artifact of asan? Do you see any difference when doing the same without asan?
11:25 < bridge> <Solly> without asan its always 60 (darned vsync)
11:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> if yes, then get a valgrind callgrind profile from the good fps and the bad fps cases
11:25 < bridge> <Solly> i cant get the good fps to happen again

12:47 < bridge> <learath2> Has to be satire or shitty ai
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> I was about to type there is no way anyone is this stupid, but then I remembered there are people this stupid
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> And then there are people that create fake content to trigger ppl like you
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> In the end you gotta assume everything in the internet is a lie xd

12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Now is the question, whom of these is more stupid
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜¬
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But yeah, just uninstall reddit and twitter and whatever
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Directly 200% better life
12:55 < bridge> <meloÆž> reddit is my only source of salt after dropping league of legends
13:00 < bridge> <learath2> Inb4 there is a hardware backdoor in the cpu that gets triggered by multiplying two specific matrices together
13:00 < bridge> <teero777> I put aluminum foil around my computer
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> They extract the data through the powerline :wechat_cool_guy:

19:02 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 1. Build a hammer hit part
19:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> This way you will test the player's skill on hammerhitting
19:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 2. Build a fly part
19:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 3. Build a hammer hit part

21:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> whoops, wrong repo :\ but the code is the same
22:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems good. Is the sound preview still updated to the next selected sound with that change if you delete a sound while there are 1/2/3+ sounds?
