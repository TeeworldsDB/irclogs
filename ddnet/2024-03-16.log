00:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> im hyped for next episode now
01:26 < bridge> <learath2> It was pretty good, ofc a little weaker than last weeks but the story telling is always on point
01:26 < bridge> <learath2> And evan call never really misses with the music either
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> only 2 more eps :(
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> :twintri:
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> btw rust is fun asf
01:27 < bridge> <learath2> I heard season 2 is somehow even better than season 1 btw
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> hyped
01:28 < bridge> <learath2> I really really really hope madhouse keeps making it. Watching frieren has made me notice how much I’ve missed proper animation
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> the animation quality is amazing
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> *compared to other anime of our time*
01:28 < bridge> <learath2> If they give it to some animation factory like mappa it’ll definitely be ruined
01:29 < bridge> <teero777> Ghibli frieren lets go xd
01:30 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, I fail to come up with many anime that come close to this quality. Wit studio is on a similar level with the first 3 seasons of attack on titan, and madhouse themselves with one punch man season 1
01:30 < bridge> <teero777> solo leveling is pretty good right now
01:30 < bridge> <learath2> Haven’t watched it yet, maybe after apothecary diaries
01:31 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, A-1 is making solo levelling. They also make good animation
01:31 < bridge> <teero777> havent watched the latest 2 eps of apothecary diaries yet. pls no spoiler!
01:32 < bridge> <learath2> I only watched the very first episode yet
01:32 < bridge> <teero777> ah wat xDDDD
01:32 < bridge> <learath2> Been busy being unemployed
01:33 < bridge> <teero777> i have a hard time imagining you being unemployed
01:36 < bridge> <teero777> the past 2 days ive been learning rust a little. seems very cool till now. at first glance all the crates seem kind of bloat but most of them are very simple and intuitive
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Been busy being unemployed
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
01:55 < bridge> <Ewan> he travels all the time
02:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ger10 only supports map loading via https, and if you use that, it should be no different from other servers
02:32 < bridge> <teero777> only 1 more ep :(
02:33 < bridge> <teero777> Oh
02:33 < bridge> <teero777> Didn't know
02:33 < bridge> <teero777> Lerato where are you right now?
02:33 < bridge> <teero777> Oh
02:33 < bridge> <teero777> didn't know
02:33 < bridge> <teero777> lerato where are you right now?
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> rn i think he's at the center of the earth
02:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo any ddnet admin up for a confidental conversation?
02:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Nothing criticial I am just curious about something and i can not ask it in public
10:06 < bridge> <learath2> I'm in Italy now, will be in Turkey in a week or so, then will be back to Italy sometime. Not doing any extra travel for a bit
12:59 < bridge> <cyberFighter> dont use same timeout code for both main and dummy
12:59 < bridge> <cyberFighter> easy fix
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: did some messages disappear from ur chat? :thonk:
13:23 < bamcane> Everyone, don't forget to change your database default user password unless you want to be like me(I didn't change my default postgresql user password and get hacked)
13:24 < bamcane> I even thought that my code's problem until I checked postgresql log
13:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/if-i-had-one-angry-yelling-fairly-odd-parents-mr-turner-gif-16322274
13:26 < bamcane> Ah, so don't forget to change it.
13:27 < bamcane> My mode database was been deleted twice so far
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> complain to your distribution or to postgresql that the default configuration is insecure
13:49 < bamcane> No
13:49 < bamcane> that's my problem
13:49 < bamcane> and
13:49 < bamcane> My server was been hacked so i need reinstall Ubuntu LTS
13:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why? software shouldn't be easily insecure
13:53 < bamcane> Ah
13:53 < bridge> <furo321> I don't think postgresql ships a default password.
13:53 < bamcane> No that's true
13:53 < bamcane> it's 'postgres' on ubuntu
13:54 < bamcane> Or maybe null
13:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/issues/created_by/heinrich5991
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea. why does ubuntu do that? that sounds like really bad practice
14:14 < bamcane> I think that's also my problem ++
14:14 < bamcane> I trust all of the IPV4 ips at first
14:15 < bamcane> SO
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why does the installation provide a default password if exposing it to the network allows anyone to use that?
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> good software does not do that
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it either comes with no default password, or it does not allow the default password  via the network
14:48 < nRx> ChillerDragon: hi
14:48 < nRx> I have a question
14:50 < bridge> <zhn> ChillerDragon:
18:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes some history reset when I did an non clean shutdown
18:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> @_nrx
18:21 < nRx> ChillerDragon: why don't u run 0.6/0.7 bridge for ctf5 public?
18:21 < nRx> are there some problems witht this or u just don't want to do it
18:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pretty much everything I do is public I am not sure what you mean @_nrx
18:42 < nRx> i mean ur vanilla ctf5 server is for 0.7 only iirc
18:42 < nRx> why not bridge 0.6/0.7 like gctf servers
18:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nRx a bridge is not vanilla only vanilla is vanilla
18:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i have the same server running in 0.6 and 0.7 the players just can't play together
18:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the servers are currently offline but they are planned to come back in a few days
18:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nRx if you want to play on both 0.6 and 0.7 servers you can use this https://chillerdragon.github.io/ddnet7-client/
18:52 < nRx> ok thx for answers
21:25 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i have a very annoying bug where if i get 2 clients the entire game freezes and this happens only if i have vulka on
