01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> is it better to count lines number when receiving motd from server?

01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it's fine as you do it, but more efficient to do it once when server sent it. Our UI does a lot of stuff in each frame, so this approach is ok there. Otherwise you'd have to add a variable in the class and be sure to always update the line count when server motd is updated.
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> shift+click+drag doesnt delete blocks in nightly editor
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis I'm a bit confused, what am I supposed to press?
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hold shift then click and drag over tiles
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> On old client I get crash ðŸ˜„
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah, i found on old client it was like a 10% russian roulette of crashing
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but on older versions i used it very frequently to quickly delete blocks
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not old client* but the current default build
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My bad, I broke that
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I was always confused cuz i thought my ninja drops look smaller, and today i compared them to a ninja pickup and noticed that i wasnt wrong and this indeed is smaller than a regular ninja and has no particles.
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This can be achieved by sending pickup type `POWERUP_WEAPON` and `WEAPON_NINJA` as subtype, instead of `POWERUP_NINJA` :D

18:25 <+ChillerDragon> if a app has broken bash completion where do i complain? to packman devs? packagers? bash developers? app developers? linus torvalds?
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> i dont really get the completion ecosystem
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> if the dev builds a completion does the packager has to search it on its own and make sure ints included in the package?
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> ok watever i just fix it my self and leave it broken for everyone else heueueue
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> each app can provide its own bash completion file
20:34 <+ChillerDragon> ye
20:34 <+ChillerDragon> but what if it did not end up being installed on my system who is responsible for that?
20:35 <+ChillerDragon> usually developers don't package their apps do they? its someone else
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is there an SVG for the emotes?
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> If not, I just made a pack. I don't know how accurate it is, but I'm testing it in game right now.
