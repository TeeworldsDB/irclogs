00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "why c++ will never die" /r/c_programming "Most people, especially *newbie* programmers always *yap* about how The legendary programming languages C and C++ will have a dead end. What are your thoughts about such a notion"
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> emphasis mine
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually send a link to a comment i liked
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sent*
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> flair "discussion"
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What you mean?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw it says "Why C and C++ will never die" not just c++
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `In a hundred years, everyone in the standards committee will die and be replaced by someone younger.`
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what interested me most xD
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if I want to have a discussion on go's merits, I'll go to /r/go and post "why go is the best language" containing "many programmers, especially grumpy ones, dislike go. what are your thoughts on such a notion?"
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or /r/golang or whatever it's called
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok, still doesn't mean its not interesting to read
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "meh"
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh everywhere!
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/8olqis/apple_is_deprecating_opencl/
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apple will deprecate opencl too
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :danAmazing:
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I dislike it when one goes into a discussion with such a flawed premise
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or biased
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i saw lot of comments that make sense
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some are in favour and others not
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if you dislike it then don't read it
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤·

00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They're deprecating OpenGL, too, and only supporting Metal. As a developer I already operate as if macOS essentially doesn't exist, but I'm still experiencing schadenfreude seeing Apple shoot themselves in the foot, making themselves even less relevant in the desktop/laptop space.``` haha

00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now you can't say that this discussion in C is biased
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as it isnt bound to a OS
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> c best language
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no u
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `onby` best lang
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i write all my server mods in c
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :thonkery:
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby you mean c++
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> c but put into c++ classes to work with tw
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [12:54 AM] Ryozuki: now you can't say that this discussion in C is biased
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [12:54 AM] Ryozuki: as it isnt bound to a OS
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was some kind of joke
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forget it
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I doubt it's going to affect apple negatively
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people are probably going to write compatibility layers
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I saw one on reddit today already
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How does such a compatibility layer work? Should we add Metal support in the Client now?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if someone produces an opengl compatibility layer for opengl3, we could theoretically just bundle it on mac and it just worksâ„¢
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in practice, something will not work, and we'll need to adapt the code a little
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k sound ok
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-246
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the fff posts are always a great read IMO ðŸ™‚
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what you prefer?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok cancel or cancel ok
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer last
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dunno, I don't really care I think
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> worked with both
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ym bother reads that factorio shit all the time. doesnt even play the game anymore.  what is it
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like gimp's (and a couple of others) "do you really want to exit and lose changes" dialog because it includes the time since the last save
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "do you really want to quit and lose the changes of the last 30s?"
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> make an antiping that simulates random pings
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> becuase i cant play with pings that aren't 68
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo heinrich bro
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what was the cmd to fetch pulls?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git fetch ddnet_upstream pull/1058/head`
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty
15:43 <+Gabee> heinrich5991: we could also make it using electron
21:28 <+jxsl13> hey, heinrich5991, would you mind writing a documentation for teehistorian file format :O?
21:32 <+jxsl13> or anyone xD
