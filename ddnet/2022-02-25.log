10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> does anyone know why the hook collision rendering takes the direction from input data when it's a local player? This makes the collision line update only once per tick and it's not that smooth. It seems to work totally fine without it but idk if there's some case I'm missing.

11:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti\: yo pink rat! You like to map with gametiles first right? in case you are not scared to run some python maybe my new tool is worth checking out \:)https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-reverse-gametiles
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Ur so based! Best feature! I got a finished map without a single design tile placed yet xD
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Poggers that will save you some time!
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I hope you use automapper rules otherwise you donâ€™t gain much .\_.
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> u mean writing own rules?
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Well i mean my script only places one index of the layer so it wont have actual design yet. If you have an automapper for the tiles you want to use as design you are only one click away from a finished design. If not you kinda still have to do the whole design by hand

13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> my script can take this and give you that

13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But to get this\:
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you need an automapper

13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> FYI, it's already possible to do all this within the editor, you just need some very simple automapper rules.
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> FYI, it's already possible to do all of this within the editor, you just need some very simple automapper rules.
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> Oh cool! Did not know you can do automappers based on gametiles. Do you mind sharing a minimal example?
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> ChillerDragon https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=6450
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> you need a trick to copy game layers into design layers
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ÐœÐ°Ñ‚Ð²ÐµÐ¹11113> :banhammer:
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I only use tiles that have automapper rules :troll:
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> So its great
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And otherwise its pretty easy to write own rules tbh
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks do u know why amd/nvidia provide specific drive updates when a new game such as elden ring releases?
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it seems backwards to me xd
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> probably because they worked together with the game engine devs to improve performance and fix bugs
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they should work together with us for opengl issues :monkalaugh:
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> People buy new GPUs to play AAA games like Elden Ring, but probably not for DDNet ðŸ˜„
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep thats me haha
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so this would be counterproductive for GPU manufacturers
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They should release driver sources so we can do our own debugging
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why r drivers propietary
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do they do some secret optimization techniques?
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Trade secret
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> because they contain some information about the hardware that competitors might like to know, I guess
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and why make them open source, for most companies that's just extra effort for no benefit
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It also probably contains the tricks they used to make the games they worked with work better on their gpus
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not really effort. The actual reason they don't is sweet sweet cash
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What effort is just including a source tarball with their driver releases?
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> they have to talk to legal if they can publish it, or if it contains any code that can't be open source
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> they have to check with patent department if everything in it has been patented already before releasing the code
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and probably have to polish it and make it work with standard build tools, if they have some internal tools for building no one else has access to
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see why a gpu driver would contain code that cant be open source from a legal sense, do they even contribute with third parties on those?
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know, maybe they bought some other company and are still using some code in there that they bough and can't publish
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tbf, still doesn't sound very high effort by any means. I still maintain the issue is that there literally is negative reward for publishing the source
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and they might be afraid that people can find bugs and vulnerabilities easier using source code
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Isn't that usually the one benefit of open source?
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> benefit from user pov yes
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not saying it's right for them to be afraid, but they might be
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> too much speculation ðŸ˜„
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm. Why wouldnt the comoany be interested in knowing the vulnerabilities?
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> effort to fix them ðŸ˜„
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess there is no profit in fixing security issues on a gpu
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> bad publicity
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> amd has open source linux drivers nowadays, right? But I think they just communicate with some closed source firmware, so maybe the interesting stuff is in there
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They made a nice compromise. It makes debugging stuff much more pleasant
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They still have a binary blob, but iirc that part gets directly uploaded to the gpu, not much laydevelopers can touch there anyway :D
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet they put small tweaks into the drivers. e.g. if some feature isnt used (but required by spec) it can be disabled for a few fps more or stuff like that
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i guess a lot is also just marketing xD
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> NEW DRIVER FOR ELDEN RING
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> EPIC
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the day 0 drivers do improve alot, like cyberpunk ran like shit before I updated
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is that then not really needed under linux
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all games just work(the games that do actually work)
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet they add some game specific stuff there, maybe the shader compiler gets improved specifically for it?
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well idk you are the graphics magician
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean i could imagine they squeeze out a few FPS, but i really think most is just marketing
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but sure, if there is a new feature not heavily tested, and cyberpunk uses it, then it might improve by a lot
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can tell you that I got 40 fps from cyberpunk and without changing settings after the driver update I got about 60
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe some magic caching
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah not impossible, tho with vk and dx12 the game devs are also in more responsibility, so i guess there really needs to be some serious bottleneck
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if somebody could benchmark these games and say exactly what caused it, i could maybe imagine it better
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe just a signature check that enables games to use the full gpu to generate hype :D
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well at least it serves one purpose, ppl keep their drivers up to date
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like those power saving tests where manufacturers try to recognize the testing conditions so they can cheat
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah true
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in the end its all about being 1fps better or more efficient than everyone else
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even if that doesnt work for any other game xD
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadams> .
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think driver update for game is mainly game profile data being used rather than code change
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i.e. data prefetching, cache utilization and stuff like that
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> so the driver just know how the game behave and can adapt its behavior in regard to the game being played
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well if that can a GPU bound game from 40FPS to 60FPS gg
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's a nice boost in terms of %
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well if that can boost a GPU bound game from 40FPS to 60FPS gg
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's a nice boost in terms of %
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though let's not forget cyberpunk was a huge failure at it's launch, it is entirely possible that it was just that badly optimized ðŸ˜„
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> How I can install mysql lib for server? ðŸ˜…
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What OS are you using?
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Windows
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, no idea, I don't even know if we support mysql on windows, sorry
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do we? ^
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i think it was always broken
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> in subtle ways
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30467572
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an actual good tutorial
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u can use it to finally learn rust
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^the drea
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> m
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht> this is how I learned rust
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have heard that they fix bugs in the game code on the graphics driver side so the game runs better
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even e.g. replacing specific shaders if they're written in a suboptimal way
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now if only I could remember the source of that statement
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i keep most interesting stuff i find in <https://obsidian.md/>
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > bsidian is a powerful knowledge base on top of
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > a local folder of plain text Markdown files.
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds like an interesting approach, they do work together on these, I wonder why they don't just give the more optimal shader to the devs

20:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Would be cool to be able to spectate a server even when it's full
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that may actually be a good feature
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could make a mirror server
