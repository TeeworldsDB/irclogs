00:00 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> In current no, but it easy to make
00:06 < bridge> <Souly> oh god i remember the last time we had emojis
00:07 < bridge> <Voxel> what are you planning for emote graphics
00:07 < bridge> <Voxel> are they going to be :boo: :fury: :hey: :mmm: or smth else
00:19 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Idk, maybe emojis from discord servers and usefull standard discord emojis, also maybe desginers will add something
00:29 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Faking official servers is also bannable
00:34 < bridge> <El Yek> Or faking players
00:35 < bridge> <Devinci> Yeah I read the rules sent by Vy0x2 ^^
00:49 < bridge> <Teero> I need `ðŸ’€`
01:59 < bridge> <Ewan> there are emojis in the font already
02:49 < bridge> <Manga> vai todo mundo tomar no cu
03:14 < bridge> <Manga> os adm do easymap do brazil sÃ£o um bando de filha da putaaaaa
03:18 < bridge> <Iza> don't insult
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice number

10:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> someone forgot to exclude packages?
10:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> or is that like a commit of 50+ pull requests
10:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> or is that like a commit of 50+ merged pull requests
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is the total number of commits in ddnet repo
10:48 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> What do you recommend I do for getting info about a map?
10:48 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> i.e. I want to get the median time of all the ddnet maps (~2200) so I can sort them based on expected length.
10:48 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> 
10:48 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> I could use `https://ddnet.org/maps/?json=MAP_NAME` but I don't want to spam that endpoint 2200 times. (I could put a 1sec delay between each request but that might still be excessive). This is just a once-off request, and for any new maps I can just use that api.
10:48 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> 
10:49 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Thoughts?

10:49 < bridge> <k2d222> 2200 with delay is not that much
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can also download the whole ddnet database, but maybe these 2200 requests are still less. also depends how long u want to cache it
10:53 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> I will likely cache it forever, since those median times won't change much, especially for old maps
10:54 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Can't you like just make a query 
10:54 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://ddstats.org/ddnet-69b4e14:monkalaugh:
10:54 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Oh yeah, forgot about that datasette
10:57 < bridge> <deen> one request per second sounds fine to me
11:01 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Cool thanks, I'll go with that. I was looking up how to get median in SQL (need to order the data and then offset it to get the middle item in the results...), I'll just stick with the requests :monkalaugh:
11:03 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> :(

11:04 < bridge> <deen> This is how we do it: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/maps.py#L425
11:04 < bridge> <deen> mariadb/mysql
11:06 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Does datasette use that same sql i.e. mariadb/mysql?
11:06 < bridge> <deen> no
11:07 < bridge> <deen> for datasette it seems annoying, except if Ryozuki installs https://github.com/simonw/datasette-statistics
11:07 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Ah ok. I'll go the requests route, thanks!
13:43 < bridge> <cauldron> Cool, what do you do rhat for? Finish them in that order then?
13:43 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> So that I can decide what map to play based on how much time I have :)
13:50 < bridge> <cauldron> Nice
13:56 < bridge> <cauldron> maybe add as well success rate... but i guess that's not possible, since nothing gets saved when a player kills half way through the map
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses sqlite
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> installed
14:03 < bridge> <cauldron> what is actually saved about a map? i remember someone posting the playtime of multeasymap. and also how long a specific player spend on multeasy. but playtime is only the sum of the racetimes? or is it saved when a player just spends 10 minutes on a map and then kills? then you could do playtime_of_map/racetime_of_map
14:03 < bridge> <cauldron> racetimes = when player finishes race
14:18 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> I just rank the maps by least difficulty (no. stars/points) and then by most finishes. It works okay at having the easier maps near the top
14:50 < bridge> <k2d222> are there a vector versions of gui assets? in particular im lookin for `gui_cursor.png`?
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/issues/46
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> seems like voxel is working on them
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so not yet
14:56 < bridge> <k2d222> cool! @Voxel , Ill be interested to get pinged when its done ðŸ˜‰
15:41 < wildchancho> 123
15:41 < wildchancho> booba
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> o/
15:44 < wildchancho> hi
15:44 < wildchancho> whats this
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> @k2d222 write a comment below the issue u get a email from github when its closed
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> wildchancho this is club penguin chat room
15:46 < wildchancho> (0-o)
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> eh i mean u can even enable notifications for a issue w out comment @k2d222
15:46 < bridge> <k2d222> thats what i did thx
15:47  * wildchancho slaps wildchancho around a bit with a large fishbot
15:47  * ChillerDragon xd
16:21 < bridge> <Voxel> i wish gui_cursor wasnt so misaligned
16:22 < bridge> <Chairn> don't over align things
16:22 < bridge> <Chairn> dissymetry is what makes things beautiful
16:23 < bridge> <Voxel> fiiine. i'll keep the outline 2.5 pixels thick
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nah just fix this shit xd
16:27 < bridge> <Voxel> thats what i was gonna do
22:10 < bridge> <gerdoe> is there any need to use alloc.h macros? it can be replaced with some wrapper class instead
22:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Not as cleanly. alloc.h letâ€™s us have those classes pool allocated completely transparently
