00:30 < bridge> <davide55> Sadly yes, older clients can't recognize the new reconnect packet
00:35 < bridge> <davide55> I may try to send both redirect & reconnect, but it will be a little bit hard, I'll try in the next days!
00:42 < bridge> <totar> @davide55 just to confrim the only website does literally nothing now right?
00:42 < bridge> <davide55> Correct
00:42 < bridge> <totar> ok

01:44 < bridge> <totar> hmm thats a lot of diff
01:44 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
01:59 < bridge> <totar> why does the text in the screenshots look blurry? was it always like that?

02:02 < bridge> <Solly> could turn off that if not in game

02:09 < bridge> <syrinok> Is the 2 at the top of this the ID?
02:09 < bridge> <Solly> yes
02:10 < bridge> <syrinok> Was below hook strength previously
02:10 < bridge> <Solly> do you want it that way around
02:10 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, strength is better at the top imo

03:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @Discord Mod
03:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> every channel
03:34 < bridge> <louis> the heart icon is too detailed
03:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> end-to-end encryption situation is crazy
03:41 < bridge> <louis> i agree with these sort of stances on privacy but it's kinda silly to call the average tech user a 'normie' when these sort of messages should be presented to the average tech user
03:42 < bridge> <louis> if this guy wants to make videos for his techie echo chamber community he can, but its silly to act like the average person is a tech illiterate normie who's ruining privacy for everyone else
03:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> no offence to anyone here but thats literally how most techies act
03:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> they trash on everything that isnt linux
04:05 < bridge> <louis> you generalizing like that only makes it less easy to get along though
04:05 < bridge> <louis> also i personally trash on everything including linux
04:07 < bridge> <totar> is there anything new in this video?
04:08 < bridge> <totar> from the parts I skimmed it seems like they have not removed e2ee
04:09 < bridge> <totar> it's pretty obvious people care more about convenience than privacy anyway (we're all here using discord)
04:10 < bridge> <totar> there's nothing the government can do to stop you from using math if you so decide
04:11 < bridge> <louis> discord apparently has e2ee for voice and video at least üòÅ
04:11 < bridge> <totar> really? that's impressive
04:12 < bridge> <totar> e2ee between you and discord or between you and the other participants?
04:13 < bridge> <totar> new viral github PR

07:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> but backwards compatibility
07:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> :feelsbadman:
07:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ~~just stack more protocol~~
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning peeps
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> and peeppetes
08:19 < bridge> <totar> I still think it's worth discussing
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to review more prs
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u wanna continue working on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2754 ?
08:48 < bridge> <hectavoxel> jesus, that's a lot of stale PRs
08:48 < bridge> <hectavoxel> glad ur doing this, but at the same time it's sad seeing all the cool updates just sitting there
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> its better to close em imho they are 2+yr old and i plan on redoing some
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill try the c++20 now
08:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> hell yea
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> also those had like 10+ conflicts xd
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> we also getting a lot of new cool prs lately
08:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> well duh, they probably collected more dust than a vacuum cleaner
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> im gonna make a label: has-conflicts
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> makes knowing what to review easierr
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> the sad thing is the pr author cant remove it
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> mayb not worth it
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> waiting on author maybe better
08:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Looking back at [the reviews on my pr](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9512#discussion_r1928204201), I do want to discuss touching up the editor in the future. Mainly small things, like:
08:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - How in `src/game/editor/editor.cpp:4228`, the padding for Ui()->DoPopupMenu() doesn't change when it's selecting a game layer, so it's massive when it shouldn't be
08:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - How, with these new automapper updates, they could be put on top, where the Destructive button is
08:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - How, like you said, a lot of the variables should be renamed to be more clear.
09:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They can even be in one packet. Just slap both in there. Old clients ignore the messages they do not know. Should be simpler than 0.7 which you did at 3am
10:08 < bridge> <Solly> Yay blessed by def instamerge
10:11 < bridge> <ignoringlynx> How sv_input_fifo works, and how to use it on VDS
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> any opinions on this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1264
10:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> close this
10:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> its not a bug its a feature
10:29 < bridge> <teero777> Don't think it should be fixed right? It's used on many maps and is mostly common knowledge for experienced players. It would fix many skips which would result in many ranks being invalid. Removing those ranks would be pretty unfair since people spend a lot of time trying those skips since skipping death tiles is mostly inconsistent and you can get unlucky. Skipping tele is also a nice trick.
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @murpi should we poll this? im unsure what to do so i wont do anything for now xd
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> we have a feature that we can whitelist maps that use old bugs tho
10:30 < bridge> <teero777> *also would invalidate my deadrun tas
10:30 < bridge> <teero777> Wouldn't that be a little confusing? xd
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> we do that already with a grenade bug in some map
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i guess xd
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i have no opinion on this issue i dont rly care
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its the oldest pr open now so it triggers my ocd
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its the oldest pr open now so we should decide
10:34 < bridge> <teero777> I mean ddnet should move forward I think this should be fixed with your map setting
10:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> are there server options to enable/disable bugs? like sv_shotgun_bug
10:37 < bridge> <chairn> i think it should stay as is, it's part of ddnet's history and identity
10:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> would be useful if ddnet wants to get rid of bugs but keep them for old maps
10:47 < bridge> <davide55> There is any way to differentiate a normal connect packet from a dummy connect packet? (I guess no?) @chillerdragon @heinrich5991
10:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> nah, there is no difference afaik
10:47 < bridge> <davide55> rip me
10:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> why rip
10:48 < bridge> <davide55> because I need to write a lot of stuff haha

11:07 < bridge> <totar> someone online?
11:07 < bridge> <syrinok> Thanks
11:07 < bridge> <totar> nice
11:16 < bridge> <davide55> How the DDNet version is encoded in the sys.client_version packet?
11:24 < bridge> <totar> you can check the NETMSG_CLIENTVER message
11:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/9f0f75e38d3842d8eef38ce778e21745a568e8a7/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L214
11:27 < bridge> <davide55> Thanks
11:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> hmmm i wonder if MsgVer.AddRaw(&m_ConnectionId, sizeof(m_ConnectionId)); changes when a dummy is being connected
11:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> ig it stays the same
11:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> if you are working with the protocol i suggest setting up wireshark with libtw2 dissector
11:32 < bridge> <totar> he is most certainly familiar with those things
11:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> alright
11:34 < bridge> <davide55> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333746959915290675/WLdYWJSuiu4p.png?ex=679a0427&is=6798b2a7&hm=aa35ec68248656a3271778ec176fb1d87aeac7f4e95d29bb36269b84da084d1e&
11:34 < bridge> <davide55> Any idea why it is ignoring the redirect packet?
11:35 < bridge> <davide55> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333747283996573777/ePWDqj63PeZv.png?ex=679a0474&is=6798b2f4&hm=7e32130535d462b27a97824e5b9a39c4fe387ec4b4c4d01f499eb83c2f69d253&
11:36 < bridge> <davide55> It may be sent too late? Or maybe an "unknown" (which didn't exist yet on that version, the sys.5f4d....etc) packet can let the client ignore it?
11:37 < bridge> <davide55> It may be sent too late? Or maybe an "unknown" (which didn't exist yet on that version, the sys.5f4d....etc) packet can somehow force the client ignore it?
11:37 < bridge> <davide55> It may be sent too late? Or maybe an "unknown" (which didn't exist yet on that version, the sys.5f4d....etc) packet can somehow force the client to ignore it?
11:40 < bridge> <davide55> Ok confirmed, the issue is the unknown packet
11:41 < bridge> <davide55> So yes, I must do a per-version check
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> No. I think it belongs outside the client, in a launcher
11:49 < bridge> <learath2> This is curious. The unknown packet should get ignored just fine
11:50 < bridge> <davide55> It is not üòÑ
11:50 < bridge> <davide55> Every next packet is ignored too after it
11:50 < bridge> <davide55> Redirect included
11:51 < bridge> <davide55> Actually, not every packet, I managed to be able to close the connection
11:51 < bridge> <learath2> That's very weird. Would maybe reordering them help?
11:51 < bridge> <davide55> What do you mean?
11:52 < bridge> <davide55> Sending the unknown packet (for this version) after the redirect?
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> Yes. But then I guess the new client might behave weird?
11:52 < bridge> <davide55> Exactly
11:52 < bridge> <davide55> üòÑ
11:53 < bridge> <davide55> I'm basically catching the old clients which don't have a new function (the reconnect), and if that's the case I send the old function (the redirect)
11:53 < bridge> <davide55> But after I send the reconnect (which is a new function), the old clients just ignore the redirect
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> That's very weird. Why would a previous packet that's unknown influence future packets parsing? :/
11:57 < bridge> <davide55> I have no idea
11:57 < bridge> <davide55> I tried without the unknown packet and it worked
11:57 < bridge> <davide55> With the unknown packet -> not working
11:57 < bridge> <learath2> DeepSeek R1 is also MIT licensed
11:58 < bridge> <learath2> I might investigate it later. Can you tell me the uuids for the two messages and whether you were sending them in one packet or two?
11:59 < bridge> <davide55> Sure, single packets
11:59 < bridge> <davide55> Reconnect = 5f4d5db739473711b04e07a1ff23c970 (the unknown packet)
11:59 < bridge> <davide55> Redirect = 4efe406a777433f1bfde1806ff6d1528
12:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's talking about all these ai assistants everyone is adding to their devices that have full access to the screen. No amount of e2e will fix that üòÑ
12:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I could see individual terminal sessions being fed to an assistant with that assistant running locally
12:07 < bridge> <totar> Idk I still haven't found much use for those but they're being pushed pretty hard. I only use the assistant if I'm driving
12:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> But I'm not going to feed everything I'm doing even when the model is on my own computer
12:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't use them either, I'm just thinking about how much of my data I'd be willing to pour into a magic black box
12:17 < bridge> <davide55> Well, for now, I ended by doing a simple silent disconnect, if you can find the reason why it doesn't work poke me üòÑ

12:27 < bridge> <avolicious> I like the wtf.pcap
12:27 < bridge> <avolicious> wtf is always reasonable
12:27 < bridge> <davide55> HAHAHAHA
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> I have a fuckyou.pcap from 2016
12:33 < bridge> <avolicious> Do you still know what its about?
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah. It's the dump from a dos attack, used it to craft iptables rules
12:34 < bridge> <avolicious> I found a `cryhard.pcap` from 2018
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> FIFO is a file. You can set the config to a file name or path such as sample.fifo and then just write to that file. All lines written to that file will be executed as rcon commands.
12:35 < bridge> <avolicious> Oh, nice. Good old days where DoS was a problem
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I also think there is not. But we could add some if you need it. Sounds like interesting info.
12:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That should not cause issues. Just make sure you use the correct sequence numbers. Both of the messages are vital so if you send two of them you need to increment the sequence number.
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> The sequence number being wrong would make more sense
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> With the next packet being ignored too
12:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Since innocent Davide only ever sent one non control message he got away with not worrying about those damn sequence numbers hehe
12:47 < bridge> <ignoringlynx> How sv_input_fifo works, and how to use it on VDS
12:47 < bridge> <ignoringlynx> ?
12:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I already told you @ignoringlynx
12:49 < bridge> <ignoringlynx> Sorry, I didn't notice.
12:52 < bridge> <ignoringlynx> Can I record them in real time? if so, I have to delete all the lines that were entered before
12:54 < bridge> <davide55> Oh, thanks, I'll check that!

13:07 < bridge> <learath2> Beef Stew Recipe
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> 1. Heat oil in a pot, brown 500g beef cubes.
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> 2. Add 1 diced onion, 2 minced garlic cloves; saut√©.
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> 3. Stir in 2 tbsp flour, then add 4 cups beef stock.
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> 4. Add 3 chopped carrots, 2 diced potatoes, 2 celery stalks, salt, and pepper.
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> 5. Simmer covered for 1.5-2 hours, stirring occasionally.
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> 
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> 6. Adjust seasoning and serve.
13:08 < bridge> <davide55> Oh no, AI is here
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what you are talking about
13:09 < bridge> <davide55> To thank you I'll also give you a receipe

13:09 < bridge> <learath2> I do this every morning
13:10 < bridge> <davide55> The same steps?
13:10 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
13:10 < bridge> <davide55> Oh wow nice
13:10 < bridge> <learath2> The second step 2 is essential
13:10 < bridge> <davide55> I agree!
13:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> just put raw beef in a furnace for 10 seconds
13:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> works like a charm
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> That doesnt make stew. It makes Steak
13:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ima try deepsek locally wiht ollama
13:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> ah yeah
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> Do you have enough memory for it even?
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> can i run the 32b with a 3080?
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1iblms1/running_deepseek_r1_locally_is_not_possible/
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm idk
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I don't know why Ollama decides to call these models Deepseek R1, but it's problematic. Running the actual Deepseek R1 in q4 requires more than 400GB of VRAM or RAM depending on how long are are willing to sit there waiting for an answe
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Idk if there is a way to swap pages in an out while inferring
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> But you definitely can't fit the model on your single 3080
13:14 < bridge> <davide55> I have a few servers with 1TB RAM, I may try it!
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> man
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Cpu inference is usually muuch slower. It might be unfeasible
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> when consumer hardware ai that is okayish
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always had the idea to add a local ai translation service to ddnet
13:15 < bridge> <davide55> EPYC 9474F, should be decent
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i gues its not possible yet
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> The people who ran it at home successfully mostly all used a swarm of Apple Silicon macs
13:15 < bridge> <davide55> I maaged to run a 100B+ and it was pretty fast
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt epyc have like a fpga

13:15 < bridge> <davide55> Nice
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> (With the gpu having access to all of the unified memory on those)
13:17 < bridge> <Solly> I have a draft of non local translate in tater
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah non local being the keyword
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ffxiv has a plugin that translated the game to spanish using deepl
13:18 < bridge> <Solly> Idk about the legality but that also means you could add Google translate and all the others
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> (oddly enough ffxiv is not in spanish and doesnt plan to, ignoring the wide userbase that exists in spain and south america)
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> I never felt like translation belonged in the client
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> (but it has french and german translations)
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> square enix: lets ignore the second most spoken language
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> That's bizarre. Spanish speaking market is nassive
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> That's bizarre. Spanish speaking market is massive
13:19 < bridge> <Solly> Copying from console is exceedingly slow and not worth when half the messages are derogatory
13:19 < bridge> <Solly> So I end up just not understanding russian which I could
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:21 < bridge> <teero777> yes make ddnet require 1.3tb of vram xD
13:21 < bridge> <teero777> New steam requirements
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> well
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe with the 3k$ nvidia pc
13:22 < bridge> <Solly> You can get good enough or better than nothing with small models
13:22 < bridge> <Solly> Which even run in reasonable times on CPUs
13:23 < bridge> <teero777> Smaller models are easy to run
13:23 < bridge> <teero777> But ddnet would depend on ollama which idk
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333774511086108692/GiUTEcGbsAA3QQ9.png?ex=679a1dcf&is=6798cc4f&hm=46a0e6a692f7e0bdc6206e31635f160b17bcebbcce1b540e6eda3b0217c420cd&
13:23 < bridge> <teero777> But ddnet would depend on ollama which is idk
13:23 < bridge> <Solly> Well it can be an optional dependency
13:24 < bridge> <Solly> Like plz add ollama to path to access this feature
13:24 < bridge> <teero777> So much effort for mods explaining to ppl
13:24 < bridge> <teero777> We need a wiki page then
13:25 < bridge> <Solly> You can steal the ollama install guide for which probably exists
13:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
13:25 < bridge> <teero777> I guess so

15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgor
15:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> this already exists https://github.com/garritfra/qbe-rs
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
15:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm gonna contribute to i3 :greenthing:
15:26 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if this happens im gonna try and jailbreak it
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> what will u add
15:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> probably will try to fix some bug
15:28 < bridge> <Ewan> can u make it tile better
15:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pf, i can make it tile worse
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt look that complete
15:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea, when i did some stuff with qbe i just copied the source of qbe rs and adjusted for my own needs
17:09 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> What? You don‚Äôt have to delete lines. Just give it a try
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> @robyt3 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/8e90bc443556591c9ba05b896ffc461769e9fce2 seems to have broken something
17:37 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean that commit in particular or the series of fixes? This would only affect `sv_dnsbl_vote 1` since `DistinctClientCount` is only used once
17:37 < bridge> <learath2> I haven't diagnosed it entirely but this is the most recent change in the backtrace
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> It's crashing all the servers, there is a core in `RUS2:/home/teeworlds/servers/core_crash`
17:39 < bridge> <robyt3> And servers are already on this commit? Could otherwise be the opposite that the commit fixed this crash
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing it has something to do with the `ClientIngame(i)` being gone
17:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :feelsbadman:
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> That's a good question, idk, I assumed it was a recent deploy since it wasn't crashing yesterday
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably also possible that is crashed without debug dummies (without the fix), probably happened also when there are large gaps in the range of valid clients
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> In the backtrace it seems it was trying to compare a client with `m_State == STATE_EMPTY`
17:41 < bridge> <learath2> cid 9 was STATE_EMPTY, cid 10 was STATE_INGAME, they got passed to `net_addr_comp_noport`
17:42 < bridge> <robyt3> The `ClientIngame` check should ensure `CClient::STATE_INGAME`, otherwise the address entry in `apAddresses` is `nullptr` which is checked in the second loop
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> (gdb) print GIT_SHORTREV_HASH
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> $10 = 0x564e54c02b5d "9f306fcc712de032"
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like it doesn't include the fix yet
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, so maybe a redeploy might fix it
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder why it wasn't crashing yesterday though
17:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Was `sv_dnsbl_vote` always enabled?
17:47 < bridge> <learath2> Probable
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> Let me compile a new one and try deploy the latest commit
17:51 < bridge> <learath2> We really need to start monitoring these better too, we should know about dozens of crashes in a row before people can report it to us
17:52 < ChillerDragon> did a server just crash?
17:52 < ChillerDragon> i clicked away the ip but some back in the days server just went connection problems on me
17:53 < ChillerDragon> pretty sure it was this one 45.141.57.22:8328
17:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Automate rollbacks!
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> deployed the current master, restarted all empty servers
17:54 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, would be really useful to get notifications about crashing servers, with crash dump and version
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> RUS2 was also set up to just keep overwriting a single corefile
17:55 < ChillerDragon> @robyt3 but there are crash dumps right?
17:56 < ChillerDragon> notifcations are nice ish but logs of all crashes and someone who checks it once and then should be enough
17:56 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but it would make the process a lot smoother if all the crashes would just be logged in a web console or something
17:56 < ChillerDragon> give me ssh ill do it xd
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:57 < ChillerDragon> or fix ddnet-scripts repo to correctly reflect prod and ill pr it
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ssh@jupeyy
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> We should just rip out all these messy script mish-mashes and just add some proper monitoring with modern tools
17:58 < ChillerDragon> no
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> I would not even know where to add what as it is currently running
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> I don't get how this wasn't happening all the time
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> It literally just requires any slot to be empty as far as I can see
18:08 < ChillerDragon> what so server full is crash?
18:08 < ChillerDragon> gotta start kicking players then
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it was getting safe addresses that pointed somewhere atleast
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it was getting safe addresses that pointed somewhere readable atleast
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> but I don't get why that changed recently
18:11 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know, I tested the specific case of client in slots 0 and 2 before the fix without debug dummies because that's how I read the code as well, but couldn't get it to crash
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> This makes no sense to me which is scary
18:17 < bridge> <robyt3> I suppose there was something valid on the stack that `net_addr_comp_noport` doesn't crash on
18:17 < bridge> <robyt3> so it was just writing a 0 to a random memory location :monkaS:  and then calling `mem_comp` on it
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> It does look like just luck that we were always getting a readable garbage address
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> mh it doesn't seem like the new version is crashing, the servers that didn't restart yet keep crashing though, that's a shame
18:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Shouldn't they use the new version after crashing once?
18:27 < bridge> <louis> do ddnet test servers use the latest release?
18:27 < bridge> <louis> if they use latest master, can they have sv_practice_by_default enabled? or at least a toggle in vote menu
18:28 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious when fix BETA fra emote delay

23:46 < bridge> <learath2> literally anything, you just need like 7% return
23:48 < bridge> <Ewan> but not really, watch inflation halve your yields
23:49 < bridge> <Ewan> third

23:50 < bridge> <learath2> How much inflation are you even expecting? This isn't Turkey or Venezuela, the average is about 3.3% in the US
23:51 < bridge> <learath2> 7 - 3.3 = 3.7%, which is 11k per year that you can safely withdraw from your investments without shrinking them
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
23:52 < bridge> <learath2> Above 500k invested you are pretty much safe forever unless some global catastrophe happens üòÑ
23:54 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
23:54 < bridge> <Ewan> im not as apt with money as i'd like to be
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> so far i have made $29 from investing.
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want 1500 TB of RAM
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> * 16
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `* 16`
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> you want 24PB of ram
23:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is the real boss fight

23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> what does it mean
23:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats how many neurons and synapses the average adult human has
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i see you are comparing it to the ram lol
23:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> that was lost on me
23:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gotta beat the human brain in everything
23:59 < bridge> <Ewan> how can a neuron/synapse be counted in bytes tho
23:59 < bridge> <Ewan> is it about the number
23:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i mean the real brain has inifinite precision
23:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is kinda unfair
23:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but lets assume 16 bit fp perform good enough
