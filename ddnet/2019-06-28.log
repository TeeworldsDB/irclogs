11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it acceptable to have single file python "projects" or should I be creating a virtualenv?
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ?
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really ever make anything with python except "scripts", I use it mostly like a very powerful bash
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I'm not sure what the "standard" way to organise a project is in python
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> i guess u put ur files in a folder like any other project? xd
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well DUH
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was putting them on the blockchain
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, ethereum smart contract teeworlds master server?
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> sounds cool
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, I have a half working version of http masters \o/
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll clean it up a little and will put up a draft pr tomorrow or the day after
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> nice
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remembered how much I hate languages without static typing, I should have done this in typescript or just c++
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe directly in rust even
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are you trolling Learath2?
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or did you really get some tw masters stuff running on a blockchain lol?
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not at all, I wholeheartedly believe dynamic typing is evil
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> -.-
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh that, yeah i'm trolling
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean the master part
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sad
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't waste time with putting masters on blockchain ðŸ˜„
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk how smart contracts work but i assume you cant host anything on it
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you are evil
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyone who thinks dynamic typing is acceptable, don't @ me
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well best language uses dyntypes
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's an oxymoron
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :p
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it can't possibly be the best language if it uses weak types
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm it somehow is
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm intrigued, are you talking about Scratch? ðŸ˜„
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe :D i knew you thought about scratch
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk what types it has
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i am talking about shell o.O
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd only like to say "Ew"
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh cmn its best
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be against the genova convention to use languages with weak types
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Scratch lmao
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sh > bash > scratch > masm > rest
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> masm?
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Masm
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Wth is this
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's an assembler
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> microsoft assembler :p
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> an x86 assembler
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it has quirks more fucked up than javascript
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it doesn't belong on your list
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you should say x86 assembly ðŸ˜›
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Microsoft ew
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well masm does kinda have it's quirks with it's macro syntax though
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> x86 64 bestt
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do people put up with this madness? It's insane that doing field validation is so hard in this supposedly high level language
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's easier in rust even
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> whatâ€™s so hard about it
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> fields themselves don't have a type, so validating them requires you to either requires you to write your own validator or use a library, which requires you to create a schema
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> either way, now I have either two classes or one class one function that can easily go out of sync
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll use marshmellow and call it a day
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> marshmallow*
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 latest python versions got some type hinting but not as good as typescript
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> typescript is rly well done tbh
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to go around the js shit
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> welcome to another episode of syntax fails:
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/594148879184822285/unknown.png
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> highlight*
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that editor must be rly bad
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have never written anything this ugly
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye the editor is the worst but i already had similar stuff in vscode
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/a071797508435ac35a3ae13c75e6fab5
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> still the huge avatar ðŸ˜›
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is the "reference" i'm implementing against
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it barely works
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, removing the support for old masters and serverinfo packets might be a tad too radical ðŸ˜›
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> shouldnâ€™t validate_dict return false and then raise exception from that
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, it's all very dirty now, i was debugging sth, so I moved the exceptions up, then forgot to move them back down
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you can combine the 2 checks btw
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> haven't slept in like 30-35 hours, so a little brainmelted aswell
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> wtf
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> go sleep
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if i sleep now I'm fucked
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd sleep 8 hours minimum, waking up at 2400, then tomorrow i'll sleep at 1600 again ðŸ˜„
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> unwise
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao which two checks you mean?
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 again
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> stop stopping sleeping
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> NO U
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜¢
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> nvm
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> I would pass the dict to init
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 damm how is that even possible. I sleep atleast 7 hours a day.
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> __init__ can't return a None though, I guess I should be raising the exception anyways
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> go sleep
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> its time
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b it's usually not possible, making an adjustment today
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 I have already told you it'd be insane to sleep right now, so stop giving me bad ideas
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> And if i make it till 6am on Saturday i just sleep 4 hours.
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> But not sleeping is the worst
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, do you think it's a little too much to remove the support for oldmasters and serverinfo packets?
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but you validated already before
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking we inject the servers that don't support the new protocol into the masters ourselves
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> why would it be insane
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you can go sleep at any time
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> if you need it
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 if I sleep now, when do you think I'll wake up?
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> and you, need it
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> tomorrow at 2pm
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well that is bad advise actually
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the whole point of staying awake is to shift my sleep schedule to more favourable hours
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 no way i'll sleep 19 hours lmao
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Better advise is just sleep for 3 hours now and go to bed again at noon
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> lol then better stay up
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b and that's too little, no way I'll be able to get out of bed after 3 hours
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 yeah but when its 35h you didn't sleep its not shifting anymore xd
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Ez
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> he will be even more wasted after 3h sleep
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> I dont
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 ofc it's shifting, I can sleep a max of 10 hours, if i go to sleep at 2400 today, i'll wake up at 1000 at the worst case
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is much better then what i have now
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sleeping at 0600 waking up at 1500 is not good for one
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> why 35h no sleep
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how else do you suggest i move the sleep schedule ahead?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> in one day there's enough time?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I could sleep on command like the lucky few, I would do so
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> if you go sleep at 12 pm each day
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to actually be quite sleepy to sleep, insomnia is a bitch
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> that's why you wait so much?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> easy for you to say with your decent sleep, 2400 is usually when I'm at peak awareness
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah xd
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> they probably never had a fucked up sleep schedule ðŸ˜‚
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Lying in bed is also resting. I gave up to sleep fast. I just am chilling 1 or 2 hours before i sleep.
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> he would fall asleep
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> currently yes
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> i would instantly pass out ðŸ˜„
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> afterall its ur life xd
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, we have some major spaghetti code with the serverbrowser :/
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this will be so much to refactor :/
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont add old master support to new master pls
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all just validation code
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well at this point it just needs to make sure i'm sending proper requests, saves them and sends them back
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't need it to do anything else rn
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new rpi
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks awesome
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the rpi website is hosted on it
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should find a new project to do with it
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill buy it probs
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it got wifi and bluetooth
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats nice
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has also dual display 4k60
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> i doubt it's beefy enough to render much of anything worthwhile at 4k60
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let alone 2 ðŸ˜›
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> :justatest:
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't believe it actually works, now just need to polish it for a couple dozen years
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Make a live cam online with a timelapse feature
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you know that it's fairly untrivial to parse a url?
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 thats why u use libraries but ur u and i guess u dont like them
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think anyone wants any more libraries in ddnet ðŸ˜„
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh u mean in ddnet
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not masterserver
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> u banned 38 ppl @jao
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> nice
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> one
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> http masters sorta work, if you don't send them bad json \o/
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you send them bad json they crash and burn ðŸ˜›
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> why
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> u didn't do something that validates the json?
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> validating json in C++ is even more cancer then validating in python
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill send u bad json in a min bb
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> in c++ ye
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u just use
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> i'm sure
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a LIBRARY!
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> there's online api
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I DO
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> WE ALREADY HAVE A JSON PARSER
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you do
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but it still crashes? xd
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> SEARCH A JSON VALIDATOR LIBRARY
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> one that doesn't do validation
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no I'll just add a HUGE function that does it ðŸ˜›
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok maybe there is an online tool which u can use instead of including yet another library
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually wanted proper json schema validation
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> or that could be something to do if not
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw instead of ur ugly validation code u can use https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/ or something liek that
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> note i dont think this validates if the text is correct json
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it works for the value parsing
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 show an example of what you need, input -> output
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I was doing that with marshmallow, then I noticed I made some mistakes while unpacking
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw why u dont just catc the error if parsing errors
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> then I didn't want to bother re-arranging
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki in the client?
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the sv
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are talking about
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> masterserver
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right?
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, that side I do catch the error normally
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just disabled it while debugging
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it crashes
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u want to make the client not crash if it recieves invalid json
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would use a lib but ur the one doing this
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a couple dozen lines of verification
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll write them, @heinrich5991 will complain that I didn't use a library
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> then I'll probably use a librarys
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> library*
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 by invalid u mean malformed or incorrect value types?
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> all of the above ðŸ™‚
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a troll master server sending malformed json to clients
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> crashing all them
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trolls would do it
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for sure
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well trolls can't has masterservers
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm actually about to fall asleep on the laptop ðŸ˜›
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> then go sleep
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> :D
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll eat and I'll sleep
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> do it then
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> my god you are pedantic
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> wtf ðŸ˜‚
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.StÃ¸nÄ™> Why canâ€™t I play teeworld anymore
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.StÃ¸nÄ™> ?
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> hum
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> explain?
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ExBlack> Who is the monkey tee made by?
