09:48 <+ChillerDragon> anyone having issues with gtest on arch since last os update?
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/LL
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do a full recompile
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, probably remove the CMakeCache.txt and CMakeFiles
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I still have gtest 1.10.0 on Arch
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> too bad its not
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> because no one uses guilded
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> lmaao its such a unbelivable rip off
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> looks 1:1
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Aurix cuz discord is well known since a long time
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> did you ever try it lol
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> nah and i wont xd
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> discord is superior since everyone uses it
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well guilded had good ideas + maybe discord will get worst if microsoft really buys it
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> it is a fresh build directory
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> any idea on how i can turn off gtest so i can just compile?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST=ON
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea i assumed off lol
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> still same error
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> wait so nobody can reproduce that?
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> ok i have a fix
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ce2bf096bde8ccf6f0ce81fb084eba47a52ce72e/CMakeLists.txt#L358 commenting out that line does the job
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> since that calls the cmakefile in /usr that throws errors
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> but still dirty fix
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> weird, i think it's a problem of your gtest installation. for me ddnet can still be built without gtest installed
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> yes it seems like
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> this cmake file /usr/lib64/cmake/GTest/GTestTargets.cmake expects a lib that does not exist
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> but how did i break my system?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try reinstalling gtest?
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i did
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> well i found a fix lmao
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> thanks for the idea
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> uninstalling gtest did the job

13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i tried to launch ddnet with native wayland sdl backend and got this. compiled it with native sdl2 which has wayland support
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you need wayland with opengl not opengl es
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you compile mesa?, maybe zink works with wayland, then you'd just need vulkan ready hardware ðŸ˜„
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in my testing the perf was around 1/5th of the native performance when running high fps
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can overload the mesa driver with
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> it will 100%. guilded is probably better but all is discarded since no one uses it
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> discord will became shit after microsoft buys it
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> seems like it got heavily improved, just tested with mesa 21-devel and its only 1/2
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mipmaps looks correct too now, looks really usable, nice ðŸ˜„
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now we just need a windows version of it, and we can ship it optionally xd
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also considering windows is only 75% of linux speed for me ðŸ˜„
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> well xwayland just works so it's okay :D
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok nice
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> @Learath2 @deen @heinrich5991 I can't make an issue on github because i barely write. Mouse buttons seems tobe hardcoded. Changed buttons in mouse settings from left to right and rebinded in client an still some menu fields/buttons react only to left mouse click and some react only to right.
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> seems that only search field in server browser react only to left mouse click everything else react right
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> keybinding is aalsi hardcoded
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> anyone having expirience with the dummy having only 1/4 of the fps when running the client with gdb after some time?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SukLuck> any help to compile server_sql on windows?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Eh I cant Update to the newest Version
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> woot OpenSSL CVE? Or am i getting bamboozeld and flooded with irc spam too now? :D

18:47 <+ChillerDragon> is the internet doomed? _D

18:48 <+ChillerDragon> oh wew
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> were here any changes in scoreboard?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, a bit bigger, and the scoreboard collision was fixed, and maybe visually most confusing is that tees are now centered, but once u get used to it, the old looks weird xD
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Mysql connector is not a dependency anymore on ddnet 15.4 ? @deen
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/824758593353023488/unknown.png
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> im not sure its supposed to look like this from my experience
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> it's hard mode for kobra
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> update windows
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> update drivers
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> reinstall windows
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> uninstall windows
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chronological order
22:48 <+ChillerDragon> ouch @NeXus
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> tis not my windows machine to uninstall windows on and install linux on
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> linsux
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well tell him todo that
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tell them to update windows + drivers
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but if all that doesnt help, its a hardware issue, or something similar
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nobodys gonna install linux to play tee game
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> xd
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i saw this once, and the person just reinstalled everything and then it worked xd
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, we need teeworlds-os
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @ChillerDragon I'll add you again in the future don't worry
23:26 <+ChillerDragon> sure^^
