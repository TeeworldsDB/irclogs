01:17 <@deen> @ChillerDragon so now we shut down zcatch, it's the next target for ddosers?
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Just ddos the exec servers as punishment :troll:
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> zcatch is fine all thos asshols are in block which are mostly ddosing
04:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> @Admin Hello, it's been 2 months now (maybe more), when do you plan to release the fix for Binary ?
04:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> @Admin Hello, it's been 3 months now (maybe more), when do you plan to release the fix for Binary ?
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Dareka the fix is done but not deployed. we're discussing how to integrate it into the code: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1091
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> Is it possible to have a background overlay for the chat? And some more settings, like variable size and width of the chat similar to Minecraft.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt it possible to manually replace the font? and use some super hughe font with background?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but im not sure
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ofcourse it is possible but who is gonna code it for you. That is the real question
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> allthehaxx client has it. ask them if you could take it.   btw what happened to the cinematic camera movement? is it in the next version?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> @heinrich5991 Already know that. But it's taking much too long for a simple discussion. Fixing the bug is the priority, doing it in the better way comes after. 
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> I just think you should release now as def was saying and think about how you can improve it after.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i did try to use ddnet11 agian and i expirenced some frame drops and general way lower frame rate than with ddnet10 (using win10)
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> Hello anyone knows why my mouse is faster in the editor?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> It's faster than my sens in menus
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <azerty> ui_mousesens
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> That changes the menu sens
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> It also changes the sens in the editor but I want the sens in the editor to be the same as in the menus
