08:41 <+d3fault> amm, why the presidential veto enabled or not based on `server` time rather than `race` time? i load a save with 140 mins, then get trolled (by SP | Someone ofc) doing a changemap ~_~

15:37 <+minus> What was that 
15:54 <+ochristi> could someone please kick/ban player "SP  | Someone" on instance with port 8332, the user is connecting/spamming the server
15:55 <+ochristi> ehh GER
16:10 <+ochristi> ok problem resolved

16:38 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 0688229 def: Forbid names starting with /, as they can be abused to make people write chat commands
17:01 <+ochristi> how about allowing to write //namestartingwithshlash, to highlight players instead of recognizing it as a command?
17:12 <@heinrich5991> ochristi: you can also put a space in front
17:14 <+ochristi> bothersome if using completion, you have to cursor left all the way, add the space, cursor right to write
17:14 <+ochristi> oh I just noticed ctrl+arrows jumps whole words
17:14 <+Henningstone> It should also be possible to press "home" to get to the very beginning, isn't it?
17:17 <@heinrich5991> ochristi: can't you just do <space> <start of name> <tab>
17:17 <+ochristi> right :D
17:17 <+ochristi> works both :p
17:18 <@deen> then you have no colon
17:18 <@heinrich5991> but I guess it should be fixed
17:18 <@deen> "fixed"
17:18 <@heinrich5991> otherwise people are going to name themselves /kill
17:18 <@deen> they did a lot
17:18 <@heinrich5991> oh
17:18 <@deen> fixed in the same way as Vanilla Teeworlds fixed similar unicode characters
17:19 <@deen> by disallowing unicode :P
17:19 <@heinrich5991> huh? how does that help?
17:19 <@heinrich5991> /kill has no unicode
17:19 <@heinrich5991> ahh
17:19 <@heinrich5991> no names with /
17:19 <@deen> yep
17:20 <@deen> there are no active players whose names start with / anyway
17:21 <@heinrich5991> ah
17:21 <@heinrich5991> could be used for decoration
17:21 <@heinrich5991> /name\
17:21 <@heinrich5991> or something
17:21 <@deen> and there's a clan that uses // at start
17:21 <@heinrich5991> /\ the boss /\
17:22 <@deen> but it's been inactive for a few years i believe
17:22 <@deen> Him for example, and he's even semi-active: https://ddnet.tw/players/-47--47-Alex-92--92-/
17:22 <@deen> and inactive clan: https://ddnet.tw/players/-47--47--32-red/
17:23 <@deen> In my opinion names starting with / were always buggfy
17:23 <@deen> buggy*
17:23 <@deen> because writing to them didn't work well
17:23 <@deen> in the same vein ; could also be problematic
17:24 <@deen> hm, shit
17:24 <@deen> if someone calls himself "XXX;timeout me" and tells someone else to write /rank on him, it will cause /timeout me as well
17:25 <@deen> stupid text parsing

17:25 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 8b10d15 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #509 from timakro/pr_no_disconnect_timeout...
17:27 <@deen> but that's difficult to prevent, woud have to forbid ; everywhere
17:27 <@deen> maybe TAB should instead escape the player names :P
17:41 <+fstd> deen: i had to deal with something similar at one point and decided to base64 names internally and work on that instead
17:41 <+fstd> unbase64 only for human presentation
17:42 <+fstd> (not sure if that would work for whatever you're doing, haven't read the backlog)
17:42 <@deen> wouldn't but thanks anyway :)
17:42 <+fstd> k, too bad

20:00 <+KinG_> hi
20:02 <+KinG_> deen: hey, can you make the ddnet persian servers save ranks and points offline and sync it with other servers when it gets back online? currently internet is off because of ddos ...
20:14 <+KinG_> bye guys 
21:04 <@deen> well, GER is also off half of this week since ddos
21:04 <@deen> doesn't make much sense since all the ddosers work together
21:06 <@deen> DDNet GER - 10 players, Attackers' server - 160 players
21:06 <@deen> running servers in Teeworlds really isn't much fun
21:53 <+nameless-tee> What is attackers' server?
