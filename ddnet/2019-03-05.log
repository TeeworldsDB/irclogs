21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm taking the liberty to advertise for the first post on my new blog here. It's about me messing around with and programming my new bare-bones quadcopter to make a LED blink. And maybe it's the start to something great (taking flight some day?).  https://timakro.de/blog/bare-metal-stm32-programming/

22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> y did i say that
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro you're on the HN frontpage btw
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 3-axsis -> 3-axis
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> earths -> earth's
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Uh, right, barely on the front page :), that's great
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Gg
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Thanks, I'm fixing those and any others if you find them
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> What is HN ? :o
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://news.ycombinator.com/
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Thanks
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Timakro's famous :D
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro what's the plan with the quadcopter?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> generate more hn karma
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Didn't expect trolling comments from @heinrich5991 ðŸ˜„
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen full power to all 4 rotors for ~0.5 second and see what happens  ^^
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess you can only do that once? ðŸ˜„
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'll try not to break it
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Well, the idea would be to get it staying relatively stable in the air
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice blog post. the blog layout looks vaguely familiar ðŸ˜‰
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Does it have sensors for acceleration or how will you figure out where it is in the room and how fast it's moving?
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I got inspiration from your blog ðŸ˜‰
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I noticed your repo is not public
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah it has sensors for acceleration and many more
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why make it public?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for pull requests to fix typos ðŸ˜„
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> haha, ok
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or if you make improvements so i can steal them back
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> sure, I'll put it on github then
