02:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> Hi, I made a feature for defining teamcolors.
02:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> https://btp.uber.space/ddnet/
02:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> It's propably not good code quality and stuff, and it's pretty simple.
02:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> I mean colorpicker and everything is there.
07:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Awesome! Next Is to flip game inputs and the render on the middle of the map. And one can finally chose team red or blue client side in team modes

08:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ñ•Î±âˆ‚â„“ÏƒÎ½Ñ”ðŸ–¤> hi, when i go in a map my game crash how i can fix it pls ?
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> every map or some?
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> weird question: why does the 3-tile jump from x = .34 work from the first pillar but not from the 2nd pillar?
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/953244661709946880/2022-03-15_12-50-25.mp4
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> what's shown in the video is how .16 .31 and .34 all work on the first pillar
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> and that .34 doesn't work on 2nd pillar
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> .16 and .31 still work tho
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> also for reference i've been using this coords jump thingy for  a few months already and this is the first time this happened
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> lol what is this "edgejump" output you see in chat. do you have a bind for edge jumps :D?
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> it's a bind that presses right and jump or left and jump at the same time
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> if you do it from certain coords you're guaranteed a jump from 1 edge to the next over 3 wide freeze
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> if you don't hit your head on the ceiling
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> (but apparently you're not guaranteed)
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> What is the name of the map ðŸ˜„ I want try it
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> Simple down
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> Complicated up
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I have only manually tested without bind ðŸ˜„ but you're right with the first two I manage that jump every time, with the other later in the map I have not managed once. ;D Interesting you must probably look deeper into the game mechanics to improve your guarantee.
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> This is because we use floating point numbers for these calculations
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and thus the physics are slightly different in different parts of the map, this is mainly noticable on large maps
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and that's also the reason why we don't optimize old maps by removing empty parts
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> maybe some calculations could be changed to be made relative to the player position instead of the fixed map position, but any kind of physics change is super risky
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I have only manually tested without bind ðŸ˜„ but you're right with the first two I manage that jump every time, with the other later in the map I have not managed once. ;D Interesting you must probably look deeper into the game mechanics to improve your guarantee. (After a few dozen attempts more it now works ðŸ˜„ may depend on different factors, but since I have only tested it manually I think it also depends on how simultaneously I have
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think needlessly large floats are used in the coord system, when making my quad tool I noticed the floats got really big and inaccurate quickly
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> woah that's crazy, i wonder how the coords work tho, is the difference only coming from 495.34 vs 965.34 or can you be on different parts of the same block like 495.34 vs 495.34 and still get different jumps
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first one we even demonstrated. Second I'm not quite sure about. There are some very interesting issues with floating points
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It even failed cendren and mizkibos bit3 run where jumping down from .54 resulted in a tower but a little closer didnt
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> any time i tried that it always worked so maybe its just very rarely
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> What does "data/hud.png is not dilated" mean? I have looked at the check_dilate.sh script and also understood what it checks. But how can I fix the problem?
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> drag it into dilate tool
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should come with the client
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thanks ðŸ™‚
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh, but did not fix the check
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thanks ðŸ™‚ worked
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> gender is actually a floating point number :troll:
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 floating point numbers even
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> uh
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> lynn talking about gender
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> hot
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> and where is nogender ðŸ˜±
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> 2 floating point numbers sounds reasonable
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> NaN is a float
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> gotem
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> what
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> i don't really talk nerd language, what is NaN
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> gender becomes a 4d array :saddo:
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not a number
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> o
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `float gender = nan("");`
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :lynnyaSmug:
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> did u ping me
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sounds fake

17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> yes fire man
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> im actually in class rn
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> literally go do ur homework
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> I have no clue how render / opengl works. If I had I would make a webgl map viewer or even spec client ^^
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> but the idea with flipping render is nice. Maybe I can use it to get into that kind of code.
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's shown is rounded coordinates, maybe in first case it was .339 and second was .341 which could change the final results
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> first pillar consistently worked while second one consistently didnt work
