12:03 <@EastByte> that's a known problem. changing the gametype name currently causes strange incompatibilities
12:04 <@EastByte> you can expect this to be fixed in the next client release though.

22:29 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: o_be_two: what does that mean? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=116590#p116590
23:14 <+o_be_two> hello
23:15 <+o_be_two> what this ? oO
23:16 <+o_be_two> they are afraid of r0x.fr tackling them oO ?
23:17 <+o_be_two> what it means ? I think they just fear cause someone give me all personnal info about them everyday :/
23:18 <+o_be_two> many peopel complaint about them, so they do many things to help, but when they talk about ddosing or attacking, i just answer "no, dont dot that, we dont need this"
23:19 <+o_be_two> and actually im getting ddoses on all my servers -_-
23:20 <+o_be_two> jsut to let you know heinrich5991 , since illuminati and vali and temmo can do what they want, i use VPN everytime. I dont trust TW anymore and im not the only one with this mind
23:21 <+o_be_two> ill dont answer this thread, like terrorism, they dont need to be "popular"
23:23 <+o_be_two> (and i dont want to war cause i dont really care about TW, i care about DDNet and my community, cause these 2 are good communities
23:24 <+o_be_two> and TW is not played by my community players, so its not a problem to stop tomorrow)
