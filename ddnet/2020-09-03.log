09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki peddling open source software that's just not there yet as alternative to industry standards?

10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Wtf
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I dont want my client refreshing when i change filter type
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> This will be annoying

11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > I dont want my client refreshing when i change filter type
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > @ᶰ°Konͧsti 
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Not clear pr name. The changes was just about to update visible servers when you change ping filter but not to reload them
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> HMM
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ᶰ°Konͧsti Use the steam beta and you can try out these features already
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, tomorrow probably
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut honestly I'd be a bit worried about CPU usage with 128 players. I noticed that some VPSes already are at 40% CPU load with a full 64 player server
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for my server it works, cpu is not fully used
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, some CPUs are more powerful than others
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean we have some running at 2 GHz, others at 4.4, that alone makes a big difference already
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So we stay at 64?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not sure. Do you also have client support to show 128 players?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, then I prefer 64 for now
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i dont use steam but i can just build the commit right
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> When I was testing around with 128 players because of the master connection issues, one cpu core was at ~90%
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> That's quite a lot...
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is player limit have to be power of two? can't we set it to smth like 96?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Introducing id mapping and tons of compatibility code just for a few more player =\
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 128player Back in Time would be nice af
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Maybe if the server can handle it we could allow it for some maps
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> 128 player team ranks :justatest:
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> oh yea
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> @cyberfighter you mean 64 players and 64 dummies
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> f4
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no, real players :justatest:
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751035010127233064/unknown.png
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron:
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie 🌈 texture for text rendering on GPU? or what is that?
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> texture bin packing that I ported to vanilla.
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, nice
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I removed texture resizing altogether by partitioning a fixed texture into multiple pages. and drop the page with least characters currently displaying when it is full
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> only vanilla would need this tho.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why not ddnet?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think you guys have pretty fast texture resizing already
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 🙂 Good!
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have heard 0 complaints about lags caused by text rendering in the last ~1 year
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> even now that we enabled CJK for all
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron: yeah, we don't have any complains for ddnet here in china as well
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll speak again if smone writes down the bible in tw xd
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in chinese
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> traditional
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but even than a 4096x4096 texture can probs handle insane amounts of characters
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should really test it just for fun xD
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> older gpu might have a limit of 2k tho
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can create a fifo for client and paste it in from the command line easily
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i test mine using this
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751036957546512444/test.cfg
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something like:
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `cat bible.txt | while read line; do echo "say \"$line\"" > client.fifo; done`
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something like:
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `cat bible.txt | while read line; do echo "say \"$line\"" > client.fifo; sleep 5; done`
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I might start working on proper IME again.
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe ddnet should increase the default texture size tho
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to 1024
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs that improves the packing
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> maybe just use 2k
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for latin 1024 is already too much
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont want to stress VRAM too much xd
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> sure
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I don't think my implementation would even works using only 1 page of 512.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 1024 with 4 pages can be filled really quick by going through settings and chat a bit under CJK
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, i just wonder how often this happen in real life xd
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs recreating is always cpu intensive probably
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if its not as horrible as pure vanilla
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :saddog:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751042612319748096/91881627-ad3ee680-ec79-11ea-99c4-5d9761d007cc.png
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> *spot the difference*
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like when i played a korean mmo someday and had to focus spotting the difference xd
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Ddnet has way more font sizes than vanilla :O
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> You store them all in one texture?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I know what to look for because my phone always gets the kanji wrong
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 丸
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> the main source of glyphs are actually just chats. so storing them all in one texture wouldn't be a huge problem practically i think
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://s12.directupload.net/images/200903/yarmlfdi.png
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 20000 characters with chat size on 2k resolution
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> might have to open in new tab
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i don't think that's 2k..
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its 8kx8k texture
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oh
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i googled and it said, even traditional chinese mostly only uses 20k glyphs
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron:
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides it's very unlikely that all 20k would ever be used in one session of teeworlds 😛
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw the client downscales if the texture is too huge for the GPU
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so even IF that ever happens it will just look shit xd
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i dropped mine to a fixed 1k. doesn't seems to have any problems.
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but i'll keep the paging just in case.
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> btw 丸 does not look the same under different locale
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751049780460912680/unknown.png
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its funny how well the name skyline algorithm fits the output
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 丸 is rendered however your renderer feels like rendering it most of the time
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's rather hard to get it to render the actual glyph you want 😛
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron: well depends on your system's locale font
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 刃 is an even worse offender
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie 🌈 btw might be interesing to know:
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://feedback.wildfiregames.com/report/opengl/feature/GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats 5 years old report and:
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 90% of all gpus support 8k+ textures
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the only "GPUs" that aren't atleast 2k are just software renderers from microsoft 😄
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Microsoft has 3 different fonts for the same style of glyphs.
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751051150240776243/92112949-7a663100-ede6-11ea-9164-46f986e18d67.png
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751051510611443712/unknown.png
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was reading up on slug a couple days ago. It's also quite interesting
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :EeveeShy: this is how I made it in vanilla
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is it in ddnet now?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> In practice the font texture in ddnet quickly grows to 2048*2048 (on wqhd). Might be good to increase the default size a bit
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> ddnet render SC only i think
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should probably fix that too
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think ddnet's fallback was made in a few hours?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> just check the language. and nuke the texture when the variant switches.
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> should be easy enough
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but font loading might need some works
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh now that I think about it, it doesn't matter all that much
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: yeah, it'll just look a bit weird for TC or JP people
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The things coming from chat will always be rendered with the clients language
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> they can still read them anyway
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, usually not much trouble
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but i would notice them if they are rendered in other variants
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> quite OCD triggering
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so i'm glad ddnet defaults to SC.
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :EeveeShy:
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 墨 kinda confuses me but that's the only one I can think of rn
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we could send a hint what each client prefers
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I was thinking that too
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix yes i agree
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and send messages/render names in that manner
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I doubt we want to keep all 4 fonts loaded all the time
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> don't do that actually
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess with the fallback that's no longer an issue
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> people will prefer reading glyphs in their way even it is in other languages
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> people will prefer reading glyphs in their way even if it is in other languages
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so client settings is enough
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 hm, I guess you'd know better
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One less thing to code 😄
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie 🌈 but we still need some default for people not having a language without chinese characters
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but ddnet only shows SC glyphs even if you're using japanese translation tho
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> just defaults to one of them
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> jp usually works for rest of the worlds
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> if they can't read CJK, they won't care anyway
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (maybe make that configurable in console)
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can adopt something similar to what you are doing for vanilla and that should be enough I guess
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> that would be great
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and a console setting that chooses glyph variant for people that are on a non CJK language)
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I so want to do the IME thing or the glyph variant thing, but I also need to learn about fourier transforms
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> (why did unicode has to unify the codepoint for different glyphs tho)
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk why unicode would do that tbf, they are soooooo verbose about everything
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> man in business suit levitating
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I would do the IME thing.
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the reason was: they wanted to fit everything in 65536 codepoints
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 do you have an idea in mind?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but I don't have any great ideas
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bad idea in hindsight
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> cuz SDL builtins just don't work
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> for TSF anyway
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> (on windows
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> don't know about linux/mac
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 huh, what's wrong with SDL? Does it not trigger the IME properly?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Chromium have some workaround. And I tried use imm.h directly
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> imm.h? that's for intel intrinsics, should'nt have anything to do with IMEs(?)
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a winapi header
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure that SDL can't figure out how to IME on windows?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> sdl_settextinputrect just use immsetcompositionwindow and forgets about it
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but that one doesn't work for all imes
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> some are only triggered by immsetcandidatewindow
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> some aren't triggered by either
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how fast was sdl to respond @Learath2?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and you'll have to fake a system carats sometimes
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but anyway, we can probably use an SDL fork until we mainline it
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still have 2 prs waiting on sdl 😄
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie 🌈 if it could be fixed in SDL, it would be best
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 link?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and another bug report that I even offered to fix, though no one really cared
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046>
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd asian languages are really to complicated. 26 characters are best xd
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: there are a million ways to implement IME supports. i guess it's hard to have one solution in SDL so they just gave up
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5130 This is the reason we can't compile on macOS Catalina
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> you can use imm stuff, but they usually don't work in fullscreen
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> you can handle messages and store the candidates yourself. but SDL can't render those under every context
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but then you'll run into whether the candidate windows are horizontal or vertical
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :EeveeShy:
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5068 This probably is a bad fix, but it's why we can't really do resizable windows but I did kinda work around it, we can have resizable windows on all platforms as soon as they merge 5130
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> just stuff
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5071 This is me asking for advice on the most SDL-ish way to handle apples odd IME
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> patches lingering for 4, 6 months
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They might be more responsive to windows issues though, larger userbase
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's make sure this won't happen in ddnet
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> SDL vs vanilla which is worse
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vanilla is okayish ATM
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still think they should have at least a second person merging PRs
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> (i'm not really asking.
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 so what is the correct way to trigger the most common IMEs on windows?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: all of them
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> together
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How would notepad trigger it, e.g.?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> notepad has windows's textinput context, so the carets are handled by the system.
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/7e279a29c6ff61e6132039d444a7fe066478d9f3/chrome/browser/ime_input.cc
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> maybe check this
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> chromium has some workarounds
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> if you are using any windows' forms, you probably don't need to handle IME like at all. but graphic program works quite differently. I think Value handles WM messages, store the candidates and render them in game.
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but their solution don't work for my IME
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe SDL can adopt some of these workarounds in chromium
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is github down?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> tbh, the most argent issue is that you need to block backspace when IME is activated.
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> people can still "try" to type without a candidate windows, but backspace deletes both the inline and composition.
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> which is annoying
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> opengl drivers are a mess... using 3.3 compatibility instead of 3.3 core halve the cpu usage (intel igpu) with latest windows drivers. On linux it does not make a difference
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki fine for me
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> also enter key does different things under different IME, which might be a problem too.
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 I think we should implement SDLs albeit not complete textediting thing first
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> yes
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Each text input on the screen should add themselves to a stack, when the stack is empty we disable textediting was what I was thinking
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix oh really? in the menu only or even ingame?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> some IME always have empty textedit string
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> lol
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> like mine
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and that's exactly what i did years ago
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and it got reverted cuz it broke some other languages that uses hidden ime. (which is using the IMM framework but types like a normal keyboard layout.)
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and it got reverted cuz it broke some other languages that uses hidden ime. (which are using the IMM framework but types like a normal keyboard layout.)
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, really?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> maybe my implementation is just broken
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but i did that before
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's very surprising, text editing being active shouldn't change anything for those languages
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd be a sdl issue, and it'd have been reported there
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Jupstar ✪ in the menu. Ingame it does not make a huge difference, but it's harder to measure there since the usage stays below 10% anyway
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 which language was it breaking?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> probably a shitty driver implementation
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix ah ok, then its probs bcs it alows CPU streamen more effectivly
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix ah ok, then its probs bcs it alows CPU streaming more effectivly
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think in 3.3 core it really trys hard to act like you only create VRAM, but on an iGPU i actually expect it to be on CPU memory
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> well in ddnet it's the same code just with another opengl context
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so strange
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I actually forgot, it's been a while
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also how is your IME even supposed to work with an empty textedit string? What is the client even supposed to render if not the textedit string?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it do it's own rendering in a overlay?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751060033588166746/unknown.png
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> you render nothing but still blocks input
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, what an odd choice
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> the mesa driver on linux seems to be really new. Works better there
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does it behave in fullscreen applications?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but i think chinese is the only offender in that regard
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> zh-tw, jp and kr always use on-the-spot input
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> > How does it behave in fullscreen applications?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> @Learath2 doesn't show up at all
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just odd to me that ch doesn't atleast put something in the textedit string
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not like it hurts
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> some ch ime do
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> mine doesn't tho
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> probably just ignore this type of IME
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> not majority anyway
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way to work with that kind anyway
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it even give away it's candidate list so we can try to render it ourselves?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I have my own input schema, so this one is the only one i can use
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> > Does it even give away it's candidate list so we can try to render it ourselves?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> @Learath2 the default IME made by microsoft are guaranteed to send candidates messages to application i think
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but I think a lot of third party one can't
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> come up with your own input schema is actually quite fun
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> building the word dictionary and design your sound/shape layout
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron:
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we can somehow get the contents of the entire IME window and render it ourselves 😛
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751061871976644658/layout.png

14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> how is this possible? xd
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Rus1 ddnet
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> > I wonder if we can somehow get the contents of the entire IME window and render it ourselves 😛
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> @Learath2 Valve can so i guess it is possible
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Dota2 and csgo renders candidates list themselves
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 doesn't valve just render the list itself?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the entire thing. I was thinking of letting the IME take care of rendering itself and we just mirror it's window buffer
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oh
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> that might be too ambitious.
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Easier than rendering the candidate list and the compositions ourselves I'd wager
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but I suppose it would require some wizard stuff like how obs window capture works.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> the IME windows is not a texture in anyway i suppose.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> even then it might be occluded and therefore can not be captured anyway.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @Learath2 isn't flooding fixed?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> (you can't fix people's boredom/bigotry tho)
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @m!ki it was for a long time
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay I think all major IMEs on all platforms support getting the candidates out
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can implement SDLs meh method for now, then I'll look into either getting a patch to SDL to allow getting candidates cross platform or just handle it in tw
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I'll wait :troll:
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we had something like nuklear or imgui in tw, it'd be much easier actually
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :nervous:
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm more concerned about rendering this thing and not writing a one off like everyone else
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :nervous: might as well just rewrite a client using other engines.
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just for an IME candidate window?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> make a new game
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> get on steam again
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> lol
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The tough part is already being done by the IME, rendering it's candidates isn't as hard as you are making it out to be
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron: I don't think it is hard. I'm just saying what I've observed
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only observation relevant here would be the fact that I'm very lazy
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046>
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751067371225088040/layout.png
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron: this is how I type chinese
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 how fluent are you writing in chinese on a computer?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> pretty ok
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And handwriting?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> bad
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> actually i might not be able to write at all at this point
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it's been years since I've hold a pen
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Been the case for everyone I've met that uses CJK. Seems handwriting is dying in asia
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> my mom feels the same way and she started to practice handwriting about a year ago.
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I don't have that much dedication
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i wouldn't say it is necessarily dying as long as education are still teaching handwriting.
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I understand why it's dying though. It's quiiite a challange knowing all the necessary glyphs and their stroke orders
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 well if people forget it after they graduate, it is dying imho
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> there are bound to be some people that are less tech savvy who can actually write since they are used to writing.
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> or even take notes ocationally
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah, older people especially are doing much better
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i guess if you met people online they are likely to be less capable of handwriting
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, mostly people I met irl I've asked
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oof
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Younger folk though, so it could be the case that older people that are less integrated with tech would be doing better off
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i would love to go back and practice handwriting tho. but you know.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> laziness
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> stroke orders are such a bitch tho
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> my input schema use strokes to reduce candidates
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do an hour of kanji in the morning, 30 minutes of anki, 30 minutes of writing the 50 kanji I'm the worst with
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I've only know some of the order because I was making this
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, how do you encode strokes in an input schema?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> kanji usually don't have curves. so there are only like 7 categories.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> for strokes
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and you may just input the storke.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> or you can enter the sound first then use storke to filter out some
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What would you qualify as a stroke?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 乛 一 丨 丿 丶
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I see what you mean now
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That makes a a lot of sense actually
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but there are shape based method too
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751070582585688124/600px-Wubi86_keyboard_layout.png
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> I don't know how to use these, but you can probably imagine combining parts together to get a character
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like radicals
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i don't know what's the actually definition of radicals tho
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i don't know what's the actual definition of radicals tho
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been wondering about how some han characters with simple meanings changed meanings when the japanese adopted them
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> like how simple tho
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> characters don't usually change meaning anyway when they are pairs with others
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g 汁
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> characters *usually* change meaning anyway when they are pairs with others
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's still similar enough, but it'd be soup in japanese, more like juice in chinese iirc
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So why would the japanese decide to use the character for juice as soup? 😄
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> vegetable juice in jp still use  汁 i think
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> the soup one in chinese, is bath water lol
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 汤
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> the soup one in chinese, is bath water in jp lol
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> pretty gross if you think about it
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :EeveeShy:
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> well more like hot water but bath use that as well since it is technically the same
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> seems bath is only similar 湯 not the same
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it's the same for us.
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> just write differently
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> since ours are simplified
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, yes there is that too 😄
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> we still recognize that as the same chars.
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and probably why people don't usually have trouble reading both trad and simp
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> mentally it still works for some reason
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean, they probably chose the simplified chars very carefully so it's not hard to recognize
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think they made some rules to cover the majority and then manually simplified some uncommon ones
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think most characters are simplified based on radicals
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and some different radicals are combined into a single simplified one.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so we have less characters in general
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> But I wouldn't actually know. nobody teach these lol
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I have to go, learn more about fourier transforms
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nice chat o/
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :yes:
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funny enough, linux seems to be the worst when it comes to getting IME candidates
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lemme guess
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are 5 incompatible ways of doing IME on linux?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wayland introduced two more?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3 incompatible ways, XIM, GTK IM, QT IM. None of those provide a way to get the candidate list
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 3 most common frameworks (fcitx, ibus, scim) implemented on top of those do have a way to get the candidate list out of though
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be great if XIM had the concept of candidates at all
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and all of this is veeeery horribly documented too
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay i cant use github for some reason
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it simply doesnt respond

16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fcking clown isp
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this must be affecting lot of companies tbh
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they use github
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is it possible to see ingame messages in steam chat? (like in dota2)
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which way do you want?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think you can see ingame messages in steam in dota2
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but steam messages in dota2 are possible I think
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea thats possible
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can even reply
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can we implement it for teeworlds?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I just tried it. I started dota and type /w "My_Friend_Name" 123. When I exited the game this message was in the steam chat
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but if I send something via steam chat its not in game chat for some reason
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Integrating it with our /w might not be the best idea
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially since you can change names on steam easily, so you can hijack whispers
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nah, you can not send messages to not your friends tho
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> what I want is just receive message in steam chat if some one whispered me
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so I can read it on my phone
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't sound possible (ingame whisper → steam)
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dota doesn't have native whispers, you can only whisper via steam there
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > I just tried it. I started dota and type /w "My_Friend_Name" 123. When I exited the game this message was in the steam chat
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>  I used "native". Or what you mean by native?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> self hosted best https://git.ryozuki.xyz/ u will never get blocked by a evil isp :justatest:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can get steam messages ingame though, should be relatively simple
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki if you get blocked you have no recurse, unlike github ^^
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym by recurse
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> recourse
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its unlikely they would block a unknown self hosted repo
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm getting more and more pissed the more I read ibus' documentation. How could someone come up with a api this horrendous is beyond me
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently this github problem is recurrent with movistar
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they had this before
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my domain (heinrich5991.de) somehow ended up on a school blacklist in germany
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and here i was wanting to program in rust but without being able to see github this is painful
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cargo update --offline I think?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try a vpn if you have one
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you only want to look at github, tor would also work
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye i have tor
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does cargo update depend on github?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it does
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz the command is hanging xd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. try cargo update --offline
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki if you have a vps somewhere you can tunnel through
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh true
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i have my vps
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ❯ cargo update --offline

17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cargo build --offline?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw, I'm very happy with wireguard, excellent roaming capabilities
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that works
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 nice. I like software that supports roaming
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel the china pain rn
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine this daily
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> guess you would have set up a vpn by now in china
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :f3:
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I also love how wireguard is a silent protocol
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it udp?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> silent = no traffic while nothing happens?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems to be at odds with roaming
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man i rly hate isps, on twitter 100 ppl complaining about this, and the only thing the twitter guy do is ask for id number, phone number and a tracert (he assumes i use windows lol)
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pisses me off
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> udp yeah, and yeah no traffic while nothing happens
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so no chance of roaming succeeding when the client changes IP address but the server has new traffic
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it does a handshake again when it changes ip
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how would it know?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when behind NAT e.g.
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> behind a NAT you already need keepalives so the firewall doesn't close the connection on you
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ohh
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> true
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> goodbye silent protocols
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks nat
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish we would hurry up with deploying ipv6 :/
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like NAT at all
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but ipv6 doesn't solve this issue in consumer routers
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they dont even know why they block a ip they wont know how to do that lmao
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they still have a stateful firewall
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could give each client an ip of its own
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ipv6 is meant to be allocated as rather large subnets per end site
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but consumer routers still firewall you off incoming connections, for security
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you can run your windows xp without being infected the moment you plug it in
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does ipv6 help handle ddos better?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that question doesn't make sense(?)
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i guess
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Irrelevant, maybe a little worse as it's a tad tougher to route
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its tougher to route?
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be easier to route
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i thought
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because of more space for sensible routing
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah maybe sensible prefixes will help
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though if we allocate as we've been allocating for v4 it'd be tougher to route
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> more bytes to check
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, there seems to be no way to get the candidate list/lookup table from ibus
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what Valve did for that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to open tor
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen about the kill and pause buttons, i thought time ago to add a Button with name "Commands" and it is a dropdown with most common used commands
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kill pause lock etc
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Back in high school I had a chat about tor with a math teacher of mine, he said anyone contributing to it is also contributing to the distribution of drugs and child pornography. Odd guy, couldn't understand that just because something is used for malicious purposes doesn't mean it shouldn't exist
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw america contributes to tor funding i think
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the CIA?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so by that argument
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the CIA is contributing
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to drugs and child pronography
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well LEAs own a lot of the drug and cp trade on the deepweb too, so they directly contribute too 😄
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> adding a dropdown also would be easier
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont have to adjust
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for different resolutions
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't have dropdowns in the UI code though, I think
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can make it
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well you can
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im blocked
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsamazingman:
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why another msg
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pause state?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt ddnet network character have
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> m_paused and m_spec
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, does
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2720/files#diff-4c1480841d96bf73e07b29e10fbd394bR441
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its funny that the embed loads
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know the black magick here
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> serverside
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohhh
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 140.82.114.3
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is one of the github.com ips
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i added it to hosts file
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and now i have access
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe your dns broke then?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they blocked 140.82.121.4, 140.82.121.3
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they only blocked those 2
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it must be smth about the load balancer
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i just force this ip
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 there are many ways to get an invalid name in client, I'm wondering how best to fix them
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anything with complex unicode and longer than 16 chars will be invalid
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like copy-paste, steam name, automatic dummy name, entering it directly maybe?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah no, direct entering is not possible
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, and reading from config file
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I think a function on `Packer` would be easiest
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> our model of strings unfortunately doens't include utf8-ness
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds very general for something so specific
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at every point in our string handling, we can introduce broken utf-8
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> str_copy, str_format, etc.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `AddStringFixUTF8` which replaces broken utf-8 with replacement characters would probably work
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess the exactly went to the message bfore the latest
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd envision that `AddStringFixUTF8` as a new function on packer, alternatively rewrite the existing `AddString` function so that it always fixes utf-8
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try to do it in the packer
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shouldn't it always be valid utf8?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 any concerns about changing `AddString`?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I see what you mean, I can't think of any
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because at the moment many people with CJK names in steam can't join our servers
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or can't join dummy
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but these should see the update, right?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because steam
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess one disadvantage is that it will be a bit slower
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and checking things we in theory could know are correct already
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Quite a bit, the only other way would be to make sure we never have broken strings in the first place
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, but that would also have quite a lot of overhead
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could ofc also fix str_copy, str_format
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure which has more
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that all our strings are always utf-8
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that solution also takes more time to implement
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and isn't guaranteed to be any better performance-wise)
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the string copy functions would only have to check at the end
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they truncated
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so probably more performant
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but much more complicated to introduce
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making a dropdown with the current UI code style sucks
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its just dobutton
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 has them I think
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no owner
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can steal that
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> booo 0.7
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The UI changes they made are mostly good
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The UI library had some very stupid stuff
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would rework cmenus along with ui.h completly
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but to much work
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u would never finish it
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love factorio UI

18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 The AddString code looks scary to me, don't think I want to break something there
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I really can't find a good solution here
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm looking at fixing `AddString`
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Google thinks my very german ip is in the united arab emirates
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep getting prices in dirhem
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> device setting maybe?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> What dependencies are required for a server-only build?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I already found: python, openssl, zlib
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I don't know about: sdl2, freetype2, opusfile, curl, glew, wavpack, pnglite, ffmpeg, libnotify, miniupnpc, sqlite
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sqlite  is required
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> That's it, or there could be more?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that's it
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen change

21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @nori you have better ideas?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yes, very simple tutorial with something like gifs would be awy better
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @nori even with a tutorial, these buttons seem useful
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i already see ppl wanting to hit spec and kill the team xD
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs used to it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> yeah put the buttons on the right of connect dummy
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, they're much less useful than "spectate"
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean u go into team, stop playing (in a raid) and then kill instead of spectate xd
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a raid?
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think we have raids in ddnet
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i ser noobs accidentally hitting Spectate after 60 min of racing when i tell them to pause and look behind
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well only nobos will use buttons
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly want to bind spec
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and kill
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> you cant bind the join spectators thing right
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in teams with 10ppl
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> wait whats the bind
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao ill kill myself any time i want to connect dummy
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Cuz i dont use bind yet
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @abcqwerty I think `team -1`
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :O
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a friend who played a bit
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he went into settings after pressing esc
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> but that seems like a bad bind to accidentally press
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then he wanted to close the menu
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of pressing esc
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he pressed the X
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and closed the game
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Remove the spectate button completely?
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @abcqwerty like kill? ^^
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Oh wait it is useful in vanilla
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Nvm
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> removing it completely might still work for ddnet
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> kill has kill protection
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and show it in vanilla)
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think closing the client should have always the popup question
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> is there spectate protection
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast if u are in a server
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> playing
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki it has the question when you have kill protection
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but people confuse it
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with closing the menu
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps it should be red, or say quit?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> say quit maybe
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> Does the client know if it's in a race?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should, the auto recorder gets it from somewhere
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> maybe we should apply a team leader to teams (the first one to be there) that is the only one who can kill the whole team because usually he is also the one who is supposed to have strong.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Also there should be an /unlock command or something? Because sometimes when someone is falling down in the void everyone is writing/Pressing /lock and then all die
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think there is an unlock command already
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /lock 0
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /unlock I think
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :O
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> konsti banned from being captain
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, /unlock
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> nice
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> /uninvite :troll: :troll:
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and thats why they just go spec, bcs its easier and safer
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @deen sqlite is runtime ou buildtime dependency for DDNet Server?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @RafaelFF both
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Thanks!
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently RafaelFF != Ryozuki
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Yep, different people, but both maintainers of Arch Linux's DDNet packages.
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the new fullscreen default instantly destroyed my resolution
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure whether to report or not
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 what do you mean by destroyed?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, since you upgraded and had a resolution set already
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> new players get their screen resolution, but existing players didn't
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe a bit too late to fix now :/
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a multimonitor setup
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it managed to set the 2560x1440 to 1280x768
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1280x768 is none of my screens
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it led to some weird scrolling effect
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> scrolling the screen when I go near the edges
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Was 1280x768 the resolution you had your window set to before?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> that scrolling effect releated with x server, happened to me before
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a tiling WM, I used it windowed. not sure what resolution was set
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> with gfx_resizeable
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do I find the resolution?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gfx_screen_width/height
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's now set to 2560x1440, but I'm not sure it was like this before I fixed it
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably not, I experienced the same resolution change
