19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> If you tag something as hd in the editor, it only shows up if HD is enabled. Would it be possible to have an option that makes something disappear if HD is enabled?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Would be useful to give foreground stuff like freeze a different design for default and HD.
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @mind have 2 layers, top one HD freeze bottom one non HD freee
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> doesnt work with transparency
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and dont think such a feature is possible
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> compat fucks it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u really want just put a whole HD design layer and a whole non HD design layer lmao
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with a quad in between
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but at that point it's just wasting space
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but at that point it's just
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> it doesn't work for foreground
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> the quad would be in front of your tee then
