11:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 1. wrong channel - use #✉-create-a-ticket 
11:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 2. dont ping discord mods for ingame moderation
11:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 3. dont ping mods directly
11:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 4. why did you choose #developer ? :D
11:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> also - good morning
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tickets are currently broken
11:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> a - gg
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh mah gawd chiller gets his PR's merged
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> :POGGIES:
11:13 < bridge> <egyt> So many issues and PRs going on!
12:43 < bridge> <egyt> 3 left to report, and two of them are nitpicks
12:43 < bridge> <egyt> Three left to report, and two of them are nitpicks
13:15 < bridge> <egyt> Well, I wanted to say that I have two left, but now I have one left
13:16 < bridge> <egyt> Although, the semicolons... yeah...
13:43 < bridge> <egyt> So, I'm done with nitpicking
13:45 < bridge> <egyt> Back to translating...
13:52 < bridge> <egyt> Crazy stuff
14:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there a name for an action when compiler takes int literals for example and tries to find a type which can hold both. Example, `-5 + 5` so if you look at them separately it would be i8 and u8, but when you try to add them the common type would be i8
14:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Confetti being merged in under a week is slightly unsettling
14:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> Integer Promotions ?
14:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> idk if that's it but ill call it like that :YEP:
14:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
14:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In the meantime I am waiting for a response in the colored broadcast pr since a month @heinrich5991
14:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
14:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but it's more fun than when it gets merged in a few days, amirite
14:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And spent a hour today again solving bugs caused by merges in the 0.7 pr which is also waiting for reviews since months
14:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Stale prs seriously bother me
14:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> but you just got 2 merged didnt you? :P
14:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye the boring ones
14:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
14:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And they all took way longer than 5 days
14:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 27 days to fix clang spamming warnings
14:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Vs 5 days of adding a new confetti net message
14:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> go to #✉-create-a-ticket and complain why ur prs take so long to merge :justatest:
14:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> when bridge create a ticket
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> C calls them the "usual arithmetic conversions"
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I understand stuff takes time and nobody gets paid here. And if one would ask me to check some pr it might take 2 years or more.
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But then there seems to be some priority of prs that get reviews faster that I don’t understand which annoys me. I always make time to respond to feedback within 24 hours just to get ghosted for weeks again.
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> The trick to getting faster reviews is not working on controversial stuff
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How is colored broadcast that much more controversial than confetti?
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or fixing clang warnings
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> There is much more to chat about how colored broadcasts should be made and handled
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 1 month ghosted on the most controversial debug print xd
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> You feel as if your prs get a higher level of scrutiny, which annoys you. That is understandable. But you also commonly port stuff from 0.7 which only one developer here really cares about
14:44 < bridge> <learath2> That is imo what is increasing your average review times
14:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8341
14:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I improved the usefulness of existing particles
14:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Highly controversial
14:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t get it
14:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s also not 0.7 and Heinrich refuses to answer my questions here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8331
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> 8341 looks like it got reviewed. You just don't like the reviews
14:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea but how is that controversial?
14:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And confetti isn’t?
14:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s way less intrusive
14:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think thats because confetti is a cosmetic, and "using amount of snow flakes as unfreeze time indicator" affects the visual timing of unfreeze
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The original author of the snowflakes was too lazy to add a fading out. I fixed that. How is that controversial
14:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think thats because confetti is a cosmetic and doesnt change anything gameplay wise, and "using amount of snow flakes as unfreeze time indicator" affects the visual timing of unfreeze
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes. Before it was uselessly random now it is actually helpful.
14:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> how to spot a chillerdragon PR:
14:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
14:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
14:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> 300 comments
14:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246808455273119804/image.png?ex=665dbc5c&is=665c6adc&hm=edfa7b88fd47a818f173ab3e6fc5c56500cef2b6a9e0a80e2aa1ff2c62972d8b&
14:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am thinking of implementing https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8358 but I don’t wanna maintain another stale pr.
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> Robyt3's review there sounds perfectly sensible to me. Random position, size and low contrast make this not very good UI/UX
14:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh wow the 0.7 client support has the most comments ever received on 5.2K PR's :o
14:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It fits the style I wanted to make it less controversial by keeping it as is
14:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Surely we can make it a big snowflake at the same position every time. I would be in. But that’s not what would be merged either.
14:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When the snowflakes were introduced the fade out effect was forgotten or someone was too lazy to implement that. I would call my pr a non controversial quality improvement.
14:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Source? I'd rather consider that the author also didn't like the bad UI/UX of this
14:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I tend to be spammy. And I opened it with the first draft hoping to get a merge on the network code before I start working on all the features. But the review phase took 2 years so I just finished it all in the meantime
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk who the author is. No hate. I just think that the snow flakes as particle who replaced damage indicators should also fade out. I don’t see how them fading out could be problematic in any way. So I assumed the snowflakes were unfinished.
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nobody disagreed with that in the issue I opened for it
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In 2 years
14:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nobody of the maintainers\* codedev did but he just says the freezebar covers it. Imagine me opening a pr back in the days removing the damage indicators and saying the armor covers it xd
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, you are not getting extra scrutiny is my point. Your small prs get merged just as quickly as everyone elses. Then you drop a bomb like add 6k lines for 0.7 support on client. Of your open prs, 1 is a sweeping format change, 1 is a massive change that only 2 people want, 3 are changes we feel are not exactly the best way to do things but fixes your mods, 4 are drafts, 3 are ui changes that imo needs discussion, 2 to support 0.7
15:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.7 pr would be much smaller if it were partially merged as I requested it
15:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And I’m not saying all my prs should be merged in 5 days
15:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just the ones that are comparable with something so critical as adding confetti
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> It's easy to merge confetti. That's why confetti is merged quickly. It's isolated. It looked fine. It's implemented properly
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Of all your open prs, I could only see 8307 and 8342 that are no brainers to merge
15:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t understand how confetti is easier than fading out an effect
15:07 < bridge> <robyt3> #7588 also seems fine
15:07 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7588
15:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How can fading out an animation be problematic
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> It's not that's you are fading out the snowflakes, it that you try to add meaning to it in a way that's bad UI/UX design.
15:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Worse than not trying at all?
15:11 < bridge> <robyt3> I like the other idea better so I don't see a reason to go halfway on a design I consider bad.
15:11 < bridge> <robyt3> > > A top to bottom melting ice cube would be much nicer in my opinion. Something that is integrated into the game world should not be a hud element but fit the environment.
15:11 < bridge> <robyt3> > That's a cool idea. I would generally support such a design. For the last 3-5 seconds there could also be a special shaking animation to indicate exact seconds and/or an "ice-cracking" sound effect every second. I suppose that could satisfy those who want the exact one second visual/acoustic timing that the freeze stars gave them (#6028).
15:11 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6028
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think we in general need a better timing indicator, once used to the freeze-bar made timing easier for me personally - but something like this:

15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6028#issuecomment-1412890901
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> seems much better than

15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ>

15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> seems much better than ticking down the amount of stars, making them hardly visible
15:13 < bridge> <learath2> As I said in this PR I'm open to getting something in which reintroduces the damage indictator style particles. In a proper way, using a freeze flake instead
15:13 < bridge> <Iza> what if the freeze bar was blinking in intervals of a second?
15:13 < bridge> <learath2> By proper way, I mean no hacking around with server commands
15:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well I’m not opening another big pr again for ice cubes. And I still think the bad ux is better than no ux and it also looks nicer if it fades out,
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> i am against that
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> > heinrich5991: Perhaps it would help to make the bar flash on each whole second?
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> > 
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> > Charin: Please don't. However, adding some marks in the freeze bar may help?
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> Ice cubes are very hard to do
15:15 < bridge> <Iza> idk the stars were doing something similair so i dont see how you wouldn't want that
15:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How is reusing the death effect for a finish animation good design. If fading out isn’t xd
15:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
15:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So it won’t happen
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> Just the fading out would have been merged in 10 minutes
15:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s what I did no?
15:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe the thing actually keeping your PR from beeing merged is the way you named it :kek:
15:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe the thing actually keeping your PR from beeing merged is the way you named it :kek: (this is meant as a joke and i don mean any harm)
15:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe the thing actually keeping your PR from beeing merged is the way you named it :kek: (this is meant as a joke and i dont mean any harm)
15:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So what did I do wrong then?
15:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I faded them out
15:20 < bridge> <learath2> That's not fading out. You are decreasing their amount and adding meaning to them
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> Actually I'll tag myself out of this discussion because it's giving me a headache. Merge it, don't merge it, idk.  I think it's useless at the thing you intend them for. Someone should still look into bringing back a clear indicator of pace
15:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would consider decreasing amount fading out. But ok sure let’s end the discussion I’m tired. I just wanted to say that I am a bit upset and the open prs make me feel bad and that’s why I would like to avoid opening new ones.
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> If there are any prs that you haven't received feedback for. I'd be more than happy to look them over
15:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Robsti reviews everything
15:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He is so nice and he also looks into the big ones and never creates stale prs
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> denying prs is hard but should be done to avoid steering projects into a wrong way
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
15:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would prefer denial over stale to death
15:28 < bridge> <learath2> I'm starting to appreciate why oy was doing "wontfix" and just closing prs left and right
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s clear
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lerato you could review my 0.7 pr hehe
15:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you rebase 7588 ? Seems fine to merge it
15:30 < bridge> <learath2> You don't want me reviewing anything with 0.7 in it
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This pr should have been closed weeks ago together with the corresponding issue  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8307
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am the worst maintainer
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 when ping
15:34 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, can we do this some other day? I have to go out and meet someon, then idk when I'll get back home
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes but that other day i finished the stuff anyway
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am at a speedrun
15:40 < bridge> <lerizan> Chill
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I invented chill
15:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 this actually causes ddnet client being unable to join many servers
15:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> as it seems
16:15 < bridge> <robyt3> If those servers also don't send `CNetMsg_Sv_ReadyToEnter` then they'll have to fix that on their side, otherwise this will also cause other issues on the client-side if this message is missing
16:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This is de-facto breaking backwards compatibility, since many servers 1. don't know about this and 2. not every source is open probably
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> do you know what mods are broken? I'd think servers that have stuff like theme changes is very rare
16:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i've just seen people report they cant connect to specific servers and/or map mismatches and i've had that myself a few times
16:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think more niche mods, like mmotee
16:33 < bridge> <louis> i have a newbie question about game networking in general, if anyone has insights: if i have a pve scenario where untrustworthy clients aren't too much of a problem, would predicting client positions ahead of time server-side and doing calculations with predicted position make sense? (and later on adding some sort of anticheat for fishy inputs) -- I want the client to have as smooth of an experience as possible without too much compromise
16:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea if hacking is not a problem go with the Minecraft approach. It feels blazingly smooth with basically no internet connectivity required.
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> if you trust the client, run the simulation on the client, then sync the results to the server, it'll be butter smooth
16:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Let the client do all game logic locally and then just inform the server of the new state on a „trust me bro“ basis. It will be lag free and simple. But when you then want to avoid people using teleportation and speed hacks you will get a bit of a messy situation.
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> The only issue is if there are multiple players you'll need to figure out a way for the server to resolve conflicts
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> e.g. client A shoots monster, kills it, client B on their screen shoots same monster, kills it, who killed the monster?
16:39 < bridge> <louis> it is multiple players -- also a bit confused on whether i need to predict enemy ai on clientside or not (if enemy A with deterministic AI shoots a bullet at player B, should player A predict the bullet being shot), since i need to do all collision calculation server side
16:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you trust your players don’t collision calculate server side hehe
16:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s like paint ball. Rely on players saying „hit“
16:41 < bridge> <louis> xd
16:41 < bridge> <louis> well i want to trust player's movement + location since that has less chot potential than just ignoring anytime they get hit
16:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are untrustworthy clients a problem now or not? Xd
16:42 < bridge> <louis> i guess i wasnt clear, i want to trust them half only on the things that aren't super chot worthy
16:42 < bridge> <louis> not sure if that makes sense
16:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So teleportation is not bad?
16:43 < bridge> <louis> it is, but i could solve that with anticheat
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, this is not an easy problem when the source of truth is different for different properties of an entity
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> but anyway, I would first not predict anything, establish who is authoritative on what and how state gets propagated and conflicts resolved
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> After that you add in prediction where things are not smooth. Ai shots depend on the game but I'd think wouldn't need much prediction if your projectiles are fast and the server is authoritative on projectiles
16:46 < bridge> <louis> ye i guess ill have to go from simple to more complex
16:46 < bridge> <louis> it's a bullet hell so character position + bullet position needs to be close to truth as possible client-side
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> On your first question, idk, it depends again on how you want it to feel. If you predict on the server, but the client has stopped on their own screen and get shot, it'll feel wrong
16:48 < bridge> <louis> for that problem i was thinking to just undo the previous tick's collisions if client input changes and server has to predict a position in the opposite direction
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> What if client input arrives too late?
16:49 < bridge> <louis> yep that's a problem too, i guess just predict for however many ticks late it is, if a client is consistently late maybe flag it thru the anticheat somehow
16:49 < bridge> <louis> but then the client and server could desync as well if it's too late / something got dropped
16:51 < bridge> <louis> in that case maybe the server can just force the client position to its predicted position and client corrects itself? shouldn't be a problem except for laggy players
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> Why do you want to predict the client position on the server?
16:52 < bridge> <louis> i want the relative player-enemy-bullet layout on the client to match the relative player-enemy-bullet layout on the server
16:53 < bridge> <louis> so i believe the server would either have to keep track of the previous x ticks of each bullet and calculate collision based on each player's ping or predict each player's movements x ticks in advanced with ground truth bullet position
17:03 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I think I get it, that does sound sensible. The server is technically behind the clients, it has not received all the inputs necessary to know what will happen this tick. So it can instead do it's thing on a predicted state, then you can retroactively fix up any mistakes the prediction made.
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think I'd bother though, just have the server run behind and have the client predict, retroactively fixing game state is expensive
17:13 < bridge> <texnonik> idea for moderator in game force swap with blocker and then banning that person , to save tees that he blocked .

21:15 < bridge> <egyt> Or you would have gotten a bad translation for non-\\DDrace 😅
21:15 < bridge> <egyt> Or you would have gotten a bad translation for non-DDrace 😅
21:24 < bridge> <egyt> Had to shorten "\<color> team" to just "\<color plural adjective>" (it makes sense!) and "Switch to \<color plural adjective>" to just "To \<color plural adjective>" (it ***kinda*** makes sense..!)
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> type inference
21:34 < bridge> <zhn> oh you should definitely check both previous ukranian (on 0.7) and russian translations
21:36 < bridge> <egyt> I won't check russian translation
21:37 < bridge> <zhn> half of your translations problems come from not checking other slavic translations smh
21:37 < bridge> <egyt> Wrong
21:38 < bridge> <egyt> Also, I checked old Ukrainian translation and it is bad
21:38 < bridge> <egyt> Won't even check russian
21:38 < bridge> <egyt> Won't even check russian xD
21:38 < bridge> <egyt> Won't even check russian, I suspect it's the same xD
21:38 < bridge> <zhn> ok
21:40 < bridge> <egyt> It says "For red" and "For blue", which is confusing
21:40 < bridge> <egyt> Whoops, wrong reply
21:41 < bridge> <egyt> It says "For red" and "For blue", which creates a confusion
21:42 < bridge> <zhn> ye, [play] for red/blue
21:43 < bridge> <zhn> pretty straightforward, actually sounds like [play] as red/blue
21:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anticheat is a losing game
21:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> don't think that exists
21:45 < bridge> <egyt> less straightforward than "Go to red/blue team", and that's how I translated it
21:46 < bridge> <zhn> can't really say if there something better than "[играть] За красных" with same width
21:46 < bridge> <egyt> less straightforward than "Go to red/blue team", (that's how I translated it)
21:47 < bridge> <egyt> imho Russian shouldn't tell Ukrainian how to make Ukrainian translation
21:47 < bridge> <egyt> less straightforward than "[Go] to red/blue team", (that's how I translated it)
21:47 < bridge> <zhn> wdym, i say that about russian translation, not about ukrainian
21:48 < bridge> <egyt> ^
21:48 < bridge> <egyt> "К красньім"
21:48 < bridge> <egyt> even less letters
21:49 < bridge> <zhn> i said that because i translated and retranslated almost all ddnet related lines in russian and happened to suffer from same thing you recall there
21:49 < bridge> <zhn> i didn't touch teeworlds related lines since theyre perfect and iconic for me at least
21:49 < bridge> <egyt> i better log off or that might escalate
21:50 < bridge> <zhn> theres nothing to escalate huh
22:21 < bridge> <learath2> @murpi #bot-cmds perhaps that message should also be privately sent
22:29 < bridge> <egyt> Hm, what if Esperanto becomes source language so there is no confusion for translators (Esperanto words always have only one meaning, I heard)
22:29 < bridge> <egyt> 
22:29 < bridge> <egyt> /hj
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how about we invent a new language called teelang
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> ^
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mimimi
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> i speak in 😠
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> :ouch:

22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my normal conversation
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on ddnet
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> f4 far
22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> i dont trust no language invented by a ophthalmologist!
22:34 < bridge> <egyt> Yet you trust translations made by random people on The Web :^)
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mi mmimimi mi
22:36 < bridge> <egyt> btw, does teelang has tones?
22:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> thats because translations are human readable ? - i dont care if a translation is wrong, and if it is, i propose a change
