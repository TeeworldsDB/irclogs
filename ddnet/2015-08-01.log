02:52 <@deen> heinrich5991: why does it say TW is incompatible with greenlight? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130194014
02:52 <@deen> oh wait, that's the wrong one
02:53 <@deen> mybad
03:15 < uchar> fake?
03:20 <@deen> not "fake", but not made by the main developers

11:35 < Chairn> hello people
11:37 <@EastByte> hello Chairn 
11:37 < Chairn> i have a small question
11:38 < Chairn> the function loadPNG in CGraphics, the variable storage type, i put IStorage::TYPE_ALL, but where does it look for the file?
11:40 < Chairn> i guess that it looks into data folder
11:40 < Chairn> but im not sure about the usage for int storagetype
11:44 <@EastByte> there are multiple folders loaded in CStorage
11:44 <@EastByte> I think it does some kind of search

12:58 < Shiki> sup guys
12:58 <@deen> hi Shiki
12:59 < Shiki> I'm not a c++ kind of guy myself so I'd like to know if it's actually ok to use static local variables in functions or maybe there is a better way to achieve the same functionality?
12:59 < Shiki> here's an example: https://github.com/nzyuzin/ddnet/blob/06c4470081b82d50db5a9dce2fc8310be72f59a2/src/game/client/components/camera.cpp#L133
12:59 <@deen> well, I wouldn't consider TW to be C++
12:59 <@deen> it's C with the object orientation of C++
12:59 <@deen> so let's use it like that
13:00 <@deen> and static local vars are common style in TW/DDNet source
13:00 < Shiki> yeah, I've seen that before, that's why I came up with this solution
13:00 < Shiki> otherwise I'd use class variable, but that's a simpler way
13:01 < Shiki> still I'm curious about how elegant it's considered in comparison with other approaches :)
13:02 <@deen> i think it's ok, at least it puts the variable definition in the location where it's used
13:02 <@deen> better than specifying it in the header
13:04 < Shiki> ok, thanks
