06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how can i fix this
08:10 <+ChillerDragon> if i knew the name i would straight up told you but i forgot it @heinrich5991 the folks from the minecraft paper community use it its some smaller self made thing but it aims to be fully featured
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Didn't know this existed - very useful to see the performance numbers. Alright so the load on the server isn't bad at all. Would then only help with latency.
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> You could have a distributed memcache, but very much an overkill here and doubt it is possible with the given infrastructure. Few options:
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - A flattened storage/table to track the more heavy queries. This will solve for consistency across servers.
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - A cache per server where you don't solve for real-time consistency:
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> ** Unlikely for certain queries to change minute-by-minute
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> ** Unlikely that two servers will be on the same map impacting the same query
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> ** Refresh cache after X period or other
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - Move database behind an API with external servers making queries to it. 
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> That said, non of the above options are worth it seeing that a relatively small server is handling the load fine.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> You could have a distributed memcache, but very much an overkill here and doubt it is possible with the given infrastructure. Few options:

11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac if you have some query  that is slow on real server, we can check if some index or rewriting query differently help√üs
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> The show ShowTop can sometimes take a second or two. Noticed this when going around different servers to test it. My main concern was that the underlying database was taking strain - hence the suggestion. 
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> It isn't too slow so an index or change in the query could definitely help
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Here's what the DB serverhas index-wise at the moment
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/819520145395417088/message.txt
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you do multiple round trips for your top 5? that might be a problem
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Multeasymap has the most ranks, and /top5 is definitely under 1 second for me on GER (still running old state before your changes)
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> It does two. One for global and one for the region. I spent a bit of time thinking of alternative queries but came up blank
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can always combine two queries into one
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it might be a bit awkward
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Could have been an anomaly then. I'll do some more tests and see how the responses are.
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I still think it might be nicer to show the global top X and then the next best people from current server in some way
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not sure it's worth it, probably the best solution would be a new UI that shows all this info in scoreboard
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, can see how it is received with the update. It isn't doing two calls when the region has a high score so for the bigger servers the command will function the same
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> A usual test would be to assess the feeling of it among the Chinese community. They have a significant representation, relatively new community with low rankings and tend to be patriotic / care more about their peers.
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can try asking on the kaiheila ddnet server
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since Discord is blocked in China
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @deen sorry for tag, but i have question about this 45¬∞ aim thing, it always set inp_mousesens to ``200``, shouldn't be same as previous inp_mousesens ?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but we have no realiable way to find that out. Better to bind it yourself with the correct value
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it will be removed in the next release
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is most likely due to actual latency now that we have a single db server instead of the old replication circle we had

14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> I saw it 1 week ago
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> üòÅ
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not possible
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or are u a patreon or smth
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> It is
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> On Ger channel
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tv?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> https://youtu.be/9sf-3Q8EcAE
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lel
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well english best
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unranked :poggers:
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/819588204549505044/unknown.png
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Zodiac  you are forget the number in rank or you did delete ?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @Ryozuki it simply means you haven't finished the map in the RUS region
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Where are you referring to? The description of the command?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> /rank
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> You might be on a server with the old broken rank on it
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Which one is that?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Which server did you use it on?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> how many players/tees it's unexist
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/819589224969011250/unknown.png
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, the server must still be on yesterday's version
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> GER1
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok get great day
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Thanks for flagging though. Give it some time / try another server and it will work again
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @Zodiac could always do local rank to where the map was finished irrespective of server, then display unranked if on a different server like the RUS example above. 
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Just a small suggestion but dont want to complicate things.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> /rank doesn't merge if spammed
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> #3693
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3693
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oops, wrong issue
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I meant this üòÖ 
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> #2887
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2887
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> ü§î that could work - will leave the feature to sit for a while before making changes though
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby check where you're generating the server info, and see what you're doing after the map name and before the map size. or send me hte relevant code somewhere and I'll fix it
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @heinrich5991 ill dm u
