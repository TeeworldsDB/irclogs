00:20 < bridge> <Solly> YIPEEE
00:29 < bridge> <smetanolub> gfx_render_thread_count
00:30 < bridge> <smetanolub> Is this command accepts thread count of gpu or cpu?
00:33 < bridge> <Solly> cpu probably
00:33 < bridge> <Solly> but check
01:25 < bridge> <smetanolub> How to check
02:10 < bridge> <Solly> look at process count
02:10 < bridge> <Solly> look at gpu process count
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> increase `gfx_render_thread_count`
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> look at process count
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> look at gpu process count
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> and filter for ddnet

04:49 < bridge> <woidless> I noticed that on the "медленный горес"  after respawning / logging in to the server, you are in the solopart for a couple of seconds and a thing flies behind you that resets all items to the standard
04:49 < bridge> <woidless> What does it give?
05:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you mean by "What does it give?"
05:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can ask the 0XF developers if you have a question about their mod
05:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you mean by "What does it give?" something like "What is its purpose?" then i would assume its some kind of spawn protection to avoid blocking each other
07:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Morning concurrent map writers and others
07:24 < bridge> <Ewan> Gm
07:24 < bridge> <Ewan> That shit rocks
07:25 < bridge> <Ewan> Erroring is hard though
07:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: Java’s concurrent map?

07:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: golang's map
07:51 < bridge> <woidless> Thx
10:01 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Give a bit time to leave spawn and not collide to others, bcs too many players on spawn usually
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat did you publish a private repo or did I not see this in my github feed for 2 weeks? https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/nodummies/
10:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Looks promising, I have to admit as a dummy enjoyer. I like that you have some teeish branding.
10:08 < bridge> <zhn> looks like it does nothing but logs every udp packet :justatest:
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes for now
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> let me re plug https://twnet.zillyhuhn.com/ again pasting hexdumps in here is quite convienient during development of such tools
10:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon it was public from start
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm weird
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks like i missed it or the gh algorithm punished you
10:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I can ping you personally for every new tw related project :lol:
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that would be nice actually
14:24 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
14:25 < bridge> <woidless> Which command can forbid changing the deceleration for a short time
14:25 < bridge> <woidless> How to do not change the map
14:26 < bridge> <woidless> As in KoG do not change map
14:26 < bridge> <woidless> Only in my case, the speed change
14:29 < bridge> <woidless> And also how to make sure that in the voting, like, really 65% of the players have to press f3 so that the speed changes
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> Otherwise, the green stripe does not even reach the black stick, and the voting is still going on smoothly
15:06 < bridge> <montikboom> Can you send master server rules please?
15:06 < bridge> <x1lenix> Необработанное исключение по адресу 0x00007FF7792D7D17 в DDNet.exe: 0xC00000FD: Stack overflow (параметры: 0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000C6D603000). this is what the debugger gives me

19:19 < bridge> <montikboom> I have a question, if I use fng to get server type color, if this against the rules? Because I don't see any rule that disallow this
21:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> small utility for parsing your logs for spambots: https://github.com/jxsl13/twlog-who-said
21:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> have fun
21:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> currently synchronized, if anyone has that many logs that async processing is required, ping me
21:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do you have go code where `<- ctx.Done()` is used? :DD
21:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> github.com/jxsl13/amqpx
21:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> extensively
22:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> I mainly use context.Context for graceful shutdown handling.
22:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill check it, thanks
22:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> async -> parallel/concurrent
23:30 < bridge> <smetanolub> uh, expand your explanation plz, i didnt get it
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> ill just check gimme a moment
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s cpu thread count
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> gpu core concept is completely abstracted
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> i think its a maxmimum increasing it doesnt do anything
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> or i mite have to restart
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> yeah no change
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but you could theoretically for whatever reason make multiple gpu processes
23:34 < bridge> <smetanolub> thank you
23:34 < bridge> <smetanolub> Is there a list for maximum performance for every command?
23:35 < bridge> <smetanolub> In ddnet 15 i had 10k fps, but on 16.7 i have only 5k,somwtimes 7 but for short moment
23:36 < bridge> <smetanolub> I didnt change my settings, and also upgraded my pc, so it must be something with settings wrong
23:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> screen resolution -> 480x320 :jaouis:
23:37 < bridge> <smetanolub> I did switch my i7700k for 7950x3d, may be i need to set up some settings for cpu in a different program?

23:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> :justatest:
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah?
23:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> is rust the culprit? :justatest:
23:43 < bridge> <Ewan> of what
23:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> did you try 16.5?
23:44 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i see
23:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t think it’s actually doing anything in that release, but idk
23:44 < bridge> <Ewan> ffi has just been implemented
