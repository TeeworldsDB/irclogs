00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the skins need to be good quality
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> use a program like inkscape to make skins so they look good
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i use photoshop
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway now it is too late
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i really was hope put anything in ddnet ðŸ˜¦
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> is there an opportunity to put  another one if i change collor and if i fixed something in the circle my skin?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @louis
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> possibly, but we'll see
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if you want to contribute to ddnet, do so because you like the game and want to support i :p one skin wont matter too much in the long run
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Putting my print is enough for me

14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> chiller nobo
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> using irc
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> ty solved
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen can you test "pr_TESTING" with the laptop one more time, had a random thing in mind, dunno if that helps, but can atleast test
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and make sure u didnt downgrade with gl version ofc ðŸ˜„
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (oh yeah u have to disable that driver check very quick) ðŸ˜„
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually doesn't matter @deen , ravie said it even happened with GL 3.3, and that code doesnt exist there
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> would it be possible to make a tile that blocks you from spectating xD?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <UnlucksMcGee> Wouldn't you need to block zooming out as well then?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> i mean /spec to remove yourself from the game
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <UnlucksMcGee> Ah, so you're only allowed /spec in certain sections, instead of the whole map.
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> ye, i want /spec enabled but there is 1 tile where i dont want it
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u mean u dont want them to remove their tee there
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> lol deen playing teeworlds :D i thought its fake first but he is ignoring me like real deen :p
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> @Aoe why do you want to enable spec anywhere in the first place
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chillerdragon is a troll
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> notroll compared to you
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> acwerty
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> noy
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Aoe nope and I'd prefer not to add that
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe use a stopper there and give people infinite jumps on that tile but not around it?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> hmm i'll figure something out ðŸ˜„
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> What are `Snap`s?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A "snapshot" of the state of the game
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It contains all the data needed to recreate the game at any tick
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are sent in "delta" form though, so we only send the changes most of the time and send a full snapshot only sometimes
