00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> how can i add new maps and update sql (points , etc)?
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc following official ddnet maps and ranks?
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the maps are in a git repo, so you can git pull them daily. We have scripts for the official servers, but they are probably not so nice to use: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc what's the goal?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @deen i added maps to the server but i don't know how set points for them
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> i have scripts
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @TcTc the bbnet scripts repo has some very simple scripts for adding maps and basic ddnet mysql stuff https://github.com/BanBansNet/bbnet-scripts
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I was wondering would it be possible to create a emote fetcher, so if someone has another emote.png you still see his emotes instead of yours.
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i already know how i would abuse that
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm true
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But what about the skinfetching thing on ath that would also be vulnerable for that.
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that’s opt-in
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can abuse mapres too
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so..?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah, nvm. This was an bad idea xd
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you wouldnt release it where as when i make my own emoticons i could display anything i want on your screen as long as you have the fetching on
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @heinrich5991 nope, I just get timeout when trying to load ddnet.tw or any subdomain of it
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> This is really weird
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Now I tried restarting my router and modem but still the same
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> OOF
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> $10
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Nitro Classic is $5
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also if you open a cmd and ping 31.186.251.128, which is the IP for ddnet.tw?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Nah
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> it doesn't ping
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> you can also do `ping ddnet.tw`
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that would require DNS lookup
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I mean
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> DNS Lookup works
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tunneled IPv4?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://fuck.light-the.me/use-stylus™/2rgpql.png
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> What tunneled
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are you even on ipv4? xd
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Yes
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tunneled through ipv6?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> My ISP doesn't support ipv6
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or "native"
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> not tunneled
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok then you should call them
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I'll try
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Thanks
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But before that I will check my router configuration just in case
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where are u living?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Serbia
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I see that DDnet already has a race helper implemented. How do I use it for the server to save 3 decimal place times?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we check finish once per tick, 20 ms accuracy max
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> So its not possible with the current build?
19:17 <@deen> nope
19:17 <@deen> i guess you could interpolate it though
19:17 <@deen> that's probably how race does it
19:18 <@deen> at the tick where the finish line was crossed (same for start line) check at what point at that velocity it was first touched
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Wtf I try to do category votes (short, middle, long) with 3 config files. But when I start the server with short.cfg for example I get every map in my vote list
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> is ddnet ever going to update its client/servers to 0.7 or release compatible versions
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> How this this even possible lol
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> In short.cfg are only some of these maps
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Ok seems like when i vote middle, all middle maps get loaded correctly, but the short maps still are in the vote pool
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Ok seems like when i vote middle, all middle maps gets loaded correctly, but the short maps still are in the vote pool
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I must be missing smth
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> clear_votes
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> when you copy dummy move and use the hook lines while you use the `+toggle cl_mouse_max_distance 2 400; +toggle inp_mousesens 1 100` up,  the tee that isn't in focus gets a 45° hook line, don't know if that's really understandable
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> https://i.imgur.com/mAAdWsb.png
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> So I just add clear_votes under my add_votes list?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> before you add all of the middle votes
