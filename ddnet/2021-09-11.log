00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do we do about it?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, generally, I want to know the clients "real" dimensions, when at zoom level 10 (1.0f) by not sending the allowzoom flag for a short time, in order to calculate the cursor position while zooming in/out to match the actual position on the screen in the client
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it works, just the fetchting of default show distance is not working properly
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, when joining a server it doesnt send the zoom level at all, if it was the same on the other server you just came from.
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I commented on the PR
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (did you see the first line as well?)
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, testing it right now seems to work
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looking at the code, you can probably extract the original zoom coordinates without going to zoom level 10
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that would be amazing
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i doubt, because i dont know the client's resolution
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't think the client sends its resolution (even on zoom level 10)?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see no references to the actual screen size in `CRenderTools::CalcScreenParams`
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt, but thats fine, i just need the show distance x and y at the level, where the input target matches the actual cursor pos on the screen
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How would i calculate it back?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm trying to figure out the formula rn
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, okay
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> divide width by height and pass that to the CalcScreenParams function, zoom=1
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aspect = width/height
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what? xxd
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so i need that function on the server?
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can copy paste it
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't have dependencies
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me try
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> WHAT
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it really works
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you are a magician
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no wait
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how is this possible
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how is what possible?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> math!
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i see, your math studying really pays off
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xdf
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be fixed i guess
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think resetting m_LastZoom on connect is okay?
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm, it's already reset in `OnReset()`
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that not being called?
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no its not set there, m_LastZoom belongs to CGameClient
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since its only for whether to send the zoomstate or not
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `CGameClient::OnReset`: `m_LastZoom = .0;`
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, i noticed, when holding bind for zooming in, it will send the new zoomstate when key is released, but when holding zoom out, it will send each step in between
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when zooming in, it only sends the new zoom state when it finishes zooming
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when zooming out, it immediately has to send something, because more stuff gets into the view port
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you want to avoid potential tees jumping in, yes
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's intended
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically it could try to merge these zoom requests until the they're sent out
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can the server detect dyn cam?
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because dyn cam does not work with this cursor hack
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why tho, lol
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as soon as the camera starts moving away from the tee, so the tee is not in the center anymore, the cursor position will start to be further away than the displayed clientside cursor

07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Are there magic comments to disable clang tidy? It throws an error and the suggested style improvement breaks my code .\_.
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby might know why this happens from his antibot work where the position of the cursor would be important
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont think you understood it correctly, because this is not normal behaviour:
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cursor works fine in zoom 10 and with dyncam, but what I did here is recalculating the cursor pos for zooming out
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And when zooming out + dyncam, the calculation seems to be wrong which I dont understand
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as soon as the dyncam distance gets triggered, the calculated mouse pos (the laser) will start to be further away from the tee than it should be
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tbh im not sure and most of the work ive done lately has more to do with angle than cursor, i guess it has something to do with the reason that the max dyncam distance as sent to server ends up around 633 even though cl_dyncam_max_distance is set to 1000
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh, that sounds like it is the issue lol
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or? idk, i will check at home
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 u didnt accept my invite to fddr btw, idk if that was wanted just wanted to remind
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, forgot about it, was logged out on the laptop
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it expired?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah, I'll accept it in a couple mins
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this doesnt make sense
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with dyncam I can go up to 1000 and that is also sent to the server
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 5 damn disks and it still doesn't feel enough :/
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i use it to place stuff etc, that is all working with 1000
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut is this laser thing on your repo yet or are you testing with it locally?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have 2 and currently thats fully okay xD
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But i dont bloat them tho
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want more ssd storage, modern games are just too massive...
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have a feature on the server that records max mouse distance
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> all dyn players with standard settings will max out around 632 or 633
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its some combination of the follow factor + dead zone that causes it i guess but im not sure how it works
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I find it odd that you haven't figured it out yet üòõ
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah i wanna know now lol im curoius
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut ^^
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```cpp
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         float CameraMaxDistance = 200.0f;
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         float FollowFactor = g_Config.m_ClMouseFollowfactor/100.0f;
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         float MouseMax = min(CameraMaxDistance/FollowFactor + g_Config.m_ClMouseDeadzone, (float)g_Config.m_ClMouseMaxDistance);
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         if(length(m_MousePos) > MouseMax)
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>             m_MousePos = normalize(m_MousePos)*MouseMax;```
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess this is why
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it's capped
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea its there, its view_cursor cmd
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But not the zoomed thing
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because i havent found a way to do it good yet, right now I am forcing players to zoom 10 whenever they do something with cursor, so it matches the clientside cursor
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it does really work @noby, I can place at a distance of 1000
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe bcs u have 0 follow factor or smth
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have standard dyn settings
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take a look at the cursor thing over lunch, maybe I can figure out how it's supposed to be
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and im talking about every dyn player ive seen with standard settings not just me
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will test later, it really works for me xd
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 0.7
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mo
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no*
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I use ddnet
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> test on fng, use dyncam, extend mouse max range, then type /mdump 1 in the chat, ull see the leftmost column is ur max recorded mouse distance
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i mean server-side is 0.7 and maybe there is no limit while 0.6 server-side had any
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (idk tho)
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby portal max distance is 1000 too, and when I use dyncam it goes up to that range and works
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its clientside
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mouse distance isnt really capped by server other than integer limits
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (although maybe it should be(?))
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nah
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> would make my job easier at least xd
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can we manipulate with player's cursor?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nope
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it can help to make mods kekw
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like server-side map-picker
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how does it get mouse distance
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> distance(m_Pos, CursorPos)
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> can i get player's mouse pos including zoom level?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cursorpos = m_Pos + Target
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why not just length(cursorpos)
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> only cursor pos
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Probably because i didnt know about it
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://tenor.com/view/out-disappear-bye-vanished-gif-4932063
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wish i could get other players zoom level xd
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not if they modify client or use old client
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 btw there is a bug in the calculation of NetworkClipped
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it has to be ShowDistance.x / 2 aswell as ShowDistance.y / 2
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> for zoomers?
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Otherwise double area is sent
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i added a 15*32 area as border on top, so that tees wont fly in
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> especially when zoomig out far, it sends a lot more
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so showdistance.x / 2 + 14*32
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 15*
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby try view_cursor on my server with mouse 1000
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> .
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it will likely work with dyncam disabled
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean with dyncam
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't we have a transform for going from mouse pos to world pos btw?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think i have deadzone and follow factor 0
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or are entities in screen coordinates?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u have deadzone and ff 0 then its not dyncam afaik
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will see later
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> one hour i think
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> these settings are what makes dyn dyny
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I never understood them but also never investigated
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> deadzone is like, the max distance at which u. can move ur cursor away from the center before it starts dyning
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> followfactor im not exactly sure but has to do with the speed that it the screen follows ur cursor outside the deadzone
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hm
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then my deadzone is probably 400
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as my static mouse distance
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i believe how it works is that, if follow factor is 0 then it wont follow regardless and so deadzone doesnt matter
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes i just tested, with followfactor 0 it records distance correctly
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did never see anyone complain that portal place position doesnt match up the cursor or that he wasnt able to place further away portals with dyncam, and thats what i find too, for me it seemed to work always
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then thats it already
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when placing portals though, do you place them at exactly where the cursor is?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you use the exact same code for the portals and the view_cursor function?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If portals are entities too that really doesn't make sense to me
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait, dont misunderstand me, i am trying to add something new
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that is not in yet
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. does the formula work rn, or does it not?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It works, but not for dyncam, as soon as the dyncam starts
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> From what I see from the code zoom is not considered at all for now
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> read these
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No its not in yet as I said
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its only local right now because of that issue^
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, so without the extended object reporting the screen bounds we don't have a way of figuring out the actual position of the cursor on the serverside? So odd that matricks left that out
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> going further away from the tee with dyncam results in the cursor pos on the server being further away than the Client cursor
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm? our current extended message only tells width/height of the screen
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then even that isn't enough, how do you figure out what the zoom level is @fokkonaut ?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and zoom doesn't exist in vanilla, so we should have the same information as in vanilla for figuring out the map cursor pos
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont, I just use the Aspect (width/height), then use CalcScreenParams from the client with zoom = 1
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as heinrich found out xd
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Before, I tried to fetch zoom lvl by not using allow_zoom flag
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but this works better
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without the zoom level you shouldn't be able to figure out the cursor pos from what I gather
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then, to get the cursorpos in zoom i calculate it * showdistance and / default show distance, the one for zoom 1 where the cursor matches up the screen cursor
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will show you later
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> going to the barber now, dont worry it works xd
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not worried about it working in your mod, I'm more annoyed that we don't have a proper mapping for it
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um, seems bors died
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh, idk what to do with that, so I guess you still aren't getting your merge @fokkonaut üòõ
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rip
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> who destroyed FPS graph <.<, why is it now on top, instead of the mid?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/886250254045954048/unknown.png
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon:
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3988
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there a reason the fps graph doesnt respect lowest fps anymore?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it's nicer to have a relative jitter, instead of 0-maxfps
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> btw, can the fps graph be changed to logarithmic scale?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not like the fps range is rly high
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> maybe it's because I get skipped frames, but the max fps fluctuates a lot for me
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Max fps fluctuates??
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, every second or so there are a few spikes with 10k or 20k fps, while the average is much less
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> or, my gfx_refresh_rate is 400, so there shouldn't have been any spikes above that
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u have a lag you might get higher fps for a very short time
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it tries to stabilize at 400fps
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, so that after a long/slow frame it might skip the next one to stabilize?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> after a slow it will try to get 2 quick ones probably
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you also use cl_refresh_rate
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you also use `cl_refresh_rate`
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd suggest to not use it, use gfx_asyncrenderold 0, if you really want to limit your CPU
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> hmm, increasing cl_refresh_rate above gfx_refresh_rate seemed to help
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `gfx_asyncrender_old 0`
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it waits for the GPU
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but both options can create input delay
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but cl_refresh_rate is really destroying everything
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast to me it feels very unsmooth
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ok, that made the fps graph a lot smoother
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I guess the input delay will be lower if you increase gfx_refresh_rate?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> but thanks, seemed to work
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes should generally be lower the more fps you get with that option
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs the only thing that could eliminate this problem more is to split the graphic stuff from simulation
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then there are two threads that don't depend on each other(e.g. the visualition thread just uses the current state), while the simulation just calculates its stuff.

17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> RN when a new frame is about to happen the same thread that also is the simulation thread, prepares the gfx buffer, which obviously can take alot more CPU time, than just the simulation itself, especially when there is interaction with UI(which does all calculations on fly) and or does some more heavy math
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's probably the main reason cl_refresh_rate puts out so bad frametimes
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> too much factors for randomness xd
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs the only thing that could eliminate this problem more is to split the graphic stuff from simulation

19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™\:  i have no opinions on the graph I just wanted to get the changes from upstream in
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so can you fix it?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast improve it, so it doesnt chill on the top of the graph all the time, e.g. calc a higher max
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh Uhm sorry I don‚Äôt feel pro enough to mess with that code also do not know what bothers you. Can you do it .-. Im sorry I made it worse for you
