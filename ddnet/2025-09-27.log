00:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> hmm
00:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** watfak
00:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** whats a `ref`
00:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and a `String^`
00:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf
00:08 < bridge_> <kebscs> c#?
00:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it says C++ in the ms docs
00:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @patiga i tried to do tactical skip through freeze on to boat and got really confused when my avoid freeze hack wouldnt let me get frozen and i had too much speed xd
00:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=failed_to_get_frozen_smh.mp4&u=chiller
00:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i compiled tclient just for that clip xd
00:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the draw feature is kinda neat
00:15 < bridge_> <thrava> c#
00:16 < bridge_> <kebscs> screenshot has using var, definetly c$
00:16 < bridge_> <kebscs> screenshot has using var, definetly c#
00:17 < bridge_> <thrava> .NET stuff is really life saver
00:18 < bridge_> <thrava> If you found something seems to not able to work on c#, Nuget it
00:19 < bridge_> <Assa> looks like java to me
00:19 < bridge_> <thrava> Yes it's do
00:20 < bridge_> <thrava> C# is pretty much as same as java in the early state
00:20 < bridge_> <Assa> oh yeah looks very similar
00:20 < bridge_> <Assa> var true
00:21 < bridge_> <thrava> but with a better coding experience
00:21 < bridge_> <thrava> you can really feel like your brain works smoother coding on c#
00:21 < bridge_> <thrava> they just setup almost everything
00:23 < bridge_> <thrava> as I know, the performance in the front end of C# isn't so good, but it can be pretty fast in the back-end (but all in all, it's not system programming language, so it can't compete with c++ or c)
00:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> it really depends on the C# you write
00:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> it can be nearly or about as fast as managed C++ depending on what you're doing
00:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> there's dotnet AOT which lets you precompile it and eliminate a lot of the IL bytecode overhead
00:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is all on windows, mono is not as good
00:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> but aot still works for other platforms
00:25 < bridge_> <thrava> I remember I've seen a test of the performance of c# very long time ago, but I can't remember its detail
00:29 < bridge_> <thrava> I start my computer programming experience from C#, at the very beginning, I was trying to kick the door with python, but I felt like I don't know what I'm coding and what I'm expecting because the python I've learned that stage isn't strongly typed, so I tried C#, and I instantly feel "this language knows me"
00:31 < bridge_> <thrava> But because of this, now when I facing languages like javascript, I just feel half of my brain shuts down (exaggerated speaking) because I have no idea what the code is processing about
01:32 < bridge_> <louis> c# is nice
01:32 < bridge_> <louis> almost too nice to the point its boring 😹
01:50 < bridge_> <totar> I like c# because the packages are made by serious people, not like Javascript framework #43  that was minted a month ago.
06:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rust
06:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur outdated, nobody uses mono
07:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm?
08:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> modern .net runs on linux
08:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have net sdk 9
08:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dotnet
08:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421376440863031356/image.png?ex=68d8cf77&is=68d77df7&hm=7eec504e0c16322cd913cf7ce4d7caec709670132704755ead2998e46cbb7fd2&
08:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mono is only for rly legacy apps now old
08:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think older than net 6
08:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> today i fixed a bug in my kernel
08:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i had a simple bool for high priority threads
08:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i was adding to many threads to the run queue with priority, which just means push front
08:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so  i starved some threads from runtime
08:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> such a dumb issue but it cost me hours
08:19 < bridge_> <remakepower> I was quite suprised that I replaced SDL2 with SDL3 in Teeworlds and FPS is even lower than work on SDL2
08:19 < bridge_> <remakepower> :thonk:
08:50 < bridge_> <zhn> did you actually replace it? you can help ddnet with migration i guess
08:57 < bridge_> <remakepower> Yeah, and the client has released.
08:57 < bridge_> <remakepower> https://github.com/Bamcane/teeworlds-carbon/
08:57 < bridge_> <remakepower> But I don't know why the rendering performance is poorer than vanilla.
08:58 < bridge_> <remakepower> Yeah, and the client has released.
08:58 < bridge_> <remakepower> https://github.com/NewTeeworldsCN/teeworlds-carbon/
08:58 < bridge_> <remakepower> But I don't know why the rendering performance is poorer than vanilla.
08:58 < bridge_> <remakepower> Yeah, and the client has released.

08:58 < bridge_> <remakepower> But I don't know why the rendering performance is poorer than vanilla.
09:14 < bridge_> <zhn> thats... a lot of changes, i can't even find commit responsible for sdl upgrade
09:19 < bridge_> <remakepower> Hm...
09:21 < bridge_> <remakepower> It seems I combined it with other client modifications into one commit.

09:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pog, i have procfs
09:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i need to actually remove dying threads
09:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller
09:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is there any wireshark tutorial?
09:55 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: what do you need to know? What are you working on?
09:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i simply want to compare the connecting step of ddnet with ddnet-rs (or libtw generally)
09:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I want to understand what they do differently.. If at all
10:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> That seems simple enough to be done without wireshark knowledge
10:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> You have heino dissector installed?
10:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
10:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Okay do that first
10:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Very important
10:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok let me search internet for heino dissector
10:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/index.html
10:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I got this xd
10:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> libtw2
10:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It’s linked there
10:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> wireshark dissector
10:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oge
10:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/wireshark-dissector
10:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Build that and move it to plugin dir
10:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Which wireshark version are you on?
10:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how can i trust this tool if libtw might be the reason for different connecting phase?
10:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yes it’s trusty
10:04 < bridge_> <learath2> It just decodes packets, doesn’t change anything
10:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I think josspit might also not trust its decoding xd
10:05 < bridge_> <learath2> If there is something ddnet does that libtw somehow doesn’t even recognize, it’ll stay as an undecoded packet
10:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But I triple checked it
10:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: u have a ddnet-rs pcap for me?
10:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Or how do I get one that doesn’t work?
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> plugin aint working :c
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oke
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what is that
10:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah wireshjark capture?
10:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont have any
10:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok
10:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how do i get one?
10:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how do i make it not work
10:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i will send you some debugging time now because i love u
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno. start ddnet-rs, connect to any ger ddnet server
10:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok
10:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** lemme try to launch the rust rocket
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i can also do that
10:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `cargo run` was it rite?
10:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do you want me to help you get the plugin to work? or should i just have a look?
10:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the pluggin needs some version fiddeling potentially
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** not being able to double click to join a server drives me crazy xd
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just unsafely copied the plugin into my usr/lib dir and then it worked
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** pr
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** o
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421409681305501858/image.png?ex=68d8ee6c&is=68d79cec&hm=ddc253ae654b9a8683c7b26cfe051160bd3bf298389e2382f9346b3ea8fd4cd3&
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Now simply compare to ddnet?
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.0a34556f-7a2d-448e-a9a9-6240ed2a55ec.png
10:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** why is it 127.0.0.1
10:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh wow
10:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** cant screenshot ddnet-rs?
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it uses a proxy
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so it connects to proxy and the ui doesnt support that yet
10:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** nvm i cant screenshot in general anymore
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> showing the proxy addr
10:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i regret updating my system again
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i get these annoying notifications every time i tab out of ddnet and now screenshots broke too
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf gnome
10:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok, ddnet simply sends ctrl.connect twice
10:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i do that too later
10:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421410199276752958/image.png?ex=68d8eee8&is=68d79d68&hm=36e254424562cb48d3c1a3010d992b8f03971bfc2bee0ceb00f8b514b7a32f66&
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i doubt ddnet sends it twice intentionally
10:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that mf server simply ignores me
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its probably just a resend or something like that
10:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but there is no resend answer in my wireshark thing
10:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What i could imagine is that it's about sending a request to the master server
10:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> which i do too, but not with curl, but with reqwest
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** doubt davide can catch these
10:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think he can
10:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that was the idea of not having a TCP server
10:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> TCP connection*
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe we shouldnt reverse engineer ddos protection in public
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and rather dm @davide55
10:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont want to annoy other ppl with my project
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he chill dude
10:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i send two connects now, lets see
10:20 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i even receive map chunks
10:20 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u dont?
10:20 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no progress bar so i cant tell if the map download is just slow or broken
10:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah that is also broken
10:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** map downloads?
10:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think libtw is buggy
10:22 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well then the connecting works
10:22 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i just get stuck in download
10:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah at some point it just stops replying to map chunk requests
10:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:22 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet ger3
10:22 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ez working
10:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but the download requests are vital, but i never get their response
10:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's luck based
10:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now it kinda works i guess
10:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421412466021367837/image.png?ex=68d8f104&is=68d79f84&hm=fa64fbad1c2b4b25c533e43114bbefdd932b9b7f8f2a0ffa4b81aa30b8bc9adb&
10:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just spam connect packages
10:25 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** dont spam them
10:26 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** there is logic to it
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** send it every 500ms
10:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but sending twice does the job
10:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just that libtw is not in some invalid state
10:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd call that progress
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/174340a8c49c91a68dbd8b9a5efd6ea98c0df748/src/engine/shared/network_conn.cpp#L576-L580
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bro idc about these 8 bytes extra send to all servers
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's not a ddos
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but u only send twice now?
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u need to send it more often i guess if you want to be as reliable as the c++ client
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ctrl is not vital
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so if it gets hiccupped you stuck in connection screen
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** twice is a magic number that just might work on your current setup
10:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i cant
10:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's libtws job
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh i see
10:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I have no access to these packets
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt know it also handles state
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @heinrich5991 pls fix
10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how do you send it twice then?
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> simply call connect twice, but that doesnt work
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it breaks smth in libtw xd
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i patch it now
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to simply send it twice
10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u use custom libtw2 now?
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i do anyway
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/issues/122
10:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I had to add backward compatbility to libtw2
10:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
10:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** open new issue for connect resend
10:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont want heinrich to waste time for my project
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think heino does it
10:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if he does, then it doesnt work
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my rust so bad
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/a31611e8c4ba5a521ebf8da2abe2f36380d17a56/net/src/connection.rs#L657-L673
10:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i patched libtw2 now and it works now
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but this looks promising
10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/libtw2/commit/0b6b1b7533dc00c48483dca51eedf04656efb66d
10:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait wat xd
10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that fixes it
10:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** isnt tick_action called on tick?
10:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno wtf even a tick is in network code
10:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and it checks if in state connectiong then it sets `control` to connect packet
10:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and the it sends it on tick every 500 milli seconds
10:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** you now send it twice every 500ms?
10:39 < bridge_> <filoqcus> https://tenor.com/view/pipotam-baby-hippo-hippo-wash-shower-gif-3406421565683572068
10:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I call ticks apparently
10:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what does `self.send.set(cb, Duration::from_millis(500));` even do
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```rs
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pub fn run_once(&mut self, mut on_event: impl FnMut(&mut Self, ChunkOrEvent<'_, SocketAddr>)) {
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>         self.net
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>             .tick(&mut self.socket)
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>             .for_each(|e| panic!("{e:?}"));
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>         while let Ok(res) = self.socket.try_recv() {
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>             self.run_recv(res, &mut on_event);
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>         }
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>     }
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dont want to read libtw2, not bcs i dont like it.
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but bcs i dont want to learn about old network
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did you know i use async socket with libtw2 xdd
10:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** whatever that is
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/blob/2b8545cb52c75088405c58bfa4d9c03736299bb8/game/legacy-proxy/src/socket.rs
10:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i should really try to use libtw2 once to better understand it
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ wdym heino waste time
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if libtw2 is bugged it should be fixed
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im sure he will use it for accounts
10:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with async sockets i can basically easily wait on multiple async code.. even non-network code
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that way i can have the legacy proxy run without any kind of perma run loop
10:43 < bridge_> <remakepower> I am really confused by Rust code.
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wait until either proxy socket or new network get any packet
10:43 < bridge_> <remakepower> :thonk:
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> otherwise do nothing
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if it's bugged
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not high level code
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he'll show me some weird hack to make it work
10:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** heinrich the hacker?
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well it's the same with the map download
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it simply does not return packages sometimes
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno why
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if you want to debug, go ahead xd
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes changing maps also doesnt work, it says smth about couldn't decode packet, maybe the unpacker is not reset properly or smth
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the whole tw network code is just overengineered and over complicated
11:19 < bridge_> <Assa> new hook lines incoming 🎉
11:44 < ChillerDragon> I KNOW WHY MY ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FUCKED AAA
11:44 < ChillerDragon> update switched me to wayland watafak
11:45 < ChillerDragon> the root of all evil
12:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> true story.. they simply cannot accept that, just because they had a good idea. their software still sucks ass
12:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so much not ready for production
12:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is this a trend or has it always been happening?
12:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they fix some minor things every year
12:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and i wait since 20 years that it is usable
12:10 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> where people like to architect software that's in theory better than the current standard
12:10 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but it never gets there because it's too ambitious
12:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess we are simply missing labour
12:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet-rs is also cooler than ddnet but sucks 😬
12:11 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I feel like Rust in general is almost a part of this trend
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
12:11 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Not the language but many of the applications
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i honestly have the feeling using rust libs you get higher quality software than the c counter part
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno rust is used a lot in microservices already
12:11 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Old software is sufficiently dumb
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so that is where it's very stable
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if you mean like gui.. yes
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it sucks
12:13 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and microservices are one of those things that solve a problem while creating ten more
12:13 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :greenthing:
12:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how so
12:14 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess we do have new software that is good... So I may be experiencing survivorship bias
12:14 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> too fancy
12:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think it has to do with fancy
12:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's more about not using some ugly ass apache with php anymore
12:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> writing software to solve exactly one problem makes it easy to write tests for it etc.
12:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah you can overuse microservices, no doubt about that
12:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet example:
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think an assets server would be good addition
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it can handle assets upload, download, download with hashes, deliver an index
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not more, not less
12:17 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I talk about traditional software as if it's so great but like our core utils are GNU and those codebases are terrifying
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> possible yeah xD
12:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but honstly they use c
12:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that is scary alone
12:18 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yet somehow they keep being one of the fastest around despite the complexity
12:19 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The scarier part is the three other languages you've never heard of
12:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but there again, devs 20 years ago were not bad, they just reinvented the wheel for everything and used ass tools like autoconfig
12:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and then you get code bases like this
12:24 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> DSLs are based but the problem with them is that there are a lot of domains
12:30 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oh damn
12:30 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought that would tkae longer
12:30 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> epic
12:34 < bridge_> <Assa> you are partly right, all linux core utils are gettin rewritten in rust due to memory safety
12:36 < bridge_> <Assa> but this opens, of course, another can of worms, and rust doesn't prevent you from doing logic mistakes
12:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the only thing rust does to prevent this is making writing tests very easy
12:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it motivates you to do the boring part
12:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you can just slam it right under your code in the same file
12:38 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Reimplementations or replacements?
12:38 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm not a fan of nonstandard tools
12:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> same interface ig
12:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> otherwise it would be kinda useless
12:39 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Then I can get on board
12:39 < bridge_> <Assa> https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
12:41 < ChillerDragon> we should rewrite all software in lua
12:41 < bridge_> <Assa> The chart at the bottom is really interesting, so you can assume it will get ready in the next 1-2 years
12:41 < bridge_> <Assa> yeah, let's add a lua interpreter to the client, like n-client did 🥳
12:43 < bridge_> <Assa> idk 80-20 rule probably applies
12:43 < bridge_> <Assa> so by that logic, in 10 years 😄
12:43 < bridge_> <Assa> so by that logic, in 10 years for full 100% 😄
12:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** n-client has it too?
12:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait whats n-client
12:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i only know h-client
12:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ath is the lua goats 
12:45 < bridge_> <Assa> n-client was a 0.6 client from map64
12:45 < bridge_> <Assa> this was like 10 years ago, probably longer
12:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ono @robyt3 doxygen in ci raped my ass in forks xd
12:46 < bridge_> <Assa> @chillerdragon https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8025
12:46 < bridge_> <Assa> 
12:46 < bridge_> <Assa> you can still find it xD
12:46 < bridge_> <Assa> 2011 xD
12:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think i know this name: MAP94
12:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** isnt he mapper too? or i confuse it
12:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** N-LVL also rings a bell
12:46 < bridge_> <Assa> He is known, or he was
12:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** rip
12:47 < bridge_> <Assa> This guy introduced me to programming when I was 13 and I started to implement lua scripts and breaking his API
12:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no way
12:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u know him?
12:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he was your mentor?
12:48 < bridge_> <Assa> idk if he was my mentor, more like a Vorbild (there is no english word for this?)
12:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my mentors where Krisko (k-client dev), Meskalin (AllTheHaxx) and FruchtiHD (status.tw)!
12:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** pretty goated
12:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** they took a lot of time to sit down with me when i didnt know arrays yet
12:50 < bridge_> <Assa> I also bombarded Botox with questions, he inspired me a lot to do stuff, but I remember he was very hated by some people
12:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** Assa u soo old
12:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** as a newfag i envy u
12:50 < bridge_> <Assa> he was the creator of zEsc
12:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ofc i know botox
12:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he did a lot
12:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** isnt ddnet.org still powered by botox code? xd
12:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the status thing
12:51 < bridge_> <Assa> probably maybe 😄
12:51 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** linux server monitoring using teeworlds protocol xd
12:51 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** jupstar would hate it
12:51 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ServerStatus
12:52 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think its that https://ddnet.org/stats/
12:52 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no dis? https://ddnet.org/stats/server/
12:52 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or dis xd https://ddnet.org/status/
12:52 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** bruv idk
12:53 < bridge_> <Assa> These are all really well made tbh
12:55 < bridge_> <Assa> confirms, ddnet is mostly hosted in germany and played by russians :p
12:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
12:58 < bridge_> <Assa> 2391 maps released
12:58 < bridge_> <Assa> most of them are Brutal oO
12:59 < bridge_> <Assa> I think I did not see a lot of brutal maps in my life
12:59 < bridge_> <Assa> no if you combine race and solo, then solo is the biggest category (which makes sense)

13:42 < bridge_> <Assa> and I move my dev memes into off topic 🙁
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> working on lag profiler using the tracing crate and some custom logic.
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pretty cool.
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. if a frame takes longer than 17ms, it prints an output like dis.
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>

16:36 < bridge_> <Assa> @chillerdragon since we esablished, that the removal doesn't change anything from the last 8 years, what about merging, closing all that pesky issues, and I can finally continue to work on this and build features on it, update the 8 years old code and stuff
16:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well if this breaks something the state gets even worse
16:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and you are the only one who is sure it doesnt break anything

16:40 < bridge_> <Assa> like I already have multiple features in mind we can build on it, as I said we play domino day, giving this domino a puch will cause a bunch of issues to be closed and future stuff to be viable

16:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ez sketchy pyson script
16:58 < bridge_> <Teero> you have to tell it to explicitly forward keybinds for every application you need keybinds in xd

17:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what a day
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Why does heinrich approve compat breaking changes
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In rendering code
17:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its heinrich 2.0
17:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** this will be the age of compat breaking
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> He should remove them in network code
17:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** huge things to come for ddnet
17:07 < bridge_> <Assa> @chillerdragon can you give @jupeyy_keks a TLDR why we remove envelope sync? Or should I?
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I am strongly against removing this feature, wtf is your motivation
17:08 < bridge_> <Assa> feature is broken since 8 years
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not broken at all
17:08 < bridge_> <Assa> what is your motiviation in removing this feature?
17:08 < bridge_> <Assa> okay tell me what's the difference between synced and unsynced envelopes
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> synced depend on tick unsynced on local client time
17:09 < bridge_> <Assa> what is your motiviation in keeping this feature which doesn nothing?
17:09 < bridge_> <Assa> wrong, all depend on server time
17:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
17:10 < bridge_> <Assa> yes
17:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No
17:10 < bridge_> <Assa> yes
17:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Bro no
17:10 < bridge_> <Assa> because it's bugged since 8 years
17:10 < bridge_> <Assa> BRO YES
17:10 < bridge_> <totar> Almost all reports of lag I see are actually bad network connection
17:11 < bridge_> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks see #879 and #10678.
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I already told you before, it's about mixing and that can be cleanly fixed
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No need to remove it
17:12 < bridge_> <Assa> they are syncing because they're running over the same static value
17:12 < bridge_> <Assa> yes need to remove it, I provided an alternative which nobody wants and breaks other stuff
17:14 < bridge_> <Assa> they're syncing for 8 years now all to server time. If you "fix" that and make some envelopes run on client time again, you will break stuff.
17:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** POMG @Teero thanks for the hitn buiauaid
17:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but
17:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** FUCK
17:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i can only use a key once
17:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i had f9 in obs to start AND stop
17:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it doesnt let me do it
17:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** dis madafakin wayland
17:15 < bridge_> <Teero> lmao
17:15 < bridge_> <Teero> hi tater
17:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> STILL A NO
17:25 < bridge_> <Assa> ???
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Bro, I tested it
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you have a map with ONLY non-synced animations it's client time
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as soon as you mix them it's reset as you say
17:25 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, what speaks against syncing all to servertime then?
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it simply is a change in logic that is not justified. e.g. that one map with the ugly more getting dark background which i dunno by name rn will break
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well or get fixed 😬
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well no
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kinda none of both
17:26 < bridge_> <Assa> this was addressed and was a different bug
17:27 < bridge_> <Assa> btw, server time and client time are essentially random for the player
17:27 < bridge_> <Assa> if you join a server, the timer can be days old
17:27 < bridge_> <Assa> if you join late into a map, the client timer won't reset too
17:28 < bridge_> <Assa> the map you adress **was broken 8 years ago, because it doesn't reset on the start line anymore**
17:28 < bridge_> <Assa> and none of them do that, synced or unsynced.
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a client restart fixes it tho
17:29 < bridge_> <Assa> a server restart or map reload as well
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but that is not as likely
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> your lack of communication also annoys me tbh.. you CAPSLOCK no, even tho i said the exact right thing
17:30 < bridge_> <Assa> because I am discussing a lot about this issue already, now we finally have a decision, and you NOW block it
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ofc I block it
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it sounds like the maintainers that approved it are not aware
17:35 < bridge_> <Assa> what do you want from me now, how would you resolve this issue?
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess the best would be to introduce a second timer
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so the unsynced animations are not dependend on server time
17:36 < bridge_> <Assa> but then maps break, where envelopes are not marked as synced but which sync to the server time currently
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If I introduced that 8 years ago then it's simply a bug since 8 years
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then these maps are buggy
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as well
17:37 < bridge_> <Assa> Then we just have more buggy maps yay
17:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No, these maps are buggy anyway
17:37 < bridge_> <Assa> I can almost guarantee you, that the number of maps with both synced and unsynced envelopes is high
17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok tell me what are you even talking about
17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> This fix?
17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10679
17:38 < bridge_> <Assa> making everything sync from now on wouldn't break anything, because an envelope running on client time can also run on server time without issues
17:39 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, this would have fixed old maps as well, like 8 years ago, but was breaking mods like kog and infection and was thereby undesired
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes that is not what i'd do
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or I say it differently.
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That is a bug in the network code
17:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** can you guys please post a tldr on github when you are done. We shouldnt hide such info in the discord logs @Jupstar ✪ the gh pr is what will be revisted in 10 years again
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> We'd need to have a animation tick, instead of racing ticks & server ticks
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then the mod can decide
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But the other fix is to simply not overwrite s_Time
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But use a local variable
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If maps really relied on synced time without marking the env synced, then it's  a map bug anyway
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But has nothing todo with startline
17:41 < bridge_> <totar> Why are we against putting compat data in map file, if you just use 1 timer for old maps and 2 timer for new maps everything works and it seems very simple
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> To be clear
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> which map breaks on kog?
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> like some moving or all moving?
17:42 < bridge_> <Assa> all maps with the q-move feature
17:42 < bridge_> <Assa> they have like quads that move around, and if you hit them they freeze you
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes yes
17:43 < bridge_> <totar> He meant to type all moving
17:45 < bridge_> <Assa> and infection, apparently, uses a generator changing envelopes based on the current server time
17:45 < bridge_> <Assa> in order to make the start buy menu
17:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but they use synced env or not
17:46 < bridge_> <I am stupid> yo
17:46 < bridge_> <I am stupid> cho cho
17:46 < bridge_> <Assa> both kog and infection break, because they use unsynced envelopes, when they should use synced ones
17:47 < bridge_> <Assa> hmm give me sec, maybe I am wrong
17:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But they MUST use at least one sync env
17:48 < bridge_> <Assa> I was wrong, both use synced envelopes synced to server time. The issue was with the start line reset breaking that
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Fine, but we don't need the startline patch
17:49 < bridge_> <Assa> yes I am also fine with that
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Startline patch IMO is a network limitation of teeworlds
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the other is about using a local var instead of resetting s_Time
17:50 < bridge_> <Assa> The fix, which was now about to get merged, just uses server time for everything. Because, as I said, syncing a client time envelope to server time doesn't hurt, and the fix you have in mind, mind break maps
17:51 < bridge_> <Assa> The fix, which was now about to get merged, just uses server time for everything. Because, as I said, syncing a client time envelope to server time doesn't hurt, and the fix you have in mind, breaks maps
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But I dislike that
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Which map does it break
17:51 < bridge_> <Assa> and the PR now has two static variables, I want to add a local variable as a followup (I agree it shouldn't be a static variable)
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kog not
17:52 < bridge_> <Assa> hard to tell, can be any map with synced and unsynced envelopes
18:00 < bridge_> <Assa> did you test this ingame D:
18:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ^^
18:01 < bridge_> <Assa> the ingame menu should break I can already tell
18:01 < bridge_> <Assa> - I mean the background map to be clear
18:02 < bridge_> <Assa> does this even compile? You still have s_Time references
18:03 < bridge_> <Assa> hmm I need more time to think about this
18:06 < bridge_> <Assa> This would, at least, decouple server and client time as you suggest. I'll create a list of maps that'll break

18:24 < bridge_> <Assa> huh the second map didn't error on a rerun 🤔
18:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. Agile has sync envs but doesnt use them
18:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So your tool would need to check if they also in use
18:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (btw i dislike that we have maps with unused envs)
18:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> Only the datafile structures themselves should be fully validated yet in the client/server. Maybe we should add twmap to the CI of ddnet-maps.
18:26 < bridge_> <Assa> hmm I probably also need to check for envelope type
18:26 < bridge_> <Assa> ~~hmm I probably also need to check for envelope type~~
18:26 < bridge_> <Assa> no scrap that, if colors break then colors also break
18:35 < bridge_> <Assa> this is hard to tell, I need to check each quad against the list of envelopes for each map and then need to know if it's synced or unsynced. Also quads can contain references to deleted/not existing envelopes due to an editor history bug in previous verions
18:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt matter for ddnet maps anyway
18:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> which maps except kog & kaffeine want network code to be able to change animations xD
18:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> one lag and your animation stucks or what
18:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i want my flowers in my map to be smooth af
18:36 < bridge_> <Assa> I want to introduce recorder-like tiles, to start and stop envelopes
18:36 < bridge_> <Assa> like you don't want to sync each tick obviously
18:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> believe me i want so much
18:37 < bridge_> <Assa> that's why I need envelope sync to be fixed in the first place
18:37 < bridge_> <Assa> like I am not doing it because I want to annoy you
18:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i want to be rich as chillerdragon, smart as patiga, hobyless as teero, tryhard as robyte

18:37 < bridge_> <Assa> 😛
18:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you dont annoy me
18:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you just expect me to be motivated to be a good maintainer, which i am not
18:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just want to code random shit and then rq
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> hello
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I have a protocol question.
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I reduced the map download window from 50 -> 10 and now it works.
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Does 50 map chunks bloat the network queue too much on server or client maybe?
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So that packets are dropped even tho they are vital?
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That is the only explaination I have for why the map download keeps breaking
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Especially on high ping server
18:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Could be too much depending on how much you pack into each packet. The network connection resend buffer is 32 KiB. But the server seems to allow setting `sv_map_window` up to 100.
18:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok, alternatively, does the server even set map chunks as vital
18:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> let me see
18:49 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah
18:49 < bridge_> <robyt3> vital and flush
18:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i swear literally nothing was happening, this mustve been me
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not a single frame above 4ms frame after 10min of playing, while having youtube open, discord open. playing in windowed mode, having codium open, having a second instance of ddnet open.
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i really think ddnet has no fps issues lol
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not a single frame above 4ms frametime after 10min of playing, while having youtube open, discord open. playing in windowed mode, having codium open, having a second instance of ddnet open.
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i really think ddnet has no fps issues lol
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> youre on good hardware
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> there are people still on old integrated
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sure
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd claim their drivers then simply suck
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no way it's a code issue if it runs that smooth.
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not like we perma use 100 threads
19:14 < bridge_> <learath2> I like this idea of a deployment ticket
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> its not bad... to optimize more
19:15 < bridge_> <robyt3> Last time we tried to declare compatibility with Windows 10+11, it broke some version checks in old drivers I think :pepeW:
19:15 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet is a very light game, but people also have light computers
19:15 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> old hardware and new windows dont play nice with eachother unfortunatley
19:15 < bridge_> <learath2> I still get this weird microstuttering. But I think it's probably just my aging hardware slowly dying
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i wish it would be easier to debug
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'd love them to run like a bench suite that triggers their laggs and we see exactly if it's in high level code or backend code
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean it's easy to do smth stupid that causes stutters
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just did so in ddnet-rs, and was very hard to debug
19:17 < bridge_> <learath2> It's so hard to debug that, you'd need very fine grained instrumentation which would itself have significant performance penalty
19:17 < bridge_> <arctl> guys is this okay that I can write here?
19:17 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://dontasktoask.com/
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the funny thing is
19:17 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (yes)
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not even
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> calling time is so fast
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the above 4ms was with constant profiling active
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno how many spans it opens, but must be around 100
19:17 < bridge_> <learath2> External profiler?
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i use tracing crate
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and some custom logic
19:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah
19:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> good crate
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well mangohud can show 0.01% lows
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well mangohud can show 0.1% lows
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But that's not really accurate enough
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for 1000+ frames
19:19 < bridge_> <learath2> How granular are you? Do you have per function tracing?
19:19 < bridge_> <learath2> It can't however record what actually happened with that one outlier frame
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> every function that is annotated with instrument opens a span that tracks the start time and the end time
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in a tree-like fashion
19:20 < bridge_> <learath2> And how fine grained are you with annotations?
19:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I added more and more to the code base, to debug my problem, it's already pretty fine grained
19:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421547136713101526/image.png?ex=68d96e70&is=68d81cf0&hm=03fb84373af6271268ea2f9b286e2800d54887d73d002d4005666778fd0ba9c7&
19:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I don't annotate external functions ofc, but many if not most of my rendering and update code
19:21 < bridge_> <learath2> Like if every function were annotated it should degrade to callgrind
19:21 < bridge_> <learath2> This is pretty fine actually. Much more than expected
19:22 < bridge_> <learath2> I wonder if there is something similar to tracing in C++
19:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @sollybunny why dont u ask here
19:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno but i always disliked github being a place for questions
19:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that pings all ppl that watch ddnet repo
19:32 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> its not really a question
19:32 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you have to draw quads
19:32 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i know how to add things to draw triangles
19:32 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but adding it would be a pr without an issue
19:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ❓
19:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
19:33 < bridge_> <Assa> yes we can! next question?
19:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I am like super confused
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> look at all instances of `DRAWING_TRIANGLES`
19:34 < bridge_> <Assa> I think he wants to map Triangles like quads
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you never actually get to put triangles into code
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> no
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you always have to draw quads
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> which is ineffecient
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz a quad makes 2 triangles
19:34 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> so to draw a triangle you have to draw 2 triangles
19:35 < bridge_> <Assa> ah I get it, true
19:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait then how does alpha work..
19:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> there might be detection for this
19:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (which is still ineffecient but better)
19:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant find said detection though
19:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
19:36 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> waiiit
19:36 < bridge_> <Assa> the only thing would be checking if the 4th corner equals another in position
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> there is actually some code
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> specific to DRAWING_TRIANGLES
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if(m_Drawing == DRAWING_QUADS)
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> {

19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>     }

19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> no clue how it works
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> how do i draw a triangle then
19:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if you are always passing 4 verts but skipping one thats jank
19:38 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> no that doesnt actually do anything
19:38 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> look at QuadsDrawFreeform
19:38 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the triangle bit just adds 2 triangles
19:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> your question is about odd number of triangles
19:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not about triangles or not
19:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or generally triangles unconnected to each others
19:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> `TrianglesBegin` only allows the caller to manually draw a quad as triangles, it doesn't change that we only allow drawing quads
19:39 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> my questions are now also
19:39 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> * how do quads with a repeated point not cause incorrect alpha and
19:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> * why do we have BeginTriangles if the only thing it does is force triangles
19:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the opriginal "qeustion" is i wana draw triangles pleas
19:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the original "qeustion" is i wana draw triangles pleas
19:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the original "question" is i wana draw triangles pleas
19:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can do that by modifying the code. No need to add it to ddnet code unless there's a use case in ddnet code
19:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wait
19:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have code somewhere
19:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> corners are currently drawn as quads
19:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> which isnt great
19:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but not that bad either
19:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> Makes no difference if you use quads or triangles, does it?
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok cant find xDD
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think i once added that for me somewhere
19:44 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you draw an extra triangle per segment
19:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> `TrianglesBegin` is only used for `CRenderMap::ForceRenderQuads` and for the color selector bars in the skin settings
19:44 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> or feels like you should
19:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then just draw half the segments so you have the same total
19:44 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but in both here and tclient trails it doesnt seem to have overdraw
19:44 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> which is very messy
19:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Not really
19:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421553706188673104/image.png?ex=68d9748e&is=68d8230e&hm=51d3e8aa9cde1f999e76ebfb6600f97d3aa8c3f358f62d0aadb801d70488021d&
19:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and you still draw an extra triangle if its odd
19:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but in both here and tclient trails it doesnt seem to have overdraw (they used triangles by accident)
19:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Don't make it odd
19:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> well true..

21:45 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> random question, has there been tas libraries made

22:07 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Definitely, i am not sure if they're public tho
22:07 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Because the community is very afraid of TASes i guess
22:19 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @tater
22:19 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @totar
22:19 < bridge_> <totar> what
22:19 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** can i dm u pls
22:19 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** can we meet in fng?
22:19 < bridge_> <totar> ok
22:19 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ty
22:20 < bridge_> <totar> which fng
22:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the one where i am
22:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ChillerDragon
22:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 88.198.96.203:8308
22:23 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> probably not, i couldn't find any
22:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> optimized render a bit
22:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421593348216721508/image.png?ex=68d9997a&is=68d847fa&hm=3cb298931565d34d3e91388fbf6433cc910e2a4f4944f82ba039dfb43c0ed2b7&
22:27 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> probably not, i couldn't find any good ones
22:43 < bridge_> <Assa> the problem is, that you won't get a good answer here, since our leaderboards get sometimes flooded with TASes and we are not encouraging writing them
22:47 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> I want to make a volleyball ai lol
22:47 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> im not trying to beat any records
22:47 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> im not trying to beat any records or anything
22:47 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> limited only to fun maps rn
22:48 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> i did find one thing but it's still in progress
22:49 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> i did find one thing but it's still incomplete and not well maintained
22:54 < bridge_> <louis> theres an open source volleyball ai
22:54 < bridge_> <louis> Someone trained some rl bot
22:55 < bridge_> <louis> that's different from TAS though
22:55 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> aww
22:56 < bridge_> <louis> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1393538647164456970
22:56 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> nooo that video was released around the same time i started looking into doing this
22:56 < bridge_> <louis> oh looks like they also beat aip gores with rl
22:56 < bridge_> <louis> PPO op i guess
22:57 < bridge_> <louis> u could try training a dm1 bot that u can play against
22:57 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> whats dm1
22:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** a map
22:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** a standard map
22:57 < bridge_> <louis> a map for deathmatch mode, one of the original gamemodes in teeworlds
22:58 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> eh
22:58 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> i don't play anything except for ddrace type lol
22:58 < bridge_> <Teero> soon
22:59 < bridge_> <Teero> i made a volleyball bot too xd
22:59 < bridge_> <Teero> but it's op

23:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> damn the difference with KVM enabled on qemu
23:02 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> i found twnet_parser python library
23:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i built that uwu
23:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if you have any questions let me know but its not fully done yet -.-
23:06 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> oh yeah youd id
23:07 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> oh yeah you did
23:07 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> yeah i know it's not done which is why i didn'jt do the ai two months ago lol
23:07 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> couldn't really understand the snap single stuff and those packets
23:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ai and datascience with python libs is one of the reasons i built it actually
23:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :brownbear: got a proper mutex that doesnt spin and parks wakes relevant threads
23:18 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> where is this ws-client1 connected to
23:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
23:22 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> wait so is ddnet on 0.6 but custom?
23:24 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yes @12944qwerty
23:24 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> ..
23:24 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But both ddnet server and client can also speak 0.7 plus ddnet extensions
23:25 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It’s just not the default
23:26 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> why gitlab
23:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Only repo I have there actually
23:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> To try it out and not have everything on GitHub
23:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Because GitHub does randomly ban accounts
23:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And is owned by Microsoft
23:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I don’t like how dependent I am on this proprietary piece of random bans
23:30 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> never heard of a random ban there before
23:31 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> imm try this twnetparsing stuff again, see why i stopped i forgot lol
23:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> a huge problem is that snaps are not done yet
23:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what are you working on @12944qwerty ?
23:33 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> imma continue on the volleyball ai still
23:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i got like 3 gh accounts banned
23:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and swarfey too!
23:33 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> yeah, that's where i stopped yeah
23:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** !ping
23:33 < chillerbot> pong
23:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** !remind add snaps to twnet_parser
23:33 < chillerbot> Helo ChillerDragon I will remind you at Sun Sep 28 2025 23:33:42 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
23:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait i wanna do it first thing in the morning
23:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** !remind 500 add snaps to twnet_parser
23:34 < chillerbot> Helo ChillerDragon I will remind you at Sun Sep 28 2025 07:54:32 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
23:36 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> lmao
23:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero omg i got it to work cute leia-uwu coded toggle record button for me xd
23:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/leia-uwu/obs-wayland-hotkeys/commit/28a2410d73b2e4f813af8777f88764a383a7fa53
23:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i love open source
23:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** she seems to be the coding socks kinda gal
23:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** obs, vlc and wireshark all seems to have such great plugin support for loading .so files
23:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i need that for ddnet so bad
