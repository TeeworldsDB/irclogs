02:48 <@deen> i downgraded ddnet ger and prolonged for a month. anyone know if the deutsche telekom network problems still occur?
09:54 <@EastByte> deen: okay thanks; no, I havn't noticed the ping problems recently
10:38 <@deen> if anyone wants to make ddnet releases, it should be pretty easy thanks to the nightly builds
10:39 <@deen> hm, no, on mac os x that wouldn't work.^^

17:26 <@EastByte> hi o_be_two 
17:26 <@EastByte> hm vertical utf8 still appearing?
17:45 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: do you have any log for that?
17:45 <@EastByte> nope :/
17:46 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: are there server logs? perhaps you can find it there
17:47 <@EastByte> yep, I will try some searching
17:56 <@EastByte> hm I was too late it seems, can't find the logs of the screen
20:16 < Henningstone> maybe add this to ddnet client too, would be cool: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/e7534094abfe4a2733af15a9a115b92c1c5d63d5
20:19 < Henningstone> shouldn't be more than a cherry-pick
20:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame closed pull request #344: show if user has rank on map in browser (+filter) (master...hasrank) http://git.io/vcNew
20:44 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: looks like 0.7, which is sdl 2 IIRC?
20:44 < Henningstone> of cause, but i thought that ddnet ported too? am i wrong with this?
20:47 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/305
20:48 < Henningstone> oh damn, ddnet *wants* to port... my mistake. wait, I'll test smth
20:56 < Henningstone> nah shit. Than maybe remember it until ddnet gets ported, if it'll ever happen.
20:59 <@heinrich5991> you could post the link to the commit in that pull request
20:59 <@heinrich5991> just for reference
21:02 < Henningstone> did so.
21:05 <@heinrich5991> thanks
