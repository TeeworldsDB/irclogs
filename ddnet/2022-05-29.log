00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> hey is there a way to send commands to a running server from a script? I would like to send /reload when the map file changes on disk
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can use fifo file
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sv_input_fifo server.fifo in your server config, then you can write rcon commands into it: `echo broadcast hello > server.fifo`
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It should exist an headless client, ready to use
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Unix fifo is nice! Didn't know it exist
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> oho really nice way of doing it! thanks
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (doesn't work on windows)
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> who cares üòÇ
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> mkfifo server.fifo
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nohup ./DDNet-Server "sv_input_fifo server.fifo" &
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> echo "command" > server.fifo
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet server creates the fifo itself too, no need to manually create
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> actually, does DDNet-Server accepts commands in command line?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah nice
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and deletes after shutdown, so you don't end up writing into an unconnected fifo
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the fifos were probably the second thing I added after fixing the obvious cheats, so that we can run DDNet official servers at all
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> what you mean I can write commands in the running server terminal?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> oh no ok
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, you can give command when starting the server
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> could be nice tough, I know e.g. minecraft servers can
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not sure we want to reinvent the wheel
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> yay super cool !

00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> can anyone answer me collision questions?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> * default hook length is 380.0 i read in the wiki. from where to where is that? middle of the hooking tee? or on the outline?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> * what is a unit? how does it translate to pixel?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> * what is the ddfat (hook hitbox of tee) diameter in units?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> * is the hook hitbox of tees a round circle? (ddfat skins are not round)?
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cool, a new map editor?
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddfat is just a fun way to make the tees look, it does not illustrate anything üòÑ
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (no idea about the other questions)
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> .
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> really?, because i read that on the wiki
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> > To see how big the actual hit box of tees are, you can turn on "fat skins" in Settings -> Tee -> Fat skins (DDFat).
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Another option is ECON.
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Long story short:
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> ```
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> COMMAND=$@
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> printf "$EC_PASSWORD\n$COMMAND\n" | nc $EC_CONNADDR $EC_PORT -q 1
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> ```
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I chose the size for fat tees based on what looks funny, so if it's close to the hit box, that's coincidence
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Another option is ECON.
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Long story short:
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> ```
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> COMMAND=$@
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> printf "$EC_PASSWORD\n$COMMAND\n" | nc $EC_CONNADDR $EC_PORT -q 1

00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> can anyone answer me collision questions?

00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Very cool project @k2d222 . Collaborative mapping üôÇ
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> so the hookcollline, does it start from middel of tee, or from the outline? in other words, is the hookrange radius of some tee box.. + hook length, well i'll just assume from middle
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> center
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> couldn't we use steam cloud to store client settings to fix this issue? you don't need ingame accounts for that https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5270
03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> better suggest it directly in the issue, it will probably get lost here üôÇ
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> it's like dotifles in my opinion, but demo hub would be nice like skins.tw for demos
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.speedrun.com/ddracenetwork_ddnet
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nobody uploaded their run üò¶
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> can you upload demos there too?
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> as proof
05:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think speedrun.com is usually only used for games without in-game speedrun leaderboards
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and then usually only for special categories, which don't exist in-game
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki  happy birthday:feelsamazingman:
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> hm...

09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> no
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> fine
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> thanks
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> em,it is in the ddnet
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> who want to play minecraft
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It has already been closed, he cannot add anything üòÅ
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> what?
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> That was a message for Chairn actually.
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I don't play minecraft
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> oh,that's fine

09:50 <+ChillerDragon> Hi its me again. The nagging downstream maintainer!
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Teeworlds and minecraft share the same block-by-block map approach.
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It would be a nice mod, MineTeeCraft.
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Just don't say it to @fokkonaut, or he will code it next weekend ü§£
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 2. A tile is 32 physic units wide and high and has 64x64 pixels, so 1 unit translates to 2 pixels
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 1. default hook length is 380 and it's a server tuning. So you can hook 380/32 = 11.875 tiles wide
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 3. A tee has a diameter of 28 units
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 4. yes, the **hook** hitbox is round (other then the collision hitbox)
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> Any chance we could introduce deprecation into ddnet when there is bigger api changes? like removing `sorted_array` for example https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5252 instead of throwing an compile error that it does not exits one could throw and warning that it will be removed in a future version
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <È∫¶Â∫ÜÂïÜ> üò≤
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: Why? Just don't upgrade your mod to latest DDNet for a while if you think it's too much effort right now
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 2. A tile is 32 physic units wide and high and has 64x64 pixels, so 1 unit translates to 2 pixels
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 1. default hook length is 380 and it's a server tuning. So you can hook 380/32 = 11.875 tiles far
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 3. A tee has a diameter of 28 units
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> 4. yes, the **hook** hitbox is round (other then the collision hitbox)
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> deen it would nice if one can still update without getting build errors. Also imo its much more chill to fix warnings than errors.
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> would it to bee too much overhead to delete the `tl/array.h` a bit later? and put some #message pre compiler warnings in there?
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, then we have to keep unused code around and maintain and fix it
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and set dates for when to remove it
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> no it should not be maintained
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> just keep it until it breaks or latest next ddnet release
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that effort is worth it for widely used libraries, but not for DDNet, which is used by maybe 3 mods that update regularly
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> yea one can still ask
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> if i would pr it would it be merged?
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think so.
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> ok sad
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> time to create a new ddnet fork then :D
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> the stable api ddnet fork haha
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> the sad part about this, is that only 3 update **regularly**
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> yea i really have to think about something. I became a fulltime git conflict solver in my free time
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> it works as long as its fun and im activley doing it. But returning from a break of doing it would probably cause an frustrating amount of work just to merge in all the latest stuff
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> @Assa i merge ddnet more often than i brush my teeth
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> Teeth are expensive! Keep that in mind
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt insurance cover that?
10:09 <+ChillerDragon> @my_insurance im just trolling please do not raise the price. I brush my teeth every day!
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> better cleanup ddnet now than never
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> stability slows down progress ur right
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> stoopid vscode cmake syntax highlighter thinks the file path is syntax
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1653812154.png
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> dont ask me how i found out
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> i will write an angry letter to bill gates now
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not the cmake extension from microsoft
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> it is
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the one from microsoft does no syntax checks or anything
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> i got community and microsoft
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its your first extension
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> a
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> ok
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> fuck alr sent letter
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> that syntax highlighter is only lexical, not syntaxic (it only recognises words) 
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> syntaxic highlighters are much harder to produce and often not worth it
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just throw some electron devs against it and it works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
10:20 <+ChillerDragon> more like dislexical
10:20 <+ChillerDragon> axaxaxaxaxax
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so why did components drink ddnet devs chillerdragon?
10:22 <+ChillerDragon> its me working on a new feature branch called "conflicts"
10:22 <+ChillerDragon> its not going well so far
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just add back the removed files for your mod?
10:23 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1653812577.png
10:23 <+ChillerDragon> i am thinking about writing my own merge driver
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes pls reinvent git
10:24 <+ChillerDragon> on it
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and call it svn
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
10:24 <+ChillerDragon> i was about to make that joke
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> nah git is rly cool
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> it lets you run shell scripts on conflict
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> and shell scripts obv being shell scripts can ez solve conflicts
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git is cool bcs its an insult
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> wat where?
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> git gud
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so when i say
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chillerdragon git
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont even notice
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> ?!
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> where is the insult
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/git#Noun
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> wat
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> da
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> fok
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> EVEN MORE SEVERE THAN TWIT
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> arsehole xd i always thought thats an typo
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar but do insults work if nobody gets them? i mean it does not even sound rude
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> isnt that the good part
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they dont even notice xd
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> wew
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shouldn't happen for demo player. can you create an issue?
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i assume its bcs of the skin downloader or smth
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think Zwelf is working on a teehistorian replayer
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's actually pretty much the tee-hook hitbox, it's funny that you chose that accidentally. I know some people using this
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, a tile is 32 physics units wide. it doesn't have a pixel size. the default tilesets are 64x64 pixels, but that isn't hardcoded into ddnet/teeworlds
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you can just keep tl/array.h in your mod longer, no need to delete it from your mod as well
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's supposed to happen on connection start, so probably the demo player signals something similar
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea i guess thats true
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> i mean in this case i already fixed it all. Im just talking about in general. But yea in such a case I can just re add old function signatures. But that gets quite messy
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v just wanted to mention that
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> "a other" is wrong, you should use another
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> saw it multiple times now from you so thats just why i lyk
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> what about rebranding the antibot thing into a generic plugin api? It has so many hooks one can build other stuff than antibot with it. Then we could add support for multiple plugins at once and hot plugging... and voila we got the minecraft plugin system that we love.
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> Imagine how fun it would be if i as a use could browse the interwebs and download some sketchy ddnet-animal-crossing-nota-avirus.exe from mediafire and just drag'n drop that into my ddnet plugins/ folder type "reload" in f2 and hope for the best
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> user*

16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pls also add a mod-to-plugin-converter-avirus.exe so i dont have to rewrite f-ddrace as a plugin
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> thanks. 3. thee hook hitbox or tee visibility?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> thanks. 3. tee hook hitbox or tee visibility?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> tried to understand collision.cpp and find the numbers
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> how to show ddr hud on non ddr servers?
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> or can we auto show it on BW pls?

18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> skin calculation is weird
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i might actually conduct experiments on how color calculation works in ddnet, if it isnt done already
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Voxel there is an online skin renderer. But i forgot who made it
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> does it use the same code?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Alexander_ (this guy made it
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Hi whats up
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> https://teeassembler.developer.li/
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Alexander_ read these few last messagesüòâ

18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ü§î
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i mean for code that puts the colors on the skin
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i think my code works, @Voxel maybe you can test with teeworlds data bot
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah i just said it because you made the code that my website uses
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and it should work fine
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> :greenthing:
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> xd and i use ur code to render my skins on the discord bridge

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y weird
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> i only saw the one you made and refigured it into an api

19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Btw
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> my code colors the tee parts and puts it back into the skin file
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> b0ths renders it into an image
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> b0ths renders it into an image that resembles the tee
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so your api would benefit more from b0ths tw-utils
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yes i have done a feature to save it as a file but you still have access to the canva data
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> yea
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> maybe i will rewrite it one day into using tw-utils
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> but for now i think im gonna keep it and never look at it again <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x))
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> @Alexander_ can I beg for a star on the repository :'D?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> sure
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> btw deen starred my repo xd
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> xd achievement done
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> my life can end now
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> eheh
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its real
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> deen star my repo too pls, if you do it i can die in peace
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> custom color first average on the skin, so the resolution might change base color
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @Voxel did you try it on the website?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So I did a little experiment with how colors are dealt with in DDNet, and the results are a bit shocking:
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> TL: The Base sprite I used, a 96x96 px square, and a 12x8 grid of all CMYK maximums and Shade/Tint with an interval of 20%
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> TR: A control point for saturation. When the differences are compared with a grayscale version of the base sprite, it should all be black.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> BL: A screenshot of the base sprite ingame, with custom colors turned on. H: 0, S: 0, L:128 (50%)
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> BR: The difference between the control and the screenshot. Very drastic changes, especially in the near black range.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980525321830952970/unknown.png
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Not yet, I just wanted to figure out the differences in saturation first.
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Alright
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I wish DDNet kept relative saturations when it came to recoloring. Because as it is right now, all of the colors that change meld into a muddy grey, and end up looking really poor, especially white. I don't know why white changes color.
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I agree
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But I guess that's just how it is
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> white changes color because they re map the colors based of the average greyscale from what i understood
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> 192?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> is that it?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> does this mean if i make a pure white tee it would not change color?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> the reorderBody() function
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh no my bad
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> if you apply a color it will be grey because skin cannot be 100% black or white
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i mean, it will be grey if you have 255,255,255 (hsl)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> 255,255,255 wont be white
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980527896751923270/unknown.png
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yes
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its light grey
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I just have one question
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> why doesnt the `reorderBody()` function do it for the feet
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> idk
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> tw decided it x)
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it didnt even turn HALFTONE when i set it to half lightness. it just became 44%
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980528256623181884/unknown.png
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> tw skin color are special üòÑ
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> tw skin colors are special üòÑ
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> bruh
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Lightness at 0 makes it 62% black
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Lightness at 255 makes it 25% black
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980529026223468555/unknown.png
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it didnt even turn HALFTONE when i set it to half lightness. it just became 44% black
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980528256623181884/unknown.png
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think it ignores natural differences in brightness of different hues, and then finds some average of all pixels' lightness value
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> white_greyfox skin isnt even white, it's `#fefefe`
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this is the skin i use
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980529199590813740/exper_white.png
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also what do you mean? it CAN be 100% black, just not 99% black
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> it cant be black
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> there is a limit
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> if the default color is black
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> then if you apply 0,0,0 it will be black
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> but if the default color isnt black, you skin cant be black
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> just dark grey because there is a limit
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> but only in the color chooser in settings? not if you 'hardcode' it?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> even if you hardcode it via the in game condole it wont be black
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> console*
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> the darkest a skin can be is:
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> HSL: 0¬∞,0%,50%
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> the darkest a skin can be is:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> HSL: 0¬∞, 0% ,50%
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> the darkest a skin can be is:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> HSL: 0¬∞, 0%, 50%
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> when you apply colors
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> nvm, you're right, but i did a teamcolors branch and could make it all white or black
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh y, of course if you edit the source code everything is possible x)
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980533507891814430/blackwhite.png
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> the white still doesn't look 100% white to me
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yes, it looks like light grey
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> custom color doesn't allow every color
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it depends on the base skin average color
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this average color is then turned to grey, and this grey is then colorized according to custom color
