08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Since the file ranks changed to sqllite3, you cant use any test cmds and the ranks get Not saved
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Or is there are New config for that
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> that is not new why would you want to save cheated runs?

10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neiral> whenever i "windows+P" my screen and change the setting to sth else and teeworlds is open i cant get into teeworlds anymore. is that worth a fix?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have a X on "save the best demo of each race" but it does not do that
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does it do instead?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not save any demo by itself
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> seems like i can only save every single session i play or none at all.
