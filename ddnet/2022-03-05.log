06:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> @Ryozuki we want to make a cached mirror of ddnet's wiki within the teeworlds.cn domain so we can register it with tencent to allow their users to access it with in their products (QQ/wechat etc)
06:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> does that sound ok?
06:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> because they only accept domains that are registered in china bt
06:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> because they only accept domains that are registered in china btw
08:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> As long as it conforms to cc-by-sa you can do whathever you want
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Note that you may be able to use the wiki api to gather data easier, but idk how it works
09:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just over read it somewhere about archive.org using it
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Oops, two people with different solutions for the same problem ðŸ˜‰
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> We can still use urs additionally
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> other languages are also broken
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats why i chose a more general approach

11:04  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki- around a bit with a large fishbot
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> Ok. I was thinking about straight up mirrored site. Maybe keep the edit and login link to ddnet.tw
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> If a player finishes with the exact time, name and server in team. Their name will be added multiple times in the leader board. Could probably be fixed by also grouping by the timestamp. This bug can be seen here\: https://ddnet.tw/maps/NUT-95-short-95-race6
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> huh, haven't seen this before
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> The problem comes from him having lots of the same times with regular ranks, and one of them being a team rank
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> would be clean to join for that based on timestamp, but the problem is that we didn't guarantee exact same timestamps for record_race and record_teamrace for a few years in the beginning. So this might break some old ranks being displayed
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> fixed
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Well, there's also a different issue. Where the entire top20 isn't displayed. Which could now be seen on that page aswell
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> what do you mean? I see the top 20
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you mean the count only goes to 13? That's because 7 teams have the exact same time and thus all of them are 13.
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ah, actually only 5
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok ðŸ˜„
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Yep \:D
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> The query right now is `select distinct r.Name, r.ID, r.Time, r.Timestamp, SUBSTRING(n.Server, 1, 3) from ((select distinct ID from record_teamrace where Map = 'NUT_short_race6' ORDER BY Time limit 20) as l) left join record_teamrace as r on l.ID = r.ID inner join record_race as n on r.Map = n.Map and r.Name = n.Name and r.Time = n.Time and r.GameID = n.GameID order by r.Time, r.ID, r.Name;`. Not sure why some of the distinct IDs from record_
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Well, if you don't have a fix. I guess it's best to revert to the old way of doing it, as most old maps now only show around 7 teams.

17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> why servers only max at 64 players can't it be like 128 ? any ideas from game developers ?
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mostly because we felt 64 people are enough, secondarily because 64 bits is the largest portably supported integer size. Beyond that we'd need to change our integer team masks and stuff into bitsets, which has performance implications. Furthermore the O(n^2) nature of some of the code starts to rear it's ugly head. Not that they cant be optimized but that we didn't think >64p is worth the effort

17:48 <+Konsti> fokkonaut allows 128 players
17:49 <+Konsti> some maps would really fit for it
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> Hi, I'm trying to build ddnet on ubuntu (wsl), but I got an error, do you know what I'm doing wrong?
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> I have ddnet with ddnet-libs cloned.
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/949713293440864287/cmake_command.txt
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> You're missing the video rendering dependencies, you can either disable it with `cmake -DVIDEORECORDER=OFF ..` or download the following packages\: `libx264-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-extra libavutil-dev`
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> Nice, works now. Thank you. Installed the dependencies.
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i didn't understand the second part as i don't know how the game code look like but if it's possible to increase it i think it would be great to add this option because some maps like multieasy map has  a lot of players and as a player i'm not gonna join other server that has only few people while the other server has all the fun in it but the problem is that it's full 
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> 
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> if you afraid that the server is crowded  but not all players at the same spot you have playground and you have the race area so it's 2 different areas 
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> like 2 servers in 1 server
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and also i would like to ask why i can only see 2 servers in my server list ?  and the refresh button takes like 1 minute to do it's job
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> what about the ddos thing ? is there is any solution for it ? because that's a big trouble and make players leave the game and hate it 
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> 
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> imagine trying to move and u freeze while racing and the game kicks you or you in the middle of a fight
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> any solutions for ddos attacks ?
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean why are you using hetzner they  don't have any ddos protection
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> there is a lot of hosting providers have very good ddos protection can't you just transfer the servers ?
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is sort of insulting that you think we in 10 years of running this didn't think of "getting ddos protection" :D
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> nah i'm not insulting or anything i'm taking about a serious problem here that's so annoying for ddnet community
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> just trying to brainstorm if there is any solutions
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just not as simple as "get ddos protection" what kind of protection matters much more. OVH has excellent ddos protection, they just block all UDP traffic on our ports, then no one can play. It does technically solve the issue
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean first of all why are you using hetzner i know they are cheap but they have no ddos protection
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> well you can go to firewall settings and allow that port !
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it's so simple
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hetzner while having not much of a ddos protection (they do catch simple tcp syn and stuff) actually allow us to use our entire 1g link
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> tcp syn ack whatever is not really important since we are talking about game server right here which most of the traffic are UDP
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, not so simple. As the filters trigger on even the allowed ports. The filters just dont understand the teeworlds protocol, it works better for mainstream games like csgo
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> ovh also allows you to use 1Gb uplink you can also upgrade to 2 or 3 or even 10Gbps if you like
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We used all tiers of ovh service. They have extremely aggressive filters that leave us even unable to ssh into the server during attacks
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> if the filters trigger then you can have a little chat with the technical team open a ticket they will adjust the firewall threshold for you
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> may i know what was the configuration you had ?
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> go to game firewall settings type ddnet port range then choose "other" it will get fixed
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen probably remembers better. But we used servers from SYS, Kimisufi, OVH directly for months
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i'm beta tester with ovh and also a reseller partner i have been there for 3 years
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We also tried their GAME line with the supposedly smarter filter
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it's not smarter it's basically some filters to adapt to specific popular game servers to prevent bypasses ..etc
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> like ark minecraft teamspeak 3
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it's not smarter it's basically some filters to adapt to specific popular game servers to prevent bypasses ..etc ( game profiles )
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aka, smart... Aware of the protocol, unlike dumb filters which dont care about the specifics of the protocol
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, if you can convince deen the 7th time we use OVH is the charm, we can give it another go
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i know 2 people working in the technical team in OVH
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i'm assure there is an absolute way to solve your issue getting the firewall to trigger at the allowed ports as you mentioned
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you just have to message them telling them what you use these ports for and they will adjust the filters for specifically for your application
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> which in this case is the ddnet server
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The reality is there is just no filtering 10gbps of udp traffic without knowing the details of the protocol. And no hoster will give us access to their firewalls with much larger uplinks where we could actually filter this
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yeah of course he won't give you access to the firewall but they can adjust it for you if you need
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No one has filters for the ddnet server. They would have to be written just for us
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they don't have filters for ddnet yet and they won't do it unless ddnet is so f popular like mc and csgo ..etc
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The guys at secured.gg gave it a go, and it was a decent attempt, but they just had other issues
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> but the good thing that they have a very good standard protection
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it will prevent like 80% of the attack and even the volume attacks
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> the other 20% you can do it yourself using a cisco firewall you can order it through the control panel
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> or you can apply a software firewall rules  to meet your requirements
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> By preventing 80% of attacks they are eating legitimate packets. It's just unacceptable. The firewall cant possibly distinguish between a valid ddnet packet and a udp flood that looks like one
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It needs to track connections if it wants to have any chance at making sure player traffic is uninterrupted
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's why i told you  that you have to talk with them open a ticket so they can adjust the filters for you
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you can send a pcap file of the legitimate traffic for ddnet also
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I said if you can convince deen to put more money towards ovh once again we can give it a try
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i think his afk when he can talk then we can have a little chat  i can help you to setup the correct firewall rules and contact the technical team to adjust it to make sure ddnet traffic is not affected
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It just sounds silly to me that a billion dollar companies tech team would even waste the time on digging through our pcap files
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> so that i and other players can play ddnet with no down time as players do and blackmail ..blah blah blah
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> OVH is very good at this it's one of the companies that has so much network capacity they also have a great team for network department
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they do it for every customer to make them stay and make sure there is no any problems with the traffic flow
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean of course it's just one of the team gonna take a look and adjust it for you not the company founder lmao
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> GER3 is on google cloud, which has an even larger network. Network capacity doesnt really mean much unless you get access to upstream filtering
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> each customer on ovh gets around 4000Gbps filtering
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's written in their docs
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> but i actually didn't test that before cuz i didn't get any attacks bigger than 160Gbps
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, filtering that is not controlled much by us at all. Unless the tech team actually cares about adjusting filters for us that doesnt mean much either
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it's not about the network capacity your not correct about this because if the network capacity is lower than the attack size your fucked
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> even if the filters are working very good
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you won't be able to handle it
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most hosters have huge network capacities far beyond our attackers capacities
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yes but not all of them use it the right way just nulling your server doesn't mean it's ddos protection
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> even on the 10Gbps plan which costs 35 euro / month
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> with 20TB traffic
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> the traffic will get fucked up because the filters is not working there is no protection
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you will even have to pay more for the traffic if  the attackers kept attacking your servers
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's of course if the server can handle all this requests without getting overwhelmed
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hetzner doesn't null since almost 2010 btw. That's just bad pr from way back in the day
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it doesn't but your server is just going down anyway with 1Gbps and with 10Gbps it won't go down unless the attacker have more power
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> but that's worse as i mentioned
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you have only 20TB bandwidth
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Paying for more bandwidth indeed doesnt work. We'd need some insane plan like a 1g network that allows us to burst to 200g during an attack :P
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's not how it's fixed
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and there is no company will do that for you
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> even getting 200Gbps uplink is not a professional solution right here
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> depending on the type of that attack
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already said it's insane... Okay I get the feeling you are treating me like I have brain damage or something and I'm quite bored of this
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> after you fix the bandwidth issue it will move on to be a hardware issue
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> cpu and ram won't handle all the requests
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> lol
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :kek:
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> nope i'm not
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i have an idea before we talk with deen
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://hookrace.net/blog/dos-attacks-against-online-game/
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here is all the things we tried. If you think you can solve it talk to @deen
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> I'm wondering is all servers listed in ddnet tab are your servers ? or other people can add servers also ?
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have other things to do then being treated like an idiot on a subject I spent half a decade trying to fix
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> if i can host my own server and it will show up on ddnet tab i can do that right now and test it
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet tab is all ours. There is no point hosting your own as you won't get half the attacks we do. Even more popular servers like nobies gets a fraction
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> wtf are you sending email to hetzner support
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :kek:
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they will tell you what is port your using and they will do nothing
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> xD
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> hes a ovh partner hes trying to sell u servers to get a bonus :troll:
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and i see your using software firewall which is not the best solution for filtering udp traffic ( attacks )
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> lmao no
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also remember that we are on a budget. Can't afford 400â‚¬ a month for a hw firewall
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i'm just trying to help to fix this issue i'm also a ddnet player
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i see
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> when deen come we can talk i also can message my friends on ovh team to see what is the best solution
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean that's very sad even mods can't ban that guy because it will make him more angry = more attacks
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :justatest:
18:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i used to get banned on ddnet when someone dmed me a link for that hacked client
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i don't even know what did he inject to it  :kek:
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> not all hackers do these things for free he might inject a payload or rat or  a logger whatever
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> @deenWAkeee up
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> we are under attack
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :kek:
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> Now I'm trying to build ddnet for windows on ubuntu, but it gives an error.

18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> and then `make -j(nproc)`.
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> Any ideas?

18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> OVH is pretty bad at UDP
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> only if you host with game & services that are "compatible" like arma
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> ovh has many customers running game servers and applications using udp protocol they have mentioned that the service is working great 
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> 
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you can see here https://www.reddit.com/r/ovh/comments/lw48ha/how_well_does_ovh_mitigate_udp_floods/
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1. make sure u have up to date ubuntu
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2. use posix alternatives, search update alternatives for mingw
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> if your application requires specific adjustments like i told learath you have to talk to them they will adjust it for u
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes like waiting 5 months till they adjust
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> for teeworlds I had too many issues with them
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And iirc you ran one of the more successful tw servers on ovh, mostly due to lucking into a 10g link :P
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> depending on which department and working days but usually technical support you will get a response within 48 hours you can also make a phone call if you don't want to wait on the list
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they provide many support options you can get the premium one 60$ / month
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and toll-free number for technical assistant will be avail for 24/7
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mea
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> technical assistant has a note of 2/5 stars for many reasons
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fun-fact, 60$/mo was like a third of the budget this game ran on for it's first 5 years
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ovh's support is the worst one
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I havent had to deal with them so I wouldnt know
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> every startup is like this when i first started doing my business i didn't get any profit i actually paid more lmao
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i disagree with you maybe your experience is different than me i'm not sure but for me they are working great
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The difference is we dont have a profit motive, nor any income streams besides donations :D
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> then you have to develop the game and add more features maybe paid advantages like colors names prefixes packages whatever
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> open a patreon
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's not start this one again. None of us want this, neither does the community for the most part
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it's not pay to win
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And @Ryozuki would be mad
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i'm just talking about some advantages like discord you can have that nitro
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @EarthQuake bro, on trustpilot OVH has a very bad note, sometimes they even just copy paste answers from another comments, it already happened that they forgot to change the name in their comment response
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> wtf
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> don't mention like this use the reply button please
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :justatest:
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they don't care at all
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's probably some things that are cool at OVH, like their game solutions, OVH Game works very well, and many games nowadays that OVH supports, a lot of people do use OVH services to protect themselves
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> when did this happen ? i mean a lot of stuff improved but they have their own survey rating
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but the support, the api, and some other things
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's horrible
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> do you use ovh currently ?
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> not a long time ago, Mr_Anderson showed me, but I can't find it
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sure, my server is hosted at OVH
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sure, my server is hosted by OVH
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (well I have a dedicated)
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> okay so what is your problem right now i can help you to get it fixed
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Ask them to tell people when they shut down the wrong server because of a maintenance
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Had to check logs last time
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the API, you can create tokens, but you have to use the API to delete tokens, what a shame
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the API, you can create tokens, but you have to use the API to delete tokens, what a shame (application keys)
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> maybe that's a typo on trustpilot but their main support platform is their website you can just open a ticket instead on trustpilot
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Last time I've asked them to stop rate limit IPs because vali was spoofing player's IPs
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I had to wait 4 months to finally get something working
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And even now there's still some players that gets rate limited for no reason when vali does attack my server
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's a security feature i  would assume you can create api keys from the api gateway  and there you can specify the options like how long do you need it and some other stuff
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> wtf
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean on any other website giving access to an API, you can easily manage your API keys and just delete one easily if needed
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just by asking the password or 2FA is easy to set up
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yeah but creating an api key from api key is  weirdo  and might be a security gap
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Here no, you have to go on the console page, find the api id or idk how it is named, and then search the option to delete the API
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well I almost gave up with all that months I had to wait
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> do you mean by posix alternatives other linux distributions? I will try to use archlinux. And I want to crosscompile for windows, so what else can I use? clang?...
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> clang works too to compile for windows yes
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is Wclang which helps you
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Not Keks what you said is written here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14191566/c-mutex-in-namespace-std-does-not-name-a-type
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (just to say)
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yeah you can delete but creating is might be a security gap if you know what i mean
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> what application are you running ?
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> creating is way easier than deleting lol
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> teeworlds server? xD
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it's not about the difficulty it's about the security and protection creating api's from api key is different from deleting
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> imagine someone just get to know your api he can create another one and endless number of api's
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> imagine someone just get to know your api he can create another one and endless number of api keys
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they just ask you your password so well, don't think having a panel where you can manage your api keys is less "secure"
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> because on the api gateway if someone logged in using your credentials it will email you a code to give him to be able to use your account
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yes
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> lol
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> never seen that
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> try open your account from different device
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> on the api page?
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig it wouldn't be the case as I'm using 2FA
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yeah and also on the ovh control panel
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> even without enabling 2fa
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well then you're special lol cuz when recently I had 2FA off it wasn't the case at all
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i tried this like 2 weeks ago it asked me for otp code sent on email
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i don't have 2fa enabled
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you just put it one time to trust that device
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> like facebook does
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> i'll disable 2FA
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean don't disable it lol just leave it on it's good
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> just make sure it's enabled and everything is working
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'll just test, then put it back
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> okay but make sure you use a different device
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sure, I have a new phone
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean make sure the ip changes because if it's on the same ip that your using from ur pc this not gonna work
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes i'm using my 5G net now
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> okay test
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then they added that recently lol cuz this wasn't here before
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> i'm a customer since years now
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> it worked for u ?
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also having an interface to manage your api keys can still be protected by a code sent by mail lol, there's no excuse for OVH to not have smth like that
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you can open a ticket about this if there is any workaround they will tell you if there is no so it's just a security feature like i told you
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also when the api doesn't work well & gives you shit values, you have to pay to get support lol
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's a customer feature, that's stupid af
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> nah you don't have to pay unless you need more support features like phone support or enterprise
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Mr_Anderson, the guy hosting master2 and master3.teeworlds.com had that answer from the support
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> wtf that's my first time i know this you can just open a ticket and they will fix it for you
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> what did he ask anyway ?
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> api problems ?
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah, the api was like broken & was returning completly different values than expected
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> he asked them to check & fix that, they said "you have to get the enterprise support"
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (forgot rly, was some time ago, but it was similar to ^)
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's weird ...
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> because the free support you can just open a ticket they will fix your problem you don't have to get the enterprise one
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well sometimes they just tell you shit so
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> you can just phone call and ask why you have to pay for that
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> or at least they can show you where is that written in the policy or the contract
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean every place there is pros and cons there is no ultimate solution for everything you gonna get into problems  but depends if you know what are you doing
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> please remove this mention it's so creepy
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i hate blue mention names
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :justatest:
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's a discord feature
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> but replies is more elegant feature
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bro, on trustpilot OVH has a very bad note, sometimes they even just copy paste answers from another comments, it already happened that they forgot to change the name in their comment response
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> : (
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/949736969917829210/unknown.png
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i hate this
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also for teeworlds the protection is not that useful at OVH
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :f4:
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> disabling their anti-ddos is even better against vali :issou:
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> :feelsbadman:
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> when did this happen ?
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> was 2months before the OVH fire (my server is in SBG-3)
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> lol
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> there is so many improvements for the filters i mean 4 months is long af i wouldn't wait all this time
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i would just tell them to fix this problem
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> the filters should lock to the first ip at least
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and also there is other methods for protecting against ip spoofing
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> if you still have this problem i can help you to contact the network department to fix it
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well I don't need tho
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> The best protection against ip spoofing
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is to tell all those idiots on the internet to set up BCP38
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ask ovh to set up teeworlds in OVH Game
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> that's a huge change in the world lmao
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and it will come with some limitations
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's no limitations
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> lol they won't
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they only do it for popular games as a mentioned like so well known games
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> there is companies will have to register leases to customers on dynamic ip
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the goal of bcp38 is to filter outgoing traffic, checking if src IP doesn't belong to your network
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's no limitation to that
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> what network ? your isp asn or what do you mean ?
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> can be everything lol, I mean for example OVH would kick your ass for sending traffic with an IP that OVH doesn't own, an easy example is 8.8.8.8
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yeah that would require a huge change to the internet isp's and for example if your isp trying to give you dynamic ip  they have to register it for your device
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no as they can just filter on asbr
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and also it's a huge change to the internet but there's no excuse for each isp etc.. to not do it
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> only incompetence
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> EarthQuake\: you forgot suggesting an account system \:D
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> I'm switching to msys2 now.
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> I'm switching to msys2 now. not
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I only skimmed the conversation, but why should OVH be better this time compared to the last 50 servers we had with them? @EarthQuake 
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> We also still have DDNet FRA and DDNet CAN at OVH.
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> From my experience their support is somewhere between non-existent to bad. It took me many many hours in a phone loop to get someone on the phone.
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I tried getting a dedicated 10 gbit/s server there, but apparently in the meantime they switched them to 1 gbit/s, so that failed. I think the cheapest 10 gbit/s servers are ~500 â‚¬ / month now, so out of reach for us.
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> And FRA and CAN we only have because Davide gave them to us for free, will shut them down after that
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> oh, and POL
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Learning dictionaries, cuz I'm too lazy making export variables better :pepedead:
