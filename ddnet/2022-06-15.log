01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v in #5259 you didnt apply the velocity using clampvel as before, why? isnt that a physics change?
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5259
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen wait !!!
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v we need the ability to adjust the ddrace hud from the server before the release!!
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pls :C
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> GameInfoEx flags

05:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any way to quickly reload mapres?
05:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be nice for drawing mapres and reloading them to see the changes in-game quicker
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i just replace it with the same file
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah thats the fastest way i know
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its a bit annoying with a lot of reloads + if you have folders inside the mapres folder
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> showing heatbox.
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> hehe)
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @fokkonaut\: yea seeing spawn weapon ammo on fddrace in ddrace hud would be nice
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the value was before NaN and therefor not clamp... so I did copy the behaviour
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can weit till 16.3.
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You requested before that to move ddnet char display info to ddnet character ... thats what I'm working on, before I add the other flags
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can wait till 16.3.
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You requested before that to move ddnet char display info to ddnet character ... thats what I'm working on, before I add the other flags
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @louis how do you like this size for the dummy actions:
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986556926630461490/unknown.png
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> its 2 units bigger, and on margin on the sides 1 unit bigger
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd joppey it broke again `error: cannot convert â€˜std::chrono::nanosecondsâ€™ {aka â€˜std::chrono::duration<long int, std::ratio<1, 1000000000> >â€™} to â€˜intâ€™ in assignment`
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> wat an pain of a error message
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> oke fixed in 2 min but still -.-
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Not my fault
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> u changed the `Now` thing again didnt u
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> any1 here playing on 2b2t?
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki when build a good minecraft client in rust?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/iceiix/stevenarella, https://github.com/Lea-fish/Leafish
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> yea leafish is a fork of stevenarella splitting the non existant dev base enven more
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> both clients are not functional enough to be used for playing the game in any capacity
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> leafish is literally ddnet adding new features but then not updating to new minecraft version xd
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they look like the best starting points if you want a functional rust client for minecraft
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps you could even contribute, I'd imagine that being fun ðŸ™‚
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure ryo go contribute there
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> im actually thinking about switching to gitlab
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> well first of all m$ and gh being closed src. But now that i tried setting up my own CI runners on github and on gitlab i really wanna make the change
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> but only if gitlab pays me enough to promote their platform. Since i would lose a lot of followers that wont make the switch away from gh
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i need lessons in c++. so i want to access GetGameInfo from scoreboard.cpp, but it's only in gameclient.cpp. is getgameinfo even intended to get accessed from other classes (right now it's only accesses from inside gameclient)
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i see graphics()-> a lot in hud.cpp, which is from component.cpp i think / or it's passed on there or smthn. but hud doesn't #incdude component.cpp so how does hud.cpp get access to Graphics()-> at all?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i need lessons in c++. so i want to access GetGameInfo from scoreboard.cpp, but it's only in gameclient.cpp. is getgameinfo even intended to get accessed from other classes (right now it's only accesses from inside gameclient)
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i see graphics()-> a lot in hud.cpp, which is from component.cpp i think / or it's passed on there or smthn. but hud doesn't #incdude component.cpp so how does hud.cpp get access to Graphics()-> at all? ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜…
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> can i just do this with gameinfo? `class IGraphics *CComponent::Graphics() const { return m_pClient->Graphics(); }
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> `
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> are you workin on a pr for ddnet?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> yes, on this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5401
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> hide the *goalshud* in ddrace mod
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nvm, i can just acces gameclient from hud.cpp i think
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, well, thats not as important as customization i think :/
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because my server needs ammo for example, i cant wait tbh :D
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> People will complain, and when implementing such features its always important to have the possibility to get the old behaviour back
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Usually, not to break old mods, its sometimes even better to only use the new thing for new servers which fully support it, to not break older mods or smth
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron what specifically prevents you from replicating the conditions from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c04aaac64a9df2577e01c3ed1d36860851939531/src/game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp#L69-L90
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but thats too late now and not that big of a problem, if the customization comes (which shouldnt be too much code i think)
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron e.g.
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```c++
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bool ShouldRenderGoals = m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj && (m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_ScoreLimit || m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_TimeLimit || (m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_RoundNum && m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_RoundCurrent));
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> +1 xd
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I am currently working on the bouncy slime blocks and I have an edge case: If I hit two tiles, one is bouncy and one is normal, what should the behavior be? I currently implemented the max value, which means, as soon as you edge a bouncy block, you bounce. But from my personal experience on a trampoline, you usually slow down or stop when hitting an edge. What would you do?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986611686758830130/screenshot_2022-06-15_14-37-02.png
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I could do this gradually, too, I am not limited to min/max, I could also mix them btw
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps you could take the bouncines from the block that the center of the tee is on
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you only hit one block, then take that bounciness
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> that's the minimum :D
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, not the minimum
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> no it's not
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v i get first complaints... the hud withut Serverside customization kills my mod in some points
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 thank you, works perfectly and intuitive :3
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> chill... you also had enough time to implement yourself. I will try to add it today
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am on it already
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> watafk is this music
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> omg my tests are playing music aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this one feels overloaded
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it does, but sometimes the server might need it. the server can of course also disable the ddrace hud for example in a vanilla based minigame or something
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where only the damage and ammo is important
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> @heinrich5991  well nothing ðŸ˜…
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> somethings wrong i can feel itttt
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986633858055286854/unknown.png
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welshi> I wouldn't want the hud to be too different between modes in consideration for new players
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but resizing the spechud needs to know the conditions
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you are in a vanilla based gamemode, you of course want ammo and health and shields
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that will stay the same
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welshi> yeye just stating a concern
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just that a server that relies on the ammo count for example or has a minigame where you can get damage needs these
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing more
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welshi> cause if it's too different playing a different mode can be kind of daunting for someone who's new
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that will not be the case, will never be too different
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe ill lift the conditions up into onrender and modify the parameters in the goalshudrender and spechudrender
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welshi> alright ^^
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Welshi i know what you mean, but its important to make these switchable ingame
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> + make them switchable without relying on a game mode
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron thanks
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or on other stuff that is sent
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe ill lift the conditions up into onrender and modify the parameters in the goalshudrender and spechudrender @heinrich5991
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> right now you can only get the ddrace hud by sending special information, which are also used for example for prediction and antiping. of course i dont want my players to not have these benefits, while i still need the vanilla hud in some situatons
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe ill lift the conditions up into onrender and modify the parameters in the goalshudrender and spechudrender functions @heinrich5991
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron btw, if you add a new flag, you can look at @fokkonaut's PR to see how to do it. but I'm in favor of not adding a new flag for that
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5427
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok, yeah i think "lifting up" the conditions is the most seamless way. but if there would me more hud stuff dependend on game type it might be worth it
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea is that the DDNet flag is only used as fallback
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok, yeah i think "lifting up" the conditions is the most seamless way. but if there would me more hud stuff dependend on game type it might be worth it adding a flag
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise we'll get mods pretending to be ddnet when they actually aren't
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because they can't set the flags individually
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> cant the code be smart enough to determine the gametype without "gametype spoofing"
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> if they cant set the flags make other gametypes default to "other" and ddrace "ddrace"
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but i dont know the codebase enough to
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> know whats best
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not sure what exactly you mean. the idea is that the server should be able to specify what parts of the HUD to display
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it can only do so via pretending to be ddnet and getting all ddnet-specific features, like freeze prediction etc., that's a bad thing because the mod might actually be incompatible with them
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but this is kinda unrelated to the problem at hand â€” a ddnet server could still potentially have a time limit for a map, and a non-ddnet server can still have no condition for ending a round, so the best way forward is to explicitly check for the "no goals" condition and not use a proxy for that IMO
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> hmmmm... i dont know how to edit the ddnet server code, so that it doesnt "request" to show the goalshud
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, more clearly:
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't check for flags etc.
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check the condition I posted above
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this condition
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's true precisely when the goals would be non-empty
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so what should i do now? server or lift conditions?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i have to go off
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lift condition, probably, if I understand you correctly
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry for being unclear
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 master down
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :POGGIES:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :bluekitty:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess its an improvement
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-github-aws-docker-tokens-exposed-in-travis-ci-logs/
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :sue:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well i'd have to see it ingame but ye i think its better
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is it, that there is no master2 running?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cant we like create a github repo
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and make master4 redirect to a server.json so its never completly down
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Ravie told the old size is better because it is the same size as the icons on the left side... so one size for all icons
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> probably cause he wants everything to be scaled perfectly between game and .png
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i realized that people probably won't be looking at that all the time so it's fine if it's 2 pixels larger or smaller
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> What would you prefer, having it a little bit bigger, or the same size as the icons on the left
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if it's only a bit bigger, it doesn't matter to me
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean like if they are still on the far right of the screen i change my mind about size cause you still have to move your eyes
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that too but proportions get messed up
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do you have an idea for a better spot? Are you a dummy player?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im not a dummy player so maybe don't ask me
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe tryhards would like them in a circle around the main tee with alpha so they don't have to look away but i don't think any hud elements are so important for that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think the main feature for it is only to check if your binds decativated this actions.
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think those are more useful for just checking if you have copy on before a solo part or smth
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> take average value?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I already solved it, but taking the average would be the worst option
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i would bounce normally if there is no adjacent hookable and not bounce if you land on a hookable as well
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cause if you land one foot on a trampoline one on concrete you will not bounce
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> the  you would have full power, half power and no power on two blocks
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can also interpolate between both value until the tee is fully in*
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> would make smoother transition i guess
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> that is totally doable :D currently i cutoff exectly in the middle
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> that is the minimum approach, also a valid choise
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I have this problem for every material interaction, you see why this is hard?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> are the servers already using release candidate?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I can start a home server if you want, but I currently have no server with all materials
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because we merged http masters before having redundancy
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess we could push the servers.json to the chinese master2.ddnet.tw for now as redundancy
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then it'll show outdated data without showing that it's outdated
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh, maybe we need smth like secundary master server, or a local backup. but that also sucks. but having no list sucks even more, so dunno :/
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess a way of showing that the list is outdated might be a good first
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar no joke ddnet has less downtime than github
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> but still cool idea +1 from my side
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but github has downtimes, when ddnet is up and vice versa ðŸ˜‰
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> yes
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> its gud idea
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (probably against ToS to do it on github)
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> all good masterserver protcols involve git merge requests
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah also thought that ðŸ˜„
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but we can just do it with a random server somewhere
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but if u dont read them
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> then go gitlab
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u cant do it wrong xd
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://tenor.com/6zTs.gif
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> or use ryozukis gogs instance i hear it has higher uptimes than the NSA
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but its not like ddnet cant host some backup somewhere
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what Jupstar says
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can only find this in github's tos:
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > We do not allow content or activity on GitHub that is:
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [â€¦]
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > using our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity, to place undue burden on our servers through automated means, [â€¦]
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess updating a git repo every second counts as "excessive automated bulk activity"
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @heinrich5991 can you take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4850 ?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i dont know how the hud in ddnet functions. i imagine it is either hud(client) is dumb and gets every component "requested" to render by the server.
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> or the logic lies in the client and it puts together a hud depending on only one or two settings/parameters like gametype. so as i understood you the server does the logic and the client only renders what server wants.
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so hiding a component without the server requesting it would imo be a bit off the line
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but ill just do it, its only a few lines of code and not breaking the whole hud system
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but ill just do it, its only a few lines of code and not breaking the logic of whole hud system, if i understood it right
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v can u co author me? :p
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> how?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am not entirely sure, heinrich once showed me i believe
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I tried to cherry pick your commit. But as I changes your commit, your authorship was removed
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I could just overwrite the author... but I guess having you in the message is also enough, or do you want that I change the author of that commit?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nah, its fine I guess
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not if its too much work xd
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD I would at least have to look up the command... and then would need your email address
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think the git no reply adress works
