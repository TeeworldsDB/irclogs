07:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839374544363454464/unknown.png
07:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> made a mega map merger :kek:
07:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <kokoprali> nise
07:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <kokoprali> you need only build lobby
08:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @TsFreddie merge all my dummymaps so I can do a compilation:toptri:
08:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¤” like make them connect or something?
08:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can release the merger in ddnet later.
10:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Im 'corneum tele limit would prob kill your maps :d
10:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :d
10:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hmm
10:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839422652157657108/unknown.png
10:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> "show entities" on my mega map isn't working, but the prediction is fine, so the client still thinks there are grounds and stuff.
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how big is it?
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839423098197114900/unknown.png
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so 413x417
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that doesnt sound like alot
10:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, i'd prefer it not working for pvp tho. but would be nice to know why.
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u send it?
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sure
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839423587890888724/mega.map
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhhh maybe smth with the number of entities?
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there are so many hearts and nades etc
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @TsFreddie my tool throws an error on this map: `Game layer error at index 28: The values for the unused parts are not the default ones`
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i've seen other issues with many entnties before
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can that also destroy entities rendering?
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> index 28 like x:28,y:0?
10:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> sec
10:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or was there a entitie 28 or tile 28 lying around somewhere?
10:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah lol
10:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it somehow thinks the color is 0
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh!
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i did made it 0
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah XD
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> col
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt even know u can set color of game layers xD
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cool*, i'm make a standalone tool for hiding entities then lol
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so @Patiga 's tool is right
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> yay ^^
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> very cool lol
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839426748751937596/unknown.png
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> also a warning if you care about those @TsFreddie: "mega.map": [WARN] Mandatory item type of id 6 is missing
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> 6 are the envelope points, the editors always save that type, even if there are none
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i haven't save any envelopes yet
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the max size of a map is btw 9128*9128 or smth
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then it reaches the 2gb boundary for a single layer
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think all standard maps combined would still be within 2k or something.
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> even with compression?
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its not a memory issues
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its the design of our rendering implementation
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it only uses uint32 and 1 bit is used for something else
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to safe memory
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to save memory
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 1 tile uses 6 * sizeof(unsigned int) which are 2 triagnles
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as indices
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (the vertices of 2 triangles to be precise)
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can ofc also do a 83333333 x 1 map
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 9128 was the sqrt
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839428039758839858/unknown.png
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that will create floating point errors probably xD
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they so small
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mega map for pvp purpose is pretty safe.
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and i did grab a skyline implementation for packing them
11:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah nice
11:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everything under 1000x1000 is also without a warning in the editor i think
11:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is actually surprising to me how well group clipping works with stuffing multiple maps into one
11:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am trying to find a simple linux cross DE compatible way to notify the taskbar icon, but cant find any, why is this not done yet
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> our x11 implementation doesnt really work on KDE, it just makes the icon orange forever
11:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> orange forever could be a band
11:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> stays like it, even if i click it
11:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839432645984911390/unknown.png
11:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if it works on gnome or whereever it was tested, but never worked on KDE ðŸ˜„
11:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but dunno what to search in the internet, cant find anything
11:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not even a simple c++ programm doing it, where did you even find the x11 code for that xD
11:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i find the manual, but it doesnt really give any example
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> works for me on xmonad
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its still pretty undefined behavior then
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> steam implements it correctly
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, sure, should be fixed
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so i doubt its a kde bug
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bug i cant find any libs
11:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and x11 code is also not really nice
11:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be nicer to have it future ready ðŸ˜„
11:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i cant find any libs
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thought ur DE looks more like this:
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://hookrace.net/public/linux-desktop/laptop.png
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> from ur hookrace blog ^^
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, doesnt xmonad look like that
11:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a twm not a DE
11:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno found a video on yt where he had a quite cool design
11:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xmonad.org/

11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc you can make any TWM look really good
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u can just leave it be
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i use this:
11:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.pling.com/img/7/4/3/9/4b832707f1323f6015b7a4ffc90636abc3e3.jpg
12:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but with different decorations
12:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gotta try a twm made in rust
12:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://leftwm.org/ looks good
12:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks good bcs made in rust xD
12:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Kintaro/wtftw
12:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one is like xmonad, you configure it using the language rust
12:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/Kintaro/wtftw/blob/master/config/config.rs
12:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> way to distracting with so many apps open xD
12:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Drakulix/fireplace
12:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one works on wayland
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should rewrite x11 and wayland in pure rust
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everything rust
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do u litterally have so many open windows?
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tiled to the screen
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes yes
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> insane
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but usually only with terminals
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my browser is usually an entire screen
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you never used a twm?
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> once u use them its hard to go back xd
12:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno
12:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iti s
12:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> kde too op
12:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also thoughtt DE were better
12:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but oh boi
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like how it doesnt know my gpu exactly and puts lot of models there
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839442853456773150/unknown.png
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> plot twist, you have all of them
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would be rich rn
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to run ddnet
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my rx580 costs 700â‚¬ rn
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bought at 250
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah, already forgot
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> shitcoin
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> poor ppl having no good GPU, the most important component of a modern desktop pc
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its impossible to buy one now
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://streamable.com/uojlvm
12:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will u add teleporters or just swap around
12:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you will be able to vote change "the map" for your team basically
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, i did that but without putting all maps into a single big one
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't want to load multiple maps tho.
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and I did spend time making showothers work lol
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so mega map make more sense for me
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElmkTep2vXw
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> best mod in tw
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> allows multiple tournaments at once
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¥³
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but since there only 5 fng players its rip
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I think I'm kinda making the same thing but for 1v1 and multiple gamemodes
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> makes sense for u, since chinese community grows so fast
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> newcomers will have alot of fun with such things
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> more like keep kicking people out of servers to 1v1
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the great era of pvp is over in europe xd
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but yeah, we do have a few that plays pvp.
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i played like only pvp before i first saw kog
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or gores in general
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i still kinda only plays pvp
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i sucked at standard modes tho
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i saw gores, and it destroyed my life xD
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so dont start gores
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't really like gores anyway:kek:
12:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and they say drugs make addicted, what is gores then xD
12:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i feel like i might still drop mega map and just load multiple maps in the future if our people started to make maps...
12:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah when there are cool players in fng or idm, zcatch it can be really awesome
12:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my first 2-3 years in tw were the chilled ones
12:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> SO MAKE THE BEST SERVER
12:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ but by that point why don't i make a proxy server that just creates servers on the spots.
12:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ppl will just join the biggest server
12:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its fine ðŸ˜„
12:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> my first 2-3 years in tw is asking people to play with me.
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and i moved to the US for 4 years with even less players it seems
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so funny, US has such a huge speedrunner community, this game should be perfect for them
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> instead they play mario
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ mario is cool tho.
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not gonna deny
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just call louis and submit it to GDQ
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be cool
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and our servers probably won't be alive for long
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but maybe ddrace is too fast pace already.. these mario speedruns are pretty basic and easy to understand
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddrace is like yo, lets do 360 no scope hooks
12:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and do it every seconds with no mistakes
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think their mario speedruns rely on aligning and pixel perfect stuff, they dont know about edgehooks here :monkalaugh:
13:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/839468127724765184/unknown.png
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki do you know this:
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR/issues
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> would it also keep the hostname in the records instead of resolving the IP address?
16:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I would like to have only the hostname show from the address field in the client before someone connects
16:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> records?
16:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not rly records but
16:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what the client stores
17:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn no, that's not possible at the moment
17:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the master server only knows the servers by IP addresses
17:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahh ok
17:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that makes sense
17:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and the master server is master.teeworlds.com right? not something ddnet controls
17:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> master1.teeworlds.com to master4.teeworlds.com
17:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ok
17:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> iirc ddnet hosts one of them
17:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> master4.teeworlds.com
17:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (master server "policy" is independent from ddnet, we don't really touch it at all, we just host a mirror)
17:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Well, the client could do a reverse ip lookup, but that's a bit hacky
17:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Well, the client could do a reverse dns lookup, but that's a bit hacky
17:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pulls master server and make a script that generates A records. then you got a advertising scripts
17:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and not always correct since not all hosters let you control your own rdns entry, especially correct for people hosting from home
18:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Maiski> ICCCM says: "Clients must provide some means by which the user can cause the `UrgencyHint` flag to be set to zero or the window to be withdrawn. The user's action can either mitigate the actual condition that made the window urgent, or it can merely shut off the alarm."
18:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Maiski> I don't think that the client ever resets the flag (unless it's hidden in a library function that I don't know).
18:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 clang-tidy complains about the store at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3809/commits/63099c1d4583885597e8bc21ec89b951c3794b1a#diff-682e6d01bf7d8fa4d81969a211beeec5e3b8d1d4efe974165235dd79227cd480R1155
18:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's never being read. but removing it breaks the symmetry of the whole function. should I just remove it? is there an easy way to silence the warning?
18:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, I'd just remove it
18:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> done, ty
18:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Warning can be silenced with // NOLINT(name-of-the-clang-tidy-warning-here)
21:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is github down?
21:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is it my isp
21:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> just you
23:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my isp movistar is so stupid
23:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this happens too often..
23:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao i cant even load <https://www.movistar.es/>
23:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smth must be down rly bad
