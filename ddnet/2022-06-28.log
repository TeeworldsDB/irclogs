01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> what license has ddnet?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/license.txt
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @c0d3d3v Was the HUD resized recently? My custom icons are now super stretched in the most current nightly.
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @c0d3d3v Was the HUD resized recently? My custom icons are now super stretched in the most current nightly, and for what reason was the grid extended?.
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also, I'm curious what the Extras tab could be used for other than the snowflake. Are there any current plans and ideas for how this image could be used?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes it is now 512x512... forgot to tell you
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/hud.png
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet/ddnet/master/data/hud.png
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I thought it would be interesting to use it, for the upcomming particles that could come with the material layer that @Essigautomat  implements
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5403
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But maybe it is the best to just combine hud.png and extras.png in one.
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I thought it would be interesting to use it, for the upcomming particles that could come with the material layer that @Essigautomat  implements
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5403
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But maybe it is the best to just combine hud.png and extras.png in one, call it `extras.png`? and also add the material particles to it. And probably also the upcomming powerup particles
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it is basically only one icon more, so you just have to expand your canvas
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> What do you think about a community art contest for a frozen tee skin, that we can use instead of the ninja skin, till we have some better idea/solution/animation?
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> ou -.- is it possible that spawns are not deterministic if there is only one?
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656423182.png
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656423197.png
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what? If there's only one, you always spawn there
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> Im using the Tutorial map to test wether my clients auto reply to "where are you" is working. And sometimes it responds with "on your right" and sometimes with "on your left". First i thought its a me issue. Maybe integration test script sync issue or the bot determining the position wrong.
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> actually you dont
15:35 <+ChillerDragon> if one already spawned there you get pushed to the side but seems like which side is non deterministic
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> ok nevermind i run it with gfx on 20 times now all good its deterministic
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> that would have been weird
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg who added this stoopid check of logfile differing from stdout!??!?! we add so much CI shit it never will pass https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/runs/7093804998?check_suite_focus=true
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> i cant even reproduce it locally because it crashes earlier on my bugged nvidia drivers :D 
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good question, dunno why this check was added
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git blame?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or rather, `tig blame`?
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> whats `tig` ?xd
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> git in rust i'd say
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://jonas.github.io/tig/
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> is it some rust rewrite? xd
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> like bat vs cat etc
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i noticed they all rewrote classic unix utilities in rust and named them backwards
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> eww who needs git ui
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> too bad they can't rewrite cat and call it tac ðŸ˜„
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> git cli is fine
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> do u use tig heinrich?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you git blame with the default git UI?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tig blame is much more usable
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> `git blame file`
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you skip uninteresting commits?
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> usually `git blame $(fzf) | less`
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> i use github for that
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> okok i use a ui
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> even a web gui xd
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try `tig blame`
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's local and fast ðŸ˜‰
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> okok
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> ill keep it in mind thanks
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> ok ill try rn
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can press
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> enter
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to view the commit corresponding to the current line
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or press comma to go to the commit before the one on the current line
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> i tig blame deen axaxaxaxaxax
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656424870.png
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> doess  `-u` not need an arg?
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> i mean its not the issue im just wondering
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I get chillerdragon? c951a3cb899aae63c4df65ad6e34a3f41b0565e1
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `-u` is default number of context line
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> but where is the number
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `-U 1` if you want one context line in unified format for example
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656424940.png
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> but deen did -u logfile
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `-u` means it's 3
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> a
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> per default
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> oke
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> implicit
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> if its default why even use -u ? xd
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to get the more common diff format
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> unified is easier to read
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it's some strnage stuff with > and <
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> a
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> now i get it
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c951a3cb899aae63c4df65ad6e34a3f41b0565e1#diff-04a82e40ebe59c2140090275278cca1f75de61dd099b6b6ebdfaf201584fe87eR287-R288
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> ye looks hot
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this looks like you added a check whether the log file differs from stdout
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no?
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> yes i did
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> i was trolin a bit
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> :D
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> why dis bitch breaking on me
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because threads
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> race condigtion in stdout vs logfile xd
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> bra
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and each log output handles synchronization differently
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> or so do | sort | diff? xd
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do that, actually ðŸ˜„
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> would then lose order bugs 
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> but yea probably better than race condition false positives
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> or ignore the lines that can be in a different position before diff
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> timestamps are done by the logging system, so they're equal across logging targets
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> which mf wrote that threaded loggin? xd
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> ye ts looks good
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> ik u did
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> im fan
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> should we actually sort and then diff? -.-
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> then reading the diff is confusing
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> because its sorted
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> how would you ignore lines? just grep -v them? but then they could be missing. also sounds like one has to update the ci everything threading stuff changes
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah, sorting is easier and at least an improvement over flaky tests
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder if its possible to show an unsorted diff afterwards
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> if that even would make any sense
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> ou
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> can we force single threaded? xd
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> lock to one cpu core whatever
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not for logging coherency
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just sort it ðŸ˜›
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich can u fix the stdout implementation and make it not bad?
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> hrhr
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> im gonna get a shitstorm if one encounters a sorted diff issue
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> if not from others from future me for sure xd
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> the diff will just show if lines are missing or added one has to manually look at the text files
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> are the output files of the integration test uploaded as artifacts?
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> MaNuaLlY
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> na
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> or you print the original files when you find any mismatch
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> sure we can run it with some -v flag in the CI
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> would be useful if the entire integration_test folder gets zipped and uploaded
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> yikers
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> m$ will bill us 
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> so much bandwith
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> nah idk honestly
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> somehow ddnet never gets into gh limits
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> im sure rich deen secretly pays
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> time to build our own integration test server :thonk:
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> i tried for gh
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> sucked
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> i tried for gl
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> rocked
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> i mean a own ci pipeline runner
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> not sure wat u have in mind
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> ofc we can also just schedule a cronib that does git pull && test on some raspberry pi
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah, something like that
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> but then how to alert after push
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> lmao send a email to the commit author
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> can you not hook github actions?
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> that would be hilarious
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> wdym hook?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> with git you can hook actions to trigger commands and such
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> a
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> so if someone pushes on master it sends a mail to some mailing list for exmaple
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> example*
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> so everyone is forced to run integration tests after every commit?
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> u mean post commit hook? those are pain
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> imagine waiting 30 mins to commit xd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> do they work with github?
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> its gh unrelated
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> its git
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> your local git runs some script
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> after commit
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> ah, only locally ok
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> ye thats the worst
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> i like the pi idea tho
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> and it somehow making noise
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should do that for my projects where i run into gh limits
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> just buy more raspberry pis for parallel integration tests :kek:
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> we are getting closer to replicating microsoft
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> 1 pi can go para af alr
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> pis are strong compuiters
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> MULTI CORE 4K DESKTOP WORKSTATIONS one could say
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> can we just deploy test commits to some users that opt into experiments with their game? XD
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> wot?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> microsoft deploys features tests to just some systems first
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you can use software to deactivate this behavior "Experiments"
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> ou ye
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> you mean like the A/B testing thingy
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> imagine in the ddnet client menu ui
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> you can checkbox pullrequests pending on ddnet repo
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> :D
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> ez remote code execution
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> i honestly thought about tuning my mergeconflict warn system bot into a auto merge pr bot
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> so then every time i boot up my pc it tries to merge in as many ddnet prs into my client and i could alpha test all the shit combined xd
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> zlib
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> because current master is not bleeding edge enough
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> wot zlib?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> why use that license over others?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> zlib ddnet license
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> who talks about zlib?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did some reply got lost in the bridge?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> where is that coming from xd
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> i think the license is inherited from tw
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://choosealicense.com/licenses/zlib/
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> prolly a random chil license good ol magnus came up with
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nono im just suddenly here
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> wait where does it even say zlib?
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> license.txt only mentions it for external/
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the zlib license
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i checked if the text is the same
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it doesnt say it
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> i am not going to say anything further
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=licensing_misc

16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> haha
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: why is your commit description shorter than the PR description? ðŸ˜›
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> I am used to from the old days to do that
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> because pre bors the pr desc didnt end up in the git log and i would add my marketing talk for the merge gods there and extra details etc. but dont like that to pullte the git logs
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> im not into licenses, but i know gpl needs to stay gpl. mit is quite few restrictions, but what is the special about zlib? (i am forking dddnet and want to understand the license)

16:31 <+ChillerDragon> @cauldron the legal landscape in tw is chil when it comes to code
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> the artist might want you in jail for looking at their textures without buying their nft
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> but the code is pretty much do what you want
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> (THIS IS LEGAL ADVICE. I AM A LAWYER)
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> the code base is there to be used and extended. the community is small if one is sad about you raping code they will tell you.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> read this: @cauldron https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_License
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the actual license. it's like 3 paragraphs
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok, so idk isnt there a "standard" open.source license.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> can i just make my modifications licensed under MIT license?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok, so idk isnt there a "standard" open source license.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> can i just make my modifications licensed under MIT license?
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> yes u can change to MIT
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> nobody will probably ever care even if you break all of the 3 rules of the zlib license
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but then i have two licenses in the repo?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why don't you just keep the old license if you don't care about it? ^^
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and how to mark what codevhas what license?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> zlib is very permissive
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> maybe he wants less permissive
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> add a license comment at the top of every file xxxxxxxxxxxD
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> naa, i don't trust things i don't know. and i don't know zlib. i know MIT.
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> zlib is much simpler than MIT
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but reading also isn't an option?

16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the most widely used compression library
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably in every program that you can think of
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ill use it, okok ill use it
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Software_using_the_zlib_license huh
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not so much, but: SDL/SDL2, NSIS, Box2D and LÃ¶ve
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> wow there is a list of 10 entries and tw didnt even make it in
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich go edit wiki
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> im sure u got like a high elo wiki acc
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but it said at choosealicense.com where they summarize the license, that you have to mark the changes you have made - i guessbto the "original" codebase
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> are you hobby law student or why u care that much?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so sdl2 is zlib too, okay thats an argument
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> well linux is gplv2 isnt it
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt mean you should ever touch that
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron it seems there might be a misconception. you can choose a different license that people using your fork will additionally need to comply with. you can't remove the original license in that sense. you will always be bound by teeworlds's license as long as you modify it
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> no no, just try to annoy you xd
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> love it
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> u can annoy me as long as you want
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> i am getting paid per hour
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so mark my changes - what does that mean? i mean git makes it quite obvious what changes you made to the code
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> since the new update my skins doesn't show up ingame even with these 2 settings on
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/991353313121550456/unknown.png
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> then add a changes.txt and write in there "git makes it obvious"
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> since the new nightly update my skin doesn't show up ingame even with these 2 settings on
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/991353313121550456/unknown.png
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that's enough
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that you put it into git
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> if you drop git tho you might end up in court
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> anyway ill just use it, ty
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> ill send you the bil
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> l
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> check the console for errors with the name of the skin; share the skin if you don't mind
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> oh whats this?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/991354553066864650/unknown.png
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> my skin is "MummyBear" btw
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, libpng is in too
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there a line like that for MummyBear?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> no not really
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/991355658265964574/unknown.png
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> maybe this means something
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing about skins
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its just weird
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i also had a problem like that a few days ago but i fixed it with checking the setting to download community skins
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but now it just doesn't show my skin at all
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <soitak111> ```
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <soitak111> Then copy fng.cfg from the root directory to the build directory```
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <soitak111>  is write on the GitHub page but I don't understand root directory and build directory(and I'm french and I'm not really good at English)
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Root directory is the folder that has the src folder in it
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @soitak111 keep your questions in one channel please
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Build directory is the folder you created called build I presume
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u use skins.tw?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://ddnet.tw/skins/skin/community/MummyBear.png
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its defs in the database
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @heinrich5991 
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> [2022-06-28 17:39:45][png]: color type 3 unsupported by pnglite
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> [2022-06-28 17:39:45][png]: refusing to load PNG because it would be unsupported by pnglite
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i assume this is false positive?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if its in the skin database
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also the file name wouldnt hurt
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it used to load with pnglite it is definitely a false positive
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (RC can load it)
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i did add skins.tw to ddnet but my skin is from ddnet database
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah nvm already tested
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk what the newest nightly update is supposed to do but it broke my skin
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah bcs heinrich added trash code
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maks.> is there a way to see stars that popped up when u were frozen on newest nightly build ?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> no, they're server-side. They still appear on KoG for example
19:56 <+hababa_> woah
19:57 <+hababa_> its so strange to chat in quakenet wow
19:58  * hababa_ slaps hababa_ around a bit with a large fishbot
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> what is quakenet?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> an IRC network
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.quakenet.org/
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you connect to it using an IRC client or using the webchat link
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> what does irc stand for: i'm really cool?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wikipedia could help you
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> hehe....i know it's internet relay chat, but i never joined the club of "irc users"
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "internet relay chat"
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so quakenet is the server and there is something like a channel that mirrors discord?
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> some day i will be irc user and use mutt for emails...
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> some day ? that thing is a demon from the past ðŸ˜„
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD just open a irc client, join server, and say "bye I now use Discord" ... then you was an IRC user
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD just open an irc client, join server, and say "bye I now use Discord" ... then you was an IRC user
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or better \me was an IRC user, BYE!
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait, mutt is old now? It's the modern alternative to pine...
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Now I went down the rabbit hole, the manpage of mail has an interesting history part: https://man.archlinux.org/man/mail.1#HISTORY
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is old too
