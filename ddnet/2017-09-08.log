11:39 <@heinrich5991> deen: I don't want you to do that, rather I'd do it if it is so important to me
11:40 <@heinrich5991> oh, you already did it
11:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> is a bug concerning finish tile hitbox at much speed known?
11:49 <@heinrich5991> what is that bug?
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> if u are with high speed towards a finish tile,  u hit the finish tile 1 tile earlier. U dont even need to hit finish tile ever and still get finish.
11:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> i can make a post with demo about it
11:53 <@heinrich5991> I suppose this is about the blocker tile?
11:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> no stoppers. Just speed freeze before finish and finish tile
11:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> u will stop in freeze before finish, but still finish
11:55 <@heinrich5991> mh
11:55 <@heinrich5991> yea, a demo would be nice
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> i even could replicate it tho
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> can i post demo here?
11:57 <@heinrich5991> you can also PM me if you want (on discord)
12:43 <@deen> heinrich5991: I didn't make it POST, and it's opt-out, not opt-in
12:58 <@heinrich5991> so.
12:58 <@heinrich5991> another high-speed bug
12:59 <@heinrich5991> it's in src/game/server/entities/character.cpp:1328-1331
12:59 <@heinrich5991> don't know what the code is supposed to do, looks like it tries to make collision of tiles larger
13:00 <@heinrich5991> however, it checks around the target position where the character will be after the tick, instead of checking around the position that is currently checked on the line between previous and next position
13:00 <@heinrich5991> don't know how to fix this one
13:00 <@heinrich5991> I'll put it on github
13:02 <@heinrich5991> hmm. (but it doesn't explain the other bug shown to me, freezing yourself seems to increase your collision radius with finish tiles)
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> So, after I just updated to latest client version
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> that's what I see in DDNet servers list
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/355725186617704449/obraz.png
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> Another thing related to shitty-old os?
16:45 <+Learath2> which OS are you using?
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> for the moment - silence to cry - WinXP
16:46 <+Learath2> anything in the logs?
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> sec, because "console_output_level" command changes doesn't get saved somehow
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> even better, even if I add this command manually to the settings cfg, and client says it's value is 1
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> the command prompt is hidden anyway
16:50 <+Learath2> start a cmd.exe
16:51 <+Learath2> cd to ddnet directory, and do DDNet.exe > log.txt
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> start DDNet.exe > log.txt ?
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> if I do it that way, file is empty
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> ._.
16:54 <+Learath2> well it's been a while since i touched windows but it worked the last time
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> I also remember that
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> hmm, but wasn't client anyway saving (part of?) log to Server.log or something?
16:55 <+Learath2> apparently you can set Logfile
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> I think i found the bug already

16:58 <+Learath2> stop trying to murder my bot :P
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> you mean too long messages? ðŸ˜›
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> more detail may be available in the windows system event log
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> can we have the more detail from the event log pls?
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> any idea where do I find it?
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, but google it
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> eventvwr.msc or .exe
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> msc I think
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> which of these? since that seems to be quite big tree-structure

17:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> others are mostly about killed Nvidia driver, killed SQL & so
17:03 <+Learath2> eeh doesn't seem to be any of those, so i gues there is no more information there after all
17:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> ForceWare stopped working
17:04 <+Learath2> anyways i think it's something to do with our CA
17:04 <+Learath2> Soreu https://info.ddnet.tw/info
17:04 <+Learath2> when you go to that link on internet explorer do you get a warning?
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> oh man, let me digg where i got shortcut to IE
17:05 <+Learath2> iexplore.exe
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/355730421331525633/obraz.png
17:05 <+Learath2> can you connect to google with ie?
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> anyway, when I kept the "eventvwr.msc" open while starting DDNet client, no new things were added in any of the categories
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> yup
17:06 <+Learath2> yeah i don't think windows XP trusts Let's Encrypt CA
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> ye, and that would fit with what deen said lately with updates not working on XP
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> deen - 08/31/2017 I would have to pay for additional ip addresses or use no encryption
17:08 <+Learath2> SNI doesn't work with Win XP right
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> if there's any way to download the file without relying on client trying to download it
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> that'd already be good enough for me, but dunno how many DDNet client users still are stick to winXP
17:10 <+Learath2> Soreu map downloads don't work for you either do they?
17:10 <+Learath2> or updates?
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> I already would be on Win7/10 but other PC died lately
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> client updates don't work
17:11 <+Learath2> can you connect to https://learath2.info ?
17:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> in IE?
17:11 <+Learath2> yes
17:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> nope, same error as for https://info.ddnet.tw/info
17:12 <+Learath2> idk if it's SNI or XP not trusting it at all
17:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> I have to go to work now, but thanks for the help anyway
17:32 <@deen> Learath2: there's a checker to test whether ie6 on winxp can connect
17:32 <@deen> I couldn't get it working because of SNI
17:32 <@deen> but you also need different ciphers etc
17:32 <@deen> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=info.ddnet.tw
17:33 <@deen> If you can make it work you will make our winxp users very happy
17:33 <@deen> which is apparently ~1% of our users
17:35 <@deen> ah, we could use another port for winxp users
17:35 <@deen> and then we disable sni on that port
17:36 <+ezy> hi
17:36 <@deen> hi ezy
17:36 <+ezy> just makin sure it worked xD
17:36 <@deen> or we allow http again, but for winxp only...
17:37 <@deen> aaah, I think I have a workaround/hack
17:39 <@deen> but I'm afraid that enabling the insecure ciphers for winxp can cause security vulnerabilities for everoyne
17:39 <@deen> so it has to be done carefully..
18:03 <@deen> probably our openssl version doesn't even support these ciphers for winxp anymore
18:23 <@deen> @Soreu here?
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> at work
18:24 <@deen> ok, too bad
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Wow haha
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> What you wanted me to test?
18:25 <@deen> whether https://info.ddnet.tw/info now loads in IE
18:26 <@deen> no, actually https://ddnet.tw/
18:34 <+redix> A few questions: Is there any usage for ghosts on non-solo servers? Would it maybe make sense to disable them on these servers? Is it correct that the time will never be reset when you cross the start again on a solo server? Right now the ghost always restarts when you cross the line again...
18:41 <+redix> And can i assume that a server is a solo server when NETMSGTYPE_SV_TEAMSSTATE wasn't sent?
18:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> @deen still error in IE
19:43 <@deen> So I guess you need to compile your own openssl and nginx...: https://ablagoev.github.io/ssl/nginx/ie8/winxp/cipher/2016/12/23/ie8-winxp-nginx-ssl.html
19:43 <+redix> Okay... jao told me that ghosts might be useful for some speedruns with teams :D Would it be okay to not restart the ghosts on solo servers (when NETMSGTYPE_SV_TEAMSSTATE hasn't been sent)?
19:43 <@deen> why redix ?
19:44 <+redix> because the time won't be reset either on solo servers. if the ghost isn't reset it won't be in sync with the time
19:45 <+redix> if the ghost is reset*
19:45 <@deen> So I guess we can'T support it, @Soreu
19:46 <@deen> redix: shouldn't that rather depend on the timer?
19:47 <@deen> feels like a hack to look at NETMSGTYPE_SV_TEAMSSTATE
19:47 <+redix> that would be nice... but the player can choose the timer himself. and it won't work with old ddnet servers =\
19:48 <@deen> then update the servers?
19:50 <+redix> this would be best of course... but some players play on modified (mostly unmanaged) servers with ancient versions... this hack would work for them aswell :D
19:51 <@deen> how does map recording start?
19:51 <@deen> when crossing start line
19:51 <@deen> ghost should start the same way
19:52 <@deen> race_demo.cpp
19:53 <@deen> oh, that also resets when you touch the start line again in solo server?
19:53 <@deen> I guess that should be fixed too then
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> @deen just gonna stick to one of previous client versions instead :p
19:53 <+redix> race demo should be the same like the ghost. but this is also wrong on solo :O
19:53 <@deen> @Soreu you can use the new one, just have to use Internet tab, right?
19:53 <@deen> @Soreu or you can download ddnet-info.json by hand and make it write-protected
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> @deen that's exactly what I asked for  "if there's any way to download the file without relying on client trying to download it that'd already be good enough for me, but dunno how many DDNet client users still are stick to winXP"
19:56 <@deen> yeah
19:56 <@deen> just download https://info.ddnet.tw/info (optionally with ?name=Soreu)
19:56 <@deen> and save it as ddnet-info.json
19:56 <@deen> in CONFIG_DIR
19:57 <@deen> redix: ok, i guess SV_TEAMSSTATE is ok. so just record whether it was ever seen, and if not consider it a solo server...
19:57 <@deen> (and fix it for demo as well please)
19:58 <+redix> i'm going to submit a pr for the ghost anyway (because right now the ghosts get kind of destroyed by lags because the predicted values are used). i'll fix these things then too
19:58 <+redix> okay
19:59 <@deen> probably i should rather fix mac osx instead of winxp
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> thanks a lot
20:01 <@deen> @Soreu I will "fix" it for winxp
20:01 <@deen> in the next version
20:01 <@deen> it will use http for winxp only...
20:01 <@deen> but I will NOT enable updates
20:02 <@deen> only maps and info
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> updates were never a big deal
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> so it's fine
