02:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> pretty cool
02:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> this screams latency though
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Knuckles cracked
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> n-word cranked up to 11
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yup. its gaming time
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what were they thinking
09:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> i have question
09:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> if im on platform and i press d i will reach speed 10 in 5sec, then i continue running with d but i fall of platform
09:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> do i :
09:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> 1) keep my 10 speed
09:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> 2) speed is set immediately to 5
09:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> 3) speed decrease from 10 to 5 with rate of x (x = ?)
09:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> 1)
10:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> @devs pls add units in ctrl+shift+d
10:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> ;-;
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> u
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> u
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets add feet and yards and stones, the american way
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> lets add pixels
11:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> no guys in sub-tiles/tick
11:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> bcs its the smallest units of the game
11:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> st/t
11:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> u cant get half a sub-tile or half a tick
14:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> would `if (false)` be stupid?

14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <LCSG47> :kek:
14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeeeeh, there must be a better way to do this ðŸ˜„
14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ikr
14:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i can't think of any on the spot rn
14:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can only think of uglier ones, maybe this is as good as it gets
14:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can just get rid of `else` and let it compare all the way through, but i don't really want to.
14:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uhm, wait why do you need this to be dynamic?
14:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk. feel like it.
14:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> `gamemodes.h` for reference
14:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836211872969261066/unknown.png
14:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh, if you are wondering why I'm comparing. i'm making chat command `/room 1 ctf`
14:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 questions, First: Why do you need `AddGameType`Â when is this called? Second: Would you ever want to register the same gamecontroller with 2 different names?
14:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> AddGameType is for enabling gamemodes
14:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like you put `add_gametype dm;add_gametype ctf` in config, then the rooms can only be dm or ctf, can't be anything else.
14:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah okay
14:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> then 2 different name is for `add_gametype 1v1dm dm sv_player_slots 2`
14:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> then `/room 1 1v1dm` and `/room 1 dm` are both dm types but with different settings.
14:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So how about you build an array of all valid gametypes using the preprocessor, then do one single check?
14:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe scorelimits are different and stuff
14:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> bravo, i'll try to do that rn.
14:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but wait
14:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can't put constructors in array.
14:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can i
14:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the part of the code I see is just using TYPE, that's why I suggested that ðŸ˜›
14:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yeah, i had this already
14:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836213383954825257/unknown.png
14:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The usual solution is to have a factory function, though I guess that's starting to make it ugly
14:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (since you can't take the pointer to a constructor)
14:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> right, i'm making this ugly rn, just so i can register more gamtypes with two lines in `gamemodes.h`
14:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> instead of poking into factories and stuff
14:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this is fine btw, if(false) looks odd but I think it's much better than the alternatives
14:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish C++ had first class classes ðŸ™‚
14:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would make stuff like this much prettier
14:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie I have a solution for you that is not as pretty and will make all the CS people hate you but get rid of the `if(false)`
14:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ let's hear it
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even know a convoluted way to make it palatable to CS people (but they are insane so who cares)
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just use a goto ðŸ˜›
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or if you are scared of our theory overlords put it in a `do { ... } while(false)` and break out of it
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> )
14:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> `do {} while(false)` seems like it is in the same ballpark as `if (false)`
14:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> goto tho.. i don't know..
14:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is why I suggested it in parenthesis, if I was doing it I'd either keep the if(false) or use the goto
14:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might use the goto just to annoy people
14:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm more scared of goto than annoyed. cuz multiple people taught me to never use it lol
14:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> multiple people who've read just the title of one letter by djikstra
14:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just thought more about goto.. i don't know how would it work tbh.
14:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can't take `CLASS` out with the goto i don't think
14:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you'd just remove the `else` and goto a label after the `#undef`
14:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As said, just keep the if(false) it doesn't look too bad anyway
14:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yeah, i'll keep `if (false)`
14:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836217328374120548/unknown.png
14:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't even know if this is legal
14:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that looks completely insane
14:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just needed a single goto, not two
14:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh right. i don't know what i was thinking
14:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> there are some very cute goto patterns we can't use anymore because some people take things so damn literally, they really think things like `do { ... } while(false);` is better, but it only makes your code more cryptic
14:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've also seen `for(int i = 0; i == 0; i ++)`
14:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nouis:
14:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is `for(;;break)` valid?
14:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nope. tried it
14:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/libpbo/blob/master/libpbo/pbo.c#L233 here is a pattern I use a lot
14:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though this is not the best example, I don't think I have any better ones public
14:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another perfectly valid use is breaking out of nested loops, some people will tell you to make these into one-off functions. To those people I say no
14:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (fwiw these are only necessary because C just lacks the tools to do this in a clean manner)
14:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ has exceptions and RAII that can handle the first usecase for you. Some languages have `break <n>;` pattern that will break out of n blocks
14:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and if you want more examples of decent uses of goto and have a thing for "appeal to authority" arguments Knuth has a great paper on this
14:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc called "Structured programming with go to statements"
14:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'd like a `break  <n>` very much ngl
14:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I think rust had a proposal for one
14:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Also I was genuinely hoping `for(;;break)` was a thing.
15:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why?
15:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk, it looks funny
15:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust has them already since long https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/loop/nested.html
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, this is also acceptable
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant a proper arbitrary break though, like out of any block not just loops
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and more readable than n blocks
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how would this work outside of loops?
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt that a goto
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well a very limited goto that would just go to outside the block
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/loop/return.html
15:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2046-label-break-value.md
15:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
15:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well atleast u can expect to maybe have this in rust i wonder how long it would take for the grandpas in the c++ standard to add this
15:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> never lol
16:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pvp scoreboard with teams looks pretty goofy
16:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836244250634223696/unknown.png
16:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> could it be a thing that you can filter maps by date in the editor when you try to load them ? and not only by name
16:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> what the difference between 
16:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> `vec2 m_MousePos[NUM_DUMMIES]`
16:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu>  and
16:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> `vec2 m_TargetPos[NUM_DUMMIES]`
16:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> `m_MousePos` changes mouse position, but i dont see any `m_TargetPos` changes, even as another player
16:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> (client side)
18:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mousepos is screenspaceï¼Œ targetpos is worldspace iirc
20:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Apparently if you change from a non-team game to a team game while snapping gameinfo. There's a high chance that your character's color won't get updated to team color.
20:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> And..... apparently you can just resend map info to force client to refresh it's state. (For 0.6)
20:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> map info is treated as a map change
20:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so the client re-enters the game
20:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Ye, but it happens super fast if the server keeps snapping everything.
20:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> The connecting screen only flashes by for 1 or 2 frames on my MacBook. Haven't tested with high ping tho.
20:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> For 0.7 you just send team change message to spectators and back then it'll update.
20:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ’¯
20:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> And it sounds like a non-red/blue team game is possible for 0.7 :kek:
