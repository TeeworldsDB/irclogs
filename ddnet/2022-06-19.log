00:31 <+ChillerDragon> neither git operations nor the website are any stable and yet githubstatus flexes all operational status https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1655591461.png
00:32 <+ChillerDragon> so bad
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the github status page is probably connected to SLAs, so they will only admit something is broken when they have to, otherwise lose lots of money
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:brain\:
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but at some point they have to admit that their status is broken hrhr
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn, i get lot of prediciton errors with ninja
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> other people's ninja is so jerky
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> (also might be nice to view directory trees with some limit on depth)
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have a couple folders in /maps but it's only 1 depth
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> (also might be nice to view directory trees all at once with some limit on depth)

06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is indeed bizarre, old is evil xd
08:54 <+ChillerDragon> I always thought that the feature of reading user input and the emacs control keys etc are implemented by bash. Or even maybe by the terminal emulator.
08:54 <+ChillerDragon> TIL ther is `man readline`
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Good morning everyone! Does anyone know the cmake target for building data/assets?
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> wdym
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> what should building assets even do
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> in default teeworlds there was an option to build content. When I compile the data directory which get's created doesn't contain the new assets
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> so I am copying it manually rn
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> in default teeworlds there was an option to build content. When I compile the data directory, which get's created, doesn't contain the new assets
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> why do I even ask when a one line command is sufficient
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the build system should just copy data dir from source to binary
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> hmm
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no specific target, should happen for every build
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what problem are you trying to solve?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Maybe I missed to add some files in the CMakeLists, I'll keep an eye on that
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> run this script and it will auto fix ur cmakelists to contain all files you want https://github.com/lib-crash/lib-teeworlds/blob/7ed3f65514031b560184e0b31093f6ca41460987/bin/tw_cmake
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> has anyone ever built a proxy for tw clients? I didn't look into it yet. I know heinrich started something for the server.
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> I used some proxies for minecraft latley to connect via my vps and world downloading. Its pretty cool to be able to keep up the connection while restarting the client. I would love to keep connected to the current tw server and recompile my client and quickly reconnect to the proxy.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Why would you want a proxy for a teeworlds client?
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> ^ dis
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> but not sure how much effort it is to build such a thing maybe some1 has a finished one already
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this should be a simply fast-forward-proxy and the server has a timeout protection anyways, so I don't think you need any teeworlds related code for it
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this should be a simple fast-forward-proxy and the server has a timeout protection anyways, so I don't think you need any teeworlds related code for it
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> timeout protection is not a nice UX it takes ages to even take into effect. I want to rebuild my client in 2 sec and reconnect to the same spot in the map.
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> test something 1 sec and repeate
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Is anybody here experienced with multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance? I got a really bad Diamond case
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could modify the server to use saves and autoload when you join. chillerdragon
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> @deen yea fddrace already has that but its still too much effort to rcon auth save etc. Also that makes it server dependent.
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i usually put the start of the map where i want to test sth
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> yea i like to test my stuff in the real world
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> on actual servers with players somewhere far in the map
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> or push a spontaneous fix
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> but yea if its too much effort its not worth it. I was hoping some1 of you had a tool ready :D 
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i have a proxy but it just relays all udp packets, so i guess it won‘t work for your case
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> needs to be smarter
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> because it would also relay the disconnect right?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could hard quit, but it would still time out them
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then*
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> ah true the proxy needs a keep alivew
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should try it anyways even if its not worthe the effort. Just for educational purses
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> PURSES
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> sometimes i wish irc had edits ngl

11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Why would you want to understand stuff when you can try and error instead?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:brain\:
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> for the worse Diamonds I can think up :p
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no matter what your problem is, i bet you can redesign your logic to not use multiple inheritance. So better redesign it
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I could, which would probably lead to a lot of duplicated code
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh r u sure? in worst case u have 2 classes in one bigger one
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I got an idea to simplify it more. Seems like i am wrapping information into inheritance
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> '/swap' when used while in the team, additional time is added to those who used the team
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> that's an intentional penalty
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> @Nouaa im too lazy to configure matrix encryption my dms are readonly for me haha. Just write me here
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> it will surely annoy others xD whatever, i was asking for the chatcommands. i wanted to make my own chatcommands in a separated files (like u did in ddnetPP with ddracechat_ddpp.cpp / .h), so i created the files but now i'm searching a way to "access" to the commands bcs their are kind of "not registered" rn
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> i annoy others 24/7 here so far nobody complained yet. But yea would be nice if another channel would also be bridged so i could spam there
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> why do you want to do that=
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :justatest:
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am complaining, u just ignore it xdd
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> pf
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> jopstar
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> looks cleaner than just drop cmds into ddrace.cpp / .h?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> jk
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> looks cleaner than just drop cmds into ddracechat.cpp / .h?
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> @Nouaa for .cpp files its as simple as creating a new .cpp file include the corresponding header and you are done
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> and add it to the cmakelists file
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yeah that's done xD
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> so header now?
13:38 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/9cfd6d7f9b895dff8177b53c6d994a8699975921/src/game/ddracechat.h#L9
13:38 <+ChillerDragon> make sure to also include your header in the upstream ddracechat.h file
13:39 <+ChillerDragon> do you have a public git repo?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> oh, i get it, i also wanted to create the header file lol
13:39 <+ChillerDragon> nice
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> <a:aPES_SadSpin:693519538876055684>
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, it's on a branch from my fork
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/NouaaTW/ddnet/tree/BW-Cosmetics ?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yup
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye, it worked, it was pretty easy but thanks, you can check the commit if you want. i was using an old version of ddnet src for so long (like 10.x), a lot has changed since then xD
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye, it worked, it was pretty obvious but thanks, you can check the changes if you want. i was using an old version of ddnet src for so long (like 10.x), a lot has changed since then xD
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> i used 9. something :D then i went through a big merge crisis
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> after/during that time i switched to merge conflict driven development how deen calls it :D So i try to have as little merge conflict surface as possible thats why i extract all those files
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye a big one lmao
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 implementing an own logger is really cool indeed! thanks for recommending that.
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1655640140.png
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> its not going very good ... yet 
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> oh, i get it lol
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Anybody interested in testing materials again? I made a small solo map to test all materials. Also @ChillerDragon i might need to to confirm, that the bug is fixed
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> <https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/actions/runs/2523784477>
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> leaked ip: 93.245.170.253:8303
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> in one command, everyone has the same time, but the time after '/swap' will be different. For example, in a team of 4 people, two will have 2 00, the other 2 15
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> in one team, everyone has the same time, but the time after '/swap' will be different. For example, in a team of 4 people, two will have 2 00, the other 2 15
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> Tested it, seems like if you finish, you get the finishtime of the players who didn't swap, so the penalty is useless in this case
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i played tangerine 4p:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> 2 swapped, 2 didnt
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> everyone finished with the time of the players who didn't swap
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> guess not 🙂 HMU if you want to try it out, I am going to read a book or two
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> there will be one finish, but it's still a bug and for the team, you probably need to make a rule
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> there will be one finish, but it's still a bug and for the team, we probably need to make a rule
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> there will be one finish, but it's still a bug and for the team, we probably need to make a rule(condition)
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd assa ur such trol using / in ur branch names
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I stopped doing it
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> u made poor gh devs do some weird ass route globbing
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> its still `feature/all-materials-experimental` isnt it?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> y
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> but the bug isn't fix yet 😦
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> server and testmap is online tho
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> builidin rn
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> somehow my `git pull` didnt work so i had to strart from scratch
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> did u force push? -.-

18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but apparently not the g++ package
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its still gcc in the end but its kinda a wrapper
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> sorry i close it by mistake:justatest:  github so confusing
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#dependencies-on-linux--macos
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> Just run this from ddnet readme `sudo apt install build-essential cmake git google-mock libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpnglite-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libwavpack-dev python libx264-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-extra libavutil-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-tools spirv-tools`
