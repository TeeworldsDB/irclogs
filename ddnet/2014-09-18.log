00:01 < laxa> ok I'll do the mail server stuff later, right now, I need to fix the fucking crontab
00:02 < laxa> any idea deen if PATH doesn't fix the problem ? Apparently the script just die on the call... I am thinking about posting on StackOverflow.
00:02 < Savander> just
00:02 < Savander> change e.g. grep to
00:02 < Savander> etc.
00:02 < Savander> ./bin/grep
00:02 <@deen> no idea
00:04 < laxa> Savander: PATH is correctly set, that's not coming from that
00:04 < laxa> https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126
00:04 < laxa> I won't do all your requests just for me lol
00:04 < laxa> their requests I mean
00:05 <@deen> laxa: other mail servers have similar guidelines. if you don't do that then your mails will just silently land in the spam, every time
00:05 <@deen> just be happy that google informs you of that at least :P
00:05 < laxa> well, the mails aren't even delivered to me anymore
00:05 < laxa> not even in spam folder
00:06 <@deen> which is why i said it's a pain to setup a mail server
00:06 < laxa> it was working fine for long time
00:06 < laxa> and now it's not 
00:07 <@deen> then you probably switched to ipv6
00:07 <@deen> just disable ipv6 and it's fine
00:07 <@deen> i had the same problem a few weeks ago
00:08 < laxa> I don't even have IPV6 address on my server
00:08 < laxa> they tell me it's BULK mail when it's not even the case...
00:08 < laxa> I really don't get it
00:09 < laxa> ok, it's working weirdly enough
00:10 < laxa> but the mail income flagged as read...
00:10 < laxa> can anyone try to send me a mail ? support@ddracepro.net
00:10 <@deen> done
00:11 < laxa> ok good
00:11 < laxa> now I understand
00:11 <@deen> life lesson: don't help people with computer problems
00:11 < laxa> hum ? xD
00:11 < laxa> gmail blocks the spam sent to xxx@ddracepro.net
00:11 < laxa> but not the others
00:11 < laxa> so it's fine
00:11 <@deen> i made a website for some teacher's union thing 5 years ago and the teacher spams me since then whenever he needs support...
00:12 < laxa> I was a computer Helpdesk 6 month ago deen
00:12 < laxa> I know what it's like :p
00:12 <@deen> i stopped a few years ago
00:13 < laxa> ok
00:13 < laxa> first post on StackOverflow !
00:23 < laxa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25901287/script-not-working-with-crontab-but-working-when-launching-it-normally
01:02 < laxa> ok
01:02 < laxa> script was killing himself
01:08 <@deen> haha
01:08 <@deen> i told you that kill command was dangerous :P

01:52 <@deen> hm, I'm really getting tired of this
01:52 <@deen> every time i go on a ddnet server i get insulted
01:53 <@deen> no idea why i'm still running this

12:19 < EastBite> sounds promising^^
12:19 <@deen> EastBite: I'm looking at your DDNet servers tab right now
12:19 <@deen> I think you should see the other server filters and not just by country
12:20 <@deen> Also, it's "Persian", not "Persia"
12:21 < EastBite> the filter options would affect the internet and fav filter aswell, does that matter?
12:21 <@deen> they already do anyway
12:22 < EastBite> okay
12:22 < EastBite> well
12:22 <@deen> i think it's ok for them to affect all tabs
12:23 < EastBite> it might be hard to fit the normal filters and coutry filters together
12:24 <@deen> ah, and the countries should really be set by the ddnet-servers.txt i think
12:24 < EastBite> Persia is the countries name or am I wrong?
12:24 <@deen> wrong
12:24 < EastBite> deen: then the filters need to be dynamic aswell
12:24 <@deen> EastBite: yeah, hm
12:25 <@deen> probably make the filter a comma separated string?
12:25 <@deen> even better, a comma separated exclusion string
12:25 <@deen> so when a new server is added, it's on by default, not off
12:25 < EastBite> filter expression,ip,countryname
12:25 <@deen> oh, i meant something else
12:26 <@deen> i meant the country-filter setting, what is br_filter_ger right now
12:26 <@deen> should be br_filter_exclude_countries China,Russia,South Africa
12:26 < EastBite> ah
12:27 < EastBite> hm can't we just use JSON instead of text lines
12:27 < EastBite> I mean we got a reader
12:27 <@deen> we do?
12:28 < EastBite> for automapper? or am I wrong
12:28 <@deen> that's in 0.7
12:28 < EastBite> lel fuck
12:28 <@deen> i guess it is, haven't seen it in 0.6
12:28 < EastBite> ya it's not there
12:28 < EastBite> could add it though
12:29 <@deen> i find text files easier than json, but if you really want it, ok
12:29 <@deen> I'm not a big fan of javascript stuff
12:30 < EastBite> I find it kind of hard to parse textfiles without libs
12:30 < EastBite> json is easy and is supported everywhere
12:31 <@deen> yeah, but then i have to edit the ddnet-servers.json file by hand
12:31 < EastBite> it's a C like syntax? 
12:31 < EastBite> or do you want to generate it
12:31 <@deen> I'm just saying that editing a text file is easier
12:32 <@deen> and for parsing it:
12:32 < EastBite> hm I don't think so
12:32 < EastBite> hard to read
12:32 < EastBite> json can be structured
12:32 <@deen> hm, ok
12:32 <@deen> so you'll do these changes?
12:33 < EastBite> so we want to add country filters at runtime?
12:33 <@deen> i think so
12:33 <@deen> for example, i plan to remove france soon, don't want to update client for that
12:33 < EastBite> where do I place the checkboxes
12:33 <@deen> and persia might also go down
12:33 <@deen> ah, and Persia is no country, the country is called Iran :P
12:34 <@deen> but they all search for "persian" so that's what the server is called
12:34 < EastBite> okay
12:34 <@deen> hm, checkboxes
12:34 < EastBite> well there is still free place below the normal filter
12:35 <@deen> But then you would have to scroll the filters
12:35 <@deen> because the countries don't fit there
12:35 < EastBite> ye
12:35 <@deen> Ah, you could move the "Reset filter" button down
12:35 < EastBite> so the countries will just stack there to the bottom
12:35 < EastBite> and if you fail to limit the number of countries
12:35 < EastBite> it clips
12:36 <@deen> but the countries still don't fit, and putting 2 next to each other doesn't work with 5:4 and 4:3 resolutions
12:36 < EastBite> =)
12:36 <@deen> Another problem: the DDNet tab has increased size too much, know the menu doesn't fit anymore at 1280x1024
12:37 < EastBite> hm I tested 16:9 and 16:10
12:37 <@deen> I shrinked a few tabs before to make space
12:37 <@deen> yeah, 5:4 is usually the problematic resolution
12:37 <@deen> aspect ratio*
12:37 <@deen> that also triggered me to rename from DDraceNetwork to DDNet, so they can read the server type
12:38 < EastBite> would do the same for gametype but nvm
12:38 <@deen> yeah, i've considered it
12:38 <@deen> back when i did it noone knew about ddnet, so i thought "ddrace" would attract more people
12:39 <@deen> and if i change it now some people will have it buggy since they never update their client
12:40 < EastBite> instead of checkboxes we could just add a grid with country flags
12:40 <@deen> I guess the country filters should be in a separate tab
12:40 < EastBite> flags to click on look nicer
12:40 <@deen> true, and save space
12:41 <@deen> then we could easily fit it into normal Server filter space
12:41 < EastBite> yep
12:41 <@deen> Reset filter should still go down though^^
12:41 < EastBite> ^ meh
12:41 <@deen> looks like it's at the wrong position to me
12:41 < EastBite> the current page doesn't go below the other tabs
12:42 <@deen> but the info page does
12:42 < EastBite> oh you are right
12:42 < EastBite> silly
12:42 <@deen> (maybe i added that for the info page)
12:42 < EastBite> :D
12:42 <@deen> since i added the scrollbar as well
12:48 <@deen> ah, and then we can also disable the default search for "DDraceNetwork" for people starting the client for the first time, and instead just set the default tab to DDNet
12:49 < EastBite> yep
12:59 < EastBite> hm a country/server list might look like this: https://eastbit.net/priv/srvlist.json
13:00 <@deen> looks good, what about the filter?
13:00 <@deen> "filter": "GER",
13:00 < EastBite> not needed
13:00 <@deen> my bad
13:00 < EastBite> actually, but
13:00 < EastBite> hm
13:00 <@deen> you're right
13:00 <@deen> don't do filters, this json is good
13:00 < EastBite> yes, okay
13:01 <@deen> Ah, so you want a name? Not just flag?
13:01 < EastBite> nah the name is just additional I thought
13:01 < EastBite> for conf except
13:01 < EastBite> except_country Germany,...
13:01 <@deen> hmmm, actually GER isn't called "Germany" anywhere
13:01 <@deen> ah yeah
13:02 < EastBite> could be ger aswell :P
13:02 <@deen> but maybe make it GER then
13:02 <@deen> yeah, like they're called in the server names, makes it easier for everyone i think
13:02 <@deen> there are no specific rules, i just asked people in the communities what name they wanted and used that
13:06 <@deen> so much packet loss to china today, > 50% since morning
13:07 < EastBite> the route might not be the best :P
13:11 <@deen> player numbers for yesterday: CHN 42, Persian: 155, USA: 239, South Africa: 385, RUS: 556, FRA: 611, GER: 1598
13:11 <@deen> GER: 1928*
13:11 <@deen> 1598 is the number of people who started ddnet client yesterday
13:12 < EastBite> cool
13:13 < EastBite> do you think there are players which do not close teeworlds and rather minimize it?
13:14 <@deen> no idea, why would they do that?
13:14 <@deen> it's not like teeworlds takes more than 1-2 seconds to start
13:14 < EastBite> hm I dunno
13:14 <@deen> but for this case i added gfx_backgroundrender 0
13:15 <@deen> so it doesn't take any resources then
13:15 < EastBite> I hope they close it because otherwise the ddnet srvlist will not update
13:23 <@deen> ah, true
13:23 <@deen> i don't think that's a serious problem though
13:23 <@deen> at least the serverlist will update when they update the client :P
13:25 < EastBite> but client update dialog also only appears on start :P
13:26 <@deen> i haven't heard of any complaints about that yet, so i don't expect any about the same issue with the serverlist
13:27 < EastBite> following situation: GER is down and you want to set up a backup server for the players rapidly
13:27 < EastBite> without a client restart they wont find the backup server in ddnet tab
13:28 <@deen> true, hm
13:28 < EastBite> we could update the list on every server disconnect or something
13:28 < EastBite> nvm I'm having lunch now :)
13:28 <@deen> i don't think periodic checks would be very welcome ("omg, ddnet client is calling home!")
13:29 < EastBite> ^
13:30 <@deen> Solution: When you click on refresh in the ddnet tab a new list is downloaded
13:31 < bip_> Hi all.
13:31 <@deen> hi bip_ 
13:32 < bip_> do u have skype deen?
13:32 <@deen> yes, s3c0nd55
13:32 <@deen> but i have to go afk now, talk to you later
13:32 < bip_> ok. bye.
15:27 <@deen> EastBite: i have to use json now myself...
15:27 < EastBite> you do?
15:27 <@deen> yes, i'm adding a player search function and want autocompletion
15:27 <@deen> but the player database is too big to just send it to the client, so i need to send parts of it as json
15:29 < EastBite> where do you want to add the player search func?
15:29 <@deen> everywhere!
15:29 < Savander> Hello
15:29 <@deen> hi Savander 
15:29 < Savander> EVERYWHERE??
15:29 < Savander> :OO
15:29 < EastBite> hi Savander 
15:29 < Savander> IM EVERYWHERE?!?!
15:29 < Savander> XD
15:30 <@deen> so you don't have to search through the status or ranks for your name
15:30 < o_be_one> hi
15:30 <@deen> just a top right form field like with the "Compare"
15:30 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
15:30 < EastBite> I don't understand, in the game client?
15:30 <@deen> or maybe somewhere else
15:30 <@deen> nono, on the website of course!
15:30 < EastBite> ah
15:30 < EastBite> "send it to the client," < was confused by client
15:31 < EastBite> I'm currently playing with json in tw
15:34 < EastBite> the json lib is strange
15:34 < EastBite> it supports operator overloading for C++ but I think I shouldn't use it
15:39 < EastBite> deen: so you also do js right now?
15:39 <@deen> yes ...
15:39 < EastBite> :D
16:08 <@deen> i need 4 js files already... no wonder all these websites use 50 js scripts
16:08 < EastBite> why do you need multiple files?
16:09 < EastBite> remember twwebgl.js ? :D
16:09 <@deen> because there is a plugin for everything...
16:10 < EastBite> ah
16:10 <@deen> i need my own script, jquery, typeahead, and now some templating library
16:10 < EastBite> okay
16:11 < EastBite> well atleast I'm able to load the serverlist from json now
16:12 < EastBite> maybe I got more time in weekend
16:16 < laxa_work> deen: you can be proud of me, I am finally using pkill to restart my tw servers :D
16:16 <@deen> ^^
16:26 <@deen> Hm, the search may be a problem after all: http://ddnet.tw/search.html
16:26 <@deen> i get weird results when i type deen :P
16:26 < laxa_work> xD
16:27 < laxa_work> ajaxquery ?
16:27 <@deen> no
16:27 < laxa_work> Nice, you are using jquery
16:27 < laxa_work> but there is a little bug
16:28 < laxa_work> when you don't have window on focus
16:28 < laxa_work> results are not shown
16:31 <@deen> and even more attacks, now people are bruteforcing our nuclear server pw to reveal the tournament map
16:32 < laxa_work> xD
16:32 < laxa_work> wtf, tournament map is on test server ?
16:32 <@deen> has always been, it has to be tested of course
16:32 < laxa_work> yeah, but it's not on votemenu
16:35 <@deen> i really don't like this, the attacks are becoming more coordinated
16:45 < Savander> so
16:45 < Savander> make it similar to rcon auth
16:45 < Savander> 5 tryies == ban 5  minutes
16:46 < Savander> xD
16:46 <@deen> then they attack another way. too many possibilities
16:46 < Savander> save ip in memory for 5 minutes :c.
16:46 < Savander> but for bruteforce
16:46 < Savander> its good
16:46 < Savander> i guess?
16:46 <@deen> then they spam me from a different ip every time
16:46 <@deen> Should look nicer now: http://ddnet.tw/search.html
16:47 <@deen> but i don't know what to do about the "bad" suggestions
16:47 < EastBite> sorted by points?
16:47 <@deen> yes
16:47 < EastBite> hm
16:47 <@deen> what sorting would you suggest?
16:48 < EastBite> best match on top
16:48 < EastBite> "east" -> east on top
16:48 <@deen> how do you determine what's a best match?
16:49 < EastBite> why is Pasteque on top when I search for east
16:49 < EastBite> because of "ast" ?
16:49 <@deen> i'm also wondering
16:50 <@deen> there isn't even a request coming for the "east" query, only for "eas"
16:50 < EastBite> hm
16:50 < Savander> how it works?
16:50 < Savander> its jquery?
16:50 < Savander> or ajax? :c
16:50 < EastBite> it falls under ajax
16:51 < Savander> jquery in ajax?
16:51 < Savander> ahm, ok didn't know
16:51 < Savander> I have never used
16:51 < Savander> :/
16:52 < EastBite> ajax is just a term
16:52 < EastBite> "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML"
16:52 <@deen> no xml here
16:52 <@deen> :P
16:52 < EastBite> but deen uses json 
16:52 < EastBite> ajaj
16:54 < EastBite> deen: the speed of a tw bruteforce depends on bandwidth right?
16:54 <@deen> no idea
16:54 < EastBite> it doeeees
16:54 < EastBite> server responds no matter what
16:55 < EastBite> so the traffic gets really big
16:55 < EastBite> = easy to block
16:56 < EastBite> but not necessary I guess
16:56 < EastBite> as long as the password isn't 4 letters long :P
16:57 < Savander> the best idea
16:57 < Savander> add accounts for testers to client (and on server),, then if you logged in 
16:57 <@deen> it was 3 letters long :P
16:57 < Savander> you can join 
16:57 < Savander> xD
16:58 < EastBite> oh okay
16:58 < Savander> otherwise
16:58 < Savander> close connection
16:58 < Savander> <Lol>
16:58 <@deen> EastBite: happier with the search now?
16:58 < EastBite> yay
16:58 < EastBite> I also am more important then eastcoast
16:58 <@deen> just because you have more points
16:58 < EastBite> :)
16:58 <@deen> but that's the only reasonable way i can think of
16:59 <@deen> otherwise people will just make troll finishes to have funny names in the list
16:59 < EastBite> okay that's true
16:59 < EastBite> deen afk has 2 points
17:07 < laxa_work> really deen, test server password was 3 char long ?
17:07 < laxa_work> this is so easy to find stupid passphrases that no one will ever find
17:07 < laxa_work> "you won't find it"
17:07 < laxa_work> "this passwors id way too good for you"
17:10 < EastBite> my pws often are like "test" and blubb"
17:12 < laxa_work> The thing I hate about passwords, are website that asks for number + uppercase + lowercase + special sign
17:12 < laxa_work> when the safest passwords are just the longest
17:12 < EastBite> ye
17:13 < EastBite> people do not even remember those but rather use password reset via mail
17:13 < laxa_work> I am trying to not save any important passwords into chrome
17:13 < laxa_work> I am wondering if it's safe to save them...
17:13 < EastBite> I am wondering if it's safe to use chrome
17:13 < laxa_work> xD
17:14 < laxa_work> google knows all your passwords man !
17:14 < EastBite> do you know that the firefox addon api has a privilege called chrome? :D
17:15 < laxa_work> Nop
17:16 < EastBite> I learned alot about firefox addons recently
17:17 < EastBite> they are kind of dangerous
17:17 < EastBite> you can't even find out whether an addons gets full access to you harddrive
18:42 <@deen> The search feature should go public in a few minutes. Report any bugs please
18:42 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ranks/novice/
18:53 < laxa> the graphic doesn't feel right to me
18:53 < laxa> too big
18:53 < laxa> just my personnal opinion
18:54 < laxa> this feel off the design you already have
18:54 < laxa> round corner on text box, no round corner on website for example
18:57 < laxa> Player not found
18:57 < laxa> Maybe who you're looking for is in this list:
18:58 < laxa> this could be improved with the code you made with the search I think
19:03 < laxa> deen: could you make this evening, the last finishes dynamic, and make at least a hidden text for the rank ? I really wanna make the plugin tonight :).
19:16 < laxa> !uptime
19:16 < Nimda> Uptime: 10 hours, 56 minutes and 13 seconds - Total Uptime: 10 hours, 56 minutes and 42 seconds
19:17 <@deen> yeah, i just copied the style, be welcome to improve it
19:17 <@deen> laxa: i don't think that plugin is needed after all
19:17 < laxa> the old one you presented with /search.html was better, the one you used previously on compare box
19:18 < laxa> beh, I wanna code something deen, like this plugin xD
19:18 <@deen> and dynamic last finishes would increase the load time of those pages a lot
19:18 <@deen> it should ideally work by inotify on the mysql binlog
19:18 <@deen> but then it would need to run on dnet, so meh
19:20 < laxa> then provide an API for it :p
19:21 < laxa> or nevermind
19:21 < laxa> give me idea for nice plugin !
19:23 <@deen> Make a graph of the player number over time
19:27 <@deen> I'll give you your api
19:28 <@deen> but website stays static
19:28 <@deen> ah no, the resulting rank would still be missing
19:28 <@deen> i don't want to look that up too =/
19:30 < EastBite> laxa: you also could do something easy
19:30 < EastBite> !top5 <map>
19:30 < laxa> hum
19:33 < laxa> deen: is there a specifig signal that should be prefered to kill teeworlds servers ?
19:33 < EastBite> shutdown
19:34 < laxa> I don't have fifo 
19:34 <@deen> yeah, i use the fifo^^
19:34 <@deen> i don't know if the server listens to signals
19:34 < EastBite> laxa
19:34 <@deen> but the client does
19:34 < EastBite> how abuot using 
19:34 < EastBite> fifo
19:34 < EastBite> not sure either
19:34 < laxa> I better work, on something that would be usefull
19:34 < laxa> ddracepro.net are dead servers to me :(
19:35 <@deen> ok, client listens, server doesn't, very weird
19:35 <@deen> be welcome to fix it :P
19:35 <@deen> you're*
19:35 < laxa> I think now I'll spend more and more time to code on my free time
19:35 < laxa> or learning things
19:35 < laxa> so, I don't know yet what I am going to do
19:36 <@deen> fix all ddnet bugs
19:36 < laxa> it's on my "maybe" list :p
19:36 <@deen> they're the "not easy" bugs though, because i didn't fix them yet
19:36 < laxa> but in order to do that, I'll need to learn C++
19:36 < EastBite> DO IT
19:36 < laxa> xD
19:37 < laxa> I learnt it 3 years ago, but forgot everything
19:37 <@deen> i don't like that kind of learning
19:37 < laxa> what kind of learning oO ?
19:37 <@deen> just do projects in the language and you get a feeling for it. also read a lot of code
19:37 <@deen> i don't know how you learnt, but i guess with a tutorial or book
19:37 < laxa> if I learn C++
19:37 < laxa> I'll read that
19:38 < laxa> http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/programmez-avec-le-langage-c
19:38 < EastBite> I recommend to learn C++ from C and lowlevel stuff
19:38 < laxa> I already know C
19:38 <@deen> if you want to write on teeworlds code, c++ will do you no good at all
19:38 <@deen> teeworlds is c + classes from c++
19:38 <@deen> and you won't need to touch the classes in any complicated way for any of the bugs
19:39 < EastBite> not sure whether matricks wanted to port tw to C++
19:39 <@deen> the most recent c++ versions are actually pretty nice
19:39 < EastBite> ya they look really different
19:40 < laxa> if I become rich, I might pay an entreprise to recode all teewords in full object with C++ :p
19:40 < EastBite> a C coder can't read it anymore
19:40 <@deen> a lot of good ideas adopted from other languages
19:40 <@deen> i made the player search look more ddnet-stylish
19:40 < EastBite> but modern cpp versions are not supported by vs I guess
19:40 <@deen> true
19:41 <@deen> and not by intel's compiler
19:41 < laxa> I don't intend to dev C++ on VS
19:41 <@deen> which is why i'm in trouble with my masters thesis^^
19:41 < EastBite> lel
19:41 <@deen> but gcc + llvm are fine
19:41 < EastBite> stil need to learn about llvm
19:41 <@deen> nimrod programs with llvm/clang compile faster and run faster
19:41 <@deen> it's cool
19:42 <@deen> i like the search thing
19:42 < EastBite> I like it too
19:42 <@deen> even though it's by twitter
19:42 <@deen> but it works with keyboard only!
19:42 <@deen> TAB works, up, down works
19:42 <@deen> enter works
19:42 <@deen> perfect

19:49 < laxa> ok, now bot exiting correctly :)
20:46 < o_be_one> hey someone knows where i can get the latest teeball mod ?
20:47 <@deen> can't find it
20:47 < Tobii> http://funelefant.de
20:48 < o_be_one> oh nice Tobii thank you :)
20:49 <@deen> oh, i thought you mean sourcecode^^
20:49 < o_be_one> its better with sourcecode
20:49 < o_be_one> but no problem, the goal is to up a server
20:49 < o_be_one> awesome there is battlefield too :D
20:50 < o_be_one> im looking too for a good updated city gametype
20:50 < EastBite> o0
20:50 < o_be_one> EastBite, never tried city ?
20:50 <@deen> city is like block: i have no idea what the purpose of the mod is^^
20:50 < EastBite> it's about chilling
20:50 <@deen> i've only seen that people sell stuff there
20:51 < o_be_one> city is useless but many players loves it, idk why
20:51 <@deen> so you need a mod to chill?
20:51 < EastBite> and giving players different rights to disturb other players
20:51 < o_be_one> 2 years ago i was playing some citys and have fun, idk how ...
20:51 < EastBite> o_be_one: do you know ecity?
20:51 < o_be_one> no
20:52 < EastBite> nvm then
20:52 < o_be_one> last time ive searched was 2 years ago and didnt found one good and opensource (without master pw)
20:53 < EastBite> deen: building a city was like building a small realworld :D
20:53 < EastBite> that actually was really fun
20:53 < EastBite> but playing it...
23:08 < Savander> goodnight
23:08 < Savander> :)
