21:19 < eeeee> ^ does that broadcast your nickname to every tw server on the internet? kiddies are gonna like that.
21:28 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: yes, it does
21:28 <@heinrich5991> also it performs an sql query for every received packet
21:28 <@heinrich5991> sounds pretty optimal, huh?
21:29 < eeeee> needs a sql injection for a hat-trick
21:30 <@deen> i think i told them a few times that we should NOT add that feature =/
21:30 <@deen> it was requested quite often
21:30 <@heinrich5991> tbh it seems they're running pretty wild on adding features
21:32 < eeeee> sounds like a neat feature to me, just has to be implemented as a separate service (sync the finish times from http and cache them locally)
21:32 <@deen> eeeee: then it only works on official ddnet
21:32 <@deen> and people always complain with ddnet-only features
21:34 < eeeee> but would they complain more if that feature was missing entirely or if it was ddnet-only?
21:34 <@deen> eeeee: see http download, no one complained before we had it, afterwards they complain that it's ddnet specific and other servers don't profit
