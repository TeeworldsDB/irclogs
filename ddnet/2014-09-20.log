01:07 <@deen> Any opinions?: http://ddnet.tw/mappers/Aoe/
01:11 < laxa> opinion: why not.
01:11 < laxa> I have terrible headache, I go sleep
01:11 <@deen> good night

10:17 < EastBite> deen: I will zlib encrypt the json list okay? okay
10:17 < EastBite> unfortuately the plain file gets about 4k big
10:18 < EastBite> zlib compress*
11:30 <@deen> EastBite: told you json is bad! yeah, ok
11:38 < EastBite> deen: I made the VERSIONSRV_DDNETLIST dynamic sized if that's ok
11:39 < EastBite> Packet: VERSIONSRV_DDNETLIST + char[4] Token + int16 comp_length + int16 plain_length + char[comp_length]
11:39 <@deen> ok
11:41 < EastBite> deen: btw. you didn't zero m_aNews in versionsrv, are you sure it doesn't contain random data after reading "news"?
11:43 < EastBite> should be the case if "news" isn't NEWS_SIZE bytes long
11:43 < EastBite> but dunno
11:43 <@deen> doesn't matter because there's a 0 at the end of the file, right?
11:43 <@deen> I just made it fixed size so I can easily see how much more space I have^^
11:44 < EastBite> if the zeros fill up to NEWS_SIZE it's okay :P
12:00 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #41: DDNet Tab / Server list (DDRace64...ddsrvs) http://git.io/VqRfGA
12:06 < EastBite> I hope it doesn't require too much fixing
12:11 <@deen> I'll take a look now
12:13 < Savander> hello
12:13 < EastBite> hi Savander 
12:13 <@deen> Good morning
12:13 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/mappers/Savander/
12:14 < EastBite> :)
12:15 <@deen> laxa: i think Aoe wanted to send you a demo
12:26 < Savander> Wow
12:26 < Savander> Nice :)
12:28 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/mappers/Silex/
12:32 < Savander> deen: what's wrong with this map?
12:32 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/maps/?map=Exchange
12:33 < Savander> HAhaha
12:33 < EastBite> my webgl map viewer might be wrong
12:33 < EastBite> I go jogging
12:40 < Savander> Yay..
12:40 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/mappers/Unknown-32-Mapper/ the best our mapper
12:40 < Savander> :PPP
12:49 < laxa> Hi
12:49 < laxa> A lots of maps have the mapper's name inside it and it's not in ddnet db.
12:53 < Savander> ye
13:23 < EastBite> hm really muggy outside
13:27 <@deen> laxa: Zerodin said he'll try to enter them soon
13:27 < laxa> ok nice 
13:27 <@deen> Savander: the Exchange map could never work with webgl map viewer
13:27 <@deen> it's a really weird map
13:28 < EastBite> map viewer doesn't handle quads moves
13:28 <@deen> and also in this map there are 2 graphics for everything and they change all the time

13:42 < EastBite> the grid is not dynamic enough I guess
13:42 <@deen> well, i plan to shrink by 1 country, not grow
13:42 <@deen> so it's fine i guess
13:42 < EastBite> okay
13:44 < EastBite> hm

13:58 <@deen> Can you fix it? =/
13:58 < Tobii> maybe^^
14:02 <@deen> EastBite: your variable size array made the compile stop working!
14:02 <@deen> is there a max length the serverlist buffer can have?
14:04 < EastBite> So I'm not allowed to variable sized arrays?
14:04 <@deen> I guess not
14:04 < EastBite> meh
14:04 < EastBite> Tobii: let me do
14:05 < Tobii> k
14:05 <@deen> also the json.h doesn't compile
14:06 <@deen> VS doesn't like the inline
14:06 < EastBite> I guss because of the inline functions
14:06 <@deen> yes

14:09 <@deen> let me do it, should be quick
14:09 < EastBite> also the variable sized stuff?
14:10 < EastBite> there is a variable sized buffer in client.cpp for uncompressed data
14:10 <@deen> yes
14:10 < EastBite> also in versionsrv
14:11 <@deen> let's just use 16 KB?
14:11 < EastBite> yep, right
14:16 <@deen> does __inline work in VS 2010?
14:16 < Tobii> https://gist.github.com/Tobii-/b80bcd0bc987b6fda69f works for me
14:17 < EastBite> deen: I guess it's about the .c exension
14:17 <@deen> ok, thanks
14:17 < EastBite> okay
14:17 < EastBite> Tobii: better use mem_alloc() and mem_free() for it
14:18 < EastBite> the cool thing is, players which are in habit of clicking on favourites will accidently click on ddnet :D
14:18 < Tobii> EastBite: feel free to change it :D
14:19 < Tobii> idk why but i had to move the "unsigned int i" up for it to work

14:23 <@deen> Tobii: hm, why?
14:23 < Tobii> error C2054: Nach 'inline' muss '(' folgen
14:23 < EastBite> I guess it's better only add prototypes in .h
14:23 <@deen> huh, doesn't the #define inline __inline work?
14:24 < Tobii> dont looks like it works
14:24 < Tobii> also i dont had to change all the inline to __inline
14:24 <@deen> maybe it's beter if you make the fix then =/
14:25 < Tobii> cant test if it works on linux^^
14:25 < EastBite> we still need a windows buildbot :D
14:25 < EastBite> Tobii: just make the gist
14:25 < Tobii> its still there
14:25 < Tobii> https://gist.github.com/Tobii-/b80bcd0bc987b6fda69f#file-json-h
14:26 < EastBite> maybe CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS doesn't exist
14:26 < EastBite> is it defined in src/base/ ?
14:28 <@deen> Tobii: is that the fix that works or what?
14:28 < Tobii> looks like it exists json.h(35) : fatal error C1189: #error :  Test
14:28 < Tobii> deen: it works on windows
14:28 < EastBite> k
14:28 < EastBite> strange
14:28 < Tobii> after the change i just made i think it should also work on linux
14:28 < Tobii> but i down know
14:29 <@deen> but why not with the __inline i did?
14:29 < Tobii> no idea
14:30 < Tobii> maybe you cant change keywords with define?

14:33 < Tobii> it still uses the wrong inline but when i put an error inside the if it also gets executed...
14:33 < Tobii> *if
14:34 < Tobii> i have no idea whats happening
14:35 < EastBite> Tobii: and you are sure that __inline really worked?
14:35 < Tobii> it compiled before
14:35 < Tobii> and it still does with __inline
14:37 < Tobii> maybe CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS really isnt defined but that wouldnt explain why #error works inside the if
14:37 < EastBite> looks like the preprocessor is trolling us
14:38 < Tobii> looks like the file is parsed twice... one time with CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS the other time without
14:39 < EastBite> ah it is
14:39 < EastBite> from serverbrowser.cpp and json.c
14:39 < EastBite> so CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS is not defined when json.c is compiled
14:39 < Tobii> maybe we can use _MSC_VER
14:40 <@deen> yes, try that
14:40 <@deen> it's used in other c libs in tw source too
14:40 < Tobii> looks like it works
14:40 <@deen> and it's probably set by VS directly
14:40 < EastBite> #elif defined(WIN32) || defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN32__) || defined(__MINGW32__)
14:40 < EastBite>     #define CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS 1
14:41 < EastBite> we could also include detect.h
14:41 <@deen> nah, that's wrong anyway
14:41 < Tobii> #ifdef _MSC_VER works
14:41 < EastBite> okay
14:41 < Tobii> both times

14:45 < EastBite> oh wait
14:45 < EastBite> would also mean a new version
14:45 < EastBite> nvm
14:45 < laxa> can anyone help me try my personal git repo ?
14:46 < Tobii> versionserver also dont compiles for windows... but i dont think its needed xD
14:47 < EastBite> oh it's defined here #define GAME_VERSION "0.6.2, 4.9.3"
14:47 < EastBite> Tobii: yes, right
14:47 < EastBite> ehm, but versionsrv also compiles with release I guess
14:48 < EastBite> so everyone will see errors when using bam release
14:50 < laxa> ddnet tab not wotking
14:50 < EastBite> it's empty
14:50 < EastBite> because the versionsrv is not set up
14:52 < Tobii> EastBite: chunk payload to big... using the list you sent before
14:53 < EastBite> it's zlib compressed down to ~600 bytes
14:54 < EastBite> and it's size will never go above 1K
14:55 < EastBite> its*
15:15 <@deen> why is the versionsrv not compiling on windows?
15:17 < EastBite> deen: ah you forgot something
15:17 < EastBite> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/versionsrv/versionsrv.cpp#L142
15:17 <@deen> oops
15:17 < EastBite> p.m_DataSize = sizeof(aData); also needs to be corrected then
15:19 <@deen> what was the size for the compressed thing?
15:19 < EastBite> m_ServerListCompLength
15:19 <@deen> yeah, i mean the max for aData
15:19 < EastBite> sizeof(VERSIONSRV_DDNETLIST) + 4 + 2 + 2 + m_ServerListCompLength
15:20 < EastBite> 16kb? xd
15:20 <@deen> meh, ok
15:20 < EastBite> first I wanted to use alloca() instead of dyn sized arrays
15:20 < EastBite> but it's not in base
15:21 <@deen> alloca is not standard c i think
15:22 < EastBite> oh I thought it is
15:22 < EastBite> well
15:22 < EastBite> why does nobody want to use the stack dynamically xd
15:22 < EastBite> it's the same in nim
15:24 <@deen> because it can fail randomly
15:24 <@deen> it only works with very small values
15:24 <@deen> and you could as well use a fixed size array then
15:24 < EastBite> hm
15:24 <@deen> and also C has a standard way for variable stack arrays, but VS is stupid
15:24 < EastBite> yes

15:37 < EastBite> deen: when using IOFLAG_WRITE on a file
15:37 < EastBite> will its content be removed first?
15:37 <@deen> woah, did you see the iRhyme block server in internet tab?
15:38 <@deen> it has an animated name and faked ping 0
15:38 <@deen> pretty easy to fake ping, i should punish that in ddnet client
15:38 <@deen> if they send packets from the future ping should be 999 not 0
15:39 < EastBite> what about the client->srv ping faking?
15:39 < EastBite> zclient seems to have it
15:39 <@deen> i think it makes the players lag, so if they like that^^
15:39 < EastBite> well but then they would complain
15:39 < EastBite> we will see
15:39 < EastBite> what do you mean by animated name?
15:39 <@deen> oh god, that mod is by sai...
15:40 < EastBite> ah I get it
15:40 < EastBite> I think the lower ping is just a side effect of the animation?
15:41 < EastBite> we just shouldn't acceot multiple responses
15:41 <@deen> but multiple responses are used for 64 player info though
15:41 <@deen> we should accept them, but discard the name change
15:41 < EastBite> but you can verify it
15:42 <@deen> yeah
15:42 <@deen> feel free to add it
15:42 < EastBite> busy right now "{
15:42 < EastBite> :P
15:42 < EastBite> I guess the zclient is released tomorrow before the tournament

15:49 <@deen> I should probably talk to them, even if they're assholes
15:49 < EastBite> what do you want to talk about?
15:50 <@deen> i think they want to release the client because i blocked them in skype when i was bored of hearing about their bots and stuff
15:51 < EastBite> "125ms is a magical limit of how fast a human can click"
15:51 <@deen> haha
15:51 < EastBite> ^ what about hooking
15:51 < EastBite> so they don't fly around
15:51 <@deen> but 125 is totally wrong i think
15:51 < EastBite> maybe xd
15:51 <@deen> i bet pros can hook faster
15:51 < EastBite> but not so fast that you acn
15:51 < EastBite> can't see the hook maybe
15:52 <@deen> if you had the bot you could test it
15:53 <@deen> You could ask HMH
15:53 <@deen> he has a similar bot
15:54 < EastBite> I'm just thinking about how it's possible to get rid of annoying zclient users
15:54 < EastBite> but I don't know whether it's even worth it to try to fight them
15:54 <@deen> Hm, we can't make the DDNet tab default because News is already default
15:54 < EastBite> ^ :D
15:54 < EastBite> anyway, they will try to click on fav and accidently click on ddnet
15:54 < EastBite> perfect
15:55 <@deen> haha
15:55 <@deen> is the order ok like that?
15:55 < EastBite> I think so
15:55 <@deen> internet - LAN - Favorites - DDNet
15:55 < laxa> I have an idea to avoid bots coming into DDNet
15:55 < laxa> but it's really bad
15:55 <@deen> laxa: make a server for bots?
15:55 < laxa> no
15:55 <@deen> DDBotwork
15:55 < laxa> lol
15:55 < laxa> that's called
15:55 < laxa> TAS
15:56 <@deen> yes, so?
15:56 < laxa> I am just waiting to see those bots in action
15:56 <@deen> ask meskalin, monsta, hmh or maple, they can show you
15:56 < EastBite> http://zclient-tw.tk/
15:57 <@deen> I have the solution, everyone with an "m" in their name has the bot. We should just ban them!
15:57 < EastBite> they have?
15:58 <@deen> "meskalin, monsta, hmh or maple"
15:58 <@deen> yes!
15:58 < EastBite> great plan!
15:58 < EastBite> well right now there are many ways to detect this client
15:58 < EastBite> but it will change when we try to block it
15:59 < EastBite> but one think I want todo is to analyse there encrypted chat protocol :)
15:59 < EastBite> their*
15:59 <@deen> encrypted chat?
16:00 < EastBite> watch the video on their page
16:00 < EastBite> they have a chat obfusecator
16:01 < EastBite> at minute 1:00
16:02 < EastBite> it's the easiest thing to kill such a feature
16:04 < EastBite> deen: "I should probably talk to them" might be like feeding the trolls
16:04 <@deen> well, they explicitly said i should talk to them or "something will happen"
16:04 < EastBite> xd
16:05 < EastBite> instead of just visiting the irc
16:05 <@deen> I feel bad for Welf because he put months of work into his tournament map and they're trying to sabotage it

20:23 <@deen> oh
20:24 <@deen> EastBite: For the Tournament we could make a "DDNet country" now
20:24 < EastBite> good idea
20:24 <@deen> with the somalian flag
20:24 <@deen> i just tested and it works perfectly
20:25 < EastBite> just add a new flag xd
20:25 <@deen> no, somalia!
20:25 < EastBite> wow a white star pm cyan ground
20:25 <@deen> ?

20:25 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/so.png
20:26 < EastBite> everyone will think: "oh ddnet tournament there!"
20:26 <@deen> how else would the flag look?
20:27 < EastBite> some ddnet gfx
20:27 < EastBite> dunno
20:27 < EastBite> well the flag is okay
20:31 <@deen> hm, no, don't think that's a good idea after all
20:32 <@deen> the flag isn't clear, adding a flag would be stupid and you have to remove all your other country preferences just to see the tournament servers
20:32 < EastBite> ya
20:32 < EastBite> hm I thought about highlighting tournament servers in the list
20:46 < laxa> deen: is it me or there is a bug ?
20:46 < laxa> ddnet.tw:8304
20:46 < laxa> I see 8 spec with no names in favorite tab
20:47 < EastByte> I also see them
20:50 <@deen> what?
20:51 <@deen> ah
