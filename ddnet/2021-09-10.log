02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Moving from Eclipse to Visual studio ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Seriously the progam feels so bad to me
06:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Bruh eclipse
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bruh eclipse
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Bruh vs studio
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Visual studio studio:troll:

08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> üòµ‚Äçüí´
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ahahahaha
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:04 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u must web scale
09:04 <+Ryozuki> "mongodb handles web scale" 
09:04 <+Ryozuki> xdd
09:05 <+Ryozuki> "Mongo DB handles web scale. You turn it on and it scales right up" 
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Moving from one of the most annoying IDEs ever made to the worst IDE ever made sounds like a good way to quit programming
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So you switched from emacs to Visual Studio ?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'm slowly losing my mind. How can I possibly keep failing this dumb computer networks exam ...
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you study networks?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> teach me pls
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do you now how network namespaces work?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> `man ip-netns`
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> dat boi
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> network namespaces give you a place where you can configure separte network views for separate programs
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yas!
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i want to use two interfaces at the same time
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> to get two teeworlds clients with 2 ips so i can bypass ddnet bans better
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sus
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no proof
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no talking about breaking the rules chillerdragon
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok i want to use two ips for two tw clients ( FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES )
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm done helping you with that (and people writing "for educational purposes" usually have something bad in mind)
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea educational purposes is a big meme \:D
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i actually want to use it to by pass max clients ip limit on fokkonaut server
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You were so close too
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did you reply to some msg?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can we ban discord replys?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah I replied to you. You were so close to learning how to do it but you just had to tell your reason for wanting to learn it :P
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> omg matrix ded
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> otherwise you would have teached me? senpai learath :)
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc not, I'm scheduled to sulk for the rest of the day
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> troll
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> intransitive verb
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> : to be moodily silent
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> sulk
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> schmollen?
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah lol
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> :beer:
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What an absolute joke. I actually administer networks, how can I not pass a computer networks exam? Pure insanity
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> go teach me netns u will learn a lot
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1631268342.png
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> zwelf unban me from matrix
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> aaa
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> omg my screenshots are ded
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everything is breaking down
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> ez fix
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> permissions master dragon
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a matrix bacc
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks zwelf
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if it helps learath i still love you even if you failed ur exam \:)
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:3
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im sure the students that only learn for tests and pass the exam could not administer networks in the real world like you my lord
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller u need to learn to use google more
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ikr
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its actually ur lazyness or that u dont know
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but honestly
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> bit of both
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most stuff u ask i always find with 1 google
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats why i ask u
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u so good
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wat u found now?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :twintri:
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk i didnt search that
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually i dont know much about that
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nob
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and even if i knew heinrich is here to use the banhammer on me on the asap
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i just fixed my mail server feels so good
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> postfix?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yas
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> more dovecot
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> was the issue
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> big pain in the ass
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the next time i setup a email server ill use https://maddy.email/
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just to lazy to switch over rn
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It replaces Postfix, Dovecot, OpenDKIM, OpenSPF, OpenDMARC and more with one daemon with uniform configuration and minimal maintenance cost.
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the next time i setup a mail server ill dont
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> axaxax
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i am a cheap maintainer
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i do not get paid
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/eyebrow-raise-shrek-serious-gif-14262407
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are exams always close to reality?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe thats it
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is this the anti-unix newfangled web 69.0 software?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the kernel doesnt follow the unix philosophy
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a monolithic kernel
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thus we should make everything else monolithic too, got it
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but anyway u dont know the pain of configuring all that shit
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe u do
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have the same setup my guy
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not anymore because big-email doesnt let you host your own mail now
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still host it
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gmail accepts my emails but oddly they take 10 mins more
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to receive them
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Got bored of all my mail ending in spam when I satisfy all the requirements on googles site. They just dont like my hoster
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw if there was an open source movement to create a nice kernel based on microkernel architecture I'd support it. Alas it's too big of an undertaking now
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not even close a lot of outdated shit. Like who even has CSMA/CD on their network? We have full duplex links and bus topologies aren't a thing anymore. It's not 1980
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I'll just go cry for a bit. Then I'll think of wtf keeps going wrong when I take this shit
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 when are you going to merge?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like we can get a release until @heinrich5991 decides on what to do with the startline thing
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what if they skip start line
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> drag the 1-2 tees to finish(when they started)
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> go over start and then kill
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> going back a map is mostly faster than the opposite bcs of the teleporters
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still a semi startline skip xd
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe spawns should just always be protected by startlines, and disallow startline skips at all, instead of making it more complicated xd
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where are patigas tools, that can detect it xd
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ‚ú™ pretty sure that you need to touch the start line before the finish line, else it won't count
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u skip with 10 ppl (in team)
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> -> you drag 2 from start to finish
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> -> the remaining 8 tees go to the start and kill
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still have a fast finished team
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its the same skip as fixed by the patch just with going back to startline
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be easier to define a non broken spawn, e.g.
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the area around a spawn should have solids(unskippable), or a startline
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if you can get ninja(e.g. afk king) it requires the teleoutcome or startline to have shield before it
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or if there is a tele gun, disallow shooting through start
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do the two tees that get dragged touch the start?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I dont understand the skip yet
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you understand the patch?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it does the same except the last part
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 10 tees, all skip
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2 get dragged, the remaining kill
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, haven't seen it yet
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that was fixed
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it its still atleast doable semi, depending on the ma
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it its still atleast doable semi, depending on the map
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll look into implementing https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4088#issuecomment-915394258

21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hey. Today I was coding some Rust and hooking up a specific web rendering framework to a GUI framework. The web framework renders HTML to a framebuffer and I pass the framebuffer to the GUI framework to render it as part of the GUI. I could just pass the pointer to the framebuffer in memory but the problem is, the web framework outputs BGRA but the GUI framework only has options of RBG and RBGA. So I wrote some Rust to allocate a 500x500x3

21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I need to do this each frame
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> BGRA and RBGA.. really weird formats
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Only chance todo it fast is on GPU probably, if you need it per frame
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but reading from gpu memory might also be slow on dedicated cards
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah I'd need to get the input to the GPU and retrieve the results from the GPU. Sounds kinda heavy
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I mean the whole web rendering is happening on the CPU
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't get why my simple byte flipping thing should be the bottleneck here
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs math for single pixles is the most expensive thing
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess I could multithread it xD
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean if you only target fast computers it could be fine
21:28 <+DMT> I want a feature that notifies on desktop whenever a friend goes online. For how much can anyone do this?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> install steam
21:29 <+DMT> Need to notify when a teeworlds friend goes online
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> install steam
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Actually it turns out if I build the Rust with --release everything runs MUCH faster. Might even be LLVM doing some SIMD magic behind the scenes
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> timakro ah, tight loops benefit a lot from --release even without simd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DMT: Not so hard actually with https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Quite hacky, but something like this üòÑ
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> while true; do
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   friends=$(cat ~/.teeworlds/settings_ddnet.cfg | grep "^add_friend " | sed -e "s/^add_friend \"\([^\"]*\)\".*/\1/" | while read line; do echo -n ".==\"$line\" or "; done; echo)

23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   sleep 10
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   clear
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
