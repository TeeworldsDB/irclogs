06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ^
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I get `[2021-04-29 00:31:51][client]: dropped weird message 'invalid' (0), failed on '(type out of range)'` aswell now after reverting the commit mentioned in the issue above
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> @Learath2  or @deen database connections on FRA are failing right now. Could you check whether the database is reachable from there? Otherwise https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4429 might not work as intended and needs to be reverted.
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hayesall.com/blog/latex-automata/
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> latex always cool
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can confirm that no db connection from ddnet server work
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but from command line works, rebuilding with state before your PR
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure which changes exactly to revert
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4429/commits/8c8b4e5bb410317df85e1075fbcc1f3e75220db3 should be enough
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> does the server print something like `dismissed read request during FailMode`?
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2021-12-29 09:11:19][chat-command]: 0 used /top5
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2021-12-29 09:11:19][sql]: show top5 dismissed read request during shutdown
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2021-12-29 09:11:19][sql]: show top5 failed on all databases
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> uh, ok then the other commit
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> mb both just in case
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4429/commits/ac0c935aa1352a43ef2fd15b2765fa7944fde96b
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's why I wanted to go back to old state ðŸ˜„
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zwelf I think there are further issues:
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2021-12-29 10:28:12][sql]: load best time failed: (execute:stmt:2013): Lost connection to MySQL server during query
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> this is with the 2 changes reverted
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Ok :/. I guess https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4429/commits/541667d00ad4468f10250925712469745e336462 needs to be reverted as well.
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> For the first two I'll try to investigate what went wrong. Was the change only rolled out in FRA?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> (especially not ger2, where I don't experience the issue?)
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, rolled out in all
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I had the same issue in GER2
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> layex is so cool
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> latex is so cool
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl should forget word
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and use latex
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <themsxr> ...
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hey, is it possible to also send the players skin name to the server infos and would that be ok to implement? Right now you can only get it client-side.
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> We could build some new useful tools with that, its just not possible right now
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Chillerdragon: your help bot on multeasymap is great
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had the same idea and opened a issue
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its possible with http masterserver
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just isnt there yet
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4415
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u forgot colors
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> use custom color, color body and color feet
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what's the multeasymap help bot
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> How to save server settings?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no way

19:22 <+ChillerDragon> @murpi pls no ban :c
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hasan mirac> bot ?
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> no proof!
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You're not showing the error message
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> sry, I fargot

20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> this was 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFB7.
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> invalid pointer I guess
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> invalid this pointer
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is GameServer() initialized?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> I think what gameworld initialized this pointer
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Because other entity working
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that pointer looks totally wrong
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> what did you guys do to new ddnet
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> feels so smooth
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on what os?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> macos has been optimized
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> windows 10
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> smoouli
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: since when are you the mac guy btw?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since I got a macbook 3 weeks ago
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and does that mean there is hope for a usuable mac expirience ? o.O
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow brand new
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems pretty good to me with my PRs now
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do you use it as a main machine?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> right now yes. but i actually ordered it for work, so have to see how that will go
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but it is your private daily driver now?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wew
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so did you pay it? And why a mac for work?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> SAP iOS app? \:D
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh thats why you also forked the brew repos
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes i stalk ppl on github \:D
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> new job for deen
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I quit my job at SAP, the laptop is for new work, had the choice between macbook or some Dell device I think
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wow job switch
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For now I bought it privately, but I hope they'll pay me for it in a few days ðŸ˜„ Not sure if I'm still allowed to use it privately then, will see
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> BYOD
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if you were at my company you had to install windows defender on your mac HAHA
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pls kill me
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> those corporate requirements for weird apps on devices has been annoying me for years
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> even on Linux devices a shell script running as root downloading and executing a script via http (without tls)...
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> what wm were you using again?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> on linux
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or on my iPhone the antivirus scanner would hog the entire device about twice a month and had to reboot
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> xmonad
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how do you cope with macOS windows? \:D
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Luckily for you I have a blog post just about that: https://hookrace.net/blog/macos-setup/
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok im 10% ur article maybe i should finish reading the blog before asking questions
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye ik -.-
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its soooo long
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just use everything in fullscreen, only have ~4 applications open at a time, and split terminals in iTerm
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> good enough for me
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes iterm
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> tmux masterrace
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if you would use tmux then a os switch is less change
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> iTerm is a mac thing isnt it? i used it too some time
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> tmux seems weird to me, I tried it before switching to xmonad
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> tmux is really nice
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you might want to configure it a bit first
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can you even select text from one of the "windows"?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but it is soooo good
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you can
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remember I used tmux when I tried not to use X11 at all, and did everything from command line for a few weeks
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that got annoying, and a real WM for everything, not just terminals is nicer
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hm
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> WOW macOS has wm
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I miss a section in "Mouse" explaining how to reproduce arch linux mousesense for ddnet on macOS hehe
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but to be honest I didn't play much in a while, so I don't mind
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye ikr
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I miss "âŒ˜ + Spacebar" in your shortcut list its literally the best
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i just use f4
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> dmenu for mac or however you cool tiling bois name it
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> never heard of f4 but i guess it works the same hm
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do you press f3 sometimes?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for that I use control up sometimes
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i guess thats more a gnome thing
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not really required much
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i press that 2 times a minute \:D
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> on gnome
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i remember loving to fullscreen all on macOS or split two fullscreen windows and then swipe with 3 or 4 fingers idk between the desktops thats so neat
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats such a mac workflow
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: so are you writing some metal drivers now? \:D
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> isnt openGL end of life on mac or something
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, it is. but works well enough
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We don't have many mac users, would make more sense to implement directx
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds like no app dev will ever use metal haha
