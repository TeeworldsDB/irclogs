07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> petition to make ddnet client not lose focus when you run server in main menu?
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> very annoying
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ama Can you check Polish translations? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3433
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen for #3504 why doesn't HAVING work?
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3504
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah it's not over an aggregate property
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think just a LIMIT 1 is cheaper than grouping and filtering
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would still need to filter, or how else do you get the correct Map to be the first in list?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, I'm just saying we can get rid of the grouping
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> without the group by we would get the median of each finish
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which is just the finish time itself
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, or not?
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, I don't think that's how partitions work
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are taking the median over the entire window iirc
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, my group by is totally wrong then
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it will work out due to the fact that all the values are the same and mysql reaaaally wants to fix your mistakes, but yes I think so
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can anyone tell me why the m_pMessage gets invalid utf8 on the way from here (https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/cb5622b612da54c43e0ab2ba2a96c67d2e74f133?w=1#diff-aba621fd6688d4086ab40e58808cc12fdf591fdedf0d6c58cde2312b68cea5e0R1760)
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> to
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/cb5622b612da54c43e0ab2ba2a96c67d2e74f133?w=1#diff-aba621fd6688d4086ab40e58808cc12fdf591fdedf0d6c58cde2312b68cea5e0R1791)
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> here
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ehhm
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hey, I have moved my 0.6 whisper part in my mod to PreProcessMsg(), no logic change, just changed the place where the whisper is split into parts and where we get the message out of the /w command.
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/cb5622b612da54c43e0ab2ba2a96c67d2e74f133?w=1
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> somehow, on the way from preprocessmsg to onmessage again, the m_pMessage gets (invalid utf8), and i dont know why
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i checked that even at the end, right before the retrun of the s_aRawMsg the m_pMessage still includes the right string
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> directly in OnMessage its broken already
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> @deen send me the list then i can check
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Ama https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3433/files
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Will have to fix like 3-4 lines
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Rest is fine
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> didnt do ddnet dev in a while what is this whole clang format all about
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> i mean i kinda get it what its about but any setup instructions anywhere? 
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> maybe a how to run it in the readme would be nice
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clang-format -i <file>
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea also found that i guess i have to either script something or go over the files i edited manually
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> ok well it works kinda well actually
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1611244931.png
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> not too conviced by the style yet :D
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> scripts/fix_style.py ah i see
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xddd
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> yikes how dangerous is it to run a system with full disk space? I feel like linux is handling it pretty well but the amount of warnings give me the impression the machin wont survive a reboot
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: don't. programs fail in funny ways
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a separate /home partition, but even that being full led to various funny effects
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and data corruption by programs which can't handle errors on write
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> oh intresting
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> i though it was foolish to doubt linux performance under such conditions
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> yea i quickly run a command that takes about 3days to finish then ima clean some space :D
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> yea on my arch machine i also run with a /home partition hasnt brought me any value yet but we will see
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are giving linux a responsability it doesnt have
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> programs not handling write errors are their fault
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is*?
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Can someone add a feature where you can navigate the through the menu/tab options using arrow keys? would be nice that when the game launches or in the server views to change tabs using arrow keys (you can up down left right then press enter rather than moving your mouse.), maybe its just me who would like this (CLI like interaction!).. but idk.
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @SPYRES the main menu works with some shortcuts (enter or p to play, d for demos, e for editor, r to run server, s for settings, q to quit, n for news). I would also like more keyboard input, but then I realized the entire game only works with mouse, so it's not too bad if the menus are also only usable with mouse
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> @Learath2 why don't you port your own commits from teeworlds to DDNet?
