03:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watefek who dis? https://github.com/Jipok
03:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> found him while browsing non tw github repos ?!
03:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tw fame?
04:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the gpl they are talking about here what is it? Is the the license? https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/linux-6-7-3-545-29-06-550-40-07-error-modpost-gpl-incompatible-module-nvidia-ko-uses-gpl-only-symbol-rcu-read-lock/280908/55
04:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did a fucking license break the nvidia compile during my debian update!?
04:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bruv kernel panic on boot. And debian is stable they said^^
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea so if there are any debian users here that have the nvidia package installed I recommend holding back updates for a while.
07:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As soon as it gets the extended sever info
07:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So in this case the master server script
07:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But maybe Heinrich didn't add this
07:49 < bridge> <reitw> chillerdragon: had this at work yes
07:49 < bridge> <reitw> With my RTX A500
08:24 < bridge> <reitw> funny tho debian tells me it's a A1000
08:25 < bridge> <reitw> funny tho debian tells me it's a A1000, maybe it is
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> well what do you expect it to do
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> what encoder & settings are you using
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> can't really blame obs
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> libavcodec does all the heavy lifting as far as video encoding is concerned
08:43 < bridge> <teero777> I expected storage not to stall the entire process when you're only running on memory
08:43 < bridge> <teero777> Yes myself was the issue
09:11 < bridge> <kekomonter> Maybe this looks bad, but it looks fine to me. My first hud in lua xdd

09:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hot
09:17 < bridge> <remakepower> You need to recv the client extend serverinfo msg.
09:19 < bridge> <remakepower> The client send a packet with NET_HEADER_EXTENDED
09:20 < bridge> <remakepower> The packet like this mode
09:20 < bridge> <remakepower> [NET_HEADER_EXTENDED] [Extra Data]
09:21 < bridge> <remakepower> You need to get the extra data, and
09:22 < bridge> <remakepower> analyze it
09:23 < bridge> <teero777> broke ass
09:23 < bridge> <remakepower> MRPG0.6 ?
09:23 < bridge> <teero777> i don't speak broke
09:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nope
09:25 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh
09:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are you planning to hard fork like ninslash or nodes?
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> is this client <-> server lua communication or is it just clientside lua binding baloney
09:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The server sends the lua code its full on remote code execution axaxaxa
09:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> At least that‚Äôs what I understood from his previous message
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lmao
09:46 < bridge> <kekomonter> No, I think
09:47 < bridge> <kekomonter> Server is avaible for standard ddnet client
09:47 < bridge> <kekomonter> But custom client can receive lua code from server and execute
09:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxaxa
09:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How are you going to advertise this rat? @kekomonter
09:50 < bridge> <kekomonter> :justatest:
09:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jokes on me by the way
09:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I gave you the same access on my vps lmao
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah be a bit careful xd
09:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yikes
09:50 < bridge> <teero777> xDDD
09:50 < bridge> <kekomonter> xd
09:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The Russian hackers
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This opens a huge door for hackers
09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lua itself also has quite some cve apparently
09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Use wasm with rust
09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
09:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think it was lerato who once said ‚Äûclient side rce is a feature so servers can send better prediction code to reduce lags‚Äú
09:52 < bridge> <kekomonter> Rust?

09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Fake rust doesn't require parenthesis after a if or for token
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Else indeed looks like rust
09:56 < bridge> <remakepower> Are there any more PVE mod like Zod, Monster?

10:06 < bridge> <learath2> I couldn't work on it for a couple days. I was in germany
10:06 < bridge> <Ewan> no semicolons, recurring 5-character red identifier used as the only one makes me think `const`
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It looks like it wants to be written RTL instead of LTR
10:08 < bridge> <Ewan> No way
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would be very funny

11:40 < ws-client> <VaLl> oh
11:52 < ws-client> <AGJ> hey
11:52 < ws-client> <VaLl> hi
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll> my bot only writes the first message it sees
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll> ```python
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>         if (time.time() - self.last_send_time) > 0.1:
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>             self.send_msg(CtrlKeepAlive())
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>             for msg in packet.messages:
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>                 if msg.message_type == "game" and msg.message_name == "sv_chat" and msg.client_id != -1 and msg.message.find('!test') != -1 and msg.client_id != bot_info["id"] and msg.message != "Do you know someone who uses a bot? Please report them to the moderators.":
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>                     print(1234)
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>                     msg = MsgClSay(message = msg.message)
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>                     msg.header.flags.vital = True
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll>                     self.send_msg(msg)
11:54 < bridge> <va_ll> ```
11:55 < bridge> <va_ll> but he writes message 1234 to the console
11:55 < bridge> <teero777> a friend just walked by me and saw me playin tw and he compared it to coolmathgames......
12:02 < bridge> <va_ll> now he only writes if there is 1 letter
12:02 < bridge> <va_ll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207643194817519696/image.png?ex=65e0645e&is=65cdef5e&hm=c776ce0863493740d17feace1a48af1cd3a8b86f9865847355bf73d142c6c244&
12:03 < bridge> <va_ll> and the Russian doesn‚Äôt see
12:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @va_ll: is your code public somewhere?
12:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A person called vali using flood.py to connect bots to tw servers. Anyone else getting nostalgia from this? C:
12:22 < bridge> <va_ll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207648113968283708/message.txt?ex=65e068f3&is=65cdf3f3&hm=2119078631d6cbce45381d61b4ab9a19b01848764b1802c773dd327e6daf164f&
12:23 < bridge> <teero777> *vall
12:23 < bridge> <teero777> xd
12:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh
12:23 < bridge> <teero777> nostalgia hitting hard
12:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
12:24 < bridge> <4ipset> why does everyone call Vall by the name Vali? xd
12:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looked like an I
12:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I just don‚Äôt expect the name vall
12:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Differentiating between I and l is mostly context for me
12:26 < bridge> <va_ll> https://pastebin.com/nZmhy3uM
12:26 < bridge> <4ipset> a lot of people called Vall named Vali ingame
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> I was talking about a very limited language though. Something perhaps intentionally not turing complete even
12:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sure sure
12:27 < bridge> <va_ll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207649306564239440/image.png?ex=65e06a0f&is=65cdf50f&hm=df7ca3b8442a7278d5dc6494f54947cbb5b5fb49e0ba51b39188009a0e9951eb&
12:30 < bridge> <va_ll> he also sometimes writes messages to the logs 2 times
12:30 < bridge> <va_ll> but it's probably my ping
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> :wtf:
12:32 < bridge> <4ipset> :what:
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll looks like chance to me
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah wait no hmm
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah yes it is chance
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``if (time.time() - self.last_send_time) > 0.1:`` this seems to be the problem i assume
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> last_send_time gets set on every packet send including keepalives
12:36 < ws-client> <4ipset> what is it
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you put all the if statements with your reply logic into the keep alive branch
12:38 < ws-client> <4ipset> bot have ping 999 for no reason
12:39 < bridge> <va_ll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207652381320548363/image.png?ex=65e06cec&is=65cdf7ec&hm=703e535c6a6e6dd4010bd3c31de5d5b55d4169666dfa356af19012ec71127176&
12:39 < bridge> <va_ll> I removed if (time.time() - self.last_send_time) > 0.1
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you wanna keep the keepalive
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just put your logic outside of the if statement like all the other if statements
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and lmao there is a bug in the parser my bad 
12:42 < ws-client> <4ipset> the bot still cant write letters
12:42 < bridge> <4ipset> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207653138442747955/image.png?ex=65e06da1&is=65cdf8a1&hm=0a8e52b7f5808082c8b10f17362e003b99cd666bf19ffae9bc37392e73b5952c&
12:43 < bridge> <va_ll> he answers for a while and then stops
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh and you overwrite msg
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wasnt a bug in my parser you just confused me
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you send a chat message and store it in ``msg =``
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you do a if statement based on msg as if it was a server sent message
12:44 < bridge> <va_ll> Ouch
12:45 < bridge> <4ipset> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207653969753800765/image.png?ex=65e06e67&is=65cdf967&hm=8830e4aceaca5f7ddf7d1b5e225f4a326998be4da01898999693aa0228905420&
12:48 < bridge> <kekomonter> @va_ll You are creating bot in python? xdd
12:49 < bridge> <va_ll> Then I want to connect it to my discord bot
12:49 < bridge> <kekomonter> Lel
12:49 < bridge> <4ipset> they want to create bot with ai
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707997758.png
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah your code is chatgpt?
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that explains things xd
12:49 < bridge> <4ipset> no
12:49 < bridge> <kekomonter> Huh
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/A1
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao i got A1 paste like AI
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i made your code somehow functional
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah i swapped out the ip to localhost
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you might wanna change that back
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707997906.png
12:52 < bridge> <va_ll> oh thank you he started answering
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no code shaming and all but like watfk bro
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
12:53 < bridge> <teero777> Hmmm
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and a new bot dev is born poggies
12:53 < bridge> <teero777> If 3 is greater that three I will get Dev role in ddnet
12:54 < bridge> <teero777> If 3 is greater that 3 I will get Dev role in ddnet
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> int(dev)
12:54 < bridge> <4ipset> no i mean that it will be a bot with artificial intelligence that will answer questions in the chat
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> By sing openai API?
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> By using openai API?
12:55 < bridge> <4ipset> i think yes
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i should really build an chat bot example idk why i did not do it yet.
12:55 < bridge> <4ipset> we already try to build it
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> Yea add another repo to you 165
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah just a file in examples/ folder

12:56 < bridge> <va_ll> again he doesn't like something
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you touch the code? :D
12:57 < bridge> <va_ll> Not
12:57 < bridge> <va_ll> I just changed the IP and port
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah i can reproduce
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki  `error: internal compiler error: compiler/rustc_middle/src/ty/generic_args.rs:898:9: type parameter `U/#1` (U/#1/1) out of range when substituting`
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> found a compiler bug in rust stable
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like it does not auto calc size
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic compiler moment
13:02 < bridge> <va_ll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207658186048413766/image.png?ex=65e07254&is=65cdfd54&hm=3e8525318555669ea06e47261ce0e8fd8f502f152785ca1c337cbae4048ed720&
13:03 < bridge> <va_ll> only responds to my first message
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes the message length calc is off
13:05 < bridge> <avolicious> If you create a bot, either ask the server provider for their consent and mark it as bot
13:06 < bridge> <va_ll> this is the server @4ipset
13:07 < bridge> <va_ll> I'm the admin there
13:07 < bridge> <avolicious> Fair enough. I was talking about a general process like that
13:08 < bridge> <avolicious> If you are an admin you can approve yourself, but also mark it as bot, otherwise players might think that someone is on your server
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll yea im too lazy to fix that now but thats a bug on my end thanks for testing
13:08 < bridge> <teero777> avo is scarred by iF xD
13:08 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont care about iF tbh
13:08 < bridge> <avolicious> Its more the player experience
13:09 < bridge> <va_ll> this is a temporary nickname until the bot is not fully operational yet
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh i think its a pyson momemnt tbh
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where it remember last constructor arguments
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or something like that
13:14 < bridge> <avolicious> You can also announce `"is_player": false,` in the HTTP register. But to do this you need to rewrite some code#
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll okay so for now you can only ever send the same message length. Or set ``msg.header.size`` manually but its a bit trappy. I will not fix it today but its on my todo now.
13:18 < bridge> <va_ll> Fine
13:23 < bridge> <Ewan> hi
13:24 < bridge> <va_ll> hi
13:27 < bridge> <teero777> :poggers2:
13:29 < bridge> <4ipset> hey
13:29 < bridge> <zhn> –Ωi
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wazzup
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the moon
13:44 < bridge> <teero777> No it's down
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs up right now
13:44 < bridge> <teero777> Where's up?
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> above me
13:45 < bridge> <teero777> You are standing sideways
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> If you're a line and you take the normal at the height of your feet and then draw a plane is it on the upper side or the other oeb
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> If you're a line and you take the normal at the height of your feet and then draw a plane is it on the upper side or the other one
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> If you're a line and you take the normal at the height of your feet and then draw a 3d plane is it on the upper side or the other one
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> The moon is above me dude
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> If you're a line and you take the normal at the height of your feet and then draw a 2d plane is it on the upper side or the other one
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> Ah ok cool
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> What direction are you pointing in?
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> UP
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> Hmmm.
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> away from the gravitational pull we describe as DOWN
13:48 < bridge> <teero777> Woah cool so the moon is above me too?
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> Since it is not inside the planet?
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> It is in that direction
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> Below
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> Moon is down for u
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> What is moon for earth?
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> Below or up?
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> Depends on where you make the measurement
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> there is no objective up or down in space
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> you need an anchor of some kind
13:50 < bridge> <teero777> I believe the earth isn't perfectly circular so highest point is the head
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> Ok
13:50 < bridge> <teero777> /anchor
13:51 < bridge> <teero777> *anchor
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> Not really
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> That‚Äôs not how anyone defines a head
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> It is the furthest point on a generally spherical mass
13:52 < bridge> <Ewan> My toes are furthest out from my center of mass so they must be my head
13:52 < bridge> <teero777> Yea do the average of all points on the earth and then check which is furthest
13:52 < bridge> <teero777> That is the truth
13:53 < bridge> <teero777> Okay mount Everest with 8849m is the anchor
13:54 < bridge> <teero777> So where is the moon rn?
13:54 < bridge> <teero777> Above you?
13:54 < bridge> <teero777> If so we need to know where you are
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> It‚Äôs above me yes
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Not you
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> It‚Äôs below you
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> Also not sure what furthest point has to do with it
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> So if we assume you are the moon and are represented as a 2d vector pointing from the center of the earth
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> And I am the same but somewhere else where the moon is not above me
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm Not the moon
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm me
13:57 < bridge> <teero777> So if we assume you are the moon and are represented as a 2d vector of angles pointing from the center of the earth
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> Since the moon is above you I can say you are the moon +-90¬∞
13:58 < bridge> <Ewan> No
13:58 < bridge> <Ewan> The moon is above me because it‚Äôs night time
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> So in the current time you are almost the moon
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> *+-90¬∞
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> * +-90¬∞
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> I am not the moon
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm not almost the moon
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> But in my head you are and you can do nothing against it
14:00 < bridge> <teero777> You rock ü™®
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> C++23 still doesn't have compound literals...
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> I know it worked in msvc once
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> Idk if it still does
14:24 < bridge> <teero777> you could pass vec2(x+x,y+y) as a reference to a function directly. If that's what you mean with compound literals
15:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what a cool yavascript feature. took only few hours to find it :pepeW:

15:38 < bridge> <zhn> xd, had something similar on pyson
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it was just weird that it went thru loop one time and all 50k elements have the same value :justatest:
15:44 < bridge> <kekomonter> Had something similar on lua
15:44 < bridge> <kekomonter> And this was memory leak, cuz gc in lua 5.4 is shit, LuaJIT better
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> To quote ryo. Wouldn't have happened with rust
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U'd have need to call clone for each and the type would be Rc

19:00 < bridge> <gobrox> server auto kicks afk players without a timer when it hits player cap feature when
19:02 < bridge> <teero777> today i learned floats are 2 to 5 times slower than integers
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in what task?
19:04 < bridge> <teero777> multiplication
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so when is 2 times slower and when 5 times?
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at multiplication
19:05 < bridge> <teero777> *according to llm

19:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> last few months i dont trust any word chat gpt says
19:07 < bridge> <teero777> its very bad at coding ik
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
19:09 < bridge> <teero777> and to my tests the higher the floating point numbers are the slower it gets
19:10 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks when we finally convert all those vec2s into ivec2s in ddnet code we can do 512 players xd
19:11 < bridge> <teero777> DDNet 2.0
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ask your chatgpt if that also applies for fixed point numbers at division
19:13 < bridge> <teero777> spouting the same shit again

19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not even gpt4 is it?
19:14 < bridge> <teero777> nop i dont have xddd
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gpt3 is dumb af. better not to use it than use it xD
19:14 < bridge> <teero777> true
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gpt4 at least sometimes is correct xD
19:14 < bridge> <teero777> i don't trust a word from it when it comes to coding
19:15 < bridge> <teero777> and it doesnt even know what optimization is....
19:15 < bridge> <teero777> and it cant find memory leaks ;(
19:16 < bridge> <teero777> it doesn't even know what optimization is....
19:16 < bridge> <teero777> and it can't find memory leaks ;(
19:43 < bridge> <chairn> i think both are wrong on x64 and on any high end cpu
19:43 < bridge> <chairn> or most desktop cpu
19:43 < bridge> <chairn> floating point division or multiplication implies 23 bits or 51 bits operation while integer one is 32 or 64
19:46 < bridge> <chairn> hmm, 3 or 4 cycles for integer ones, 5 cycles for floating point ones
19:46 < bridge> <chairn> https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf
19:47 < bridge> <chairn> (for haswell architecture, already quite old with jupstar's standard)
19:48 < bridge> <chairn> however, floating point division is faster (22-96 integer vs 10-24 for floating point)
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess it also depends on how exactly the calculations are used
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in a tight simd sceneraio ofc every cycle matters
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if u mix calculations with other stuff (pointer acces etc.) the calculations are often offloaded to the floating point unit while other stuff happens simultaniously
20:18 < bridge> <matodor> does anyone have experience in analyzing discrete data?

20:18 < bridge> <matodor> I need to split the data into approximately the following intervals (segments with a beginning and an end time)
20:18 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207767961939480597/image.png?ex=65e0d891&is=65ce6391&hm=08bc0129bd39e376c21fe013a0cbe3c4b2d41460e989b93f6e200a5326ff0183&
20:33 < bridge> <chairn> fft, retrieve main frequency, sample at the correct interval
20:33 < bridge> <chairn> you can also look at the derivative to detect sign changes
20:34 < bridge> <chairn> which is where this kind of stuff might occur
20:34 < bridge> <chairn> (but it's not 100%)
20:34 < bridge> <reitw> Damn u woke chairn
20:34 < bridge> <chairn> what you trying to achieve exactly?
20:34 < bridge> <matodor> determination of useful work based on the current strength of the press
20:35 < bridge> <matodor> determination of useful work based on the current  generic of the press
20:35 < bridge> <matodor> determination of useful work based on the generic  current  of the press
20:35 < bridge> <chairn> shouldn't you try some computation and integration then ?
20:37 < bridge> <matodor> now a very stupid algorithm has been made, to consider everything above a certain value as useful work, this would be enough, but on different days this limit either rises or falls, such an algorithm is not suitable, a more universal one is needed
20:37 < bridge> <matodor> fft its Fast Fourier Transform ?
20:37 < bridge> <chairn> yes
20:38 < bridge> <chairn> but now, im not sure this is the way to go given your problem
20:43 < bridge> <matodor> thanks, I'll study it
21:33 < bridge> <learath2> "useful work" sounds hard to define, especially starting from just "current"
21:35 < bridge> <learath2> Current through a resistance creates power, how much of that power is useful to you? Can you even model this system as a resistance?
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> The intervals you marked roughly looks like just threshold comparisons, maybe with a bit of hysterisis
21:37 < bridge> <learath2> The intervals you marked roughly looks like just threshold comparisons, maybe with a bit of hysteresis
21:40 < bridge> <learath2> If you are having an issue with the thresholds changing, the slope of this graph looks very steep, maybe the derivative is more telling about when the machine is doing "useful work"
21:43 < bridge> <learath2> Another tip would be to discard the DC component, for which you can use the 0th component of the FFT, you'll just have to play around with a couple of these ideas until you find something that looks distinct enough
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @chairn https://uops.info/
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://uops.info/table.html
22:33 < bridge> <chairn> damn, pretty nice
