07:22 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Saw the video on my yt home page. Thought the thumbnail says it all. Is it funi ?
07:22 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
07:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I watched it a bit. It's basically. They deleted their db and fallback db. Had no backups, except some daily sync with test db. 6h of data lost
07:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Not really interesting
07:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Comments are either jokes or suggestions to prevent this happening again
07:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> !tldw jopsti
07:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Thank
07:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> This is your first warning lerato. Sharing non interesting videos is a bannable offense!

07:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
07:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Du we soon get Auto moderation chillerbot
07:56 <+bridge> <ReiTW> The video may not be interesting but the incident yes
08:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The only interesting thing is, that someone plays around as super user like that on live systems
08:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe they should use doas on live systems xd
08:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez fix
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> i do the same yikes
09:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But u are bash God
09:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> I use doas
09:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> I love it
09:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> permit persist wherl
09:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> permit persist wheel
09:27 <+ChillerDragon> yes i am bash god

09:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> what’s happening here
09:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> why backticks trump single quote
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> they dont
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> but ruby interprets the back ticks on bash :D
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> not*

10:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks @heinrich5991 @Learath2 did u know most memmoves implementations are not standard C?
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> because they dont allow a optimisation
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4023320/how-to-implement-memmove-in-standard-c-without-an-intermediate-copy
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >  it's not possible to implement memmove efficiently in standard C.
10:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> Oh
10:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Most memmove implementations are hand rolled vectorized code
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my point stands
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:DevilGlare:731622202293747712>
10:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> I'm drinking dis tea
10:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😃
10:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> Oh, I see the question has emphasis on the standard
10:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye thats my point xd
10:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think this is sort of fine fwiw. The standard could define more behaviour so that an efficient memmove can be implemented on x86_64. However, leaving it undefined lets compilers implement an efficient one on other arches too
10:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> Maybe such behaviour can be upped to implementation defined to force compiler vendors to provide similar means to the end user
10:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :sip:
10:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> Disrespect tea?
10:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> Naw
10:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> Armless palmer
10:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> Tho I don't taste the lemonade.
10:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've tried iced tea lemonades in a couple places, they've always been far too sweet to taste the lemonade
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like tea
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its weird water
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> coffee best
10:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> I knew I was getting bad vibes from you. Heretic
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tea is simply for the real chillers
10:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i cant be british
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> "tea is weird water" 
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd be surprised if ChillerDragon does not drink tea
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> i dont do tea
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller goes to desolate zones to play tw
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> im coffee guy too
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And off
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> im currently trying microdosing coffee
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKV18A1DluU
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I only drink water and herbal tea
10:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller next time clean ur laptop
11:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> I like coffee and tea
11:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> However I cannot drink normal coffee anymore it just doesn't do anything
11:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> Espresso or energy drink with every meal of the day
11:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> Usually instead of
11:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf xD
11:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds horrible to be addictive xD
11:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> It's expensive
11:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> It would be a major productivity hit to try and adjust it because a caffeine deficit on the level I'd need would create slamming headaches and just make me really tired
11:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> And it's hard for me to bounce back from that kind of stuff
11:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> I tried the sparkling water just so I could have something to sip on throughout the day but I went through a 6 pack in a day
11:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not possible to implement va_args stuff in C at all
11:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's why such stuff is in the standard library
11:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> to do stuff that's otherwise impossible
11:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> Have you seen variadic macro implementations? That would make most standard purists cry
11:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> addicted
11:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe he was talking about the espresso 🤔
11:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> Heard it only takes about a week or two to readjust your tolerance
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki haha i get that a lot my laptop is really disgusting xd
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> i dont think that you can survive cold turkey for a week at those rates you might just die from caffein withdrawl
11:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> Bad week to do it anyway
11:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> Got shit to take care of
11:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> Find a decent week or two and tone down the coffee. The more serious it gets the harder it'll become 😄
11:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
11:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> Done it before when broke
11:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> Perpetual slog
11:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1102892806328037457/Screenshot_20230502_034208_DDraceNetwork_Client.jpg
11:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
11:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ur phone does not support alpha textures apparently
11:59 <+bridge> <андрюша> what i s
11:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gles 1 is really dead
11:59 <+bridge> <андрюша> what is this
12:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The text texture only needs a single color channel
12:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Basically only transparency
12:00 <+bridge> <андрюша> okie
12:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But this is highly deprecated. In newer opengl version u simply use the r channel(red) and use a shader to access this
12:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can't really explain better. But i assume it's simply BCS gles1 is dead
12:01 <+bridge> <андрюша> :happy:
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don't understand why we need all these fancy features like prediction and the ability to read text. It's all just bloat
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1038306924384485457/1102898005096529960/VideoEditor_20230502_034934.mp4
12:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> Though lol the text did work before I switched out of the app the first timr
12:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> Though lol the text did work before I switched out of the app the first time
12:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh then maybe the implemention for that is buggy
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Android changed some stuff about keeping the opengl handles alive when surface is destroyed
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> This is the newest APK I was able to find. Was support dropped or am I just blind
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> 9.something
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Support for building is there.. but that's about it. All controls were removed
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> Good
12:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> The controls are flaming garbage
12:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> Absolutely awful
12:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U can play with a keyboard attached to ur phone xd
12:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> The peak mobile gaming experience
12:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks does android support vulkan
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
12:07 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Why not support neuronal controllers
12:07 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Playing with ur brain
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Got over 1k fps on brothers phone. Which is better some middle class Intel cpus
12:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> Why not support telekinesis
12:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> It would probably be pretty good on this phone
12:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So the igpu is worse than the phones one xd
12:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> Phones are heavily reliant on GPU
12:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> Nearly nothing is software rendered and nowadays they are streaming and decoding devices more than anything
12:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> Nearly nothing is software rendered on mobile and nowadays they are streaming and decoding devices more than anything
12:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Phones have other kind of architecture for GPUs tho. Reading the same buffer that u already written to in the same frame can be extremely slow. That's where all the surpasses stuff from Vulkan comes from. So it's ur fault if u do inefficient things xD
12:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> :ddnet:
12:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Phones have other kind of architecture for GPUs tho. Reading the same buffer that u already written to in the same frame can be extremely slow. That's where all the supasses stuff from Vulkan comes from. So it's ur fault if u do inefficient things xD
12:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Time to reimplement ddnet in compute shader only
12:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> So fast until you have to do OS calls and disk IO
12:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It gets an API for that xdd
12:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> I always wanted to see a general purpose shader lang
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> spirv
12:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> That took the form of a more mainstream programming language lol
12:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> Not like super GPU compatible
12:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> Like bytecode JIT on GPU sounds like interesting project
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> spirv is the webassembly of graphics
12:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally tho. I could certainly imagine that highly parallelizable tasks will shift more and more to GPU. Biggest downside rn is that cuda etc. Are still to complicated to just do 
12:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe the runtime would need to figure out on fly if the tasks can be parallelized. XD 
12:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's why we need compiler dev Ryozuki
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks honestly maybe MLIR fixes that
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> from llvm
12:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> Get SDK and learn the crazy stupid language extensions
12:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> Ughhhh
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://mlir.llvm.org/
12:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> Who ever heard of <> in C
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> look at https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/GPU/
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the nvidia and amdgpu dialects can translate to this generic gpu dialect
12:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The problem is. On desktop u cannot simply share memory accross cpu and GPU. On M1 this should be ez
12:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Moving around memory a lot will probably kill to much performance
12:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> MLIR can end up as spirv code
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or llvm ir
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats the great thing about it xd
12:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> You still gotta upload
12:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes. My point was more that it is too hard to combine cpu and GPU code in one language as if none of these two existed
12:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U just write rust code and it automatically decides what is best xd
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Translation to perform
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --deserialize-spirv                                 - deserializes the SPIR-V module
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --import-llvm                                       - translate llvmir to mlir
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --mlir-to-cpp                                       - translate from mlir to cpp
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --mlir-to-llvmir                                    - translate mlir to llvmir
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --serialize-spirv                                   - serialize SPIR-V dialect
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --test-spirv-roundtrip                              - test roundtrip in SPIR-V dialect
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>       --test-spirv-roundtrip-debug                        - test roundtrip debug in SPIR-V
12:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u create a thewadpool with 1000 threads for whatever it could™️ assume this is a highly parallelizable task
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
12:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But cool tho
12:45 <+bridge> <Learath2> Mh, the way you code for a gpu is so far from the way you code for a cpu that I think such a language would end up being worse for both
12:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe. Maybe some 400iq person will find a way xd
12:48 <+bridge> <Learath2> If someone does figure it out and it works well, it'll be someone with an anime pfp
12:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe the solution is much more stupid. Execute it on cpu and GPU and see which is faster xdd
12:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That would be the jupstar approach. Just throw every rock u find in nature against it lmao
12:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think the issue there is that there are many restrictions on what sort of code can be executed on the gpu and only a further subset of that is performant. We have a lot of trouble even vectorizing the simplest of stuff on cpu's which have very limited vector capabilities anyway
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yep. It would not easily work with every code
12:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think about smth like for example rayon which has parallel iterators. Rayon also tries to assume the number of threads it will use
12:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> I was about to say the exact same thing 😄
12:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
12:54 <+bridge> <Learath2> Some subset of code can be easier to try on the gpu, like if we were already parralelizing on the cpu, the hard part of vectorizing is done. Then the easier part of working with the gpu features available is already mostly solved
14:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ddnet has 400 ⭐ 🥳
14:58 <+bridge> <Teero> kek i destroyed it
16:03 <+bridge> <Tiran> Anyone know how to make custom game modes?
16:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> better question:
16:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anyone here is willing to waste their time on implementing my idea
16:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my answer is no
16:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
16:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, but i won't tell xddd
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u never coded before u gonna have a hard time. Else start to play around with the server code
16:51 <+bridge> <Tiran> Okie
17:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What yo guys talkin bout
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> a custom game modes xd

19:20 <+bridge> <louis> no
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100% xd
19:20 <+bridge> <louis> theres pros and cons
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe if u very rich

19:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> usa is the best and the worst. thats the problem xD
19:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u part of the besties, its nice
19:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u part of the worst. u are doomed
19:24 <+bridge> <louis> ye pretty true
19:24 <+bridge> <louis> but i think there is a place for most ppl
19:24 <+bridge> <louis> depending on what u want
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, probably 😄
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well also independent of society, europe has very good geographical properties
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> almost no earthquakes
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> almost no hurricans etc.
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> true
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i never felt hurrican or earthquake
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> barcelona is rly safe
19:26 <+bridge> <louis> true
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also i got sea and mountain in the city
19:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bangladesch is doomed in the next years
19:26 <+bridge> <louis> ive been near tornados that all ive experienced though
19:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have never felt hurricane or earthquake
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also europe is way more cultiraly rich
19:26 <+bridge> <louis> but we have cheaper restaurants so
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> usa is a fabricated country no more than 300y? old
19:26 <+bridge> <louis> we win
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or 200
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @louis ?
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tell prices
19:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well germany is like 70 years
19:27 <+bridge> <louis> its cheaper for sure ryozoozki
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u have to tip lmao
19:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> louis we have to tip bro
19:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
19:27 <+bridge> <louis> i lived in netherlands before
19:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> LOL
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with 14€ i get rly nice food here
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no tips
19:27 <+bridge> <louis> well yea but its not as much even with xd
19:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that's also an advantage, germany's constitution is pretty solid
19:27 <+bridge> <louis> omg u know best place for food prices is korea
19:27 <+bridge> <louis> hugely delicious lunch for $4
19:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> catalonia exists since 1300
19:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> netherlands have bad buns, else good country xd
19:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what does it have?
19:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> appart of the unregulated american food
19:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> america actually tried hard to sidestep what makes eu food more safe
19:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants to remove harmful bacteria was a practice banned by the European Union (EU) in 1997 over food safety concerns. The ban has stopped virtually all imports of US chicken meat which is generally treated by this process.
19:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> america better be open source
19:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> meat processing in the united states is a nightmare
19:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-27/chicken-chemicals-eu-trade
19:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> tru
19:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> food safety is one of the key good points of eu
19:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> we have been cleaning beef in ammonia for decades
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but japan is even better
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> at food safety
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good that i dont eat meat
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so many scandals in this industry
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its so safe u can eat raw eggs
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> r u vegan?
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kinda
19:30 <+bridge> <jao> at least murica is a country not like catalan
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :facepalm1:
19:30 <+bridge> <louis> i used to live on a military base so ig its cheaper than normal but its like preset lunch meal w rice and sides and soup/daily specials#
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> problem is, u cant really be vegan, bcs every fucking product has some hidden animal stuff.. its not even about food xD
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> buy shoes and they probs not vegan xDD
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i enjoy meat
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> life is too short
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the alternatives are better already
19:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> ?
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is a inside joke
19:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh lol
19:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> my geography senses were tingling
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they should
19:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ryozuki is not independent yet xdd
19:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i remember reading about catalonian independence in elementary school
19:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> and that's the last i heard of it
19:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rly?
19:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> where u from btw
19:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> united state
19:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i used to be very pro independence, but my interest in politics faded
19:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im too busy working
19:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> unfortunate
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so ur luxemburg flag is fake ? 🥲
19:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> unfortunately
19:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just love the flag
19:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's so vibrant
19:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> luxembourg wouldbe a cool place to be though
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but r u from a city or red neck state
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u have a shotgun
19:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> colorado has always been pretty mixed
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u scare off crocodils
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> while shouting
19:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> i live near denver which is a big city but that doesn't mean there aren't rednecks around
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> today a tourist when to me and asked "taxi?" and i was like "what?" im not a taxi bruv
19:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are the richest country per capita xDD
19:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> i am in what can best be described as suburban ghetto xd
19:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and have free public transport
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> today a tourist went  to me and asked "taxi?" and i was like "what?" im not a taxi bruv
19:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> wouldn't that be nice
19:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> around here you have to get the RTD pass and i think it's $100/year just for the lightrail
19:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> like, that doesn't count bus fare
19:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> and there arent too many buses around
19:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since yesterday, we have the Deutschland Ticket
19:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 49€
19:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats that
19:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can travel through whole germany for 49€
19:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> here if u are under 30 u can get a 3-month unlimited pass for 40€
19:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not ICE
19:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for barcelona
19:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> nice
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the 9€ ticket was insane
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it had like 20 millions sales
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in a country of 80 million ppl
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh wait
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 52 million sales xD
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 65% of all citizen had it
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i was one of the 35% xDD
19:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> DAMN
19:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html
19:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they use rust btw
19:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> neat
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki have u seen this game
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> made in rust, from screenshot looks pretty good actually, 13k commits is really impressive too
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and for gitlab 2k stars is really impressive too xDD
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as i expected
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u just too fast for me xD
20:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i played it too
20:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 5mins xd
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
20:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gh down again wtf
20:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i get  "Access to this site has been restricted." so often lately
20:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> im rebranding
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are?
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> voxel game
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
20:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> written in rust
20:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> >:(
20:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> (im joking by the way)
20:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its ok
20:06 <+bridge> <uwu> Rust's so bad i had to decline my friends' request to play that game :troll:
20:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i had hard times with it in the beginning too
20:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u just have to be open and try it out xd
20:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :troll:
20:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> minecraft is best, bcs java
20:08 <+bridge> <uwu> Java fucking sucks 😭
20:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> java is fast, bcs it uses JIT
20:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2009 arguments
20:08 <+bridge> <uwu> Why did they do minecraft bedrock that way, they could so same thing as java edition but in c++
20:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be epic 😄
20:08 <+bridge> <uwu> C# uses jit as well
20:08 <+bridge> <uwu> :troll:
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> java version is easily moddable
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> harder with c
20:09 <+bridge> <uwu> Why would someone use java if there is c#, developed by the best org, microsoft
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true, but WASM would be one way
20:10 <+bridge> <uwu> They add features that everyone want, just like they read and analyse your code:troll:
20:10 <+bridge> <uwu> They add features that everyone want, just like *they read and analyse your code*:troll:
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lately im playing modded mc
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> stoneblock 3
20:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :santatrollet:
20:12 <+bridge> <louis> ye its not much substance but beautiful game
20:18 <+bridge> <Patiga> its fun :)
20:18 <+bridge> <Patiga> an the graphics are actually very pleasant
20:19 <+bridge> <Patiga> I absolute love zooming out in this game, that is a feature I wanna see in more games
20:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> windows bad
20:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> 2k is impressive for github too man
20:27 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> from 2021 I haven't played since I think
20:27 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1103024866451542066/shot_20210107_151915.png

20:27 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Veloren was the main reason I wanted to learn rust.
20:33 <+bridge> <ReiTW> @Ryozuki time to apply https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2nBeMZ6wC8
20:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the game industry is not known for their good jobs
20:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont wanna be a slave
20:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also im sure they use c++
20:37 <+bridge> <ReiTW> lmao
20:37 <+bridge> <ReiTW> ask them to switch to rust
20:38 <+bridge> <ReiTW> cry engine : C++ lua & C#
20:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> loua
20:38 <+bridge> <Iza> i find it cool that a game studio has its own engine, but cry engine really isnt that great compared to others, they should just switch imo lol
20:39 <+bridge> <ReiTW> lol cry engine was one of the most advanced engine
20:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it really depends on your job
20:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> enphasis on "was"
20:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> game dev are slaves xd
20:40 <+bridge> <Iza> i have thousands of hours on one of their games, i dont have too good experiences with the engine
20:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> unreal 5 is better
20:40 <+bridge> <ReiTW> idk about now, + unreal engine is way more popular tho
20:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and i hate epic
20:40 <+bridge> <ReiTW> which games
20:40 <+bridge> <Iza> ue5 is on top
20:40 <+bridge> <Iza> hunt showdown
20:40 <+bridge> <ReiTW> one game that is surprisingly amazing is Hunt showdown lol
20:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> bevy will soon be on top
20:40 <+bridge> <ReiTW> lmao
20:40 <+bridge> <ReiTW> the sound quality on hunt damn
20:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> hopeful
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> biggest problem with OSS projects is, that they want to target big audience
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> UE5 says 4090 only and then its set xD
20:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> godot still isn't even taken seriously by most non-indie devs
20:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:41 <+bridge> <ReiTW> @Ryozuki I didn't check actually but how do you create your scenes on bevy, there's no UI for that
20:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its just that hard to break through the industry
20:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah for now its all code
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a editor is on the roadmap
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but no  other engine has the ecs bevy has
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and rust
20:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> how types fork for ecs in rust
20:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> how types work for ecs in rust
20:42 <+bridge> <ReiTW> tbh I'd love to learn UE5 but it's damn complex
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/
20:43 <+bridge> <Iza> the game in itself is absolutely great, but when you've become such an enthusiast about the game, you start to see really all the flaws
20:43 <+bridge> <ReiTW> when I see godot it's so simple to get your hands on
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> #[derive(Component)]
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> #[derive(Component)]
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> struct Velocity { x: f32, y: f32 }
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> // This system moves each entity with a Position and Velocity component
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fn movement(mut query: Query<(&mut Position, &Velocity)>) {
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     for (mut position, velocity) in &mut query {
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>         position.x += velocity.x;
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>         position.y += velocity.y;
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     }
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> }
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fn main() {
20:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     // Create a new empty World to hold our Entities and Components
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     let mut world = World::new();
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     // Spawn an entity with Position and Velocity components
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     world.spawn((
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>         Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 },
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>         Velocity { x: 1.0, y: 0.0 },
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     ));
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     // Create a new Schedule, which defines an execution strategy for Systems
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     let mut schedule = Schedule::default();
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     // Add our system to the schedule
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     schedule.add_system(movement);
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is a very basic example
20:44 <+bridge> <ReiTW> ecs & im UI, I've read an article about warp rs talking about why it is so hard to make UI apps
20:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> rust ui sucks
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fn system(query: Query<&Position, (With<Player>, Without<Alive>)>) {
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     for position in &query {
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     }
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> }
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
20:44 <+bridge> <ReiTW> https://www.warp.dev/blog/why-is-building-a-ui-in-rust-so-hard
20:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> you have some system libs and druid and i'm not aware of anything else
20:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's not webshit
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> UI is smth nobody gets right
20:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> Qt gets it right
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> even at the current UI frameworks for other langs
20:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nah
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lot of ppl shit on qt too
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its just widely accepted
20:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> Qt is the best
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so it gets a pass
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
20:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> Qt goated
20:45 <+bridge> <ReiTW> always heard that Qt is a ton of garbage
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the best is clearly Tk
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it comes with python
20:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> Noooooo
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :KEKL:
20:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> Qt build system is the worst thing about it
20:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> the framework is fabulous
20:45 <+bridge> <Voxel> im a Qt
20:45 <+bridge> <ReiTW> what do firefox uses ?
20:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> every UI is ton of garbage
20:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> custom
20:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> because its impossible to get right
20:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> debatable
20:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/iced-rs/iced
20:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.areweguiyet.com/
20:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> honestly
20:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the world maybe should just be GTK
20:48 <+bridge> <ReiTW> https://youtu.be/VJu8ervRQzE?t=387 just listen to that sound quality damn
20:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> GTK is good
20:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> headache in C
20:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> gtk has bindings in every possible  lang
20:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's why it's epic
20:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have heard good things about vala
20:49 <+bridge> <ReiTW> does it have for scratch
20:49 <+bridge> <Terörist ` Data> hello is there a method I can do proxy and vpn or cheat protection for a specific server, or is there a method that is ready
20:49 <+bridge> <ReiTW> if not it's not good
20:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> closest u get is wasm
20:54 <+bridge> <Chairn> the problem is that most language such as C or Rust use a sequential paradigm, hence parallelisation is tricky from these languages
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> the death of native UI makes me sad
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> one look for all platforms 👎
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> unless you are an established app with a very strong brand & design it doesn't work
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> it just ends up looking like Shiet
21:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> though this sort of GUI approach sucks anyway. for a product with a real budget that doesn't want to rely on web tech I think decoupling app logic from interface is key. just make the best native platform-specific frontend you can
