00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Alexander hi absoliwt
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> lol
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @jao its not absoliwt
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I'm joking ðŸ™„ l
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I'm joking ðŸ™„
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> no im rayten
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> jk
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 the idea is to feed the frames to ffmpeg
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> instead of rendering them to the screen
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why doey CCharacter has its own NetworkClipped() function, if CEntity has the same?
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we clip characters differently?
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh really
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i don't know it's a guess
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is one line different (for showall)
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/chat.cpp#L531 this should be str_utf8_find_nocase right?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> probably, but utf-8 is "compatible"
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should work like this aswell
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what else could cause this https://i-am.naru.to/Jup1iBW1Aw9M.png
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> getting hightlighted for the wrong name?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> several people on my server reported this same bug yesterday btw
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> that or maybe jao is absoliwt
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 2 ideas
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes wrong highlight
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1 is it is the utf8 comparison
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 is if it happens for every message it could be the color :/
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I'm currently overly paranoid about the color stuff
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no it doesn't happen consistnly
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no it doesn't happen consistently
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [chat]: Skeith: noby: It was highlighting me as one person and then that person left and then another person joined
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [chat]: Skeith: and then it was highlighting me as that person
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wtf
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it could also be a messed up client id
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> that's what I thought
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ill go see if i can find the demo
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The demo says it was ID 3, it didn't show I was being highlighted in the demos though.
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Dunno if that's useful information or not, gl
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Both people I was being highlighted for both had client ID 3, the first person left and the other person took his place
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and your id
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> gimme a sec
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> 2
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then it's probably that
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `m_pClient->m_LocalIDs[0]` seems to end up wrong i guess
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wouldn't that break more stuff
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no idea, i feel it should but apparently it doesn
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> t
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as that's the only thing I see that could go wrong
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fwiw ive had the same bug happen on my old version of ddnet too but its extremely rare and mostly seems to happen when i play without a name and i figured that was the cause
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive never seen it happen more than once in a game tho
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how does the id end up wrong anyways
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, i reached that conclusion from the fact that `LineShouldHighlight` is a small function that is called only a couple times
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I was playing with dummy
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> So idk if it highlighted it for my dummy or me
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I copied absoliwt's name, went to another server, connected dummy and tried to paste absoliwt's name and it did nothing
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why do we still have change_map command? Afaik its for adding a map, so it changes to that map after the current round. But we dont have rounds in ddrace so we should get rid of the command completely or (if it doesnt already) make it behave the same as sv_map, so its for not confusing people who dont know sv_map
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 oh i see thx
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The wrong ping is nothing new tho
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is inp_mouseold the same as inP-grab in 0.7 ?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> compare it
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 2lazy xd
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hi fokko
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hello
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hello
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fokko people use change_map in ddrace
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it the same code as for sv_map?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> compare it
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not at home :)
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where are you
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 300 km away
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not same
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> atleast in vanilla
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in ddrace it has a pretty similar effect
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> change_map shows scoreboard and sv_map doesnt and ddnet skips scoreboard
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ??
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how can it show scoreboard
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> change_map triggers a game end
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and ddnet skips that
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah true
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> """scoreboard"" xd
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what is a game end in ddrace
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is none
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they soip it
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> commented out
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> skip*
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fix fokko
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> chiller
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :f3:
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao i built a clock with lasers
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> analog
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fun
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 how can I get what's rendered but actually not render it?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Check hmh's branch
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You render it to a framebuffer instead of to the screen
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> just gonna point out that the play/pause button doesn't change when viewing a demo
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> If i load current map it can also take a map from downloaded maps. And if i edit it and save it saves it without warning o.O
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But with a wrong hash. Im sure this can cause some trouble.
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DrpFf/66771a69af.png
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> send help how is this possible? xd
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜®
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> that's strange xd
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fixed btw
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> was cuased by %d not being %lld for a int64
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can I set default zoom ?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon that is what happens when you don't compile with warnings enabled ðŸ˜›
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the funny thing is that printf even throws errors but dbg_msg or sqlite3_mprintf dont even throw warnings
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> str_format neither
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and it worked just fine on linux and macOS
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> windows ðŸ˜„
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> we love it
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya good ol' windows xd
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u never get bored when ur in rage 24/7
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it took me 4 days to debug windows stuff that has been working fine for years on my linux vps .-.
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ™ƒ
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably i boke linux now :troll:
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon u shitbucket
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good one ðŸ˜ƒ
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wena!
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Shyzo | Alex it would tell the OS to try to keep the mouse inside the window, even when you would move it outside
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon MSVC might not throw warnings on those as we use a gnuc attribute to get warnings on formats
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> after last update I face hard lags on tab opening time to time
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> mean scoreboard
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> pretty annoing thing
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well, not really easy to figure out what causes that
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you could try profiling opening the scoreboard
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on the previous version and on this, to see what changed
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> running 17 clients in stress mode on laptop and not a single cpu gets over 40% usage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU8U858lXa8
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜ƒ
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> blockbaster hacker
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> LAUNCHING THE YBERNUKE!!!11elf
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> CYBERR!!
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Learath2 I have 420-480 fps if tab opened it drops to 150-300
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> on open it goes down to 50 after that grows to 150 and further
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and that wasn't the case in the previous version?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well, I did never notice about such huge drop, but I will check it out
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can I check gameclient version ingame?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> programatically?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if so, wym ingame
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> f1
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> no, just as user
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in the console
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it shows your client version
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rop right
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> top*
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh crap UX
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> for 12.3.1 - 480 closed, 360 opened. And it never goes lower then 280
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> on open action
