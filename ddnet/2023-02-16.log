11:08 < bridge> <deen> Sigh, that happened to a lot of bugs I opened at work. I stopped complaining at some point ðŸ˜„
11:50 < Emmi> Hi, anyone here that could help me?
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if you tell your question someone can maybe help you
11:51 < Emmi> Im on Linux and did some Ddnet updates. It seems like there was a problem with the Assets because when i start the game i cant see any hud. Maybe someone knows how to fix it
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what linux distro do you use?
11:52 < Emmi> Can i somehow PM u?
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess no
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> im on discord
11:52 < Emmi> I think its Linux OpenSuse
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> does it show invalid textures, basically like 4 colors in a block?
11:53 < Emmi> Yea, like i cant even see the text, just colors and weird Figures
11:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Why go to dm when in public ur likely to get more help
11:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Ill never understand it
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i assume the maintainer did something wrong when linking the ddnet-data package
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if its no problem for you, you can either self compile or use pre-builds from the website
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.org/downloads/
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they are more up to date anyway
11:55 < Emmi> I allready tried downloading the Sources and put them in the folder where i need them... but i cant find the folders where i have to put them. 
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd recommend doing it over git
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> git clone https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cd ddnet
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mkdir build
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cd build
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cmake ..
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> make -j20 
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sudo make install
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
11:57 < Emmi> Imma try that, but could u tell me where the Ddnet files are? like where can i find them
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> data directory is the file that is read for assets
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> usually its in the same dir, where the binary is
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> with my above example you can simply start the game from the build directory
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u dont need to do make install
12:09 < Emmi> cant figure it out :/ Ill try some more stuff
12:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xddd
12:58 < bridge> <WarHammer> Helo, I reseted my pc and downloaded ddnet, when i move, screen looks like this, i had this before too and i did fix it however i forgot.
12:58 < bridge> <WarHammer> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1075747984320503869/Picsart_23-02-16_14-52-06-232.jpg
12:58 < bridge> <WarHammer> Pls help me
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> whats ur operating system
13:00 < bridge> <WarHammer> Linux Mint now, it was MXLinux
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> generaly what u see there is tearing
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for gaming u can use vsync (in ddnet in settings -> graphics)
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it will create more input delay tho, so use it with care
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for your desktop it depends on your window manager
13:02 < bridge> <WarHammer> i tried, but it makes delay
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thats expected tho
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can try to use more FPS
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which usually makes tearing less annoying
13:02 < bridge> <WarHammer> i did gfx_refresh_rate 60
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> set it to smth higher then
13:15 < bridge> <WarHammer> When i do it, it disappears but looks like low fps idk if u feel me
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well ofc disable vsync
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and try gfx_refresh_rate 0
13:17 < bridge> <WarHammer> Thanks Jupstar ill try it :3
13:45 < bridge> <Alexander> dont do  gfx_refresh_rate 60, instead enable the vsync option in graphics tab
13:46 < bridge> <Alexander> i think its not the same
17:17 < bridge> <teqq> I wasn't blocking people, I was just watching those who blocked them, misunderstanding please unban me

22:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Teeworlds allows the player to slide down walls.

22:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> ok :kekW:
22:03 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> maybe in ninslash, but in teeworlds? any explanation on it?
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> csharp?
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gpt died for me
22:08 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> gpt
22:08 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> it's fine for me
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> gdscript
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> make better AIs. I am too stupid for what i want to do, so i need willless slaves that work for me and are very clever
23:07 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :kek:
23:07 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> write me what to ask to AI and I'll send the result
23:08 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and i'm fucking dumbass on things which I want the AI to answer
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "make an AI that is better than you in everything"
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and then repeat that step for ever
23:14 < bridge> <Robyt3> "AI engineers hate this one simple trick"
23:21 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> but fr where this wallslide thing came from ChatGPT?
23:22 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> was there a part in the movement system's code, where you can slide on walls? maybe with tunes?
