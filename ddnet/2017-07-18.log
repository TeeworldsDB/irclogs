02:32 < ddnet-discord> <jao> looks like [align] doesn't work either
02:35 < Learath2> deen || heinrich5991: do you happen to know why mods don't get server.cpp:L1104 ?
02:35 < ddnet-discord> <RayB.> highlite doesn't work too
02:35 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: "player has entered the game"?
02:36 < Learath2> y
02:36 < Learath2> mods don't get that line in their rcon but i don't really get why not
02:36 <@heinrich5991> because mods only get the response to their commands I think?
02:36 < ddnet-discord> <jao> already reported rayb
02:36 < Learath2> such a mess we made....
02:37 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: m_RconAuthLevel
02:38 <@heinrich5991> is the variable you're looking for
02:38 < Learath2> it's only set correctly inside commands no?
02:40 < Learath2> whoever made the mod stuff should have added an access level and a client id target instead of this mess of a variable
02:40 <@heinrich5991> it might be intended that only admins can see the server log
02:40 < Learath2> ofc but why shouldn't mods know who joined the server?
02:41 < Learath2> it'd be nice not to have to use status to check which client id sp someone joined with this time
02:41 < Learath2> especially if the server is crowded, digging through that status
02:42 <@heinrich5991> that line actually originates from vanilla
02:42 < ddnet-discord> <jao> Learath2: I don't think thats needed
02:42 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/1ae474689d564e1feba9924842f05e06600d83a1
02:43 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: ^
02:43 < Learath2> @jao you don't someone might, i would
02:43 < Learath2> why am i not surprised...
02:43 <@heinrich5991> hm?
02:43 < Learath2> never quite liked oy's work tbh
02:43 <@heinrich5991> I don't think it's a bad idea to restrict the server log to admins
02:44 <@heinrich5991> whitelists do work better than blacklists after all
02:44 < Learath2> i don't either, i just object to the way he did it
02:44 <@heinrich5991> usually, his code quality is quite good â€“ in this case, we have global variables :/
02:45 < Learath2> by default everyone gets access to the outputs of their own commands, everything else is determined by the print command.
02:45 <@heinrich5991> no, even that is determined by the print command
02:45 < Learath2> that's how i'd do it, not how i think it is
02:46 <@heinrich5991> ah
02:46 < Learath2> could even have the default access level at admin so mods don't see the server log
02:47 < Learath2> could go even further and make negatives levels, positives client id's and have one optional argument, wouldn't even break the original signature
02:49 < Learath2> heinrich5991: why was m_RconClientID used anyways? was matricks low on arguments?
02:50 <@heinrich5991> well, you'd need to pass it through some kind of userdata
02:50 <@heinrich5991> might have decided that the global variable approach is just saner for the programmer
02:50 <@heinrich5991> and if that's the case, then the new global variable from oy seems a lot less problematic
02:51 < Learath2> we already pass CServer in the Userdata
02:52 <@heinrich5991> yes. it'd need an extra userdata passed per executed command
02:53 < Learath2> struct CCommandContext { IServer *m_pSelf, int m_Level, int m_OutputTarget } \o/
02:53 <@heinrich5991> doesn't work, the userdata is created on Console()->AddCommand
02:54 <@heinrich5991> and it doesn't work to only pass it on ExecuteCommand, because different console commands take different userdata
02:57 < Learath2> the console can add it before calling the command
02:57 < Learath2> s/command/callback/
02:58 < Learath2> would even be logical for ExecuteCommand to take a Level and an OutputTarget
03:01 < Learath2> where there is will there is a way 
03:01 < Learath2> :P
03:13 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: doesn't really make sense because the console is also used in the client
03:15 < Learath2> we also have ACCESS_LEVELs in console
03:15 <@heinrich5991> but not OutputTarget (if I understand what you mean)
03:16 < Learath2> no i mean they don't belong either :)
03:17 <@heinrich5991> one could extend the console class for the server
03:17 <@heinrich5991> anyway, good night :)
03:18 < worstwishthegod> jao bad mod
07:54 < ddnet-discord> <deen> @jao thanks, fixed attachments
07:55 < ddnet-discord> <deen> or maybe not, not sure
08:17 <@deen> inside of [align] stuff doesn't work
14:47 < ddnet-discord> <deen> @Ryozuki  or @Learath2 want to investiage the [align] problem?
14:47 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> is the bbcode a phpbb extension?
14:47 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if so it might be outdated?
14:47 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> cuz forum updates
14:48 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> mmm
16:09 < o_be_one> hello guys, 4942 is me on Discord ^^
17:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: ehm, the downloader is a binary file?
17:57 <@deen> heinrich5991: I like source code
17:58 <@deen> heinrich5991: and that reminds me, your rust map properties thing is broken and you never published the source code, so I guess I'll rewrite it in C++ and put it in DDNet repo of course
18:35 <@Nimda_9885> DesoxyribonukleinsÃ¤ure by Im 'corneum just released on Moderate at 2017-07-18 18:29
20:45 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Have you idea, how to detect mobile via apache2 or nginx? or maybe solution via PHP?  I have to server proper version of website for mobile and non-mobile users
21:12 < ddnet-discord> <Shishigami> humble bundle has a pretty sweet book bundle on cybersecurity, if anyone is interested in that
21:56 < ddnet-discord> <Rico> Buy me one pls. @Shishigami
22:34 < ddnet-discord> <deen> @Savander That's something you should do in CSS if possible
22:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't want
22:35 < ddnet-discord> <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/index.php#L47-L67
22:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i have to make major changes
22:35 < ddnet-discord> <deen> then you have to analyze the user agent
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <deen> or resolution or whatever you want
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> because im not talking about responsive design, but rather a bit different funcionality
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <deen> not sure what "mobile" even means? phone? tablet? laptop?
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> depends on where you are
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> phone-tablet
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> vs laptop/pc
22:36 < ddnet-discord> <deen> http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
22:37 < ddnet-discord> <deen> or something like that, google should help
22:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
22:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh looks like it should works
22:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> a massive array of potential devices
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> cool, i found PHP package for composer, which uses that website ðŸ˜ƒ
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ohm, nevermind. I gonna use apache version
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with htaccess
