00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> how?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> trying to do inheritance stuff is overkill imo
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> just make a copy of dm.cpp and dm.h n that folder
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and rename them
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ok
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Cha u dont even need to rename it u can just modify it if that server will never host dm anway
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ok
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> im snatching code from the other modes
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ðŸ‘Œ
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> WEAPON_PISTOL
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> for gun right?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> or is it default
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> nvm its default
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> +
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> wheres source code for dm mode?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its dm.cpp?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ```

00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> CGameControllerDM::CGameControllerDM(CGameContext *pGameServer)
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> : IGameController(pGameServer)
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> {
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha>     m_pGameType = "DM";
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> }
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ```
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> its literally just this tho
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> thats overloaded then
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> from gamecontroller.cpp
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ok
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> er
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yea i think
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> yee i found it
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> idk how to add one to the ammo count so i'm just giving them a new weapon with 1 ammo on kill for now
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well if it works it works
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ill figure it out l8r
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> how do i change the default gamemode when starting serv?
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> @onby do u know
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its a config thing
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ok
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> in autoexec_server.cfg or autoexec.cfg (depending on versoin)
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u just sv_gamemode
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or sv_gametype
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> oh so i have to host a 0.6 server great
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ehh
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> as opposed to?
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> i think i cloned the recent vers of teeworlds on github
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> ye i got it
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> huh i cloned 0.6.8 or whatever and compiled but still comes as 0.7 >:(
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> oh wait this is 0.7 wtf
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> wow 0.7 looks nice
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> no antiping tho...
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :kek:
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/666458106808500265/unknown.png
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> where can i find m_Weapons.m_Gun.m_pBase
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> or whatever
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> does anyone know
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what are u trying to do
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> change base dmg of pistol
06:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> datasrc/content.py
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> thx
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wat? Touching python code to change gun damage sounds odd
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Is it possible to tie envelopes to race time like it was previously ?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ama should check maps which have this, maybe you can find this setting there. Didnt kindergarten have this?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Since you always start jn thus ugly bus
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I donâ€™t think he bus is mapped using sync
18:12 <@deen> @n000b how dare you call my bus ugly? :D
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> XD
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well that is how i remember it
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon what about flappybird?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> @n000b none of these have any envelopes on them XD
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Its just a change they did in the last 2 years that envelopes are not tied to race time anymore
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i dont know if they have a setting for that but i guess not
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> which is annoying as my map does only work if its tied to race time
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> If i would make my map would you make it playable on an older server because my map works in ddnet 10.0.3
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That wont work
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Is it possible to add something to make it work
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> some setting ?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont know how envelope syncing works
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I guess is possible but no idea how, look at necropotames infclass class chooser, thats all Serverside
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i want to know if someone will do it because I cant do it on my own
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if not I will make color codes
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> or Force people to Play with entities current on
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Forcing wont be accepted by ddnet team I guess
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> they did exceptions for other maps so why not for my one
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> like dummycopyfly
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> As far as I remember this was just a side effect of how the timer worked back then. Actually this broke animation on other maps so it was more of a bug
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> too bad
