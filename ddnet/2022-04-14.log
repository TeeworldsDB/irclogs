00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> hey, what uses so much memory? downloadedskins / downloadedmaps / demos / maps / ghosts maybe? i deleted all my assets but my gfx mem stays really high and i crash when trying to enter assets tab
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> this is the output of cmake -DDEV=ON .. 
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think...
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You should run 
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> make 
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> in the build directory after that
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @bencie did you try disabling auto skin download?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> no, but the folders that i listed have alot of contents so i thought some of them may use gfx memory
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I know you use skins.tw db for auto download and their ungodly 4k skins are as big as 256 regular skins, maybe that's the reason
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i'll try
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> thanks
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> how work color?
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> why 0.0 to 1.0?
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> hey quick question if i want to start working on the ddnet  code which ide shuld i use?
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> it seems most ddnet developers use notepad
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> so maybe that
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> otherwise visual studio code is ok
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anything with c++ support
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most of us use some form of advanced text editor instead of a full fledged ide. VSCode and Vim are probably the most popular two
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Is this a troll or where did you get that statistic from haha?
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Lukas Kawalec)
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more skins more ram/vram as far as i know they arent lazy loaded
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Did you try running a headless client to save vram? hehe
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> vscode and vs are not the same kind of tool
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> vscode is by default a simple text editor while vs is an ide
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also some people would recommend vscodium so you don't have all the shit from microsoft
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> same afterall
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> because vscodium is the same, they've forked it to remove microsoft's trackers
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Last I used vscodium was also using a much less equipped extension store with sometimes out of date extensions, so that's the only difference I found
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye that used to happen
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt happen now
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im using vscodium now
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and neovim
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn I remember using code:blocks when starting C++
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn I remember using code:blocks when starting to learn C++
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first time I was learning C++ Dev-C++ was a thing
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently it's still a thing and it's open source and still developed ðŸ˜„
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Written in Delphi
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nowadays I use Intellij products
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or sublime text 4, easy to use & very light
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used to use sublime 3 a lot, then the author mostly abandoned it, so I went to vscode
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually have a sublime license even iirc
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well sublime text
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> u go on github, in 2 minutes you find tons of licenses
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pirateman
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no u
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a full priced license as I'm a good citizen
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 80$ for a license upgrade from 3 to 4 is criminal, only a 20$ discount if you have an old license lol
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> rn I'm working on a program that helps to automate a business process, it's called Bonitasoft
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> pretty cool, as I hate web dev, the bad news it's using java
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 yea just activate the official ms store and u good in vscodium. On arch thats one aur package hehe. What is even your main system nowerdays? Mac? Also lol paying for sublime
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gentoo, but I honestly don't code much nowadays
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spend my days trying to get myself to study and staring at walls contemplating what went wrong in life
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i started the journey to a sane website https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-web-modern
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (dont expect much, it has nothing rn)
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no more versioning css files every time, just checksum the file kekw

11:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 dark..
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupjapjapstur sos idk gfx where to call ``DeleteBufferObject`` its implemented but never called o.O
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> i mean it seems to be called in vulkan but not for opengl
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> why is the gfx code so hard to read? ._.
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649930765.png
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> lmao my card name is a bunch of garbage :D and wetefek is llvm card? :D

12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Funny
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> just because in 2007 there was no other editor other than nano on Linux xd
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Oh, dev c++, my eyes
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> wot there was no vi in 2007?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> I'm jocking
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Idk
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> I'm joking because I hope it's not true that most people use notepad as c ++ is an object language very close to C which is basically machine language
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> ?xd
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> C is high level language not machine language
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vi exists since 1976
12:55 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats what i thought
12:55 <+ChillerDragon> I dont understand why nano has any relevance
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's the newbie friendly editor of linux
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because every stupid tutorial says use nano
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> its not like vi is harder than nano
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> it has one additional step of pressing "i" to go in insert mode then its exactly the same
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> Yea but i see how that can add additional complexity for users who are not interested in other vi features even if its just one letter
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> none use vi anymore :hollande:
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> yea vi vim whatever
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> vi nowadays on recent distros gets aliased to vim
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> how did i lose my stack agian? :c gdb shows an empty stack watefak
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> maybe the sun hits your computer well
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> buggy address -.-
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :pepobike:
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> yikers buffer overflow
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> wait wot io_read does not nullterm
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> trol tw code
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> so notepad++?
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> yes
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh we've come so far since notepad++
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> textedit > all
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you're bad, ee is the best text editor
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> dafaq das
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> pene
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> easy editor
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ee
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> send link
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ee(1)
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> freebsd is life
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> yummy emacs keys
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> looks better than nano when looking at just the man page
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nano is too easy
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> guys how does the color system work on set color? why is the range 0 to 1? sorry if its a bit of a noob question
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> which color system
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> Many rgbas in the code use a float from 0-1 to represent the color range 
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); this one
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> so rgb(0, 0, 0) is black and rgb(0, 0.5, 0) is light green
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's white
13:19 <+ChillerDragon> thats white at no transparency
13:19 <+ChillerDragon> what do you want as color?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig u can imagine it as 255 * x, x being ur value
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0-255 in what you'd normally be used to is mapped to 0-1
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig u can imagine it as 255 * x, x being ur value in float
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> ok ok thanks guys ima test it out
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (So 0.5 would be about 128)
13:20 <+ChillerDragon> quiqq maffs
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Francesco v.m.k just get ur values from 0 to 255 & divide each by 256 & u get ur float
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Francesco v.m.k just get ur values from 0 to 255 & divide each by 256 & u get ur floats
13:20 <+ChillerDragon> i am really losing motivation to fix this mf of ub here
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tell ub, I tell fix
13:20 <+ChillerDragon> nice
13:21 <+ChillerDragon> Something is off with this mf
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> thanks i just tried it out and it works thanks a lot
13:21 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/blob/843acf6a5a80ef445ff134c90bee374212673464/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L1502

13:22 <+ChillerDragon> i tired some debug printing but that looks odd. Maybe dbg_msg can not do newlines
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649935348.png
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> and asan goes nuts with this diff xd
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> hey im making a skin editor i wanted to know if anyone has already made it

13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> spammer, doesn't work
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> wait can i even send multiple code lines from irc?
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> fak
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> try to add manually the \n? lol
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> yes because isn't working lol
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> yes because it not working lol
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> fdrgsfdgfdg
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> ah no its the grep that swallows the lines after omg im like 2iq
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> not sure if its an issue with the json-parer lib but even if i update that lib to latest master its still having ub
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
13:27 <+ChillerDragon> dats asan with my dbg print patch https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/d3
13:28 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm
13:28 <+ChillerDragon> scratch that xd
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> maybe the json lib sucks at utf8 and the ddnet info contains funny map names
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> na
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Francesco v.m.k> i don't think that's the problem you should at least get something like Mâ– dâ– sâ– a or stuff like that if the char is not supported
13:42 <+ChillerDragon> no its not the problem
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does someone know why vscode thinks this xD
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964130683649949706/unknown.png
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah because __cplusplus needs to be >= 201703L
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD ez fix 
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v>     "C_Cpp.default.cppStandard": "c++17"
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> nvm its not a ddnet issue its the lib indeed
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> was server beouser filtering by ping was deleted?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> take it back
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> was server browser filtering by ping was deleted?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> removed in #4391
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4391
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in the mean time you can rename it to apStrings ;D
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so weird to have ur ide in a non english language
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its way better to have everything in engllish
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better error reporting, better error googling
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ide/editor/compiler
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> didnt even know there is a german version xd
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should install
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> I'm trying to implement, that you can add sounpacks ass assets in .teeworlds/assets/soundpacks. But I can't find where the sounds are loaded in the sourcecode. Can anyone give me a hint?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Look at sound files i guess
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also check out the python code
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In datasrc
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Make sure u have compiled
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So u can see the generated source files from python
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They are under the src dir in your build dir

21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it is in sound.cpp CSound::LoadWV I also looked it up a few days ago. I wanted to implement a assets tab for soundpacks ðŸ˜„ but if you want to try it, I will wait for your initial implementation ðŸ˜„
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the sounds get loaded in sounds.spp CSoundLoading::Run

23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> can you guys get a new ger2 server
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> its literally so bad
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> its the worst server ive ever played in on ddnet
