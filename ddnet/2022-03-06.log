05:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> hi developers! I have an idea. Make DDNet client sixup, not Server, than it should support all mode in 0.7 and 0.6
05:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> Is this impossible？
08:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What are you missing in 0.7? Why not drop 0.6 completely.
08:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@TeeFlowerFell-Sans)
08:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> i didn't see my Friends.
08:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> 0.7 have less player
08:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> Unless ddnet is upgraded to 0.7
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> 0.7 is Great, but not many players
10:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki another usecase for tool tip, not to exaplain smth, but to show the full string e.g. in this case

10:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even DDRace is a just short cut for DDRaceNetwork
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i sent you a friend request
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> On which servers are you missing players in 0.7? I thought all relevant servers are bridged nowerdays so the playerbase on fng, kog, ddnet is the exact same as in 0.6? Or what do you mean.

14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> My friends, or My ALL Friend are only play in 0.6
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> If the best Client supports Sixup, Than many people will KNOW 0.7
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> someone keeps entering random bots on the multieasy map guys @Moderator
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> ??
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But on what serves do they play. There is a high chance you can play with your 0.6 friends while being in 0.7

16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> can you guys make cl_nameplates_strong 2 so it colors name of player to green if you have strong on him and red if weak?
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> cl_nameplates_strong 1 distracts too much
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> feature request: define team colors
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/950049199808995358/teeworlds_ukraine.png
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> also would be nice to make colours(green and red) customisable
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> The thing about FNG is that it uses the default Vanilla/CTF red/blue team function
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> so if there were a way to customize color, there would have to be a rehaul of the code
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/949060973199761458
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> isn't it possible to have your own thing on the client? like your own css for a website and overwrite it
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> anyway, i'm trying to do it, it's fun to me and a nice challenge
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> nah, it can be client feature
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> oldschool clients had that thing
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i see
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> how would you even change the color?
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> do you cast a vote with a hex value as the reason?
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> i had in mind in HUD settings
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> player sets it
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> default is red/blue and you can change like the tee color
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> would be cool to have it as a server feature, would be funny
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> if it was a server feature i would imagine there would be 2 ways to get a server color to change
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> 
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> 1) input a word (red, blue, black, white, orange,) and it auto assigns it based off of a list
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> 2) input a hex value for specific colors not in a list
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> or even have patterns like footbal trikots
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> bonus idea that goes against the current coding but would still be fun: have a color change vote where both teams get themed colors
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> 
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> hot vs cold: left is a random hue from red to yellow, right is random from cyan to purple
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> 
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> color wars: rainbow colors vs grayscale colors
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe!
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> or even have patterns like footbal trikots ^^
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> i like the hue idea. even have red as a range and blue would make it more diverse i think
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> or the one with top kills have dark red and the low guys light ^^
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> OR everyone starts out as least temp sided (yellow vs cyan), and whoever gets the more kills will shift more to red or purplr
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> OR everyone starts out as least temp sided (yellow vs cyan), and whoever gets the more kills will shift more to red or purple
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> hotter/colder every kill
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> and instead of `Team Red wins!` or `wheat wins!` it'll be `Team Hot wins!`
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> i'll try for now to change colors in client ^^
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> good luck!
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> gonna use ukraine coloring on the tourney :pepebooming:
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> didn't even compile it successfully ^^
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> furo: got a new fix up: https://ddnet.tw/maps/NUT-95-short-95-race6
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Perfect, nice work!
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> when you get it working, can you stream it so I can see, too?
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> sure
