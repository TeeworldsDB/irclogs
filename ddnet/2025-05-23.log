01:06 < bridge> <louis> the furo website had more interesting stuff tho
07:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
07:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think he doesnt have this https://ddstats.org/events
08:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i updated this after 2 years https://github.com/edg-l/teeobserver
08:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually with this u can make a stalker tool rly ez xd
14:19 < bridge> <kebscs> if my prs get merged, the only thing left unpredicted will be freeze lasers
14:19 < bridge> <kebscs> and multiple tp outs
14:23 < bridge> <always> what about hook
14:23 < bridge> <always> tp
14:24 < bridge> <always> yep im stalking you now
14:24 < bridge> <kebscs> the visual?
14:25 < bridge> <kebscs> hookline already goes through if 1 tele out
14:25 < bridge> <always> not hookline
14:25 < bridge> <always> your hook
14:25 < bridge> <kebscs> like?
14:26 < bridge> <always> is it predicted?
14:26 < bridge> <always> hook tp
14:26 < bridge> <always> tiles
14:26 < bridge> <always> pretty sure they arent
14:36 < bridge> <kebscs> i think they are
14:36 < bridge> <kebscs> why not?
14:37 < bridge> <kebscs> they are if 1 out
14:37 < bridge> <kebscs> buggy if multiple
14:37 < bridge> <kebscs> i can try look into it but its different since its in gamecore
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/announcing-a-new-ide-for-postgresql-in-vs-code-from-microsoft/4414648
18:01 < bridge> <Ewan> Let‚Äôs go
18:01 < bridge> <Ewan> Their old postgres plugin is insanely outdated
18:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and completely abandoned
18:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use ide called psql
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> god
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> same tbh
18:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i use dbeaver
18:07 < bridge> <Ewan> psql never worked for me on the command line bcs of a versioning issue
18:07 < bridge> <Ewan> nixpkgs only had some old psql but postgres.app is latest
18:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have also pgAdmin installed in case I need to do something with prod dbs :justatest:
18:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> pgadmin best
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta try it
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> dbeaver has done me really well tho
18:47 < bridge> <nikhard> How does cannon projectile works? I see it has `m_InitDir m_Direction m_Pos NewPos` to work with.
18:47 < bridge> <nikhard> I want to make cannon ball jump up right (`vec2(.5, -.5)`) after each hit to the ground. How can i make this?
18:47 < bridge> <nikhard> Already found place where projectile tryes to mark to delete after hitting ground, want to set code here.
19:15 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you just want to play a different game then
19:17 < bridge> <zelnix> for some reason it's still kicking for the same reason.
19:33 < bridge> <matodor> server iF'City, map TeeTown
19:33 < bridge> <matodor> on 17.4.2 version have x2 fps more then on 19 üíÄ
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> Ppl like clicking the merge button
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> Can you blame them
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can you say the exact version?
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If it's not too much work
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (exact version where fps dropped)
19:42 < bridge> <matodor> but what interesting - with default zoom fps ~230, with maximum zoomout fps drops to ~200

19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 200fps?
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what are you running on. your cpu?
19:42 < bridge> <matodor> 4070ti
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No way xD
19:43 < bridge> <matodor> with entities

19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> Gotta be a driver issue
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh ok, so the map is making an edge case?
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you find out the exact ddnet version that dropped fps, we can look what was added in that version
19:44 < bridge> <matodor> perhaps I just threw in some information if someone wants to do some optimization)
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôve definitely had fewer FPS when zoomed out before but there have also been versions where it doesn‚Äôt do that
19:44 < bridge> <kebscs> 100+ open prs
19:45 < bridge> <Assa> we changed a lot in 19.2, maplayers, animations and skins, all affect fps
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But shouldnt they improve fps xd
19:45 < bridge> <matodor> xd, i found
19:45 < bridge> <matodor> 17.4.2
19:46 < bridge> <matodor> 18.0.3 have drops
19:46 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 what's the state of #10102 ?
19:46 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10102
19:46 < bridge> <Assa> idk about skins, the rest on average yes
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 18.0.3 is the first version with less fps?
19:48 < bridge> <matodor> from downloads page - yes
19:52 < bridge> <matodor> without quads 19.2
19:52 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1375531922322882690/image.png?ex=6832076e&is=6830b5ee&hm=90f2ef03589bd70c432efa7af9ff3484827619f6006fd25bb0c6c129b58f1fa0&
19:53 < bridge> <matodor> 17.4.2 without quads have same fps
20:00 < bridge> <teero777> yea city is hard i get 80fps with everything xd
20:00 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1375533821188903033/image.png?ex=68320933&is=6830b7b3&hm=1e2742f0416f0806ae8a5a04f274ed2a180b9ced23cc7ffd5631b9799e24f6cd&

20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> steam fps counter disagrees xd
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah it's 300 too
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe i tabbed in xD
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in ddnet 15 without zoom i get like 5x the fps
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet-rs also 5x the fps
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno wtf we doin in current versions
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but too lazy to attach profiler rn
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Could also not be the renderer but some snap object that doesnt exist in older versions or similar
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> https://tenor.com/view/pull-request-code-pr-github-fulp-gif-21584424
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> same i havent reviewed or looked at the repo in weeks
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the big merge era
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> robyt keeping it alive
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta compete with voldemort and its adjacents
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> idk really

20:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> @Discord Mod
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @zwelf2 made in rust https://ibis.wiki/
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> anti-enshittification
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i like it
22:45 < bridge> <totar> Possibly more predicted entities idk
22:53 < bridge> <Ewan> im wondering could a job like that benefit from being done on the GPU
22:53 < bridge> <Ewan> if the facilities were in place
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> would be insane if it works fundamentally because i have seen github repos which let u write rust to natively target the gpu
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like it could be ok since it‚Äôs all floating point math afaik and there are potentially many things to predict at a time
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> not really current if the drop is since 18.0
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> i get 120fps 17.4 90 18.1 100 19.2
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> i get 120fps 17.4, 90 18.1, 100 19.2
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> GPUs are only good, if it's the same entities and they have no conditions or variable sized loops
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't think ddnet physics are a good fit tbh
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just look at smth like move_box.. it's just luck xD
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> what if you could do fixed cost predictions
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What is that xd
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> no variable sized loops
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess parameters are still a hurdle
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs no simd
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> serta
