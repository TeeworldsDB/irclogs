00:07 < bridge> <learath2> nvm, I'm just not even close to instrumenting enough, yeah msan is just too hard to use
00:07 < bridge> <learath2> I hope someone picks up the AVX512 patchset for valgrind so I can use valgrind again in the future
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning fellas
07:28 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
08:41 < bridge> <_cus> Can I open 1000 servers? Will they block me for this?
08:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you also have 1000 players
08:43 < bridge> <lomination> Absolutely 
08:43 < bridge> <lomination> "They" ?
09:14 < bridge> <totar> the tee government
09:15 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^.^ who do I ping if the website is broken? Like my map got a wrong property and the maprprevious is in the mud
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> murpi i guess
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> from murpi:
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> > I have no clue how these are determined. It's done by some script, probably.
10:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the script might be open source
10:26 < bridge> <Assa> it stays in the old script, that it uses django now and a script called ddnet-properties
10:26 < bridge> <Assa> I only find [properties.py](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/properties.py)
10:26 < bridge> <Assa> I only find [properties.py](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/properties.py>)
10:27 < bridge> <Assa> First thing I see, it doesn't support the new speedtiles
10:28 < bridge> <Assa> and it instead finds the new speedtile as checkpoint tile

10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, chillerdragon. can you add random number generator?
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very important
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> missing feature in discord
10:52 < bridge> <melon> i debugged it for chiller before, it makes no sense as to why its `xx`, but i also couldnt figure out how to run a local instance
10:55 < bridge> <melon> also @jupeyy_keks, can you take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/actions/runs/16265488999/job/46362079463 if possible?
10:55 < bridge> <melon> 
10:55 < bridge> <melon> i at first thought its because of

10:56 < bridge> <melon> <a:nicmoji_angry:417333827506274304>
10:56 < bridge> <melon> let me wake up the tests again and check
10:56 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also the paniced line does not even match the locally cloned build script...
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Super weird
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is your branch rebased?
10:57 < bridge> <melon> no i'll squash it really quick
10:57 < bridge> <melon> or do you mean rebased on master?
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That too
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But squashing is good too
10:58 < bridge> <melon> i'll squash, but both PR's are based off ddnet/ddnet-rs#125

10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll rebase my draft pr and see if CI also fails there

11:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wait the ddnet discord bot uses $ not !? bro i moved my bot from ! to $ because of ddnet??? so i move back?
11:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ here u go https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-ircbot/issues/5
11:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** a task force is on your request and will deviver a random number generator in x business days
11:30 < bridge> <Assa> first number is already generated
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon, what problem did you have with valgrind?
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not without map format change
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I need the feature til tomorrow, here are 5 ddcoins to keep you motivated
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (chiller)
11:37 < bridge> <melon> `[2025-07-30T09:35:51Z ERROR editor::editor] numeric field did not have utf-8 text: ��)®C۳ when getting cksum for twmag�x`

11:37 < bridge> <melon> i also love getting ��)®C۳'s for twmag�x
11:38 < bridge> <melon> (not a master issue i'm playing around with things rn)
11:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/E9 tldr i didnt even try to fix
11:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ wtf are ddcoins? send kog points thats the only thing that matters
11:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** finish a main 2* i dont have yet in my name and i work all night on the random number generator
11:40 < bridge> <learath2> Oh that one is simple, your libc just doesnt have debug symbols, most distros provide it as a package
11:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye i cba ur dump was good enuff
11:41 < bridge> <kebscs> Why do it file by file:nouis:
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ATOMIC PRS
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ATOMIC REVIEWS
11:41 < bridge> <melon> chiller hates our maintainers
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** BLAZINGLY FAST MERGES
11:41 < bridge> <melon> and he wants to ddos our CI
11:41 < bridge> <kebscs> Per warning would be better
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the smaller a pr is the better it is
11:42 < bridge> <kebscs> :nouis:
11:42 < bridge> <melon> rather get maintainer and merge rights so you can finally review roby's editor PR's
11:42 < bridge> <melon> i want all of em
11:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im on it
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> I got so lucky with that. The AVX512 patchset didn't merge cleanly, nor was it complete. I just hacked it in hoping if I could get it to compile it would work 😄
11:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lerato u are such a hacker
11:44 < bridge> <learath2> I think I've given everyone enough time to object. I'll try to remember adding you when I get back home
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> I really wish we would, additionally to fix-changes-physics, add a fix-changes-mapformat label
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> so if we ever want to update mapformat, we can fix them all
11:46 < bridge> <melon> `.map is deprecated, please use .twmap`
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> We can definitely have a map format update. You just have to have very good compatibility and reasons
11:46 < bridge> <Assa> I am just talking about a label, not in nuking backwards comp :justatest:
11:47 < bridge> <learath2> Something ziplike or tarlike might be very cute
11:47 < bridge> <Assa> Thats the thing, I have like a million small issues I could link
11:47 < bridge> <melon> `ctf1.twmap.tar` go brrrr
11:47 < bridge> <melon> ok i'll stopü
11:47 < bridge> <melon> ok i'll stop
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1400052309299429436/ctf1.twmap.tar?ex=688b3bd2&is=6889ea52&hm=cd330924575917c7e6ca8f83971ca0a4f21df839e5fee06b9c4c561abe4ed15c&
11:48 < bridge> <learath2> Are your issues with the map format itself, or issues with how it's very hard to extend?
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> both, like I have an issue for every combination of these
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs-data/pull/12#issuecomment-2963133507>
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Here an overview from me when I implemented it
11:50 < bridge> <Assa> Well I guess it's less about the mapformat itself, but for an editions field allowing to fix things without breaking backwards compat
11:50 < bridge> <learath2> Well you can try to write a meta-issue proposing a map format update. I would support it if I like the new format. But you do need to make a really good case and at least have some semblance of an idea how you'd handle backwards compat
11:51 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this is what I was wondering. Maybe we just need to get our heads together and design an extension method just like we did for netmsgs and netobjs
11:51 < bridge> <Assa> > https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10221
11:52 < bridge> <Assa> heinrich, admittedly, made a good case against putting the full version in it directly.
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> Ah cool I missed that issue. I'll take a good look at what was proposed, give you any other idea I come up with
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We should just stop looking at the past :deen_star:
11:53 < bridge> <melon> accept greatness, remove backwards compat!
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Learath is right about one thing. We have too few maintainers.
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We either break compat completely or it will never happen
11:53 < bridge> <learath2> One of the older ideas I had was to tag each layer with a layertype uuid. When we add new stuff, the uuid gets bumped
11:54 < bridge> <learath2> The anticompatbrigade has arrived <a:alarm:774780596731904032>
11:54 < bridge> <Assa> I have now more issues that can go in this list 🙈 brb collecting
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Editions will not happen bcs they have too much maintaincance overhead
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that simple
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Editions will not happen bcs they have too much maintainance overhead
11:54 < bridge> <melon> Chiller offered himself to unpaid labor if it comes to that
11:54 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> You know what I liked? Heinrichs proposal to move all backcimpat to a completely separate module
11:55 < chillerbot> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> that's why I opeted for adding client version into the map format
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Great, I have that for network in ddnet-rs
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> When contribute?
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> Map editions are not too too bad
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I even have a map converter that converts old ddnet maps into new
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But sadly Learath is right
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> About that one thing
11:56 < bridge> <Assa> This would be great for other reasons as well, for debugging for example
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not writing a compatibility layer based on a bed of sand being developed around the idea of never commiting to support anything longer than 1 commit. No offense
11:57 < bridge> <Assa> What are your obligations as maintainers?
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good, bcs it already exists, no need for you to develop it
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maintaining != developing
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you like the idea of editions, and my network protocol would be a new edition, it would be stable until a better new edition arrives
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So your sentence is pure rage bait
12:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's just fact, you have said many times that you don't like any backwards compatibility at all. If I have to have the burden of maintaining ddnet-rs compatibility in my layer, what exactly changed?
12:03 < bridge> <learath2> It's even worse actually, now I have to maintain two sides of the interface. Though I guess at least yours is rolling so I don't have to support more than one "edition"
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. It's not true, I said many times a good amount of backward compat is around 1 year
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. I dislike that backward compat is the holy grail of declining anything, and all maintainers are so happy about it, as if ddnet has to care about t-client or cactus or old ddnet
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Edition will so or so entail this
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You cannot say you like editions, but then dislike maintaining two different interfaces
12:04 < bridge> <Assa> >  and all maintainers are so happy about it
12:04 < bridge> <Assa> I doubt that one
12:04 < bridge> <learath2> I like things being stable
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That go back in time and beat magnus for not doing encryption in the network protocol
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then go back in time and beat magnus for not doing encryption in the network protocol
12:05 < bridge> <learath2> It's literally trivial to add on encryption to the protocol in a backwards compatible manner
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yet you'll have the extra maintance cost
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And that is the point
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Next year we have yet another edition and we have 3 things to maintain
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then 4, 5, 10, 100
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What do you think gatekeeps accounts?
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's the fact that we have to first try it
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> Will you? This stuff is abstracted away very well. It's not like 0.7 compat where you need to reach deep into the gamecontext
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> Heinrich being away and QUIC being the protocol we decided on
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> heinrich dodges discord since like half a year now. I assume it's also related to accounts
12:07 < bridge> <Assa> I always believed the mostly decentralized nature of ddnet
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He litterally said it's 1 week away
12:08 < bridge> <learath2> It would take me like a week maybe two to just get dtls in there
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nobody in this world can convince me that 1 week would be such a huge blocker
12:08 < bridge> <learath2> He doesn't want to work on it, idk why. Ask him
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll not say it here in public
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^ but this is defs a huge factor
12:09 < bridge> <Assa> looks like this task should be moved to another maintainer then?
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> His draft is just too deep for anyone but maybe a handful of us to pick back up. Either he'll have to pick it back up or someone else will have to re do it
12:09 < bridge> <melon> his PR is public
12:09 < bridge> <melon> anyone could pick it up, but i looked through it
12:09 < bridge> <melon> no chance :D
12:10 < bridge> <Assa> :justatest:  I can do a lot of stuff, but I honestly thinkg I should not do this. I am not familiar with the Quic protocol at all and every mistake I do would fall back at me, like it already does for rendering
12:10 < bridge> <Assa> I'd probably just implement the next CVE
12:11 < bridge> <melon> another issue is that its rust
12:11 < bridge> <learath2> It is a very involved change, and the way accounts were designed it integrates directly with QUIC so it's not even that easy to replace it now. You'd have to basically redesign accounts
12:11 < bridge> <melon> not many people are familiar enough with the language
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sometimes I actually do think we should just ugly ass do /register /login similar to kog, maybe with bit of client support and give a shit about encryption.
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We can always upgrade to other systems from that.
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But at least it would not take another 5 years
12:12 < bridge> <pilonpl> I wonder how many vulnerability there are already in the game
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> I actually recently proposed this in the mod channel. In hopes that it'd scare heinrich into showing back up and finishing QUIC
12:13 < chillerbot> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/

12:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this is epic
12:15 < bridge> <Assa> you meen like my feelgood botanic garden at work?
12:15 < bridge> <DDNet> :heartw:
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> Would you like me to rebase one of my old account systems and PR that? It basically established an encrypted channel over the non encrypted one just for stuff that needs to be encrypted. Normal basic ass centralized accounts on top
12:15 < bridge> <Assa> you mean like my feelgood botanic garden at work?
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller lmao, is it rich generally?

12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah
12:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rich plus a question
12:16 < bridge> <Assa> hello guys, rich good bot
12:16 < bridge> <DDNet> :3
12:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the idea was the following
12:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am too rich what can i do?
12:16 < chillerbot> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you asked me, I prefer any account system over waiting years
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So yes
12:16 < bridge> <learath2> This is basically just spamming at this point 😄
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't give a shit about how exactly anymore xDD
12:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 its fixed dw https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-ircbot/commit/de4b3b5f07df339d3df871c556d9757109968faf
12:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> Oficial ddnet server are in a way centralized anyways so what's the big deal?
12:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i will redeploy when i am home
12:17 < bridge> <learath2> Hope was that all servers can use our accounts
12:17 < bridge> <robyt3> To independently progress accounts, it would also be good to open an issue describing/discussion the UI/UX changes we need, so we can already work on the frontend as well
12:18 < bridge> <Assa> they are hosted by many communities for different regions, and the webserver is just a poster?
12:19 < bridge> <Assa> they are hosted by many communities for different regions, and the webserver is just a poster ? (maybe I did the webserver a bit dirty here)
12:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> Points are centralized
12:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> Finishes are too
12:20 < bridge> <Assa> hmm, does ddnet have a centralized database or do we host a cluster which syncs?
12:21 < bridge> <Assa> according to funding, this is a centralized db
12:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> sounds expensive
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> 609€ per yer
12:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** centralized as far as i know
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> We have a db triangle, the main one serves almost everything though
12:23 < bridge> <Assa> 609€ per year
12:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh its 3 dbs? o.O didnt know
12:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how does that work @learath2 
12:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> why is storing data so expensive
12:23 < bridge> <Assa> sounds like a galera cluster to me, with read write split, but yeah
12:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** are the other two like read only or something like that?
12:23 < bridge> <learath2> We used to have a large replication circle with each server running its own db copy. But the queries just got too expensive to run on the small leaf servers we have
12:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** helps that deen does it professionally i guess :D 
12:24 < bridge> <learath2> No, one is for chn to have something closer. And the third is for backup and convenience
12:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> is the main database in germany?
12:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so only chn does read and write and if i do /top5 in germany i dont see the chn ranks?
12:25 < bridge> <Assa> probably in Frankfurth
12:25 < bridge> <learath2> I don't remember where we host it nowadays. We had to keep moving it because people found and ddosd it
12:25 < bridge> <Assa> probably in Frankfurth (so yes)
12:25 < bridge> <Assa> depends on the hoster ig
12:25 < bridge> <Assa> or does deen own a physical server?
12:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its a raspi in deens flat
12:27 < bridge> <learath2> It is a rather large server. I will not comment on where it is
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> he probably bought some ddos protection, at if it's physical, it's behind a protection proxy anways
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> he probably bought some ddos protection, at if it's physical, it's behind a protection proxy anyways
12:27 < bridge> <learath2> Who knows
12:28 < bridge> <Assa> he probably bought some ddos protection, as if it's physical, it's behind a protection proxy anyways
12:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> sad i was just about to ddos it with 5 requests per hour
12:28 < bridge> <pilonpl> So only the official game servers know the ip of that server?
12:28 < bridge> <Assa> yes
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> It's a completely internal server. So long as no one leaks the ip or we make a mistake configuring it, no one should know anything about it
12:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** http://i.imgur.com/rbzjLcI.jpg
12:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=5132&hilit=meme&start=10 so good btw
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> This literally for all the cheap locations we host
12:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's not in the spirit of open source ™ and it's definitely not decentralised (!!!)
12:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> Ddnet web 3.0 update when?
12:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there was someone working on that
12:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** a while a ago
12:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** teeworlds nfts crypto something
12:30 < bridge> <learath2> Lol yes, I remember him showing up here and people being mean to him
12:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> I mean it's not a terrible idea
12:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> You could have DDCoin
12:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> 1 fin = 1 coin
12:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> And then you can buy pets
12:30 < bridge> <Assa> 1 coin = 0€
12:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> You just don't need crypto for that lol
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> and open a ddshop to buys skins and loot boxes /s
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> Would you guys hate me if I added a small miner into the ddnet client? We need funding
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> \/s
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> Unless
12:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> Not using 100% of your system is a waste
12:32 < bridge> <Assa> one bitcoin would already finance ddnet :3
12:33 < bridge> <Assa> excluding paychecks
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> It'd easily pay for all staff wages
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> We could even quintuple our wages and it'd be enough
12:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> dont forget the bonus
12:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> additional 0€
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> True, we could increase our bonuses by an entire order of magnitude
12:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> each contributor could also get paid
12:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think all maintainers should get a fixed salary based on donation money
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> if you calculate the true manager per hour or developer per hour wage, a bitcoin would not be enough
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon ok
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Donate me
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Donate me
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> send PP
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> send PP (Paypal :justatest: )
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> where donate
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg where bot
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> No, then people will start demanding things, as is their right. But we wouldn't ever collect enough to have a full time engineer on staff
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It was more a joke because you said I will become maintainer today xd
12:37 < bridge> <learath2> Oh you mean maintainer like that. Yeah then we can all get 1€ per head maybe on some months
12:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The demanding stuff is a good idea. What if players can put money on issues
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> that's not even a coffee 🙁
12:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like donating 10 euro if fast input gets added
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet bounties
12:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
12:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess they already can just not officially
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> I don't like it, because then there is the issue of us not liking the code.
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> find cve and get 0€
12:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> if at the end of my ddnet carrer I get one coffee paid, I'd be happy
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> The player offered money, the developer made the feature. But it'd be us blocking the transaction. It feels unhealthy
12:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg am I 2nd class maintainer or what
12:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fair concern
12:39 < bridge> <Assa> at least we can guarantee you, that you are not getting sued like in other countries 😠
12:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> DDNet the country?
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe a bounty pool? People donate to the bounty pool, we decide what issues get a bounty? Again the players might not like what we spend it on, but at least it's clear from the getgo
12:39 < chillerbot> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
12:39 < bridge> <Assa> did you miss my rant yesterday
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> account bounty pool :kek:
12:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how many slop ai prs will there be with this?
12:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe
12:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
12:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> if its not an official bounty then getting sued is expected
12:41 < bridge> <learath2> Well idk if we ever discussed it but technically there are purple name maintainers and green name maintainers
12:41 < bridge> <Assa> not really in an open source project, like nobody is willing to pay a lawyer and everybody will be thankful that you notified and not exploited your cve then
12:42 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, idk if a PR motivated by pocket change will bring in the right sort of developer
12:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah thats right if we talk about open source
12:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Never heard of purple. Tell me more
12:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/ there're people who just ask ai to "find a bug" and submit whatever it spits out xd
12:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh Boy
12:45 < bridge> <pilonpl> It works like 1% of the time though
12:46 < bridge> <Assa> there is a great video about doing this "professionally", like a study about this where a person generated 100 responses for code witch was known to contain a bug. 1 was correct and found it, and it found a second unknown one. So 2% success rate.
12:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> but it acts as spam and requires time to review
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> Not like we had to treat anyone differently. But technically admin + merge privs is different since we get to deploy stuff
12:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok how to get admin
12:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Purple = Maintain + Play game
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Green = Maintain + Don't play game
12:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller: step one, install discord
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> We make you renounce 0.7 first
12:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Right ..
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> I play the game with a secret name
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nameless tee
12:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Konsti
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Just look for random vegetables
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vegeta
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Kakarott
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> then i should be green
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2

12:50 < bridge> <learath2> There you go
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just randomly remembered HMH
12:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> then i should be green
12:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2
12:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> didn't work :feelsbadman:
12:50 < bridge> <learath2> Not you
12:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lerato name confirmed 🍆🍑🍈🍈
12:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> Wtf is the Red role lol
12:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Known cheater
12:51 < bridge> <learath2> Gives you a red name, obviously
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> boostee is only for discord boosters, right?
12:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: social engineering skills 0/10
12:52 < bridge> <learath2> I think so
12:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> WHO has the most Roel’s?
12:52 < bridge> <Assa> I am only missing two, maintainer and boostee
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> ~~I am only missing two, maintainer and boostee~~ no there are more
12:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You have tournament winner and moderator?
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/developers-gif-13292051
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> there is also maptester
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> idk, where does a user see all roles?
12:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Click on my name
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo is red
12:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
12:54 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's dumb that you can't have all colors at once
12:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> It would be easier to talk what roles someone has
12:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> Wff
12:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> It would be easier to tell what roles someone has
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> I guess actually Learth xD
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> louis has 6
12:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> When we finally add account can i get the first ever account?
12:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> the username would be unreadable
12:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> I want to premove account creation
12:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's how much i want accounts to exist
12:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> there is no we, only heinrich
12:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's totally possible
12:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> Some admin has to manually add me
12:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> And i would be the first for sure
13:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1400070761334440046/image.png?ex=688b4d01&is=6889fb81&hm=f5452c94049c7c6a0838e290dd98b7e4eb3ff813dacde971bcac42c3e6f30b17&
13:05 < bridge> <pilonpl> Accounts are so simple
13:05 < bridge> <pilonpl> You just store the username and the password hash
13:06 < bridge> <pilonpl> Why is it taking so long
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Where is your simple PR?
13:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> exactly
13:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ here is pr https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/pull/264
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> PR upstream
13:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lmao imagine the troll
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That looks more useful than 0.7
13:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
13:10 < bridge> <pilonpl> Btw what is 0.7?
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Looks red to me
13:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> moderator wage + 0.7
13:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1400074157970030653/image.png?ex=688b502b&is=6889feab&hm=8c3fd2399d15787d8ff3226508c5e71fb83be472205947cb6799d200f1c14039&
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> #33CB63
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is mostly green
13:18 < bridge> <Assa> can we support mfa with fifo2 so I can use my yubikey?
13:18 < bridge> <01000111g> teeworlds 0.7, which implemented a different skin system etc and we had to uodate ddnet client to be able to join those 0.7 tw vanilla servers.....
13:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 0.7 is the break protocol update from teeworlds 0.6
13:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet was stuck in 0.6 for quite some time not being able to join teeworlds servers anymore
13:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** some hardworking furry eventually ported the ddnet client to 0.7
13:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** breaking*
13:35 < bridge> <melon> @jupeyy_keks even with the .lock patch it fails, so i can only assume its a CI issue, but i dont see anything wrong with it :-:
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa use your yubikey to for rcon? that is being sent plaintext ? xd
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** just buy chillerbot-ux it has password manager. I could not live without it anymore
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> yes, but I SHA it before with 4000 bits
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i love it
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go pr
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I currently assume it's a mingw issue or a specific compiler flag that is missing
13:37 < bridge> <melon> cant we just have the runner use gnu
13:37 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ which api u want for random numbers?
13:37 < bridge> <melon> int.rand() pls tgy
13:37 < bridge> <melon> int.rand() pls ty
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u need from and to?
13:37 < bridge> <melon> how else are you gonna roll a nat20
13:38 < bridge> <melon> !roll 0 20
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** W w3 schools to the rescue then
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_random.asp
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cryptographically secure
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> otherwise idc.
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or u mean which CLI?
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no i mean how u want it to work
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like wat u need
13:39 < bridge> <melon> !roll 10 = randint(0, 10)
13:39 < bridge> <melon> !roll 5 10 = randint(5, 10)
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** roll? not rand?
13:39 < bridge> <melon> i'm used to roll from wow
13:39 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gamer
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** roll or rand @Jupstar ✪ 
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** which args?
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> roll <min_number> <max_number>
13:39 < bridge> <melon> both
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be nice
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well or just max_number
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (rand() % x) + 1
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** from 1 to max
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** because 1 based good
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> $roll 3
13:46 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xx$roll3
13:46 < bridge> <Assa> why do we send rcon in plaintext?
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what else should we do?
13:47 < bridge> <Assa> sha the password on both sides?
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and what problem does that solve?
13:47 < bridge> <learath2> Lol
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that you hide your insecure password?
13:47 < bridge> <Assa> that the rcon can be mitm 'ed
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the hash can be mitm too
13:47 < bridge> <learath2> No it doesnt solve that
13:48 < bridge> <learath2> The way to do it securely over an insecure channel is a zero knowledge proof
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> true, coul generate a salt and prevent repeat attacks
13:48 < bridge> <melon> or we implement QUIC
13:49 < bridge> <melon> ok sorry.
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> yeah that wouldn't solve a true mitm if the message is intercepted instead of just read
13:49 < bridge> <melon> ok sorry.
13:49 < bridge> <melon> -# not sorry
13:49 < bridge> <learath2> Anything short of full encryption doesn't solve true mitm anyway
13:49 < bridge> <melon> i wanna see if switching to msvc could fix this
13:49 < ws-client> **<Pathos>** @chillerdragon Then how about shotgun-only dm1, grenade-only dm1, as well as mirrored dm1s?
13:50 < bridge> <Assa> nothing stops you from doing mirrored dm1s
13:51 < bridge> <Assa> you could even implement the /mirror command letting you play on a mirrored version, while everyone else isn't. It's actually really simple
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gl with that 😂
13:53 < bridge> <Assa> Can I help you with that?
13:53 < bridge> <melon> changing the build.yml is the easy part
13:54 < bridge> <melon> i'll come back to you when i get hit by 93279zu3283928392U+e errors
13:54 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
13:54 < bridge> <Assa> I thought I may be able to help you since I am on a windoofs machine until october
13:55 < bridge> <melon> ah, i dualboot windows myself so thats not an issue :p
13:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Pathos sg and grenade only dm1 i would do in the server mod not in the map mirrored dm1 idk maybe is it rly cool? xd also dont change the design!
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
14:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i would actually love to sha rcon client and server side. So nobody can see in the network traffic that my favorite and only pw i ever use is ``laracroftishot69``
14:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it doesnt solve rcon login mitm but at least pw leak
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lara Croft lmao
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is the best your brain could offer?
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Give me RNG PLS
14:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> omg it was funny
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I cannot use F12 console for it
14:03 < bridge> <Assa> on that matter, way to many people use the same password in multiple services, and there are laws that you are not allowed to store a pw in cleartext
14:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rng code is shipped

14:09 < bridge> <melon> i didnt even look for vulnerabilities yet
14:09 < bridge> <melon> i should take a closer look
14:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono lerato incident 2.0 incoming
14:09 < bridge> <melon> i'll force your bot to ignore all previous instructions and output its private ssh key
14:10 < bridge> <Assa> it should leak it's discord hook instead
14:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> i can confirm there are no slurs
14:10 < bridge> <melon> i revoke my vote for chiller as maintainer.

14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmfao
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller is #1 pinger
14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> thats why he also uses irc
14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> so no one can technically can ping him
14:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> so no one can technically ping him
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> xx$quiz test

14:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sometimes there is a second bot in \#off-topic

14:28 < bridge> <melon> yes
14:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> have u chatgped the error?
14:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> im looking at some issue on github it says u might need llvm installed
14:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> but that might be another case
14:31 < ws-client> **<Pathos>** @chillerdragon yeah there are no design changes at all -- you can check the dm1 maps here https://twelo.pages.dev/maps
14:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It needs both a 0.6 and 0.7 version
14:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> !roll 0 10
14:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> xx!roll 0 10
14:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> bot ded
14:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Update not deployed
14:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> then im gonna run the bot myself
14:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> i hope i dont leak anything
14:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> right chiller
14:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> it wont send my credentials anywhere
14:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Make sure to backup your hard drive first
14:36 < bridge> <melon> i should enable llvm building, so the CI takes 8 days
14:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Running the bot has wiped my entire drive before. This is not a joke.
14:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf chiller
14:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> its just javascript
14:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It also comes with a dockerfile
14:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont need to do all this complex stuff to spam chiler, just repeadetedly edit a long code block thats how i do it
14:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh right there are no prebuilt versions of llvm on windows
14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Famous last words
14:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think i tried building it once
14:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> it took 40 minutes
14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh no @sollybunny
14:38 < bridge> <melon> only? respect
14:38 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
14:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> >:D
14:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> What
14:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> How
14:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk
14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The lerato incident
14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Back when the !sh command was enabled
14:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> did lerato touch bash command
14:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> with rm -rf
14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
14:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> !sh !?
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !sh rm -rf ~
14:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> i wonder why u thought giving bash access to random people is safe
14:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> :kek:
14:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> Right??
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> chiller?
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> uhh
14:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> At least run it in a vm or something
14:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought \#developer is friends
14:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh youre alive
14:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> lerato is evil
14:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> this should make me safe right

14:40 < bridge> <pilonpl> Containers are overrated
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Should be fine xd no warranty and all
14:41 < ws-client> **<Pathos>** @chillerdragon my maps need both 0.6 and 0.7 versions or talking to someone else?

14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Check irc
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also maybe Heinrich muted you axaxaxaxxa
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But given that botters recently chatted from irc I think not
14:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> how can heinrich be so fast
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> ohhh
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> i might be using the same name for the bot
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> thats why it doesnt work
14:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It should rename
14:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich sometimes makes the channel read only
14:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> even if its read only the bot still does not show up
14:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> what runtime do u run the bot with
14:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> im using bun and there are no errors but maybe its the problem
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Irc lib is trouble sometimes
14:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok so i should rewrite in rust
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or quakent
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I use npm

15:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ):
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the server is just doing

15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         res.writeHead(200);
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> res.end("Hello world");

15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> THE SERVER HAS TO WRITE CONTENT LENGTH
15:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> adoi
15:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> was my first thought xd
15:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> but i asked ai
15:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> it said everything ok
15:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so did i
15:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it said maybe context length
15:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> does head request even need body
15:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think its always supposed to be empty
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ?
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want databack
15:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh nvm
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it also requires text/plain mime type for some reason
15:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> because web
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its curl
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe it requires text/plain to know its utf8
15:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> why would it need to xd
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> well i dont really care
15:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
15:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thanks
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> the web is old af
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> in the end you still call some function to get the data
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> which might fail
15:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> so even if you specify text/plain it wont guarantee the data is correct
15:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> so even if you specify text/plain it wont guarantee the data is correct and valid utf8
15:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller where are u
15:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yay

15:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> now make sure it cant be exploited
15:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> sending 2 gigs of text should not be allowed
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it will only send 10 lines at once at max
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and will stop if the server gets overloaded
15:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in terms of exploiting by making macros
15:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1. requires knowledge which could be used to just modify ddnet urself
15:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2. theres a random delay between 1 and 5 seconds and you can only do things on chat msgs

17:04 < bridge> <avolicious> where you got this from?
17:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> the bot is open source xd
17:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> oh
17:05 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, figures. After the incident I wouldn't put a real shell there again
17:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the reverse engineering started
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> this is not fun anymore
17:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it was fun for me :D 
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> its all just illusion
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> no real bash
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> no real damange
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> no real damage
17:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> u should have used rm -rf when chiller was asleep smh
17:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** real damage hurt my pi last time :c 
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> use rbash
17:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its not safe
17:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there actually is a safe bash
17:06 < bridge> <avolicious> https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html
17:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can let it eval in some public irc
17:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** every time i played with rbash i found it pretty trash
17:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> add an ability to interact with teeworlds-asmr
17:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
17:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sure will do
17:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> yippe
17:06 < bridge> <avolicious> please add teeworlds headless
17:07 < bridge> <avolicious> so we can join a server and send commands to fifo
17:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oke
17:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> sounds like ddnet on twitch
17:07 < bridge> <avolicious> yes
17:07 < bridge> <avolicious> we can control it via fifo and pass a map in developer chatroom
17:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-live
17:07 < bridge> <avolicious> just for the sake of research
17:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @avolicious when fix this btw

17:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah true
17:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maintainer colors
17:08 < bridge> <avolicious> yes
17:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nvm then
17:09 < bridge> <avolicious> It gets worse on development 😄

17:34 < bridge> <teero777> can someone find me a 3 character mathematical expression that results in an answer of 12 characters?
17:34 < bridge> <always> 1*12
17:34 < bridge> <always> wait what
17:34 < bridge> <teero777> bro...
17:35 < bridge> <teero777> can someone find me a 3 character mathematical expression that results in an answer with 12 characters?
17:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd
17:36 < bridge> <teero777> can someone find me a 3 character mathematical expression that results in an answer with 12 digits?
17:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> subfactorial of 15? `!15`
17:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> results in `481066515734`
17:48 < bridge> <avolicious> chatgpt? 😄
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> no in fact
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> chatgpt gave dumb answers
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> pls give credit to humans
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> :cammo:
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> chatgpt said
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> ```
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Here's the breakdown:
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> 
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious>     The Expression: !15
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious>     The Characters: It uses exactly three characters: !, 1, 5.
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious>     The Math: The ! symbol placed before a number represents a subfactorial (or derangement). It calculates the number of ways to arrange n items so that no item ends up in its original position.
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious>     The Calculation: The value of !15 is: 481,066,337,167
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> 
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> This answer has exactly 12 digits.
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> ```
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> I guess your prompt was just bad
17:49 < bridge> <teero777> @avolicious im asking here because chatgpt didn't get me the answer xD
17:49 < bridge> <teero777> this works thx
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Skill issue
17:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> its not about prompting
17:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> its about pure skill
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Prompt engineering skills
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> 😏
17:49 < bridge> <louis> i was tryna do like 5e!
17:49 < bridge> <avolicious> thats pure skill
17:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> booo
17:50 < bridge> <louis> or other irrational constant somehow
17:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> vibe mathing
17:50 < bridge> <teero777> "AT ALL COSTS"
17:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> they have infinite digits
17:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 69!
17:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and higher any it breaks alot of calculators
17:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh darn someone beat me to it
17:50 < bridge> <teero777> that is not 12
17:50 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1400143637689667615/image.png?ex=688b90e0&is=688a3f60&hm=0c10c2e6230d052f9eb706d5de980e61badbb0e3ce5d7f9ff38edb909e1645ba&
17:50 < bridge> <teero777> that is not 12 digits
17:51 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1400143637689667615/image.png?ex=688b90e0&is=688a3f60&hm=0c10c2e6230d052f9eb706d5de980e61badbb0e3ce5d7f9ff38edb909e1645ba&
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh exactly
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> danr
17:51 < bridge> <louis> oh i assume he meant like 12 digits without decimals
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> neither 14 nor 15 work
17:51 < bridge> <teero777> yes, integers
17:51 < bridge> <avolicious> Use a calculator written in rust
17:51 < bridge> <avolicious> because we trust
17:51 < bridge> <teero777> qalc is good
17:52 < bridge> <teero777> anyway i found my dream answer
17:52 < bridge> <teero777> but im not gonna tell you what it is
17:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> :pepeRage:
17:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `1eC` if your calculator is in base 16
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `1eC` if your calculator is in a base higher than 11
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gives an answer which in base 10 is 12 digits
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and e also works in base 10
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .--.
17:56 < bridge> <robyt3> `c^d = 614f4c000000` in base 16 :santatrollet:
17:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wow
17:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> primorial factorials of any integer from 30 to 36 also work
17:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> they all evaluate to `200560490130`
17:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> no idea how it works but it works
18:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> primorial factorials of any integer from 30 to 36 also work (e.g. `30#`, `34#`)
18:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato yes goes exactly like that
18:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> im surprised that the delay is almost unnoticeable
18:26 < bridge> <faffa81> What is better? VS code, or VS community 2022.
18:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> vim
18:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> but if talking seriously just use vscode
18:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @davide55 sos i am being firewalled mid run
18:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok back in
18:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** phew
18:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato well irc is fast and my websockets too
18:30 < bridge> <faffa81> Bro vim on windows goes crazy tbh
18:30 < bridge> <faffa81> i will try to download
18:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato discord is the slowest part xd
18:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmao true
18:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @faffa81 using windows is the first mistake
18:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but agree vscode > vs
18:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah
18:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> i switched to linux just to use neovim because it didnt work properly on windows
18:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> plot twist
18:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont use neovim
18:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> at all
18:31 < bridge> <faffa81> dw i have quad boot for building the client on all platforms

22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's ok. That's basically my whole life.. Waiting
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Until them I'll hopefully find something interesting
22:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** would u have rerolled if the answerwas never? xd
22:21 < bridge> <ikeed> oh so that was newlines was it
22:21 < bridge> <ikeed> god i hate it
22:21 < bridge> <ikeed> i am SO concious about pasting anything in the client, because of this bug
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ofc not
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's not how you challenge destiny
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon danr roby values ur opinion more over mine
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> shucks
22:30 < bridge> <louis> agree w chiller
22:31 < bridge> <louis> a chat shouldnt act like a terminal
22:31 < bridge> <robyt3> But it does currently act like a terminal
22:31 < bridge> <louis> yeah which is bad behavior imo
22:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Oh, "shouldnt", yeah
22:35 < bridge> <louis> i think some default windows shells also warn you on multi line paste, it might be annoying when you want the behavior but in my experience i do not want to send messages without pressing enter 9 / 10 times
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> should f1 and f2 act like terminals then
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 0-0
23:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @avolicious wtf was that broadcast you almost rushed me into fail. Can you be anymore dramatic? ._.
23:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Trolled them in voice a bit 😄
23:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Sorry
23:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was last for a second with 200 puls trying to finish faster than you can type shutdown bro
23:11 < bridge> <melon> what was the broadcast
23:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** was 90% of the map with 1 hour time and avo casually broadcasts "shutting down server"
23:12 < bridge> <avolicious> To be fair, they called out in discord for it
23:12 < bridge> <avolicious> They wanted some more spicyness during their run
23:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the run was giga spiced
23:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we barley survived xd
23:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you cant imagine the flaming that would happen if we would have failed
23:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ <:gigachad:960830678465933403>
23:15 < bridge> <melon> XDD
