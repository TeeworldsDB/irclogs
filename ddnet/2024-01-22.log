02:16 < bridge> <patiga> Hey I'm helping someone use my twgpu tools (to generate images of maps). they managed to make it work on their own pc, but want to run it on a vps. however, whenever they run anything wgpu-related, they get stack smashing errors. I'm not sure if they installed graphics drivers correctly. first, wgpu went "no suitable adapter found", then they followed this https://askubuntu.com/questions/429596/how-to-choose-the-vga-when-setting-up-the-x-server, and

02:16 < bridge> <patiga> wgpu-info is a simple tool that only lists the available adapters for wgpu https://crates.io/crates/wgpu-info
02:16 < bridge> <patiga> other rust binaries still run normally, such as my map tools
02:16 < bridge> <patiga> I honestly have no experience at all with vps and graphics drivers, so if anyone has an idea, that would be awesome ^^
02:18 < bridge> <patiga> I haven't tried to get them to debug the crash further yet, maybe that is necessary? First wanted to see if someone here has the solution cached
02:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> "has the solution cached" love that phrase haha
02:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can wgpu run on the cpu? Might be slower but sounds less driver issue painy
02:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can offer you to run the same thing on my debian 12 vps and debian 12 laptop if it helps @patiga 
02:27 < bridge> <patiga> I think there are cpu graphics drivers exist, which wgpu could use
02:27 < bridge> <patiga> maybe mesa?
02:32 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: its for someone else, I'm pretty sure they want to run it on their own server
02:33 < bridge> <patiga> but thanks for the offer :)
02:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no not for production i mean to test the issue if i can reproduce it etc
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I used mesas lavapipe, which is vulkan software renderer, in my vps to run try the off screen capabilities of dd-pg engine.
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What was directly a problem is that the mesa 22 and lower didn't work at all on the vps CPU
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I unsafely upgraded them and it worked without problems
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I'm pretty sure it was no stack smashing.. But maybe you can try your tool on your main computer using a software renderer?
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Could try to also get this issue
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BTW has wgpu no surface less mode if using vulkan back end?
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Normally u don't need any x server. At least not directly.. The mesa drivers have it as dependency. But that's mostly because of the surface extension
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In other words. Surfaces are a extension. Without this extension vulkan is really more a communication api for the gpu
09:52 < bridge> <patiga> afaik, no
09:52 < bridge> <patiga> surfaces are no extension, and there is no feature for it. you can ofc not use the surface struct, but the feature resolving happens at the device initialization, right?
09:54 < bridge> <patiga> this sounds good, that should hopefully work
09:55 < bridge> <patiga> yeah the stack smashing is rly weird imo, how could the graphics driver installation fail so drastically
09:56 < bridge> <patiga> good point, I'll get back to that if all else fails üëç
09:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For vulkan you have to explicitly enable the surface extension. Which in case of winit or SDL is a call to these APIs to fetch the correct extension name
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So if you don't have this control. Then probably not possible
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah it happens at instance creation
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: interesting, wouldn't have thought it to be possible ^^
12:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: but wait, where are the packets that *also* contain snaps but also interesting other packets?
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yep i also realized i didnt post my updated even more complicated filter :D 
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://gist.github.com/ChillerDragon/dff6661613533c9bd17ad790e01e8c97
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it now keeps snaps if the packet also contains non snap packets. I do it by only filtering out snaps if the amount of chunks is the expected amount
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this looks better
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705925584.png
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sadly i didnt find a way to filter this. But its rare and its a false negative so thats not so bad. 
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wireshark filters do have some count methods so it is probably possible to check if input_timing is in there twice but i did not bother yet

13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie u worried too fred? :D
13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it is kinda scary if this thing keeps trending like this. It might be the new normal that some bored front desk employee at a cafe or hotel starts looking at the traffoc of the customers
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Tja
14:15 < bridge> <smetanolub> ))) new normal
14:16 < bridge> <smetanolub> u mean old normal?
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I dont think its a thing. What is common as of right now that a bunch of fancy routers (at least in germany) show which sites the traffic goes to.
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I could see how much traffic at work was porn :D and seen such stats in a few places
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i never heard of something so sophisticated such as the GFW. That it starts to analyze the packets deeper and migh even show which urls on a specific host are accessed
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Starbucks employees might now see my rcon password for gCTF servers o.O
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> popping up in some fancy gui
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay thats unlikely but i mean they might see what youtube videos i watch 
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is already pretty disturbing

14:27 < bridge> <teero777> I can't tell if you're joking or not :justatest:
14:27 < bridge> <avolicious> Discord, Facebook, Google all is blocked due to GFW
14:27 < bridge> <avolicious> So Tencent can build their own service called Bilibili and QQ üòÑ
14:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if u can play ddnet there its not that bad üòè
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also github is blocked so basically no dev tooling works in china
14:28 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, its illegal in China. The game itself has no license in china
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> many ppl depend on github urls espeially raw.githubusercontent.com
14:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i never in my life read correctly bililibilili xd
14:28 < bridge> <avolicious> AFAIK: To sell games in china, you have to get approval by authorities, thus you need a license
14:29 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, its their "youtube"

15:37 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Copying it here from #bugs 
15:37 < bridge> <pipou_tw> It seems like you can't rotate quads anymore with ctrl+left click
15:37 < bridge> <pipou_tw> It works in 17.1.1 at least
15:37 < bridge> <pipou_tw> ctrl+click does nothing anymore
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Make GH issue
16:17 < bridge> <louis> press r
16:17 < bridge> <louis> i beblieve
16:21 < bridge> <coke1465> r and move mouse
16:21 < bridge> <coke1465> again r to stop rotating
16:39 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Lol wtf
16:40 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Ctrl click was much simpler
16:40 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Ctrl click was simpler
16:40 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> i've spent like 2 mins getting used to r, it's not bad
16:49 < bridge> <patiga> heh, are we going blender style? :D
16:49 < bridge> <patiga> r to rotate, g to move, s to scale
16:52 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Is it possible to unable the fact that quads align to one another?
16:53 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Also, would it be possible to improve the performance when zooming out in the editor (make it as smooth and as fast as the in-game zoom)
17:05 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> is it possible to make it visible if someone is spectateing you?
17:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> what exactly
17:07 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> if i select someone with shift for spectating show it for him that i spectate him
17:08 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> like in hearthstone
17:15 < bridge> <archidev_> Yes, it is in the settings menu
17:16 < bridge> <archimede67> Yes, it is in the settings menu, the last two options are about that feature
17:17 < bridge> <archimede67> Is this considered as a bug?
17:17 < bridge> <archimede67> Or was it simply replaced by "r"
17:20 < bridge> <pipou_tw> I have no idea, it's less practical @archimede67

17:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hello there
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they already adapted
17:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what will happen if i use for in a tick()
17:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It will cause lags if it‚Äôs too slow
17:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But computers are fast
17:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what if the for takes 50 tick's to get don ?
17:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by not pinging everyone
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are lot of fors in tick
17:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> As lerato always says: clock cycles are free. Hardware gets better so write slower code!
17:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yeh i see
17:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You need a big ass for to take 50 ticks even on a raspberry pi
17:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just don‚Äôt use while (true) axaxaxax
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and use more ram
17:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you explain the process step in step ?
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even if u dont need it
17:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how it will be done
17:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it will make another tread for that for ?
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for (auto four = 4; four < 4 + 4; four += 4) { ... }
17:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just download more tame
17:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ram
17:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It won‚Äôt
17:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You have to do it your self
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
17:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> will it mess up the tick speed ?
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
17:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> C++ is not web scale
17:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you turn it on it doesn‚Äôt scale right up
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it depends fully on your for loop
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u download four k teeporn then yes
17:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Doing 100 iterations with simple operations inside is smooth af
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's so web scale
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just show your code
17:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u always ask questions, i dont even know what u doing
17:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Web scale would turn for loops into threads xaxaxax
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not
17:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the code is personal stuff
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah for sure
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what r u working on?
17:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i renamed those variables :owo:
17:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> he switched to client side hehe
17:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> just wondering about for for a second
17:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cool thanks I‚Äôm on da phone will look tomorrow @milkeeycat
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can't foresee your thoughts about using for tho
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> using four fors inside each other can cause a for-ception. which is bad for performance
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> perFORmance
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to be precise
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> foresee lmao
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> yeah just use recursion it‚Äôs faster
17:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i will show my code
17:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but don't suggest anything
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for four seconds
17:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's lazy
17:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lazy code pog
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CCharacter::ExplodingProcess()

17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         m_ExplodingProcessStartTick = Server()->Tick();
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         for(int i; (i <= 16) && m_ExplodingProcessStartTick*(16*10) >= Server()->Tick();)
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         {
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>             if((i*10)+m_ExplodingProcessStartTick == Server()->Tick())

17:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     return;
17:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> }
17:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0fps code
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well 1. you dont init int i
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's already a bug
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh true
17:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i couldn't test it, cus it's crash the sv, but not shuting it down
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> loool
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also where did the i++ go?
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro i am too stupid to read your code xD
17:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i know this loop took long to be done
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is this chatgpt
17:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> git gud :santatrollet:
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it looks like u only increase `i` under a certain condition
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds pretty scarry
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And the condition involves i
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what if that condition is never true?
17:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It goes to 0 fps
17:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wanted to cycle throgh all the emotes every 10 tick's that's all
17:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if the tee is in exploding process
17:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and the 16 is the maximum emoteicons i guss
17:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 15 maybe
17:41 < bridge> <patiga> okay first things first: this code should never take longer than 1 tick to run (in reality it will only take a tiny fraction of a tick), assuming that it is bug-free
17:41 < bridge> <patiga> are you open to suggestions now, or was that the answer you were looking for?
17:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but what if it takes more than 1 tick to be done, yes im open
17:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> my fucking masages don't get sent
17:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if it don't take more than 1 tick it's like every other statements in the tick, am i right ?
17:48 < bridge> <patiga> yes
17:48 < bridge> <patiga> then there is a bug, causing the loop to last much much longer than it should
17:49 < bridge> <patiga> like jupstar already said, the variable `i` is not set to any number, causing undefined behavior
17:49 < bridge> <patiga> but honestly I also struggle to understand the code at all
17:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the code is lazy
17:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> like me
17:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you envolve tick in your for ?
17:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you involve tick in your for ?
17:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you involve tick in your for() ?
17:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ah man i get it now
17:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you can't cus you never gonna go to the next tick
17:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you can't cus you never gonna go to the next tick in the for
17:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you can't, cus you never gonna go to the next tick in the for
17:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> the problem is that it doesn't seem to make sense to me @mamad_melanin 
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> assuming that `CCharacter::ExplodingProcess` is called every tick, and `m_ExplodingProcessStartTick` is set externally to the tick when the tee explodes, you could simply do:
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> 1. calculate `tick_duration = server_tick - current_tick`, that is the tick duration since the exploding started
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> 2. do a `if tick_duration < 150 { return; }` to make the animation last only 3 seconds
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> 3. `emoji = tick_duration % 16`
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> 4. send that emoji
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> I don't think you need a for loop for this
17:55 < bridge> <patiga> exactly :)
17:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yeh this is smart and also fast
17:57 < bridge> <patiga> at 2., it should be > 150, not < 150
17:59 < bridge> <furo321> There is `NUM_EMOTICONS`, which is 15.

18:49 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> @avolicious
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is another TUR #1 server with different ip

18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (real server)
18:51 < bridge> <DDNet> 195.85.201.173:8303 appears to be a KoG server. DDNet and KoG aren't affiliated. 
18:51 < bridge> <DDNet> Join their discord and ask for help there instead. <https://discord.kog.tw/>
18:51 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, its fake

19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @mr.gh0s7 btw, now that you are here.
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is your new fng server still a thing?
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> has oreo ever played it? xd
19:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> dfng?
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno how you called it
19:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I mean it's up but we (me and zogtib) kinda stopped developing it xD
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok xd
19:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think oreo has played it though :)
19:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It's kinda like ALIVE servers rn
19:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> üò¨
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the main reason i lost interest in dev fng is, that i want more client support
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> end of 2024 is the time for fng
19:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah same
19:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> dd-pg is the future!

20:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can someone explain this, i tried to compile my source on a linux server as always
20:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and why downloading and building the rust packages take ages ?
20:08 < bridge> <diariesvexar> your network problem maybe
20:08 < bridge> <diariesvexar> you have network problem maybe

20:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes
20:19 < bridge> <scrumplex> it seems rather high tbh
20:19 < bridge> <scrumplex> but considering that there are 200.000 unique usernames it might be realistic
20:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how many names is there ?
20:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> all the names who ever played ddnet
20:20 < bridge> <scrumplex> oh sorry
20:20 < bridge> <scrumplex> the 200.000 was unique names in 2023

20:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> is the number i get ? :D
20:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how this is not wrong ? must be more than this
20:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> i just ran it again: https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1705951331_zo0Ahl.png
20:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> now it's cached
20:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> now it's cached for me tho
20:23 < bridge> <scrumplex> adding spaces to query to bypass cache results in the same number each time
20:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the number is can't cover even the chinese people
20:24 < bridge> <scrumplex> why not? :O
20:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> there are too many players and they have unique names ?
20:24 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> hmm..
20:24 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199072175953555547/image.png?ex=65c135fc&is=65aec0fc&hm=e087ab6f26c1c27b1e02f1d727222c2c4efdcc7518a5663aada9679508ad620e&
20:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> oh i just count all players
20:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> no matter which maps they played
20:26 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ah well then yeah you get `1153219`
20:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> maybe it count the players with standard names
20:26 < bridge> <scrumplex> so there are 20000 players who only played fun or 0p race maps
20:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> someone heeelp
20:27 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1705951667_PhiaV7.png
20:27 < bridge> <scrumplex> you need to share the file as public
20:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hah
20:28 < bridge> <cyberfighter> that would take 10-50 novices
20:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you see it now ?
20:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> or one 5* insane - ez
20:29 < bridge> <cyberfighter> 50 points is really a lot if u are new
20:29 < bridge> <scrumplex> yup. How did you install rust?
20:30 < bridge> <scrumplex> yes. But if someone just tries the game once they probably wont have 50 points
20:30 < bridge> <cyberfighter> it would probably take them a bit for 50 even if they like it imo
20:30 < bridge> <cyberfighter> or if they look at other modes too
20:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just did regular cmake stuff, like cmake -B build -C . and make .
20:30 < bridge> <cyberfighter> but its fine
20:30 < bridge> <cyberfighter> lul
20:31 < bridge> <cyberfighter> imagine some gigachad getting 50 points and THEN leaving
20:31 < bridge> <scrumplex> there is a problem with the sql query though. Anyone who starts out near the end of the year and doesnt make it to 50 points is forever excluded from this
20:31 < bridge> <cyberfighter> why does that happen
20:33 < bridge> <cyberfighter> another screen as in like another monitor?
20:33 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i could try it on linux
20:34 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, other monitor in the graphics settings
20:34 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I can try on windows 11
20:36 < bridge> <diariesvexar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199075058069545070/image.png?ex=65c138ab&is=65aec3ab&hm=aebe8023e8274afdf5c96e216d2619b7cd1e9cdde1b637e1e940e4f368b15733&

20:37 < bridge> <diariesvexar> when switch to second monitor it's change to windowed mode and resolution is still follow my first monitor that doesn't support on my second one
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I meant "windowed borderless" sorry
20:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> oh nvm actually
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess the fix would be the same here
20:38 < bridge> <diariesvexar> oh okay let me try again
20:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> yeah but dont you need to download and install rust first?
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Would probably work if we switch to windowed first and then switch back after changing the screen
20:39 < bridge> <diariesvexar> yeah it's fix it
20:39 < bridge> <diariesvexar> cuz when i manually put to window fullscreen on second one it's fine for me
20:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no, it get installed with cmake, i compiled my source about 6 times, this is the first time i getting this, and i never changed anything in *.rs files
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> If you start with Windowed Borderless and not screen 0 then it's still broken though
20:41 < bridge> <diariesvexar> no it's fine with windowed borderless on screen 1
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Thanks for testing, maybe it's a me-problem or specific to Windows 10 then
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> This issue also happens only to me for some reason #6578
20:42 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6578
20:43 < bridge> <diariesvexar> maybe but it would be nice to when switch to other screen it set to highest resolution
20:43 < bridge> <diariesvexar> it's happened to me too but In my own custom client so I had to replace restart with quit after update done
20:44 < bridge> <diariesvexar> And there is also a bug
20:44 < bridge> <diariesvexar> enter text in chat for example a then enter b
20:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like this fixes the issue for me. When I set the correct resultion windowed borderless also works on other screens.
20:45 < bridge> <diariesvexar> and when you press up it's show b but press escape button on your keyboard and again open chat and press up it's show a instead of b
20:46 < bridge> <diariesvexar> in my case my monitor highest resolution isn't same so it's goes out of monitor on second monitor
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure I understand correctly, do you use `cl_chat_reset 0`?
20:48 < bridge> <diariesvexar> no
20:49 < bridge> <diariesvexar> oh it's fixed on DDNet 18.0
21:07 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Autorule doesn't work anymore
23:31 < bridge> <opulently> Did anyone try to add ImGui to ddnet? Cuz default GUI sucks
23:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and u think imgui is better???
23:56 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yea i discovered u can plug any stdio compliant language server into qt creator
23:56 < bridge> <Ewan> so i can do like this
23:56 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199125559154856026/image.png?ex=65c167b3&is=65aef2b3&hm=9d5f46426e16d8378dd75b1a306bf6b3b36316589ee2114481168c376149788d&
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> and then get rust analyzer in qt creator... <https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1168672733060661258/1198779511030960249/image.png?ex=65c0256b&is=65adb06b&hm=f90e4ef83104eb735e10543c1a4bbe9924412f762d83e1e882b934ba3d9607b6&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1440&height=735>
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> with build in syntax highlighting and custom build steps you can do quite a lot
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> no formatting for rust tho the only format plugins that exist rn use astyle, clang-format and uncrustify
