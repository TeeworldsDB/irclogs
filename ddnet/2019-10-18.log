00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> m_Afk seems uninitialized for ghosts
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 The mapres changed in 0.7 vanilla, so we had to embed everything. rest is identical
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 am I allowed to answer too, because "anyone else" would exclude me? TEAM_SUPER is the team you get put into when you use super command in rcon, allows you not to be affected by freeze etc
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (And since TEAM_SUPER is 64 and solo server creates a new team for each player, that for a short time when you had a full solo server the last joining player landed in TEAM_SUPPER. I guess you could consider that an ingame privilege escalation.)
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen i know its a lot of work but to be cleaner using 0.7 tiles instead of embedding everything would be better.
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for the standard tiles
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, but then the maps would look different, right?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think the goal is to preserve them exactly as they are
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen hmm, how was the priviledge escalation fixed? And what is the need for team_super? It feels one can just use pCharacter->m_Super and avoid the weird team thing
13:00 <@deen> I think the last player is put in team 0
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The maps would have the 0.7 style yes
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Grass looks the same
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BµmM>/Snape> why is /ninjajetpack on by default?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BµmM>/Snape> I think it is confusing for new players
16:02 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> lol since when?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BµmM>/Snape> nvm
