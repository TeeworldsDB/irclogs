01:11 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> why dont the servers use cloudflare or something for ddos protectsons
01:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 have you thought of using cloudflare to fix ddos?
01:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 omg new discord names
01:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :kek: after like 7 years?
01:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> As if handling traffic was the only problem with it
01:54 < bridge> <rainonwires> can someone explain to me why this happens?
01:54 < bridge> <rainonwires> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347371717617647666/image.png?ex=67cb9532&is=67ca43b2&hm=9f67de511d9e134203ee58c8940148f852ee9ccbb2a630bdfd1900635d02d328&
01:54 < bridge> <rainonwires> very confused lol
01:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, the error is kind of nudging you to the #include line
01:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> shocker huh
01:57 < bridge> <rainonwires> yes i can tell, but i am at a loss for what the issue is, no need to be rude.
02:18 < bridge> <Solly> install clang-format 10 and run ./scripts/fix-style.py
02:19 < bridge> <rainonwires> appreciate it
04:03 < bridge> <pioooooo> have anyone built on mac silicon?
04:04 < bridge> <pioooooo> i think the cmake is a bit wrong
04:07 < bridge> <pioooooo> currently bundled ffmpeg libraries is not used even when no system installation is found
04:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> cmake is so cursed
04:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> i now think mac is more cursed
04:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i built.on mac
04:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> uae brew
04:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> use
04:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> to install depa
04:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> deps
04:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @pioooooo maybe u need to enable videorecorder for ffmpeg
04:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgor
04:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> i changed some cmake script of findffmpeg to use the bundled
04:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> currently the problem is about include dirs
04:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347413417765634068/message.txt?ex=67cbbc08&is=67ca6a88&hm=3497f39469fb04600e04e459706ac86db8fd7f6499c1c1490e53c59f2e9a2f63&
04:41 < bridge> <pioooooo> if i remove the `-isystem /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX13.sdk/usr/include` in the build option it could build
04:41 < bridge> <pioooooo> but i don't know why cmake generated this
04:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> and why it should cause the error...
04:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> it's for curl tho
05:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> `#  target_include_directories(${target} SYSTEM PRIVATE ${CURL_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SQLite3_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS})`
05:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> commented this line and I'm good now
05:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> i dont like it
05:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347425877633269821/128B51C9E11898153502045F044DB4E9.jpg?ex=67cbc7a3&is=67ca7623&hm=ddfb1a78ff3e11b4ea7112bb696bde6dd8da64db50bb755bc7dfe73b1e94b4e0&
12:19 < bridge> <pioooooo> when do we deploy the fix
12:19 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347529031356256366/1e702f56da84bb9e.png?ex=67cc27b4&is=67cad634&hm=bc15d6b4f96b904cf3b4ffebe743cb0686e7b9c350fde326c3d7f11804ad78f4&
12:19 < bridge> <pioooooo> they are cheesing every teaming map
12:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> and save before finish to avoid getting deranked
12:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> this is the worst day to play since i start playing ddnet...
12:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347529750083801109/c60df6305554c32b4dcaf4eeeb89df2e.jpg?ex=67cc2860&is=67cad6e0&hm=3319faa12c8ab94a72f3f0e96afd580fedf496ea65a65a67189818f3790b378c&
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> Atleast it seems detectable with some teehistorian parsing
12:23 < bridge> <pioooooo> okay
12:23 < bridge> <pioooooo> just make sure also check saves i think
12:23 < bridge> <pioooooo> but guess i cant find a game to play today :/
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> Idk how this happened practice was disabled, it shouldnt have gotten reenabled without the fix being deployed
12:27 < bridge> <learath2> I'll take a look when I can sit down
12:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> well i think that's not the case
12:45 < bridge> <kebscs> yea practice has been reenabled
12:45 < bridge> <kebscs> for some reason
12:47 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3
12:48 < bridge> <Assa> are you running some config managers?
12:49 < bridge> <Assa> This is how I run into issues like this at work ;_;
12:50 < bridge> <learath2> Nope
12:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it also seems like all chn servers whitelist was gone. most newtwcn servers is not registered either.
12:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> did you guys have some rollback issues
12:55 < bridge> <learath2> Very curious. I wonder what happened again
12:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you did fixed ddnet chn's manually before
12:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> might just be the same thing
12:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> DDNet CHN is fine currently
12:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i believe newtwcn servers like gores and fng was also whitelisted on request by deen before
12:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ðŸ˜¬  just saying this practice thing seems very sus and might be related to the whilelist thing to me
12:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> like rolling back a really really old config or something
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> But nothing should ever be replacing that masterserver config file automatically
12:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> fair
12:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> obviously i can't really tell for sure.
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> Why would they get unwhitelisted?? Did the ips change again somehow?
12:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i doubt every chn servers would just suddenly change ip
12:58 < bridge> <-StormAx> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9805
12:58 < bridge> <-StormAx> i still don't get answer here
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> I'm only entertaining this insanity because it happened once before
12:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> when
12:58 < bridge> <-StormAx> like yea the solution might be dumb but at least take a look:D
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> The time I had to rewhitelist almost every cn server a couple days ago?
12:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> nah, i'm pretty sure our ip didn't change at least on our end
12:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and ddnet chn is still fine since you rewhitelisted them
12:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm saying the non ddnet servers
12:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> has the same issue
12:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we just didn't fix them
12:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> plus you probably don't have their ips on hand anyway
13:00 < bridge> <learath2> Aah
13:00 < bridge> <learath2> If you gimme ips I can get them whitelisted when I sit down
13:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> well
13:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't have them either
13:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> they are just individually whitelisted on request between hosters and deen i believe
13:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> at least i personally don't keep track of the server IPs since i don't manage them
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> Well lmk as people start complaining and I can check
13:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> well they are complaining
13:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> else i wouldn't know
13:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you know, i don't really open the game
13:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kekw:
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252358080522747904/1267876556261560454/EB37683D3A4CDA1932DD5DD1561EC9AF.gif
13:03 < bridge> <learath2> I mean when the hosters are complaining
13:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i guess
13:04 < bridge> <learath2> If it's a whitelisting issue they will start seeing a spam of check your firewall messages
13:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chn hosters are notorious for just complaining without filing any reports lol
13:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> nothing i can do about it probably.
13:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> well chn in general
13:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but still, it does seem like weird that all whitelist were just gone. unless you are positive that ips and changed and have a list of the original IPs so we can compare
13:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but still, it does seem like weird that all whitelist were just gone. unless you are positive that ips are changed and have a list of the original IPs so we can compare
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> The config had all the old ips whitelisted
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> And the ones that were still the same as the ips from dns were registering fine
13:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw we chn did swap servers from 1 - 10 in the past year
13:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so chn5 isn't chn5 from a year ago
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> I have a saner guess
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe the ips changed, no one updated the whitelist but it worked fine because the firewall was being lax
13:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> possible
13:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sounds sane to me
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> Then it's not the ips that randomly changed by a mystery admin that didn't tell anyone
13:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we can wail until April to see what happens to the non ddnet servers
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> But it's that the firewall decided it doesnt like our heartbeats
13:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> march is the chinese congress meeting so internet is indeed weird around these time
13:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i just hope we don't just deploy the henan and fujian thing to the entire country
13:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> after the meeting
13:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we can wait until April to see what happens to the non ddnet servers
13:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> what is that
13:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> they are testing whitelisting instead of blacklisting as far as we can tell. obviously no one knows what it does
13:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> Hope my proxy won't die or have price increased
13:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> I actually have thought they would lift the restrictions somehow
13:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> Illusions
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> hope I have less bots trying to hijack my homeserver, but I guess this direction is no problem
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> trying to find something positive there ...
13:41 < bridge> <zerolacqua> hope my proxy doesn't have any issues, or else my happiness is gone. at least it works fine now :kek:
13:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> mine already doesn't work as well during march
13:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> @pioooooo @zerolacqua btw, in case you don't know, we log everything said here and they are not deletable.
13:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kekw:
13:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and everything said here is publicly available on the internet and indexed by google
14:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> Yeah I know that
14:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> I don't care much
14:12 < bridge> <zerolacqua> i think even we dont log chat, there are ways to know what we said lol
16:40 < bridge> <louis> what was even wrong with practice?
16:42 < bridge> <louis> oh i see
16:43 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9816>
16:44 < bridge> <kebscs> after fix was merged practice got reenabled
16:44 < bridge> <kebscs> when it wasnt on servers yet xd
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> demo files dont contain rcon passwords do they? because i did not find the code that hides it
17:41 < bridge> <zhn> demo writes everything afaik, should check deeper tho
17:41 < bridge> <zhn> nice question chiller
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Messages should only be recorded when `MSGFLAG_RECORD` is set on the client side, which is only used for tunings and sounds AFAICT. On the server side both `MSGFLAG_NORECORD` and `MSGFLAG_RECORD` are mixed with different functions though
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone here ever do websockets in async rust? tokio-tungstenite seems most popular but fastwebsockets seems faster & a little more explicit?
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> wondering about the ups and downs of either
19:18 < bridge> <meloÆž> you basically said it yourself
19:18 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
19:18 < bridge> <meloÆž> tokio-tungstenite has the advantage of good docs and a lot of people using it
19:18 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
19:18 < bridge> <meloÆž> fastwebsockets is a little on the newer site but would be my pick in that regard
19:28 < bridge> <murpi> @kebscs I like snappy tappy
19:28 < bridge> <murpi> rappy snappy tappy
19:31 < bridge> <kebscs> ðŸ™‚
19:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> imagine not having a razer huntsman v3 pro like a normal human being
19:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> :cat_cracked_hehe:
19:32 < bridge> <Ewan> whatâ€™s a good high polling rate mouse thatâ€™s also wireless
19:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> (it wasnt worth it, i should've gotten a ducky or smth)
19:33 < bridge> <kebscs> i got steelseries pro tkl and dont use like half of the features
19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ive seen the logitech wireless charging mouse mats but idk if there are any mice with great sensors that support it
19:33 < bridge> <meloÆž> that one logitech one was awesome when i used it at a friends house
19:33 < bridge> <meloÆž> the Pro X something
19:34 < bridge> <murpi> I have 3 BlackWidow V3 Pros, one in use and two as backups, so I wonâ€™t be getting a new keyboard anytime soon
19:34 < bridge> <meloÆž> 2 as backups
19:34 < bridge> <meloÆž> why on earth
19:34 < bridge> <meloÆž> murpi is a true keyboard warrior
19:35 < bridge> <meloÆž> https://tenor.com/view/keyboard-smash-gif-24651653
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
19:38 < bridge> <hectavoxel> why is this paced like a hollywood murder scene
19:40 < bridge> <murpi> I got two for free and had to return one because of a strange double-tap issue. When I contacted Razer, they told me to just cut the wire (to make it unusable), and they'd send a replacement immediately. However, since the wire was simple to replace (the keyboard is wireless too xd) and I was able to fix the double-tap issue myself, I ended up with three
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> So based
19:47 < bridge> <meloÆž> had a similar thing at work "oh it doesnt work huh... can you send me an email that we fucked up packaging? we'll send you a new one"
19:48 < bridge> <meloÆž> it was a small thing and sending it back etc would've been a timewaste on both sides, fun interaction
20:30 < bridge> <louis> g pro superlight ? is what i use
20:31 < bridge> <louis> no reason to have charging mat, it charges to full overnight and lasts like a month or more
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> what sensor
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> iâ€™m also okay with weight tbh iâ€™d rather have back/fwd buttons than it be as lightweight as possible
20:50 < bridge> <louis> i have the first version i think? with microusb charging :(
20:51 < bridge> <louis> i lowkey might upgrade just for usb c, i really want my entire setup on usb c ðŸ˜¹
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds worth
20:56 < bridge> <louis> just phone and mouse left
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> same actually
21:13 < bridge> <totar> I had 2 G703s and then switched to g pro superlight, it's very nice
21:14 < bridge> <totar> the best part for me was unexpected, the thumb side under the back/forward buttons is plastic instead of rubber so it doesn't wear away over time which was my main issue with the g703
21:16 < bridge> <totar> and yeah the battery lasts forever, I charge it for like 1 hr every 2 weeks
21:48 < bridge> <alw5> did you buy it for the snappy tappy?
21:49 < bridge> <meloÆž> i broke my old keyboard because i raged a bit while playing minecraft
21:49 < bridge> <meloÆž> so i needed a new one

22:23 < bridge> <nzxteam> this error appears when im trying to build client
22:24 < bridge> <Solly> That's not an error

22:25 < bridge> <Solly> Can you translate it to english
22:25 < bridge> <zhn> consider downloading ddnet-libs or using git correctly with --recursive on clone
22:25 < bridge> <nzxteam> he cant open file
22:25 < bridge> <zhn> you have empty folder 'ddnet-libs' rn i suppose
22:25 < bridge> <nzxteam> dont work, im tried
22:26 < bridge> <zhn> can you show directory structur
22:26 < bridge> <zhn> e

22:26 < bridge> <Solly> Huh
22:28 < bridge> <zhn> consider cleaning build folder by visual studios popup window and rebuild again
22:28 < bridge> <zhn> seems it didn't try to copy it on second run
22:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Omg I am closing in 10 years of ddnet server side dev and I finally understand a crash i have been seeing multiple times over the years and always thought its undefined behavior!
22:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats crazy
22:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut get this did you know
22:28 < bridge> <nzxteam> I'll try it now
22:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> assuming we are in the scope ``void CCharacter::Tick()`` is running this line of code safe? ``m_pPlayer->GetCharacter()->m_Health;``
22:29 < bridge> <zhn> why would you... do it?
22:29 < bridge> <zhn> use it directly xd
22:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well this is to simplify the the problem
22:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when you call functions you can end up passing the character as a pointer
22:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but technically you are still in the character tick
22:30 < bridge> <zhn> character can be allocated but not alive and thus not being present in player's pointer i suppose
22:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes!
22:30 < bridge> <zhn> im not sure since last time i visited that code was 2018 probably xd
22:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all this time i have been under the misconception that as long as you are in the character class or in a method that was called from within the character tick that the character pointer can not be null because you are inside of the instance!
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> gccâ€™s new lifetime checking &/ c++26â€™s erroneous behavior should help us with a lot of these lifetime/ptr related bugs, but ddnet never gets newest cpp
22:31 < bridge> <nzxteam> still the same mistake.
22:31 < bridge> <zhn> i remember some piece of code making character not alive but it didn't delete anything
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so my brain was always ``GetCharacter()`` big dangerous UNLESS you are called from character tick
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes @zhn 
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and the biggest troll is that GetCharacter() is not a simple getter
22:31 < bridge> <zhn> yep
22:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is not implemented as ``GetCharacter() { return m_pCharacter; }``
22:32 < bridge> <zhn> move to my dms pls and send a screenshot of your project tree structure
22:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> IT RETURNS A NULLPTR if m_pCharacter is not alive xd

22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yea itâ€™s good that itâ€™s nullptr instead of a dangling pointer (is there such a thing? ptr to deleted memory) but really std::optional would save many asses
22:34 < bridge> <nzxteam> i send a screenshot
