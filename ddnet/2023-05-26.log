01:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Is a score of 0 even a possibility, we use this score thing in such a bizarre way 😄
04:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao, some people thought we made a inferior IME into ddnet and they are now asking me how to turn it off cuz they thought it wasn't smart compared to their system IME
04:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And is that true?
04:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd have thought it's exactly the same from the suggestions
04:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what suggestions
05:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh candidates
05:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It should be the same as their IME
05:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> We couldn't possibly built-in multi-language IMEs directly into ddnet
05:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's probably just the look that is throwing people off
07:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok, then they will get used to it^^
07:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's what i thought
07:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> But some people just can't understand they are using their exact IME
07:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> They insist we made a dumber version of chinese input lol
07:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is, and before it didnt show in info, but i made it show
08:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> make sure u test this properly
08:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wont fix i t
08:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> point based has to work too
08:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it looks good on a quick look
08:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @Robyt3 sir, I forgot about the people who uses arrow key to select candidates
08:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
08:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd also do that 😂
08:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you'd use arrow keys or forget them
08:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use arrow key
08:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Oooo
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you not do so when using Google or coding ? ^^
08:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111546121328799765/61f2fe1c3a542848.jpg
08:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't need to select candidates on my own ime
08:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> But if i do i just use numbers
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> Hi fred
08:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do we have a config to turn off candidate window
08:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> People are asking for it
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf. Even the fps are overlapped
08:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Idk what happened, just forwarding bug reports
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's ok. Just never seen such a bug ^^
08:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Oh wait i think arrow key works
08:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's just not what they used to
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe we should collect all these issues
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is any of them at least happy to be able to play in Fullscreen
08:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I dont think the arrow key can be adjusted
08:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's entirely handled by ime
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Playing windowed under windows must suck hard ^^
08:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Probably but the happy ones don't talk
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
08:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> That's normal i think
08:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think the background was no clear
08:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Without anything drawn on it
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe driver bug?
09:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally looks really buggy to me
09:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why are there so many driver bug that we keep getting
09:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
09:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because it's cheaper to produce shitty drivers
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~Let's replace our renderer with Godot's graphic server~~
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder how much work around they have
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And black listing
09:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I randomly scanned throw some steam games a while ago. We are definitely not the only ones with these problems
09:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Through
09:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Is it generally better using latest drivers on windows?
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Most of the time yes. But not always
09:19 < bridge> <Learath2> I still don't quite understand how we manage to hit so many while rendering a 2d game 😄
09:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Should i tell them to update drivers?
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But windows often has drivers shortly after the hardware released xD
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They often suck
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Are there so many reports like this?
09:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Sounds weird to me as well but I'm not the graphic guy so idk
09:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Just one
09:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Doubt it. So what us the issue anyway? They don't like that we render the candidates?
09:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just told them to reset their custom background if they can
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess u could ask if it happened after alt tab or smth
09:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Some people don't like it
09:22 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I wonder what we are missing. We can certainly add q config for it but maybe ask them what the issue is?
09:22 < bridge> <Learath2> Or ask them to show their nornal ime completion in other applications.m
09:23 < bridge> <Learath2> I can imagine there being some extra information about the candidate in the window maybe but that's about it
09:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> We are missing nothing
09:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> They want their ime "skins" back
09:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> For the windowed users
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't feel like it's many. It's just that every person having trouble reports it. If all ppl without problem would say smth u'd get a feeling for it.. most annoying is if discord overlay or similar destroys the game for no reason ^^
09:24 < bridge> <Learath2> From 0 to 100 how sure are you? 😛
09:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 20
09:24 < bridge> <Learath2> Users are rarely completely wrong when reporting regressions in usability
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> We can add input state where it shows which language you are currently typing
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> We can add ime state where it shows which language you are currently typing
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> But lots of third party ime misreport that
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's a feature paradigm shift
09:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111556019273859152/-6c18cab31aa38140.jpg

09:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Some people just want their waifu back
09:27 < bridge> <Learath2> There is ofc bias there but still. Even the variety of bugs we manage to hit is impressive. I'd think we were using only the tiniest part of the driver which probably gets tested a lot in QA
09:28 < bridge> <Learath2> It's not like we hit some insane codepath while using a vk extension that is only standardized by one vendor
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yep. I'm also impressed. Especially about stuff like hibernate or alt tab, which often cause trouble
09:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Okay. Now I understand. The config is of utmost importance, this is indeed a regression
09:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but we can't bring the window back with unmodified SDL
09:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have to patch SDL more to get it togglable
09:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Huuh? What needs to change in sdl?
09:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we shut-off sdl's input method handling before to stop the window capturing the input method state and goes into headless ime mode
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we shut-off sdl's input method handling before to stop the game window from capturing the input method state and goes into headless ime mode
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that was just a hack to let windows do it's normal IME things
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we can bring back the hack and make it togglable some how
09:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I'm pretty sure half of the users are experiencing flashing screen during IME inputs before. the current solution works for most people and just make it look ugly for 5% of the people who has a older dual GPUs and plays in windowed mode
09:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the older hack only works if they have an older style dual GPUs setup on laptops
09:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, my knowledge of the IME mess has grown hazy but I thought IMEs didn't even attempt to render if sdl text input wasn't active
09:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was active always
09:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> with the hack
09:36 < bridge> <Learath2> Wouldn't it work for everyone playing windowed or borderless? I thought the dual gpu thing was only for fullscreen to not flash
09:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> because sdl didn't tell windows to stop listening to text input
09:36 < bridge> <Learath2> And how did we stop it from triggering on, say movement keys?
09:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nothing
09:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> user turns off their IME
09:37 < bridge> <Learath2> And they liked that workflow better :confusion:
09:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think they just think it is ugly
09:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm 95% sure
09:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> on this one
09:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Ok does winapi provide a `GetCandidateWindowWaifu_Ex`?
09:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i would've gone that route in teeworlds 0.7 if i could
09:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Or we can commission Voxel to draw us a ddnet waifu to put on our candidate window
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
09:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:  non-weeb would be furious
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can also draw waifus now
09:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean we could make the candidate window skinable
09:39 < bridge> <Learath2> It's easy to config gate 😄
09:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but is that what we REALLY need?
09:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'd happily take on the skin config development if we really need that
09:40 < bridge> <Learath2> Idk, I would also be furious if you took away my waifu and cute rabbit thing
09:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at least a horizontal mode would be nice, since windows does not report that, we could just make it a skinning feature
09:41 < bridge> <Learath2> If possible please poll around a bit, make sure the issue is indeed only a looks issue. Then we can focus in on a fix to make the 5% happy-ish-er
09:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> are we sure we know they know what they want tho
09:42 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean they should have an idea why they don't like it, no? People who genuinely only hate the looks will usually just say so
09:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they say they don't like the look and want their own ime window back
09:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the four people complaining are pretty clear about that
09:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> some do they they forgot how to type with a different looking candidate window
09:45 < bridge> <Learath2> Okay so wait, don't we now toggle the sdl input mode properly? Why isn't their IME triggering? How are we blocking that?
09:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this was one of them, but i think the feature parity is there. they're just not familiar with the interafce
09:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sdl tell windows to use headless ime mode
09:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Is that hardcoded in SDL?
09:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think so
09:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> let me pull out sdl code
09:47 < bridge> <Learath2> Wait is it SDL providing us the candidates?
09:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes
09:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well no
09:47 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah cute, this wasn't a thing back when I last checked
09:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but we are getting the window message through SDL
09:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> iirc
09:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's been a while
09:48 < bridge> <Learath2> I can't imagine a lot of games draw their own IME, maybe there is a way to make sdl not do that?
09:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there was a candidate window thing in SDL that is just empty. but i think we are getting WM_MSG or something using SDL's event
09:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a lot of games don't care about IME
09:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the ones that care (i.e. source engine) draws their own
09:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unity does not do anything with candidate, fullscreen = no candidates
09:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm pretty sure I've done the research when I was working on it years ago. :kek:
09:51 < bridge> <Learath2> Eh. Just take a quick look, see if you can either override sdl asking for headless mode (maybe by a call to winapi on our side) or better tell sdl not to do that. If neither looks feasible I guess people will have to live without their waifu for a sec
09:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm doing that
09:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at work
09:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> with my boss looking at me
09:52 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe could be worth asking the players that complain that if a horizontal mode would help
09:52 < bridge> <Learath2> This is capital theft. Please stop it
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think sdl recently changed it so candidates are send
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's why we updated sdl
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I should try out kde ime again. But as always in Linux. I can use it in Fullscreen without problems
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So it's not needed there xd
09:54 < bridge> <Learath2> I bet they don't support linux properly anyway
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> SDL was mainly build with Linux in mind
09:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a5332f0b1177406610c819636850525549186d60/src/engine/client/input.cpp#LL789C28-L789C30
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's sponsored by valve xd
09:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we are grabbing windows event
09:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah but none of the linux imes expose their candidates ever
09:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think linux IMEs are just a bunch of different user space programs doing hacks
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh ok, sucks
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> True😂
09:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there's no way we could know what the IME is doing
09:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah so sdl basically just added that headless mode thing and allowed wm events to passthrough?
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I always used the smiley ime popup window xd
09:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they didn't add it, it was there since SDL2
09:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we removed it in our custom SDL before
09:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they did also tell windows when to stop activating text input / ime so that's good. but we did also removed that before
09:58 < bridge> <Learath2> That is not how I remember that piece of code at all, but if we are being honest I spent more time on the macOS part of that code anyway so maybe I just missed it
09:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Ok so we only need the new sdl for passthrough wm events?
09:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> macOS can draw candidate window on top of fullscreen application tho
09:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i actually don't know what we're needed for the new SDL. robyt3 knows more about that. it was always working in teeworlds, so I didn't know if they are using a newer SDL
10:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think candidate was working fine in macos. MacOS only needs a drawing position other than the StartInput and StopInput thing which we are providing through SDL.
10:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think candidate was working fine in macos. MacOS only needs a drawing position which we are providing through SDL, other than the StartInput and StopInput thing
10:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think candidate was working fine for teeworlds 0.7 in MacOS. MacOS only needs a drawing position which we are providing through SDL, other than the StartInput and StopInput thing
10:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sorry IRC
10:02 < bridge> <Learath2> macOS had a massive issue with sdl not allowing access to the underlying fake textinput container they create to trigger the candidate window
10:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> SDL version-specific issues      2.26.5, 2.24.2, 2.0.22: IME candidates work. But there are minor bugs when moving the composition cursor.     2.0.18, 2.0.20: IME candidates work.     2.0.16 (our current version): IME candidates cannot be determined with Windows API. Windows tries to draw the composition window like before, so this does not work in fullscreen mode.     2.0.8 (upstream 0.7): IME candidates work. But this SDL
10:02 < ws-client> version is too old for us.
10:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> from #6530
10:02 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6
10:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chillerdragon: ^ fix bot
10:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bad bot
10:03 < bridge> <Learath2> The textediting events you got refered to nonsense offsets for the small PressAndHoldIME
10:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:04 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess the question is what 2.0.16 was doing
10:04 < bridge> <Learath2> Though I wonder if robyt was referring to our patched version of 2.0.16
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i mean whats the problem, lets just use the current SDL version
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> what would it help to downgrade again
10:06 < bridge> <Learath2> 2 concerns
10:06 < bridge> <Learath2> 1) weren't some people complaining of input lag?
10:06 < bridge> <Learath2> 2) we took away peoples waifus
10:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 1.) is bcs of mouseold
10:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> we should simply remove it
10:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 2.) we can still make it config
10:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Damn mouseold...
10:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> how does old version help here
10:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I was about to say that TODO comment looks wacky
10:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111566236241903626/image.png
10:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah, damn it
10:07 < bridge> <Learath2> 2) Seems something changed after 2.0.16 which makes windows no longer trigger normal imes idk
10:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but we do that on purpose dont we?
10:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> we probably dont set the input rect
10:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh wait, is it possible robyt3 is unaware of our hacked IME patch
10:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so he just thought it was broken in our current version
10:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @Robyt3 ?
10:08 < bridge> <Learath2> It is indeed possible
10:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> enlighten us
10:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> because we did turn off all IME stuff in our custom SDL just to make IME show up in windowed mode
10:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that would be my fault
10:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, did you manage to check? Does sdl unconditionally enable the headless thing?
10:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
10:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still trying to find the code
10:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i just dont understand why SDL prevents it, if they clearly have an API function to tell where to render the candidate list
10:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was for multi-platform, macos need it
10:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Note: If you want to use the system native IME window, try setting hint SDL_HINT_IME_SHOW_UI to 1, otherwise this function won't give you any feedback.
10:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also they might have did the windows one before they decided to grab candidate themselves
10:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its all only for macos? xd
10:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_SetTextInputRect
10:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> we have so many #ifdef WINDOWS.. why do we even use SDL in first place :joy:
10:12 < bridge> <Learath2> That hint sounds about what we want, but idk if they wired it up properly
10:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> found it https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/d4bc393efebdd45a95430397df106b69b1c26df3/src/video/windows/SDL_windowskeyboard.c#LL412C9-L412C31
10:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> `return SDL_GetHintBoolean(SDL_HINT_IME_SHOW_UI, SDL_FALSE);`
10:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok so it is a SDL_HINT
10:17 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess we can add a config for it if it does what we want
10:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it would probably require a restart after the config change
10:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it might be possible
10:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I heard many people say that. did anyone make a benchmark of how long common things take?
10:19 < bridge> <Learath2> It's an ancient meme at this point. It's probably a couple microseconds faster on everything but this isn't the early 2000s anymore
10:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe you can get it up to a couple millis if you are brave enough to enable systemwide O3 and LTO
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But a couple of microseconds that add up to each ither
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I once read around 5-10% more perf can be expected
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sometimes also degrations
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean fedora enabled system wide lto
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And opt out when pkgs broke
10:21 < bridge> <Learath2> From systemwide o3 and lto?
10:22 < bridge> <Learath2> Or just one or the other?
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can't remember, but smrh with cpu native etc march native
10:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the kernel also has a option to enable zen3 optimizations
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But can't be hard to find benchmark. But do u know Intel clear Linux?
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's basically that
10:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ryzen
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And it often is a bit faster

10:28 < bridge> <Robyt3> I wasn't aware of this, but I think I downloaded all 2.0.18 directly from github, so it should be without our own changes, unless they were also in upstream SDL
10:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Mh, I can only theorize, we can maybe test. But I imagine every single tool is a couple millis or micros faster for all tasks
10:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i mean if benchmarks are faster, then tools are too xdd. except its heavily IO dependent or smth
10:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ok u could measure the startup time of the tools, but lto is probably unbeatable here too, esp if u static link as much as possible
10:32 < ws-client> <chiller@work> fyi: jupsti im quickly restarting the backend
10:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > i mean if benchmarks are faster, then tools are too xdd. except its heavily IO dependent or smth
10:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only if you assume that the distros ship everything the same except for the compilation flags
10:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps gentoo is disabling the systemd integration of cat, which makes things go slower for whatever reason 😄
10:34 < ws-client> <chiller@work> .
10:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/25/new-playground--memory-spy/
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah well that's true ^^
10:34 < bridge> <Learath2> systemd-catd
10:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @deen did you try the IP selection thing for cn or did it fixed itself
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mention systemd, summon Learath
10:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean there **is** systemd-cat
10:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it's doing something that you're probably not unhappy about ^^
10:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Please tell me it's not replacing coreutils cat
10:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
10:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm thinking if we could build-in a IP tester in engine, could it also fix clients not be able to get serverlist without we having to setup a hk serverlist without CDN
10:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not doing anything related to coreutils `cat`
10:36 < ws-client> <chiller@work> jupsti how are you always online? dont you have a job or something?
10:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's a IP tester?
10:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's an IP tester?
10:36 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chiller i could ask the same about you
10:36 < ws-client> <chiller@work> :justatest:
10:36 < ws-client> <chiller@work> i am at work rn ._.
10:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Randomly testing different cloudflare ips and force curl to use that instead of rely on DNS
10:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> In china
10:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Randomly testing different cloudflare ips and force curl to use one in good condition instead of rely on DNS
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
10:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> DNS can not tell whether china is corporating but we might be able to test it ourselves
10:38 < bridge> <Learath2> I would be surprised if everyone isn't shipping the exact same e.g. coreutils barring maybe a version difference
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> our current setup isn't bad for that either, no?
10:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think everyone is shipping it in the same configuration
10:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Occasionally some one has to wait for half and hour before they can grab a serverlist when the list server is down
10:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> And there were some map downloading issues
10:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because we can't keep up our serverlist server?
10:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Occasionally some one has to wait for half and hour before they can grab a serverlist when the hk list server is down
10:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think maps are downloaded from somewhere else in china, no?
10:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because we can't keep our serverlist server up?
10:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes but I'm not sure if which way they were going with only screenshot reports
10:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Also might cut some cost for cn if cloudflare could just work better
10:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Just a thought tho, might be worth a experiment
10:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Btw occasionally = roughly one per week
10:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why is the list server down so often? 😮
10:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> One report per week
10:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
10:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> The server was ddosed twice for the last month i think
10:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is there something like object storage in china?
10:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Yes map were using it
10:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you link it (in DM if it's sensitive)?
10:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> But we couldn't use master2.ddnet.org for that
10:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why not? upload a servers.json every 5 seconds
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or is that too expensive?
10:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have to claim ddnet.org and register it with gov to bind cdn or obejct storage to a custom domain
10:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> If we can just use other domains then it should be fine
10:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, using other domains doesn't seem so trivial
10:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Ye i just don't think it looks good for ddnet tho
10:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Que someone exposing ddnet is phonehoming data to china
10:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> A target registered with chinese gov no less
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so in order to use master3.ddnet.org in china with a big CDN, we'd need to do some stuff we're not willing to do?
10:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
10:49 < bridge> <Learath2> If it's data premier Xi demands, data we'll send :peepoSalute:
10:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we could use teeworlds.cn however we want cuz we did registered it
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why not make master3 a CNAME then
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then u can use a domain
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how does CNAME interact with HTTPS?
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably still needs a certificate for the original domain
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ?
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which won't be possible in china with big CDNS
10:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Actually no idea
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just use same certificate for both
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can we upload our own certificate to the cloud vendor, @TsFreddie?
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this would solve the problem and we wouldn't even need a CNAME
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at what point does the CDN require you to have control of the domain in china?
10:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> let me check
10:52 < ws-client> <chiller@work> jupsti xxdddd my cheap work laptop attached to a 2560x1440 screen on gnome reaches the same fps as my 4090 desktop at home xd (400fps on average all maps)
10:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> blame nvidia for bad interaction with gnome, but also blame gnome
10:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> bcs in openbox it works :D
10:53 < ws-client> <chiller@work> good meme
10:53 < ws-client> <chiller@work> yes
10:53 < ws-client> <chiller@work> im so gonna switch away from gnome
10:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> epic gamer moment
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> zzz
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> try xfce
10:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> pls
10:56 < bridge> <Learath2> I feel a little uneasy trying to loop around the backs of the chinese govt
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> where do u have to do this
10:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Chiller use i3 or bspwm. Convert to the tiled wm religion
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @heinrich5991 are you planning on uploading to storage using master1 btw
10:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Lea: KDE also has tiling support :joy:
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or cdn a master2
10:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or either
10:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Fwiw I still think this just cache kinda approach to the master server is a bit lackluster except for a fallback. Servers in china won't be able to register through these fake masters
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cdn just doesn't want to use unregistered domain
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111579282796445756/image.png
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it doesn't matter what cert it uses
10:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but if u register a random one
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think if the final destination is tencent then they can just refuse to set it up
11:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh i get it
11:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye we probably can
11:02 < ws-client> <chiller@work> i think first ill try dwm
11:03 < ws-client> <chiller@work> omg my work internet is smooth af. And here i was unsure for months if my home net is laggy or if it is in my head
11:03 < ws-client> <chiller@work> my home setup is broken in every way while my work setup is perfect gaming moment
11:03 < ws-client> <chiller@work> i hate my life
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> dwm is a lot of setup iirc
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> moreso than i3
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i3 is good start
11:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111581005720064091/image.png
11:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> from gnome to dwm xd
11:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how can we try tho
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> what are u doing fred i missed it
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Create cert for master 3 and upload it there xd
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, interesting idea
11:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @heinrich5991 do you have a rough idea how many request we are getting per day
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
11:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let me check if cloudflare tells me something
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah right, can't, because my password manager locked me out
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😄
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we are looking at 0.2cny per 10k requests
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thats 0.026€ per 10k requests
11:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it is less than 100 per month i can just eat it
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie I'd guess they'll just refuse to serve requests that have a `Host: ` that wasn't registered
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so CNAME wouldn't really be an option
11:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they can, but i don't know if they would yet
11:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i guess they only want the cert to spy, dont they?
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well they probably would
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the cert is necessary to function as a CDN ^^
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cloudflare also has a cert
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for ddnet.org
11:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's 1000 online players all day averaging 6 requests per hour per player
11:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they can do what?
11:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they serve requests with a `Host: ` that wasn't registered in china like that?
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they can refuse
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> `Host:` header only has one domain right?
11:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar> mh who is the CA here btw? Let's encrypt or the chinese gov? i dunno how internet works in china xd
11:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `Host: master3.ddnet.org` will be how it looks like
11:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with CNAME e.g.
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah, then that would just not work
11:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ok
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, for that to work we'd have to register ddnet.org with gov
11:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but why do they want the domain itself to be registered there?
11:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> what control do they get from this
11:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> master.teeworlds.cn can work, but i don't think adding it do ddnet client is a good idea either
11:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> plus we are terrible at managing our domains and services and stuff
11:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I suppose one could try making it work with HTTP redirects
11:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but then we'd have to make the client cache those for okayish performance
11:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @heinrich5991 and if we update the client to resolve CNAME so, that they send the request to the actual domain instead?
11:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so bascially resolve the first level only
11:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then we can also update the client to cache HTTP redirects
11:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the CNAME thing would open up the client to MITM
11:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because the CNAME comes from an unauthenticated DNS packet
11:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> dns over https
11:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but we'd force a dns server, thats probs also not nice
11:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ^^
11:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at that point we could also handle the HTTP redirect, and it'd be standards conformant ^^
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can u add domains afterwards xd. What happens if u let the domain run out and buy it outside of china
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As if they made sure all edge cases work xd
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can't add CDN without a domain?
11:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but do u buy the domain from them?
11:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> buy from them or transfer to them
11:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ah i see, so they are the gov?
11:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> might just be a technicality for them to enforce the law
11:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i c, then soz for my confusion xd
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> might just be a technicality for them to conform with the law
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't remember why I haven't set up a real server in china, perhaps I'll give it a shot again
11:35 < bridge> <Learath2> I thought the masterserver just wasn't ready to be multihomed
11:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Codewise that is
11:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thought so too, maybe that's why I didn't
11:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but all the parts are there
11:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thought so too a while ago, maybe that's why I didn't
11:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the thing outputs its state
11:36 < ws-client> <Jupstar> btw just out of interest, does steam allow package different software based on the geolocation? :D
11:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Jupeyy_Keks we could just have a boolean flag inside the client that runs different code based on geolocation
11:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah, i was just thinking about hosting a custom master server cfg xD, but just hypthetically
11:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> not actually
11:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can transmit the state using https://github.com/heinrich5991/twmaster-collect
11:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the other mastersrv is able to read the state and merge it with its own
11:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's maybe a bit bare-bones, but it should™ work
11:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Merge is the part I thought didn't exist
11:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it exists because the merge is also how the backcompat is handled
11:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the backcompat is pretending to be another mastersrv
11:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Servers register on one master only, righr?
11:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
11:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Right*
11:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> china might have problem connecting with master1 if it is needed in the past-future
11:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not sure how it works right now
11:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can't parse that sentence 😄 I was talking about making master2.ddnet.org a real masterserver
11:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that reminds me, we maybe also wanted to do secret mastersrvs 🥷
11:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think i was worrying about communication between master servers so I just provided a hk one
11:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm not sure if we need inter master server communication tho
11:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I assumed
11:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we need it
11:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it currently works, right?
11:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh i misread that
11:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i thought you mean you don't remember you didn't set up a china one
11:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> didn't realize by the china master you just mean the current hk one
11:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah yea
11:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> can I grab a group of player and do a cloudflare tester test with them if we can improve master1 connection without the hk one
11:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hk server keep raising prices
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when we first bought it it was around 60cny/month. and we did two data cap upgraded not it is 100/month. the next upgrade if we ever need it would go straight to 300 now
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when we first bought it it was around 60cny/month. and we did two data cap upgrade now it is 100/month. the next upgrade if we ever need it would go straight to 300 now
12:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you want to get rid of the hk server
12:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can foreigners buy a server there?
12:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not
12:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we had this conversation about buying servers and deen sending me money a few times already lol
12:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean yea, we can try this
12:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't really like it, but it doesn't hurt to run an experiment
12:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it feels like we're trying to start an arm's race with the chinese censors
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is a quite a common thing to do in china
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it is weird to built it in the client
12:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> singapore is probably not as reachable as hongkong?
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I can make a side project and release it as tsfreddie tho.
12:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sure, no problem with that
12:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although that would only reach people that are in the community
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when I try to buy a server @ https://www.vpshosting.com.hk/, I get to the point where I can enter my payment info
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so maybe foreigners can actually order servers in hongkong?
12:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh you definitely can
12:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but they would almost certainly blocked in china
12:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how does that happen? because I don't buy at one of the providers that aren't blocked? or because the provider tells china that a foreigner bought it
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz people just buy them for proxy
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i only buy hk servers from tencent
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> as a chinese company they would at least make sure they track their users and ban anyone trying to setting up proxies so they can keep their IP range unblocked. and maybe they had deals with gov, i don't exactly know
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just know the tencent ones work (to a certain degree), and you can't buy hk servers that are targeted to chinese customers as a foreigner
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> from tencent
12:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> again, i thought we had this conversation before
12:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably, I'm just forgetful 😦
12:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry about that
12:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's fine. the point is i think hk jp and sg VPSs have a higher chance of being straight up blocked because way too many people buy them for proxies
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it is not blocked, then it is probably bad for proxies. if it is bad for proxies, then it is probably bad for masters too
12:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Can we really not send you the money for it in any way?
12:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can send them to my uk bank account
12:19 < bridge> <Learath2> I thought china would be all for foreign currency getting into their economy 😄
12:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I can't use them
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can swift transfer globally to china, but I don't think the fee is worth the effort
12:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how much is the fee?
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> plus it would eat up my foreign currency allowence
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> make it harder for me to sell stuff oversea
12:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah 😦
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How complicated can they make it bro xD
12:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes, we have foreign currency cap for personals
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> are you working for a small firm?
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> are you working for a small company?
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can't u take donations from the Chinese community?
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cryptocurrencies probably banned in china?
12:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i can
12:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i thought about it
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> crypto just got unbanned again in china for the 90th time
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can we buy CNY and send them your way without foreign currency cap?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So legal ways are banned. But non controllable grey zone currencies are ok for China ?
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> crypto gets banned every 2 weeks in china
12:25 < bridge> <Learath2> It's not a horrible idea, it should be fine as long as it's @TsFreddie that controls the account and we get to log the donations like we log the ones we collect outside china
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just use steam gift cards xd
12:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie https://wise.com/us/send-money/send-money-to-china
12:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this doesn't work?
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have a wise account. It doesn't have withdrawal
12:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Lol wat? Wise account without withdrawal?
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Is there cash in china? or only digital currencys allowed? Could one send you an evelope with euros or is that useless?
12:28 < bridge> <Learath2> I actually know a way to make this happen. It's how people in turkey sent money to their relatives abroad for decades when there was currency control in place
12:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have a Payoneer account that has withdrawal but it only takes business payments like google, unity and steam
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> steam xd
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> told you
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Oh you can indeed send me steam gift cards
12:29 < bridge> <Learath2> We just need someone chinese outside china with relatives still in china. We pay them, their relatives pay you
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I can resell skins to turn them into cny
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok its confirmed tsfreddie is scammer
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is asking for steam gift cards xd
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> But that's literally money laundering i think
12:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Worst case you get sent to some reform camp and we never hear from you again, is that not worth the master servers being up?
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dark lerato
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo fred is there cash now or not?
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and which cash currencys are functional
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how does that work?
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you have physical cash?
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why does the chinese expat help?
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im just curious
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> You pay them usd, they wechat me cny
12:31 < bridge> <Learath2> They either charge a commission or they do it out of the kindness of their hearts
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Private currency exchange
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Ye
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use CSGO skins
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's a relative or friend thing
12:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I would never ask anyone to do it for me cuz it is a huge scam market
12:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also have a payoneer account. how can I try sending money to you?
12:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah god damn it, password manager 😦
12:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Back in the days of strict currency control in turkey there used to be lots of people who did this semi-professionally, they worked on a referral basis
12:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 👀 I can happily to spend 1000 per month for ddnet no problems tho, but it would still be nice to manage the cost
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :dollar:
12:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd also be nice to have a way to fund the china side tbh
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm idk discord emote names .-.
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Is the chinese community not donating?
12:34 < bridge> <Avolicious> In order to reduce transaction fee's I would also send the money to you for the CHN transaction
12:34 < bridge> <Learath2> Fwiw the best way would be if they collected donations in china in CNY directly
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it would also be nice if chinese players can fund the game too
12:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i need to work out a way to manage the fund without over taking
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can lend you my financial advisor he is good at fund managing
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "without overtaking"? wdym?
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> "taking more donation than needed to maintain server"
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> without that^
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't even know how much we spend for servers yet
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also multiple people are donating servers
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just close donations if too much money comes in and then keep them for furture server costs
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> need to make sure everyone's on the same page
12:37 < bridge> <Learath2> This is what we do if previous years are all covered
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i see
12:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @deen said he's fine with a chn funding source before while we were trying to find a way to send money to me, if every admin agrees to open a chn funding source. I can grab our server owners together and talk
12:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although I'm pretty sure Tom want's nothing to do with it, he expressed against it before
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @T.Charlie never said anything about it before.
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have to ask the rest
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wow i just found this gem!
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > This required adding a finish tile using gdb on the already running servers, so that players could finish in the middle of the map already. Thanks to heinrich5991 for helping out with this.
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://ddnet.org/news/advent-of-ddnet-2022-recap/
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that sounds amazing! Can we get a blog post for that? @heinrich5991
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, that was a fun
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> How did you manage to figure something like that out so fast?
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> during a players run!?
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy shit
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> advanced teeworlds CTF
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> well, you need to get a reference to the map data somehow
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> figure out the coordinates
12:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and set the tile to a finish tile
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> insane
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> please please do a writeup on this
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is amazing
12:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> having dinner, later
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> timezone moment
12:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its hilarious that sending money to someone in china is so hard
12:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's not if you are sending tuitions or yearly spending
12:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~Too bad the server are so cheap~~
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> tbh swift transfer probably isn't so bad. I might be able to sell stuff in the future by setting up a company so it wouldn't matter if I'm receiving too many foreign currencies
13:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Let me double check swift fees tho
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Ah it varies from banks to banks
13:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm paying 12.5€
13:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> My bank deduct 150cny per transaction for recieving
13:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> So it's like 2.5% for a 1k euro transaction
13:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so another 25€
13:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so we'd be at ~40€ for a 1000€ transaction
13:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not too bad for something thought to be impossible
13:19 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> In Skrill, once you have enough Skrill points, you'll get a premium service, which lets you send money to another Skrill account without fees
13:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I also looked up afdian
13:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Skrill doesn't have cny withdrawal either
13:20 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> if the sent account has that service, only then
13:20 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> it has 3 tiers
13:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> A Chinese donation site. They have webhook you can subscribe to to know how much is going through us if you guys want to take cny donations too.
13:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> And we can do a substraction <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
13:22 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ok, I looked at my services on Skrill, it has no monthly fees, but has fees for sending money to another bank, especially if it's not a Skrill account. If it's a Skrill account, then the fee is 1.45% and for higher tears, it's free
13:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> from Skrill account to Bank account, it's free, from Bank account to Skrill is dependent on Bank account fees
13:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> from Skrill account to Skrill account is 1.45% for sender if they are first tier
13:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> above first tier is free
13:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what do you do to have a premium skrill account lol
13:25 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think buying stuff or sending money (or crypto :pepedead: ) will get you points
13:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh i thought you have one
13:25 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> So for example if that money (from ddnet funds) will go to servers, they'll reward you for spending that money
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well i can't pay for servers with skrill tho
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
13:26 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> It has a virtual debit card
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they only accept local bank transfer and wechat
13:26 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> It has a virtual credit card
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think chinese business take visa
13:27 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> well what do you expect? It's from Paysafe
13:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye they don't
13:27 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> unless there is like a chinese Skrill, you cannot do it without fees
13:28 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> but the fee is actually surprisingly low, from what fees you guys have
13:29 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Maybe a chinese Paysafe?
13:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's not a thing i think
13:30 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
13:30 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I don't know what services we could have, that the eastern countries also have
13:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just a chinese thing where they controls the economy and market so much
13:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's probably fine spending money between europe and japan however you want
13:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's probably fine sending money between europe and japan however you want
13:32 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> makes sense
13:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> don't quote me on that tho, i don't live in japan so i don't actually know. i'm just imagining so
13:33 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I don't think we have a Japanese person in this community that could help in this case
13:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have a korean guy tho
13:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> not close enough
13:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean, probably equally valuable, if we are talking how strict china is
13:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> well fee's a fee
13:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye I know that, but there must be a easier way to spend money to other eastern countries than china.
13:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @cheeser0613 can you receive euros in malaysia 👀
13:36 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I expect that there is no easier way
13:36 < bridge> <cheeser0613> no
13:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is there a malaysia paypal
13:36 < bridge> <cheeser0613> yes but no one use
13:36 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> that's a start
13:36 < bridge> <cheeser0613> Most of them dont even know what tf is that
13:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so you can't pay anything using it
13:37 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think he could, but related to the internet, and not real world activities
13:37 < bridge> <cheeser0613> What topic
13:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> money
13:37 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> paying servers
13:37 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think
13:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really relevant to you tho. i'm just curious
13:43 < bridge> <cheeser0613> just checking, do you mean if someone pay something with euro cash, does the man accept or not?
13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm asking if people can send you money from europe
13:44 < bridge> <cheeser0613> by bank, yes
13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye but other than just global bank transfer
13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
13:44 < bridge> <cheeser0613> paypal
13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> can you withdraw on paypal
13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like take money out of paypal and put it on your bank account
13:45 < bridge> <cheeser0613> yes
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then it is already better than china
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> eh
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u have to be careful
13:45 < bridge> <cheeser0613> :kek:
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> witrh paypal withdrawals
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if its too much, u look sus cuz u are not declaring it
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> unless u declare it
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, but at least he can.
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> where is he from
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> malaysia
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i chuckled at euro cash
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> first time i hear it
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> china paypal doesn't have a withdraw function
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 💶 💶 💶
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we do have a paypal tho
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 💶  > 💵
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and most business don't take chinese paypal
13:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's literally useless
13:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know why paypal still bother to exists in china
13:47 < bridge> <cheeser0613> alipay.exe
13:48 < bridge> <cheeser0613> fun fact, some store in malaysia accept alipay
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> some store in japan takes alipay as well i've heard

15:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> tater dev :poggers2:
15:53 < bridge> <Ewan> He was picking up the slack while tater was gone ig
15:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i have plans to re-do the whole thing based on tater's tater version
15:54 < bridge> <Ewan> now that i am a bit more intimate with the ddnet codebase
15:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have something I want to do in ddnet as well, but not until we improve our workflow at work so I don't have to work 13 hours per day
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say u should work 3 hours for ddnet
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then sleep
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then repeat that
15:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the project management goes to hell at work because we don't really have a project manager
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who needs a life
15:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually

16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is clearly a problem when everyone (to be fair it's just a team of three) is so busy to the point we can not pull 10 minutes to make sure we are still on the same page is clearly problematic
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what even is that sentence lol
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it's clearly a problem when it's clearly problematic
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> -freddy 2023
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> freddie*
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> you are freddy like the benson
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> benson is dead
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> this is clearly problematic
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> where even is that server, did nibs just gone
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah dude
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> he nuked it
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thought so
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111656711632212109/image.png
16:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh lmao he literally went gone
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> awol
16:08 < bridge> <Ewan> they say mossad has killed him already
16:08 < bridge> <Ewan> nah he's actually alive i still talk to him sometimes but there is a bemani CN shaped hole in my heart
16:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there were still a bcn telegram group
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bcn?
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> barcelona?
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, it's a secret code for an agency me and ewan worked for
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
16:11 < bridge> <gerdoe> what happened lol
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> must have:
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65991
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is so much stuff experimental ;~;
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u always find the weird stuff
16:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it does hurt my head when I know ewans' from my other online presents and shows up in ddnet like a veteran players and I don't even know if I should ask if we know each other
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (i havent looked at the issue yet)
16:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it does hurt my head when I know ewans' from my other online presences and shows up in ddnet like a veteran players and I don't even know if I should ask if we know each other
16:13 < bridge> <Learath2> :pepeW: we can do discord parties
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> weird
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its useful
16:14 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes very weird
16:14 < bridge> <Ewan> But the game is fun
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's fine, i'll wait for you coming here to have a chinese barbeque sit out
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> alternatively rust should allow
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bla: &mut dyn Trait1 + Trait2,
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lets party
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs that sucks too xD
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in genericore 3
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fun enough for you to do client dev apparently
16:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I like to developing the client
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> only client?
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like to develop ddnet
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also its kind of nice to leave your mark
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz i know ddnet itself will last
16:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> learn server dev and help twcn revive the pvp servers
16:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
16:15 < bridge> <Ewan> nooooo
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like pvp so
16:15 < bridge> <Ewan> protocol looks horrific
16:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i was going to put some work into the unique games
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk tw server
16:16 < bridge> <Learath2> Protocol is excellent wym
16:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> protocol is fine, you barely need to touch it
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i hear you are packing raw structs into packet data
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but i hav enver seen it
16:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~cuz you literally can't not touch it normally for compatibility reasons~~
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
16:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> checkout https://github.com/teeworldscn/ddnet-pvp tho
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't have any idea what i would do to add to the game other than client side enhancements tho
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i will check it out
16:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the project is dead but the spirit is still there
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> This is neat
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> how do the weapons work
16:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in teeworlds?
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> In this
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet based pvp
16:19 < bridge> <Ewan> are they ddrace weapons or vanilla
16:19 < bridge> <Ewan> or is it broader than that
16:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i abstracted a weapon class
16:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can do whatever you want
16:19 < bridge> <Ewan> excellent
16:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I haven't remade ddnet's weapon back into my abstracted weapon class tho
16:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it doesn't seem useful at this early stage anyway
16:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the codebase works, but the serverlist registering process is old, so it breaks quite easily it seems
16:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I made it so you can code a gamemode class without having to modify anything else
16:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's the goal at least
16:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/ddnet-pvp/blob/master/src/game/server/gamemodes/catch.cpp
16:21 < bridge> <Ewan> Have you implemented any gamemodes
16:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ^ this one
16:22 < bridge> <Ewan> catch i c
16:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, i just thought if a classic mode works it's a good start
16:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:23 < bridge> <Learath2> The patch for this is rather small and compact iirc, heinrich kept it very clean
16:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i know but i haven't even read it
16:24 < bridge> <Learath2> It is time I learn about lorentz force, cya’ll
16:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> good luck
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i would love to see modern pvp
16:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how modern
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> it's all old gamemodes and old servers
16:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or modern how
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> feature wise
16:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> not like entirely new modes
16:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> people just plays fng and infc
16:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yea it stinks
16:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean, do you have ideas
16:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or do you just want new stuff but don't know what new stuff <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
16:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it would just be updating old gamemodes to support newer ddnet features
16:27 < bridge> <Ewan> the ones so old they don't support /pause and whatever
16:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it gets annoying playing on such servers
16:28 < bridge> <Ewan> and some gamemodes are not predicted properly by the client
16:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why do you need /pause in pvp servers
16:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh there aren't many things we can do for prediction
16:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unless we can send character code to clients and run them, but that sounds like a bad idea
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> client would have to be updated
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not realistic
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for that it'd be more reasonable to make a teeworlds rip-off than teeworlds mod tho
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont have ideas
16:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
16:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you have one we can make that happen
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet amogus
16:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yea something like that
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's definitely possible tho, you just need to make minigames into different region of maps
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the field of view thing might be hard
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but you don't necessarily need one if the map is designed around it
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym fov
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wall occlusion and shadows thing
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i am surprised that at this point ddnet doesn't support moving tiles
16:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> kog does
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> kog has this weird half-assed moving tile stuff
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> but it doesn't work in entities
16:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean proper moving tiles
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> or really any sort of dynamic tiles
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's be tough without a protocol overhaul
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we are still supporting old teeworlds clients i believe?
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not sure
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate run guy 25
16:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the good old run guy 25
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i save and quit
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> my patience has been tested
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> now i go to race
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think i've finished that map
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that I play ddnet that much anyway
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> ur ign is TsFreddie or what
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i played that map in 2015 when we first got chn ddnet serversi think?
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> wow
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually maybe even before that
16:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I stopped playing ddnet at 700 or so points
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> when i play the game now i have such a short fuse
16:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> now i have 900
16:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> teecity
16:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i just stop caring and leave the game
16:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/teecity
16:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> need to continue it
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i am 1850 something
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> not too many points
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> lol ryozuki what is it
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i can’t glean much from the readme
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>  i think people who are really good have someone to consistently play with
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is a teeworld MeTaVeRsE?
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> u don’t? i do i just am impatient
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a 5 hour save in barren I haven’t touched in a week
16:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh i don't
16:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just play with dummies cuz i don't like wasting other people's time
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> dang
16:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i have ADHD, i get bored in 5 minutes and want to quit
16:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and I can't just quit if i'm playing with real people
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> it took willpower not to quit earlier
16:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> same reason i don't like CSGO and DOTA or any game that requires a team
16:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fng are fine cuz i can leave and no one cares
16:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and rhythm games are great cuz i can just open it and be bored after one song and it is fine
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> fng i like to play sometimes but it’s hard to have fun when no-lifers are on it 24/7
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> and are toxic
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have to really enjoy an RPG to be able to hyperfocus on the game
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I play solofng
16:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> which i accidentally made popular in china and now that's all they plays
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> oh wow
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i host solofng server for unique among others
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> still never olayed it
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> if i want to play fng with lasers i go to the noby servers because they are stable and good and modern and whatever
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but i wish they said all ur base are belong to us
16:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> until you get banned for no reason
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
16:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bcs of the weird anticheat
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> I had that one time
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i was playing pretty good
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> killed@my vibe
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> killed my vibe
16:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> asian people are so good now that some people just can't play on noby servers
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
16:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know why higher level players enjoy short mouse distance and high sens
16:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but noby's server really doesn't like that
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s funny because USA players will think they’re good at something but the sheer difference in people that play the game between places like europe and china is too big
16:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are just not enough mouse sample points to tell anything
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> there are always better players
16:47 < bridge> <Ewan> dang
16:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the server just see they snaps everywhere, and bans them
16:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think 100 md is problematic. I have switched to 200 and I have yet to be banned :)
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> fbg lobby in usa is dead recently
16:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i told them to increase their md
16:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they don't want to
16:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> block was dead for a while but it’s back again ish
16:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe they're bots :banhammer:
16:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe
16:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i know two of them aren't for sure
16:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you american or canadian
16:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or neither :kek:
16:50 < bridge> <Ewan> usa
16:50 < bridge> <Ewan> erm acthually canadian is still american because it’s in north america 🤓
16:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> ye, tell that to citizens of the all powerful usa
16:50 < bridge> <Ewan> murica
16:51 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Please stick to development relevant topics =)
16:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> right
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> hell nah that just happened 😭
16:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i mean, we were just talking about mods 5 minutes ago
16:52 < bridge> <Ewan> I sense a disturbance in the pointless bureaucracy….. must… interrupt… perfectly chill conversation…
16:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> anyway, i'd love to see new gamemodes with ddnet-pvp
16:53 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Lol i just saw you guys having a dialog and the last messages were about usa, didnt know you just switched, dont feel offended just keep on
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> any variations on the weapon behavior would be nice
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> only mods i've seen do that are monster and teesmash
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well infc has different weapons
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> oh does it
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> never played it
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> infection with classes
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> infc
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> oh actually
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i tried it one time
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> and it was fun but the others were not vibing
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i was laying down mines though it was fun
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't like the chaos
16:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i like something that's a little bit more technical
16:55 < bridge> <Ewan> we were playing on an EU or CHN where the ping really gets you... can't remember which
16:55 < bridge> <Ewan> that made it bad
16:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~but not so technical that I lose everytime i play it~~
16:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish boomfng was popular
16:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably CHN since the infc community is huge here
16:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it was probably china
16:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> people don't like boomfng bcs it was too spammy
16:56 < bridge> <Ewan> sad
16:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i really like rocket movement
16:56 < bridge> <Ewan> fred we should play rn
16:56 < bridge> <Ewan> something
16:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> emm
16:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sure
16:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i will play on chn servers idc
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i used to think playing well on high ping was a myth but some guys do it really well on USA
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> novashock and rage from south africa
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> and savage from chile(?)
16:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what do you want to play tho
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> moderates?
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> or a pvp
16:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i will play whatever
16:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't have ethernet cable plugged in
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
16:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it'd be tough on wifi
16:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:58 < bridge> <Ewan> if u don't want to that's fine. another time
16:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the router is too far away, and i keep forget to route it
16:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet is the only game that really needs a ethernet cable tho
16:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i was trying to route some ethernet recently but i was sorely disappointed when i found out that my cat5 is stapled to the studs of the wall
16:58 < bridge> <Ewan> so i couldn't use it to fish more through
16:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't really matter though i was just trying to get a second line to my room because i wanted to put some stuff in the closet without running it all the way across the room
16:59 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111670035816132718/image.png
16:59 < bridge> <Ewan> this is what i have to work with rn
16:59 < bridge> <Ewan> half of these people afk
17:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @Ewan Green try find TsFreddi
17:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no e
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not this map
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> horrible map
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and angell from china
17:48 < bridge> <Voxel> ✝️ ‼️
18:07 < bridge> <Vinson> hi
18:07 < bridge> <Vinson> what's the anticheat of fng server
18:07 < bridge> <Vinson> i need it on my own server
18:07 < bridge> <Vinson> what's the anticheat of fng server
18:08 < bridge> <Vinson> i need it on my own teeworlds server
18:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It's closed source.
18:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a brainfuck interpreter works on the lang i made a compiler for, feels nice :sip:
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use of unstable library feature 'slice_as_chunks'
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see issue #74985 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74985> for more information
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> classic
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear once per day
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i hit at least one unstable feature xD
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its cuz ur on nightly
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so autocomplete knows about them
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but they are behind feature flag
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or idk
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use of unstable library feature 'iter_advance_by': recently added
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see issue #77404 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77404> for more information
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is smth stable bro
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u can use itertools for all this
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> many itertools get stabilized into std
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok then i'll use that xd
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah use it
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> itertools is amazing
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use itertools::Itertools;
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> let data = vec![1, 1, 2, -2, 6, 0, 3, 1];
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> //chunk size=3 |------->|-------->|--->|
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> // Note: The `&` is significant here, `IntoChunks` is iterable
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> // only by reference. You can also call `.into_iter()` explicitly.
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for chunk in &data.into_iter().chunks(3) {
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     // Check that the sum of each chunk is 4.
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     assert_eq!(4, chunk.sum());
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, doesnt implement what i need it seems
18:26 < bridge> <Voxel> i can *almost* know how that works
18:48 < bridge> <Patiga> you can work around `slice_as_chunks` quite well I think. you could use `slice::chunks` and .try_into().unwrap() the slices into the array. I assume the compiler is smart enough to see through that
18:48 < bridge> <Patiga> (ofc it is nice-to-have to get functions like this into std ^^)
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just did it the oldschool way by using indices and create a slice and copied manually xd
19:12 < bridge> <Chairn> maybe because the people developing drivers focus more on 3D ?
19:24 < bridge> <Learath2> That could be it yeah
19:25 < bridge> <Chairn> i can easily imagine a division by 0 when doing 2D and they didn't think it thoroughly
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why should 3d work better than 2d
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the graphics API generally only takes 3d
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is nothing like 2d
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rasterizer etc
19:26 < bridge> <Chairn> yeah, but for 2D, you set `z` to 0 which might trigger some edge case
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in 2d the z is used for whats on top right?
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then set it to 1
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u use a orthographic camera
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all coordinates are in normalized device coordinates
19:27 < bridge> <Chairn> tell that to gpu driver developer, not me
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> forgot name
19:27 < bridge> <Chairn> orthonormée in french
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean u can literally set it to 1 in the shaders
19:27 < bridge> <Chairn> orthonormal @Ryozuki
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ty
19:29 < bridge> <Chairn> ortho is for orthogonal, so perpendicular vectors
19:30 < bridge> <Chairn> normal means that each base vector has a unit length
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> @Ewan shebang should be in line 1 https://gist.github.com/ewancg/f51336b92f6d69d3becb7d552aee95b8#file-aur-sh-L12
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> Oops
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> nice script yay and paru are indeed bloat
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> rewrite all rust in bash
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> fixed
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and thanks
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> faster than robi
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> be careful now https://gist.github.com/ewancg/f51336b92f6d69d3becb7d552aee95b8#file-aur-sh-L100
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> u dont wanna reach more than 100 lines
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> otherwise bloat
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> the script is not airtight
19:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ChillerDragon you stole my friend
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i remember it having some issues but i don't remember what they are & i'm not on anymore to use it
19:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> fred? ewan?
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> wot frend
19:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye i was saying bye to ewan in game
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> oh 
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> i pingered him
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> thief
19:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> imagine getting notifications
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> if i close irc the world is silent
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> discord is full of distractions
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> always on 
19:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean if i close discord it doesn't ping either
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> fakin gen Z
19:44 < bridge> <Voxel> im always on do not disturb so lol
19:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> does your irc have mention sound tho
19:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ChillerDragon
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> back in the days i would go to ma frints house and ask if steve can come out an play
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> mom would stay gtfo steve has to do homework
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> and then i go home
19:45 < bridge> <Voxel> dude ddnet reference
19:45 < bridge> <Voxel> back in the days
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> boo
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> no fakin discord dms all day always on
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i mean i only get pings on discord for pings and a single digit number of channels that are important to me
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> equivalent to getting a text or email
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> which i also get sounds for
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie i have no sounds for sure i run a terminal client over ssh it doesnt even do the beep sound
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i mean i only get pings on discord for @ pings and a single digit number of channels that are important to me
19:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685123168.png
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> the broidge bg is as highlight as it gets
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> dang
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> its very calming
19:46 < bridge> <Voxel> do you even listen to music
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> I’m not a tui diehard though I understand why some are
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> yes @Voxel a lot
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> did u fix audio btw?
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> no
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i forgot
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> i ordered new sound system xd
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder what else we can try
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> oh good
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> is it usb
19:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do you use brow.sh
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> idk
19:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> instead of a browser
19:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> its only one speaker so it cant go wrong xd
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> is that a real thing freddy?
19:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i believe so?
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> no way you went from 5.1 surround sound to mono just cuz of a small difficulty lol
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> there are other tui browsers
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> there is one insane tui browser
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> which is 1:1 real browser
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> its nuts
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> lynx and stuff
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> nono
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> and another I can not remember the name of
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> i mean full 100% css support etc
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> oh wow
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> yes
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s cool
19:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think browsh has css support
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> its just chromium
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> with diff render engine
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah wow they already have keyboard selection and everything there for accessibility anyway
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> never thought about it
19:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's probably just browsh but i remember it being firefox
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> idk browsh also dont find it
19:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't remember tho
19:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's literally https://brow.sh
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> how does it perform chiller? is the rendering all software or do they just render to tui after fb composed
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> ah yea like that
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> i meant carbonyl tho
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> i thought brow.sh is written in bash
19:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not
19:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye it has a firefox dependency
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice ``ssh brow.sh``
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> down but amazing he used to offer that
19:51 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> So, today's painful session:
19:51 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> - Make variable data (5 exactly) for 256 entities, making it 1000+ lines of pure variables, because I cannot use classes for the task I want.
19:51 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> - I have to load all 256 variables into their respective Array positions :YEP: 🔫

19:51 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I love godot
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> ``ssh sshtron.zachlatta.com ``
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> this is amazing xd
19:51 < bridge> <Ewan> What the hell
19:52 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
19:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> would that be considered as browser as a service
19:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i love godot too
19:53 < bridge> <Ewan> is that a real godot constraint? i would be surprised if you can’t find a way to loop that or macro it
19:53 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Gotta love, that in Godot, I cannot create Inspector variables which target a specific variable, but rather targets a variable, that is the **same fucking name** as the inspector variable, making it impossible to just for loop variables
19:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although by that point i would probably just use C++ or rust bindings if i know rust
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I would've rather used C# or C++ with the native language compiler in Godot to make my dataset
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> This is more painful, but it's gonna be done only once, it's only for making entities.
19:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> For modders, this will be fine, for devs who want to use that, they'll experience worse pain
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> Cellegen you run skins.tw right?
19:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> nope, Nexus runs it
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
19:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I'm a manager in there
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> can you make a way for me to download all skins
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like a big bandwidth hog but if the user has the skins that means they'll never query the api again until they encounter a new skin
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> would be wroth
19:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why would you need that
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> would be worth
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i hoard
19:56 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I could, the github repo on the skins are built with the Teeskins API, so in theory using Teeskins API, you can download all the skins
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i am pretty sure it has a max of 100 cellegen
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111714751756640350/image.png
19:57 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And I'm sure, that you'll exceed your VRAM xd
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> Nope
19:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it would be slow to load tho
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> It already is
19:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> it is slow
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> idc my disk is fast
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and i'm thinking of multithreading it anyway
19:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> expensive ssd guy
19:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> can you PR that when you done :kek:
19:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> only if DDNet client allows for better PNG support, I could've already compressed PNGs to be more acceptable
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> well yeah...
19:59 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> saving hundreds of MBs of VRAM
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know what you mean cellegen, once it reaches vram it's no longer a png & is raw pixel data
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it will equate to the same size in vram, only take longer to decompress
19:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unless it was hardware compressed but they usually looks bad
19:59 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> then ddnet's compression system has it's limitations
19:59 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> directly compress from memory sucks
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet has to upload the texture in a pixel format that the graphics backend is familiar with
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it's out of their control
20:00 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I can use compress image formats in Vulkan and OpenGL, it's just that the engine is not built for that png data use
20:01 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> the tw engine i mean
20:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in godot or directly
20:01 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> both, I wondered if Godot just used a native library from OpenGL
20:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I looked at documents from OpenGL on how they use PNG compression
20:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and my brain hurts
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> unrelated but i'm not super privy to how modern desktops work when it comes to fancy CPU features. i want to enable hibernation but powercfg says the firmware doesn't support it, but all relevant settings are on in the bios
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> am i missing something
20:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a better bios
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the motherboard that fish sold me
20:03 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Windows API issue I think
20:03 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> in linux you have a package for that :kek:
20:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> THE fish? or just a fish
20:03 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Windows API redirecting to BIOS settings are never a good idea
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> it used to be an armored princess cabinet xd
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> our bud fsh
20:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cool
20:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah the memory ~~that i don't remember exactly~~
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ya he sold me mobo (matx supermicro hybrid thing) + cpu (i5 9400f) + 16gb ram for $300 cad
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> which was 200 something usd
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> good deal
20:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is it that easy to ship across canada border
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> Shipping definitely wasn't much
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it's all continental
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah truckers go through borders multiple times a day sometimes
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a normal thing
20:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cool
20:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i really should go to bed now
20:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> gn fred
20:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 2am already
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i'm gonna try a cmos flush
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it totally could be a firmware thing. i've poked in there a lot the past year and a half i've had it
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it totally could be a firmware thing. i've poked around in there a lot the past year and a half i've had it
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i think my GPU is covering it though so i have to find the jumper
20:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ☕
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> hi ryozuki
20:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hi ewan
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> do u know my problem
20:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt read chat
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> omg
20:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> r u on windows
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
20:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cant help
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> sadness lives within me
20:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can always switch to linux
20:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also hibernation is not even needed
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> do u think this functionality is enabled on a live cd
20:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i want to leave my pc on without the fan spinning. it's very loud recently
20:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just power it down
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but i lose my contexts in apps and stuff :( big productivity hit
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i forget i was doing stuff
20:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz u use bloated software
20:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk i always close without issue
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and no hit
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well my life is simple
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> open editor code
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> my issue is remembering i even had a particular app open
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> close
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> my ide has projects open and i hop between stuff a lot so when i wake up i like to see where i left off
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> past few days i've been forgetting i've been using figma for smth
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just a pain in the ass
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i never used to shut down but it's so stupidly loud now
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hm
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why is it loud now
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> age probably
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can tweak fans on bios
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well on mine i can
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a 170€ mobo tho
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i can control fan speeds but idk if i can do curves or anything
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it's very barebones
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i can do curves
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> buy better fans
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i generally replace them every summer
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i want to but my hyper 212 mounting nuts are lost so i have to use intel stock cooler
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but this time i bought higher quality ones
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> noctua
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they are silend
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i was gonna splurge
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but each one costs 30€
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> but i went to actually install my hyper 212 after putting it off for months only to find out that i don't have the nuts
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> so i have to buy a new cooler altogether
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> a sad situation
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i had that  cooler too
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have noctua now
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> which
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12a-chromax-black
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it fits if u had a 212
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> also you should not have to replace your fans, the ones immediately above the cheapest option usually have lubricant reservoirs
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this one has 3 more pipes
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or 4
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> nice but my cpu kinda sips so i don't need anything too performant
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah but i used to buy rly cheap ones
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz i didnt have as much money as now
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> life
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dev life
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i want to make the bucks
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> can only go up
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> good thing about this job
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u have a upwards future
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in most ur stuck at ur range
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> in 5 years all junior roles will be filled by AI
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i went from 18k to 25k to 33k
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know not much
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for a murican
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im above avg in spain
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i got offers for 50k now
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i think us lacks smart people so good devs are rarer xd
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> they get paid more
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i like where i am quite a lot
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yea you are euros right
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 💶
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> basically equivalent to usd
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> we make 2x u do on this side of the ocean lol
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk things are costlier in US
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ewan Green how much is a big sized good coffee
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah very expensive
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> mine comes out to $11 ish
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here a big one is 2€ a normal 1€
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> LMAO
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> what a world
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here ppl would be beyond crazy
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if 11€ for 1 coffee
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> trust me
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i went to paris
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and found it weird it costs 6€
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> coffee + croisant here is like 3€
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> mine is a little bit extra cuz i get extra espresso shots, but on its own it's still absurd
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> coffee + croissant is such an awesome combo
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ofc
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> my internship fell through
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> so i'm boned for now
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta wait until july 30
20:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> very catalan

20:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> looks delicious
20:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> all of it
20:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also there is a weird but delicious combo with this "jamon"
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> not big on the super cured aged hams but otherwise yea
20:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the ham with melon
20:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the contrast of salad and it
20:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nothing like it
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> wow usually i try to do something savory with it
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> and when i compare it to a salami i don't like it
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111723217300758678/melon-con-jamon-preparado-con-palillos.jpg
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> but i never thought about putting it with something sweeter
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u ever come here
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> try this
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> yea looks awesome
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> best summer food
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there are qualities to aged hams
20:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and trust me

20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i have to give
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> sux
20:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why u sound old
20:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how old

20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> im not old but usually ppl my age have jobs and are buying their family shit on the holidays
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> if they love them that is
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> me 17
20:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
20:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ppl ur age dont have  jobs
20:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would say 20% maybe
20:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and  they are jobs to pay uni or smth
20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont worry xd
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess
20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> trust me
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't like being a freeloader
20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also used to be worried xd
20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> r u going to uni
20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it sucks to be in debt at 18 already xd
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> nah
20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (i didnt go to uni)
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i was going to be set with this internship but they really pulled the rug out on me
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i went to the site to get a run down on how things were and days go by waiting for them to send me things to sign and laptop and whatever
20:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u ever try this
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i reach out and bossman says HR changed their mind, no longer comfortable hiring a minor
20:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> even though according to my state law I'm not
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pussy hr
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> since i have a high school diploma or equivalent
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i told him and i got no response
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not like u work a high risk job
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> shady shit
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they probs just didnt want u
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> excuses
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> could be
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its normal
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u will be rejected even if ur mr perfect
20:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> looking for a job
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> though i got interviews with them through a contact of mine, he knows the guy who would have been my boss & contact said boss was really thrilled with me
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think they would just say that, right
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> fucked up if so
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe it is a way to deal with comp science egos
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> break them down lol
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this may sound like a joke but
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe learn rust
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lately there are way more jobs
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah rust is a goal of mine
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and ppl calling me to interview xd
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well i got lucky cuz i found a job with rust
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so now i got the xp
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats hard to get
20:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway rust is the future
20:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well web dev pays a lot too
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> web dev is very saturated
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> and i'm not interested anywya
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> and i'm not interested anyway
20:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
20:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but most jobs are web dev too
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> im completely uninterested in web dev at the momeny
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> im completely uninterested in web dev at the moment
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just not intuitive to me, the way they do things
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i also think the company's issue was a miscommunication
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> because i think the boss interpreted their initial warning as them saying to beware, instead of just trying to be gentle as a hard denial
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and then we got further through the process and when it came time for them to have more input
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> they clarified?
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i am just pissed because this was my way forward and now i have no idea what to do
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We removed compressed image formats:
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. They are not standardized,they are not lossless or might affect performance
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. They were buggy on some computers when textures were update
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3. Since some impl weren't losless they made the game look like trash and ppl didn't understand why
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I couldn't name a game that used them anyway xd
20:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ewan Green i would rework ur web
20:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and put gh link front
20:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and do more stuffs
20:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but thats how i work
20:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know some ppl dont use gh to show their work
20:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they love their private sources
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> stuff has been slow for me lately
20:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also having a blog greatly helps
20:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just write
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> since at first i thought i would be able to put less effort into impressing employers through gh stats & stuff
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> and now afterwards i am just in a pit
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i might make a blog
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know what i would write about
20:50 < bridge> <Learath2> Ofc, it's a classic combo
20:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ewan Green u write about stuff u made, you seen, you had troubbles with but solved
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or anything u find interesting
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also thought at first, who would read my shit
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but look
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> some ppl even link it here
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdxd
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice u know well
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my grandma prepares it
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> best
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with ham from local market
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yep
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe a blog would be better than running my friends' ears off
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for example
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just learnt about std::optional
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> write about it
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i did
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> ?
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its an example
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hypothetical
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> oic
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just learn about how rust is better than c and cpp combined, u write about it
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought u were talking about rust std option
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i said optional
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so its cpp
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust its Option
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> we talked about this a week or more ago, when talking about protocol stuff
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought that may have been what u were saying
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> but i understand now it's hypothetical
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> hope i am clear
20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah sry i didnt have much cpp in my head
20:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so i just remembered that
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
20:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe about the weak ordering from learath
20:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdxd
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> yea that sizeof ptr stuff was a mindfuck
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> but i don't work with pointers unless i'm doign cursed stuff or working with lots of deeta
20:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> another thing to  write a lot about is threading
20:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> since nobody understands it
20:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should write more but im lazy
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> it is a tricky topic
20:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/sdl2-cmake/
20:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is my first post
20:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xddd
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i even saw that and was like geez that's pretty basic
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> but if it works i'll try
20:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and for some reason
20:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its one with most traffic
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ppl suck at cmake
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> most googled
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> right lmfao
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake sucks it's kind of just trial and error to begin
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> there are no good guides
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess i shoud add that to my resume i forgot about it
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> stupid mounting nuts are nowhere to be found
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it's over
20:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have spare of all the shit i bought
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know when i would have done it but i fear they are on my cousin's motherboard
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i have too many cords and misc pieces of tech
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ugh
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> why i have microsoft visual c++ 6.0 professional edition box in my closet
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Robyt3 when i select text in a text input, then press ctrl + backspace, it does not delete the text but jump to start instead xd
22:03 < bridge> <Broso56> lmao i actually used your tutorial to start messing around with ddnet
22:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> epic
22:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet: https://edgarluque.com/categories/ddracenetwork/
