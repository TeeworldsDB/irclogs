03:39 <@deen> I'm wondering why I even paid for the server at datafabrik. It's been terminated for nearly a month now and is still running^^

11:21 <@deen> hi RafaelFF 
11:21 < RafaelFF> Hi there
11:21 < RafaelFF> did you see my email?
11:24 <@deen> looks like it got lost in the spamfilter =/
11:31 < RafaelFF> Hey deen, i've been disconnected and didn't see if you see or answered my question, so just checking: did you see my email?
11:40 <@deen> RafaelFF: hi
11:40 <@deen> RafaelFF: it got lost in the spamfilter, now i have it
11:40 <@deen> and I'm setting it up right now
11:40 <@deen> sorry about that
11:41 < RafaelFF> Ok, don't worry, I'm not in a rush. I was just checking if information arrived
11:43 <@deen> oh, it's a 32bit linux
11:47 < RafaelFF> problem?
11:47 < RafaelFF> ddnet is only 64 bit?
11:48 < RafaelFF> if required, I believe we can request an "upgrade" for 64-bit.
11:49 <@deen> no problem
11:49 <@deen> just interesting
11:50 < RafaelFF> Looking at the hosting options, 64-bit seems to be available. I don't know why 32-bit was chosen.. anyway.
11:54 <@deen> servers should be running as DDNet BRA now
11:55 <@deen> nice, very stable ping
11:57 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
11:57 < Nimda> New server detected : DDNet BRA!
12:02 <@deen> playing with an Argentinian now
12:02 <@deen> looks like they have nice ping too
12:02 < RafaelFF> Deen, could the server be "BR"? That's a common abreviation for Brazil, and would avoid jokes for US americans
12:03 <@deen> ah, ok
12:03 <@deen> i can change it
12:03 < RafaelFF> ( about women bra)
12:03 <@deen> or we can just call it Brasil or Brazil
12:03 <@deen> whatever you prefer
12:03 < RafaelFF> Brazil would be awesome too, no problem
12:03 <@deen> ok, good
12:03 <@deen> then Brazil
12:04 < RafaelFF> oh, can you also set the domain to "br.ddnet.tw"?
12:04 <@deen> yes, will do
12:05 < RafaelFF> awesome
12:10 < RafaelFF> *DDNet Brazil* detected

12:21 <@deen> should all be fine now
12:22 < RafaelFF> ping around 33-61 for me
13:21 <@deen> note: don't buy a server at gc-server.de. they ignored my mails and only paid back the money when i opened a dispute at paypal
13:34 <@deen> EastByte: we need more space for server flags in the client after all^^
14:10 <@EastByte> deen: yep

14:12 <@EastByte> cya
14:33 < o_be_one> hi crew :)
14:34 < o_be_one> 2 days ago if i remember well; someone on CAN servers flooding : "woaw this server is laggy" (we were 10 tees online, Maple with 15ms ping and me with 22ms ping ...)
14:39 < o_be_one> muted by me, so he use nickname change to flood again, banned for 10 mins, hes came again with proxy, and again and again and again ... boring
14:39 < o_be_one> with different range except one time
14:40 < o_be_one> he has faked deen, too, all was "hey deen how r u" and he was saying bullshits. Boring -_-
14:40 < o_be_one> i hate these kind of player saying too "stop to ban me" and flooding or spamming, and saying after "if you ban me again, i'll attak you server !" ... making me laugh too.
14:58 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
14:59 <@deen> yeah, weird kids
16:06 < o_be_one> deen there is many kids like that on v3ROYAL, less on other blocker map ... BlmapPepe has some kids but not ddosers, just annonying kids with endless hook, normal

17:13 < MatzeeE> DDNet Ger Brutal - Map:Logics
17:15 <@deen> look for moderators next time: http://ddnet.tw/staff
17:15 < MatzeeE> okay but thank you!
17:25 <@EastByte> @deen | GER2 for testing purposes
17:25 <@EastByte> @deen | low ping, cheap server, ddos protection
17:25 <@EastByte> @deen | ddos on GER2
17:25 <@EastByte> haha
17:25 <@deen> yeah, was testing it
17:25 <@deen> 0 lags
17:25 <@EastByte> ddosers need to dedicate every new server heh?
17:25 <@deen> but it was only 150 mbit/s ddos
17:25 <@deen> need to wait for a bigger one
17:26 <@EastByte> yea
17:26 <@EastByte> we also might sell ddos stress testing service at friday night
17:27 <@deen> haha
17:45 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=688
18:09 <@deen> maybe we should consider moving to more players per server at some point
18:09 <@deen> 256-1024, something in that direction
18:09 <@deen> would be awesome for the tournaments
18:13 < o_be_one> yeah :D
18:13 < o_be_one> i agree my lord :>
18:16 <@deen> would probably have to change some code though to scale
18:18 <@deen> holy, i love this solo tournament map
18:19 < WolfAlex> deen, is teeworlds capable to keep up with that many players? (client and serverside, with modifications)
18:28 <@EastByte> new office chair <3
18:29 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: relating to the current cpu usage of a full 64pl server, it shouldn't be a problem
18:29 < WolfAlex> and timing? 
18:30 <@EastByte> timing?
18:31 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: let's finish kobra 3
18:31 <@EastByte> using your new hardware you even might be more skilled :P
18:34 < WolfAlex> eh
18:42 < nuborn> hi
18:43 <@heinrich5991> deen: not sure if already incorporated, but eeeee (or fisted (?)) made some improvements to some algos in TW, reducing them from O(n^2) to O(n)
18:45 <@EastByte> really?
18:59 <@heinrich5991> I believe so
19:10 < NICOs> [19:09] <NICOs> hi, ty for unbann [19:09] <NICOs> o_tee_one said at me: What kind of map are you doing? [19:09] <NICOs> i posted some screenshot of the map [19:09] <NICOs> PLS DON't BAN ME
19:10 < NICOs> xd
19:10 < NICOs> goonna go bb
19:18 < o_be_one> EastByte, what about CPU ? Not seen hard cpu usage with 64 players online oO
19:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] josephgbr opened pull request #107: Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/fywZkg
19:18 < o_be_one> wtf with NICOs Oo ?
19:19 <@EastByte> there is no problem with the cpu
19:19 <@deen> with 64 players it's ok
19:19 <@deen> but with 1024 probably not
19:19 <@deen> depending on the map it's 15-30% cpu with 64 players
19:19 < o_be_one> ok read fail from me ^^ sorry
19:20 < o_be_one> 1024 it's just like crazy :p ! hum eeeee was hosting 256pl no ?
19:20 <@deen> there is a 128 player server running
19:20 <@deen> ddwar128 or something
19:20 <@deen> I'm just trying to get all of Europe on one Tournament server
19:20 <@deen> ^^
19:21 <@EastByte> you like servers with a lot of players
19:21 <@deen> not at all
19:21 <@deen> but people have often asked me for that

19:22 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:22 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 489
19:22 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
19:23 < o_be_one> its funny when there is many tees, and i think ddnet is a great way to boost again the tw community
19:23 <@deen> we still don't have a tutorial map =/
19:24 <@EastByte> well there is a reason why I would want to see a ~256 pl server
19:25 <@EastByte> ddos target number one :)
19:26 <@deen> ^^
19:26 < nuborn> deen, I tested the antiping stuff some more, and it seems that normal clients cant play demos recorded when the client and server are using the modified projectile info
19:26 <@deen> nuborn: yes, i've noticed that in some videos on youtube already =/
19:27 < nuborn> deen: I just noticed this. but I guess this means that the server modification is a bad thing
19:29 < nuborn> I mean, the demos can still be played, but only by the modded clients (6.02 or something). so I guess you dont want the server mod re-added?
19:29 <@deen> hmmm
19:30 <@deen> maybe you can fix the recording
19:30 <@deen> convert the grenades to normal grenades and record only those
19:30 <@deen> in the client, you understand?
19:30 < nuborn> deen: yes, I think it would be possible, but at first sight that code was a little complicated
19:30 <@deen> yeah
19:30 <@deen> hmm
19:31 <@deen> without server mod it's not that accurate
19:31 < nuborn> deen: its accurate for your own grenades, but buggy for others grenades
19:32 < nuborn> a non-buggy solution would be just prediction your own grenades, perhaps
19:32 < nuborn> predicting*
19:42 <@deen> maybe it's not that bad when the demo only works with new ddnet client
19:51 < nuborn> maybe its possible to just send a modified projectile the first time/tick, then store that in the client and re-use it for the later projectiles. it would just require a little more work for the client
19:51 < nuborn> and would work unless two players fire a grenade at the exact same time and place
19:57 < eeeee> we tested 512 player server once (filled with dummies)
19:58 < eeeee> it didn't work well out of the box but after a couple patches was pretty stable
19:59 <@deen> eeeee: nice, would be interesting for ddnet
20:03 < eeeee> dummies are kind of an edge case though. most server problems were because of the ridiculous velocities the dummies attain when tightly packed in a closed space
20:05 <@deen> also, real players do a lot of inputs and movements
20:05 <@deen> which dummies don'tdo
20:07 < eeeee> yeah but in our case server was just timing out because too much time was spent in collision code (because of those huge velocities most of dummies were "trying" to traverse the whole map in one tick)
20:08 <@deen> haha
20:11 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
20:11 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
20:28 <@deen> cool, mtr needs 100% cpu when you do ctrl-s
20:29 < ochristi> heh was just wondering why the cpu spiked on the web server
20:30 <@deen> yeah, me too^^
21:14 < o_be_one> what the goal for "antiping" systems ?
21:15 <@deen> to be able to play with high ping
21:15 <@deen> it predicts the movement of other players
21:15 <@deen> and grenades
21:15 <@deen> nuborn's new patch even predicts weapon effects
21:15 < o_be_one> nice, what is needed to work (i know where is the option in ddnet client)
21:16 <@deen> ?
21:17 < o_be_one> i mean, does it work only on ddnet bin servers ?
21:17 <@deen> no, all servers
21:17 <@deen> it's a client feature
21:17 < o_be_one> on servers running ddnet bin*
21:17 < o_be_one> ok, good to know
21:17 <@deen> but nuborn's patch needs server changes for proper grenade explosion prediction
21:17 <@EastByte> ^ so it's not client only anymore
21:17 <@deen> what we have so far is client only*
21:17 < o_be_one> is it powerfull ? can we really enhance our game experience at 90 / 110 ms ?
21:18 <@EastByte> oh
21:18 <@deen> i can play well with ping 300 with antiping
21:18 < o_be_one> oO really ? :o
21:18 <@deen> yeah
21:18 <@deen> you just have to get used to tees flying around everywhere
21:18 <@EastByte> what about dummy dragging with highping?
21:19 <@EastByte> (frozen dummys)
21:19 <@deen> that's what works perfectly
21:19 <@EastByte> okay
21:19 <@deen> except when they slide on the ground
21:19 <@deen> i guess strong/weak is not predicted
21:20 <@EastByte> noticed that
21:32  * o_be_one slaps XXLTomate 
22:06 <@deen> pings really look better on GER2
23:13 <@deen> i'm wondering if i can fuzz test ddnet
23:23 <@deen> interesting: http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/ http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/zzuf http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/trinity/
23:23 <@deen> anyone have any experience with fuzzing?
23:28 <@deen> hi PJK
23:28 < PJK> Hi
23:28 < PJK> I just discover teeworlds' IRC
23:32 <@deen> Welcome to DDNet channel then =)
23:33 <@deen> You've played on our servers already?
23:46 < PJK> Yeah =)
23:53 <@deen> sigh, now deutsche telekom ping on GER2 jumps from 20 to 120
23:53 <@deen> and GER1 is constant at 20 instead...
