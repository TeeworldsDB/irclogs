00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> spent like 3 hours trying to figure out why a crate update broke stuff
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ended up like halfway reimplementing crate behavior that changed & i couldn’t figure out
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> apparently they just moved it to live behind a feature flag 😃 😃
00:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> Blazingly fast feature flag 🚀

05:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the difference between the 2 heights is 10 which suggests only the padding is showing which is weird
05:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah because im an idiot

13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> hello fellas
14:15 < bridge> <vahemaaa> hello
14:16 < bridge> <Sans> Can someone help me with regex :PES_Cry:
14:16 < bridge> <Sans> I'm trying to parse the name out of this ab line
14:16 < bridge> <Sans> 
14:16 < bridge> <Sans> `2025-03-31 14:09:32 I server: id=61 addr=nunya:business name='Magic Woman'' client=19010 secure=yes flags=1 dnsbl=white`
14:16 < bridge> <Sans> But the damned quote is screwing with me
14:16 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356240832369262782/image.png?ex=67ebd934&is=67ea87b4&hm=4cba7089fb671efe50f71cd6d2b74a46a0a69bc34f2d2e2f7ace46ef2554c82a&
14:18 < bridge> <Sans> Most likely "What now?"
14:18 < bridge> <Sans> probably out of frustration
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask ai, they are native regex speakers
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
14:20 < bridge> <Sans> I did that
14:20 < bridge> <Sans> you think i wrote that regex myself xd
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> It spat out this
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356241886221963396/image.png?ex=67ebda2f&is=67ea88af&hm=519178818671c0a62183b92d56af822b29f6011b05fb94a1e17f97b25eca0274&
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> which also does not wor
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> which also does not work
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> It spat out this in the end
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356241886221963396/image.png?ex=67ebda2f&is=67ea88af&hm=519178818671c0a62183b92d56af822b29f6011b05fb94a1e17f97b25eca0274&
14:21 < bridge> <Sans> yelling at it with "This also doesnt work" gets me nowhere :(
14:21 < bridge> <remakepower> Then ask another AI
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
14:22 < bridge> <Sans> <a:NOOOO:1144072189683966004>
14:22 < bridge> <remakepower> :nouis:
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what even is the problem with the quote?
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the capturing group kinda looks correct
14:23 < furo> Is this what you want? `name='(.*)'` The name will be in capturing group 1.
14:23 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356242440922599604/image.png?ex=67ebdab3&is=67ea8933&hm=d3bc8691310c139eff6366c05c4d54a83e35cd54dec54a4e05c9cc6e6cc70387&
14:23 < bridge> <Sans> the quote is part of the name
14:23 < bridge> <Sans> and theres also quotes surrounding the value in the ab line
14:23 < bridge> <matodor> '\s
14:24 < bridge> <matodor> name='(.*)'\s
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean the original string has 2 quote characters
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why does it even have that
14:24 < bridge> <Sans> because the name key's value is always surrounded by single quotes
14:24 < bridge> <Sans> dont ask me why cuz idk, whoever coded up the antibot knows xd
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok, just weird to use double single quotes. what happens if the name already contains a quote?
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you also want to ignore that
14:25 < bridge> <Sans> if the name contains a quote i wanna keep it
14:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is exactly the case where the name already contains a quote
14:25 < bridge> <Sans> that's the whole point
14:25 < bridge> <Sans> ^
14:25 < bridge> <Sans> xd
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's what i thought, but apparently he is not happy with that
14:26 < bridge> <matodor> @sans._. :justatest:
14:27 < bridge> <Sans> wut
14:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the problem is parsing the line with that name surrounded by quotes
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah his ai thing failed too
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can't even rely on the space afterwards because your name could have ` '` at the end
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time to fire up ai magic
14:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can't even rely on the space afterwards because your name could have `' ` at the end
14:28 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> does the "load current map" shortcut work for anyone
14:28 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> it doesnt work for me
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `name='((?:[^']|\\')*)'`
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
14:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the name could even be `xd' client=19810` and that would make parsing even more hellish
14:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> THIS IS WHY YOU SANITIZE
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it failed
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u use capture groups?
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://regex101.com/r/x8A98s/1
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356244118044414104/image.png?ex=67ebdc43&is=67ea8ac3&hm=38e173655bd158e3e6348218137246b418f70aa49f2e743287725bed886af587&
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> group 1 has it
14:29 < bridge> <Sans> sure why not
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh it has ' in the name?
14:30 < bridge> <matodor> and? 
14:30 < bridge> <matodor> ".*" capture it, exclude last `' `
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> ```ts
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> const line = `2025-03-31 14:09:32 I server: id=61 addr=nunya:business name='Magic Woman'' client=19010 secure=yes flags=1 dnsbl=white`;
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> 
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> const playerName = line.match(/name='(.*)'/gi)![0].slice(6, -1);
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> 
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> console.log(playerName); // Magic Woman'
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> ```
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> success
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> :owo:
14:30 < bridge> <Sans> furo is too smort
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> `name='(.+)' client`
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> this works for me
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356244410291192078/image.png?ex=67ebdc89&is=67ea8b09&hm=4beead0bf14f7cdf1f32faaff3dd385e1d258c3d8b65f669cff41338ea3945a3&

14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> furos would fail if there is a `'` later in the text
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or not
14:31 < bridge> <Sans> wdym
14:31 < furo> It won't fail, regex is greedy by default.
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except that never happens
14:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if there's another quoted string on the same line it'd get greedily combined into the name and now you get an output that contains a whole lot of garbage
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> ```ts
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> const line = `2025-03-31 14:09:32 I server: id=61 addr=nunya:business name='''Ma'gi'c' W'o'man''''' client=19010 secure=yes flags=1 dnsbl=white`;
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> 
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> const playerName = line.match(/name='(.*)'/gi)![0].slice(6, -1);
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> 
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> console.log(playerName); // ''Ma'gi'c' W'o'man''''
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> ```
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> it works fine wdym
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> luckily its not possible
14:32 < bridge> <Sans> furo i love you :owo:
14:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah that's a bit of good luck at least
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> if our logs are razy we cooked
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> racy
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should use regex101 to test stuff
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its so much better than shitjs
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> I am lol
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> I just sent the code example cuz why not
14:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> u shouldnt need slice
14:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> use capture groups properly
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356245342479323197/image.png?ex=67ebdd67&is=67ea8be7&hm=ab2ac1191d2020ba4246e2896f13801a5f9a1d4af09d58dc5c5246c950fdb164&
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> ah
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> yeah uhhh
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> it works
14:34 < bridge> <Sans> im not touching it
14:35 < bridge> <Sans> :heh:
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, the correct fix would be to escape the inner string
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```js
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> /name='(.*)'/gi.exec(line)[1]
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its 1
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else it's not really parsable
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> try this @sans._. its cleaner
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```js
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> /name='(.*)'/gi.exec(`2025-03-31 14:09:32 I server: id=61 addr=nunya:business name='''Ma'gi'c' W'o'man''''' client=19010 secure=yes flags=1 dnsbl=white`)[1]
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> "''Ma'gi'c' W'o'man''''" 
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> works on browser
14:36 < bridge> <Sans> ooo nice
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat are u there?
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a question for u
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> in your language, will you allows circular module dependencies?
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u will add forward declarations
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> or not allow it at all
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> going for non circular makes stuff more simple
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to get coffee
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if its possible to make a proper std lib without circular modules
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its probs possible
14:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill yoink what rust does, probably
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @milkeeycat is your lang already usable?
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can I write a real program if I wanted to?
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust allows circular
14:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i can dm u mine
14:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im making a compiler backed for it
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No need, we all know edlang repo 😉
14:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not that one
14:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean the work one
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> edlang is a bit abandoned
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean i can simply go on your gh profile xD

14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> the binary xd
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDD
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt u want to get mlir to build it
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah too xd
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok i try your examples
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think the "crates" will be called "bricks"
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> the lang is called concrete xd
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i think u got other deps on arch than me
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to install mlir

14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki currently have a temporary PC, so dunno
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that VM related?
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My new pc arrives soon
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i built it with my ryzen 9
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then I itest
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait i build it with lower isa
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then I test
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot most ppl dont have new cpu
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3800x

14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u give back the 9?
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it died
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> no warranty?
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i even bought new motherboard to test it
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it just died
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> rip
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 14-day return perioud
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didn't want to do RMA
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that really lower?
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> my 7900x3d works nice
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym size? i guess
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i strippedi t btw
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my 9950x3d was also a dream cpu, but i never had a processor die before
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like 120mb and i have 100mb discord limit
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that kinda shocked me
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> tthats such a let down xd
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no i get same error, that's why
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> uh no idea
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i have the flag somewhere hidden
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> let me build it on my server
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks https://edgl.dev/concrete

15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think size is cuz llvm stuff

15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks hello world with libc
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you also have some kind of std lib?
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> in std/
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just recently added project dependencies
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> go to std
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> do "pwd"
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> save the path
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> on random folder do
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> concrete new myproject
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> cd myproject
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> edit Concrete.toml
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> and add the path to std
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> like in rust
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> [dependencies]
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> std = { path = "../../std", version = "0.1.0" }
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> version doesnt matter xd
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> [dependencies]
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> std = { path = "pathto/std", version = "0.1.0" }
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```toml
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> [dependencies]
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> std = { path = "pathto/std", version = "0.1.0" }
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> concrete build to build a project
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki are gpus your target group or more micro chips?
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can also add --asm --llvm --ast --ir
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> to output the intermediate files
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> for now just normal cpus, but with mlir its easier to target gpu kernels and stuff
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> the lang goal is to be a mix of rust/elixir with a pluggable  default async runtime
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and simpler lifetimes
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and liner types
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> linear types is what make it most special
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> not yet implemented tho
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Linear types correspond to linear logic and ensure that objects are used exactly once. This allows the system to safely deallocate an object after its use,[1]: 6  or to design software interfaces that guarantee a resource cannot be used once it has been closed or transitioned to a different state.[
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Linear type systems allow references but not aliases. To enforce this, a reference goes out of scope after appearing on the right-hand side of an assignment, thus ensuring that only one reference to any object exists at once. Note that passing a reference as an argument to a function is a form of assignment, as the function parameter will be assigned the value inside the function, and therefore such use of a reference also causes it to go out of 
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So stuff like `Rc` won't exist?
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm idk
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want an example of a lang with linear types: https://austral-lang.org/
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont like the syntax a lot tho xd
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You too much rust enjoyer XD
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> the syntax looks cobol like lmao
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> who likes that
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @0xdeen is april fools tomorrow?
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot the day

16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should release ddnet 2.0
16:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like tw did 1.0 as April fool
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye

16:57 < furo> @TsFrediman Looking at the code it seems to read this file, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/8cc6949be1a7d0b2780553da6afcf44074dbc8ed/servers/releases but seems like it doesn't update when map info changes and only get appended new maps.
16:57 < bridge> <TsFrediman> very cool
16:58 < bridge> <TsFrediman> :nouis:  now i have to sync the database just to correct maps
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> furo app knows it all
17:06 < bridge> <TsFrediman> why does the list stop at 2021
17:06 < furo> Because it's not synced to git. It's a local file on the server
17:07 < bridge> <TsFrediman> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>  ofc it is
17:07 < bridge> <TsFrediman> bummer
17:07 < bridge> <TsFrediman> database it is then
17:25 < furo> @TsFrediman Or you can use this if you wish https://ddstats.tw/maps/json
17:25 < bridge> <TsFrediman> i already coded the database one

22:57 < bridge> <_qey> It’s not that hard actually, good luck.
22:58 < bridge> <Sans> I mean, I was able to get this so far
22:59 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356372227725197522/Screenshot_1.png?ex=67ec5393&is=67eb0213&hm=ac8a830bdb775634fa4d23f8935a1e63f343e99d47d08bb8d7ef141b7744c288&
22:59 < bridge> <Sans> I think whatever I'm doing is gonna work when I finally put it in code
22:59 < bridge> <Sans> if not
22:59 < bridge> <Sans> 🪢
23:02 < bridge> <_qey> You can actually just do \d+, no need to specify the length.
23:03 < bridge> <Sans> aight
23:03 < bridge> <Sans> thats better
23:04 < bridge> <_qey> And as for IP, ([\d\.]+) will do.
23:04 < bridge> <Sans> smort
23:04 < bridge> <Sans> :owo: ty
23:04 < bridge> <_qey> Wait.
23:04 < bridge> <_qey> There’s \ before the dot, it’s not showing for some reason.
23:05 < bridge> <_qey> I hate Discord.
23:05 < bridge> <Sans> yeah i figured
23:05 < bridge> <Sans> dw
23:06 < bridge> <_qey> Sooo… As I wanted, Ive implemented whisper logging and auto-banning people based on spam ad of the KNOWN CLIENT (I’ll play along, guys), now I’m in need of actually unique-identifying clients to persist bans across IP changes. Any ideas?
23:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You need to escape the \\ because of how discord formats text
23:08 < bridge> <_qey> I know UUID isn’t a thing. I’m thinking of creating a fingerprint of some kind, but what can it be based on?
23:09 < bridge> <_qey> There was a good practice in good old CS:S, a plugin was setting a config value client side to an identifiable one, ban upon detection. Is this possible in DDNet?
23:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you get alot of config from the client, but thats a really bad uuid
23:12 < bridge> <_qey> If the client is default, sure. Ooooh, we also get skin data, ain’t we?
23:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you only get what skin is selected
23:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what skins are downloaded is only known by db
23:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for 30x same as before
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and tahts by ip aswell
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or idrk how that works
23:13 < bridge> <_qey> Thing is, those banned are usually not playing on a default client, they do configure their clients.
23:13 < bridge> <_qey> That would be a good fingerprint I guess.
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think many people stick with default settings
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the first thing i do when opening any game is go straight to settings
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the first thing i did was change jump to w
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the first thing in ddnet was change jump to w
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the next thing was s = hammer then 1 = gun 2 = sg ... etc cuz my hands r too small to reach 5
23:15 < bridge> <_qey> Exactly. Read config (I don’t yet know what we have, I’ll have to dig into the code), make a hash fingerprint out of it, then just ban after the IP change. Genius.
23:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anything which is makred cfg_server
23:15 < bridge> <_qey> I’m just tired of people changing their IP and continue playing as if nothing happened.
23:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~anything which is makred cfg_server~~
23:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~anything which is makred cfg_server~~ (i misremembred)
23:16 < bridge> <_qey> A UUID system would be good though.
23:16 < bridge> <_qey> Based on HWID.
23:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it wont stop anyone
23:17 < bridge> <_qey> Spoofable? Yes. But you have to do it. Which is a deterrent for many.
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and changing ip isnt?
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> voldermort client will have a uuid shuffler
23:17 < bridge> <_qey> Way easier to change your IP.
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not for me
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have no control over my ip xd
23:18 < bridge> <_qey> How come?
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> uni internet
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it changes when it feels like
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and im in a fixed ip range
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and my udp ip is different from my tcp
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bane of many a ip verifier
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we just need accounts
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. get moderator
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. cheat under your ip
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3. read who does ban appeals
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 4. know who from this community is in your uni
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what does this achieve
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we'd need forced accounts tho
23:23 < bridge> <_qey> I’m slowly getting used to you being a weirdo.
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i *hope* that the ddnet account system will be available from chat
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so thats not a problem
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do u mean with chat
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !register !login etc
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why should that help
23:23 < bridge> <_qey> Having an account system is a problem for DDNet.
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> with not breaking backwards compat
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well ddnet will not have, so much i can guarantee you
23:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also means it can be implemented on server before client
23:25 < bridge> <_qey> It’s already achievable.
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not correct
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it would mean we'd have a unsecure account system
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it can move you to links
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for password entry
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and then tell u to enter numbers on the client
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> still unsecure
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the network is unsecure already
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that defeats everything you gonna try
23:27 < bridge> <_qey> What do you mean by insecure?
23:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
23:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !register
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> please goto ddnet.org/register to register
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ...
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !login
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> please goto ddnet.org/ingamelogin?code=1238719823 to login
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (page says type !login 12093812037816239123712731208731278312 to login)
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !login 12093812037816239123712731208731278312
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you are now logged in :D
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not secure as said
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why not
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs a man in the middle can read the traffic
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> change it
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whatever he wants
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its as secure as https is
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is still succeptable to man in the middle
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is completely wrong
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bro
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You say the whole internet is insecure?
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah to an extent
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe if you distrust the CAs
23:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait is it
23:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hold on
23:30 < bridge> <patiga> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS
23:31 < bridge> <patiga> according to wikipedia, https protects against man-in-the-middle attacks
23:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
23:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there have been incidents of bad certs
23:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you would have to be a proxy, you dont get any control (without being unstealthy) and you dont get any details
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fake ddnet server and you have everything u need
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @patiga: my school teacher said Wikipedia is not a good source!
23:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a problem with kog aswell
23:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or any other thing
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your school teacher is probably also not the best source xD
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yep
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Shots fired
23:35 < bridge> <patiga> sorry chilli, but my mum told me to not trust internet people :c
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> kek
23:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i dont think thats an issue, other servers can have the option for this login method aswell as the server gets no login details
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> clients supporting 100% secure login methods can block you from using it
23:36 < bridge> <learath2> btw it's not as secure as https, since our chat is completely plaintext, a mitm attack can just replace the url being sent by the server
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah, the older I get the more I realize that teachers must be like me or ppl in my age
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah to something not ddnet.org
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Full distrust
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its the same as sending a fishy link
23:37 < bridge> <learath2> It's very hard to achieve a secure channel over an insecure channel, especially by hand
23:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah yes look at my new steam game `staem.com/game/123123`
23:37 < bridge> <learath2> ddnet.loginsecure.org/login
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we need to educate the masses x-x
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or that idea from ... i forgot which browser which only shows the domain name
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Must be? You mean should be?
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not subdomain
23:38 < bridge> <learath2> ddracenetvvork.org/register
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> always assume ppl are stupid.
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just today i downloaded a random binary by a guy called ryo and executed it
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you see people falling for the steam gift card scam, and the link is identical
23:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I once gave a guy called lerato access to my raspberry pi
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yet you dont automoderate
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yet you dont use automoderate
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you think I am rational the whole day or what? xD
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Struggler army
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also fake servers cant get any login details or even login tokens
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unles it sends a fake link
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> of course xd
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not with a client cert authing based system
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what about older clients or 0.7 D:
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> unsupport
23:41 < bridge> <louis> btw @essigautomat if u wanna try to port water i can make or help make a map for it
23:41 < bridge> <Assa> Thank you @robyt3 ❤️
23:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you seemed to 180 xd
23:41 < bridge> <Assa> I wish for Stiopia to answer, but he seems inactive :/
23:41 < bridge> <louis> he answered
23:41 < bridge> <louis> also i had ideas on how to port the harpoon for some rly cool gameplay but its definitely a bigger feature so idk if it would be well received 😹
23:42 < bridge> <_qey> That’s a very short story it seems.
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont understand what that means
23:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we cannot support clients who's network is not secure anyway
23:42 < bridge> <Assa> Step one: break this up into multiple PRs
23:42 < bridge> <louis> yeah, fs
23:42 < bridge> <Assa> My Material "Mockup" had multiple thousand lines of code, so no chance to ever get reviewd
23:43 < bridge> <louis> i actually was like halfway thru a water port a few months ago but gave up xd
23:43 < bridge> <louis> some discussion is needed as to how to handle water tile and any separate layers
23:44 < bridge> <Assa> at some point I had a material layer which was able to create water xD this was also cool, ice into swimming pool into speedup
23:44 < bridge> <louis> cus i think the old pr has separate layers for design water and entity water, so its kinda weird
23:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think thats fine
23:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats how the rest of the tiles work
23:45 < bridge> <louis> ye but design layer is a separate thing from tiles or quad
23:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also when that happens can the water work like it does in celeste (that the water dynamics work on all sides)
23:45 < bridge> <louis> its like a separate Water layer that only renders the fluid
23:46 < bridge> <louis> idk i forgot if you can put the border tile on sides
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh is that what the crossed out one does
