01:27 < bridge> <KDaniel> ok thanks, but its not working anymore... and its not open-source

06:17 < bridge> <cauldron> Is it possible to mirror the ingame chat to discord? I know there was a player on fng called â€ždiscord-botâ€œ. But I mean is there some kind of discord game integration?
07:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> No Discord Selfbot/Bot inside DDNet client
07:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> So no. You will have to add that functionality yourself.
07:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> (for what do you even need that? logging chat for reporting?)
08:35 < bridge> <cauldron> Boost the social part off ddnet. Using discord as friends list / semi accounts.
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://gitlab.com/swarfey/teeworlds-client/That is the discord bridge by Nudelsaft that one usually sees in Game. I think the discord stuff is not included but itâ€™s just doing a simple http request to a discord Webhook.
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@cauldron)
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> F-DDrace has a discord chat integration
09:02 < bridge> <Swarfey> Yea it still exists, but it got banned by a mod on fng, so i disabled it. Its still online in a few other servers, if u want i can dm U the server

13:18 < bridge> <cauldron> Is it possible to send chat messages over the api? (To discord) then send them via the client and they appear in a channel dedicated for each ingame server
13:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> it would be possible  if the devs wanted to do that
13:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> you could do it for your own server though without restrictions
13:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> you just have to get to the code that handles sending/receiving chat messages
13:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> it would be possible  if the devs wanted to do that here
13:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> it would be possible if the devs wanted to do that here
13:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> you just have to get to the code that handles sending/receiving chat messages
13:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> it would be cool I guess for some people, but I wouldn't use it. nor do I think you can do it the other way (sending a message in the discord channel -> sending it to the server) without the admins coding the support for that.
17:06 < bridge> <cauldron> Wellâ€¦ I didnâ€˜t think of that. Maybe itâ€˜s an idea.
17:09 < bridge> <cauldron> Ahaa
17:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://discord.gg/ewnjzp9V
17:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I designed it to show the skins as profile pictures aswell :)
17:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> skins.tw made an API on request, before that I used KoG's tee render API
18:38 < bridge> <Swarfey> we do have public two way support on our server :) https://discord.gg/MSYcjYvU6e 
18:38 < bridge> <Swarfey> however its not handled server side like on fokkonaut's server, its a bot connecting to the server and acting as a bridge
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> TIL the word `shibboleths `
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> noun
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> plural noun: shibboleths
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     a custom, principle, or belief distinguishing a particular class or group of people, especially a long-standing one regarded as outmoded or no longer important.
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     "the majority, under the influence of vague nineteenth-century shibboleths, understood him to be associating himself with the doctrine that every nation has a right to be a sovereign state"
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
19:02 < bridge> <Robyt3> I learned that from xkcd

19:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why did u remove the embed nooo

19:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> oops, does it show the alt text also? I though it was redundant with the image already posted

20:08 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> yeah okey
21:52 < bridge> <newlesstee> Where is the file that configures the shotgun?
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> game.png
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> best is u use assets in settings -> assets
21:53 < bridge> <newlesstee> no
21:53 < bridge> <newlesstee> in the code
21:53 < bridge> <newlesstee> if I set the gamemode as CTF it works the CTF shotgun
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh well shotgun.cpp? xd
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what exactly did u d?
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u used vanilla teeworlds?
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> shotgun is basically a gun that makes many projectiles in CTF
21:54 < bridge> <newlesstee> yes
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so projectile.cpp is what u want probably
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or gamecontext.cpp
21:55 < bridge> <newlesstee> If I put my own game mode, the shotgun is equal ddrace shotgun
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well if you use ctf with ddnet source code... i dont even know if that works at all
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe chillerdragon has a ddnet compatible vanilla mod
21:56 < bridge> <newlesstee> i'm conding an mod and i need to know where is the file that configure shotgun shoot
21:57 < bridge> <newlesstee> i want like vanilla shotgun, not ddrace shotgun
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> search for new CProjectile
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> CCharacter::FireWeapon
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> copy the vanilla code into the ddnet code
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and hope that it works xd
21:58 < bridge> <newlesstee> i tried
21:59 < bridge> <newlesstee> but i want to know where is the part that i can change this, because if i set te gamemode to CTF its work like vanilla shotgun
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe the client just thinks that?
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont see any ctf code path
22:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> :tee_thinking:
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe i also simply dont understand what u mean.
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Either u mean, u set ctf in config for ddnet and it makes the shotgun behave like it is vanilla
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or you simply want it to behave like it, bcs rn it doesnt (then i'd be confused how that should be the case)
22:17 < bridge> <newlesstee> @Jupeyy_Keks i found it
22:17 < bridge> <newlesstee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1070815297147244605/image.png
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did u maybe mean the vanilla gun?
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the pistol
22:18 < bridge> <newlesstee> shotgun
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but how does the tuning make the shotgun use projectiles instead of laser
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> laser is a completly unrelated type
22:18 < bridge> <newlesstee> if i comment this code
22:19 < bridge> <newlesstee> the shotgun shot is laser
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do u mean how the projectiles fly around?
22:20 < bridge> <newlesstee> i want the vanilla shotgun
22:20 < bridge> <newlesstee> instead of ddnet's shotgun
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok anyway, glad that helped xdd
22:20 < bridge> <newlesstee> but I still want to know where this tuning controls which type of shotgun it will be
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> CCharacter::FireWeapon
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> has a switch code path
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is _SHOTGUN
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> creating a laser
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in vanilla it will create projectiles
22:23 < bridge> <newlesstee> omg
22:24 < bridge> <newlesstee> It's true, I thought this condition was on the server
22:24 < bridge> <newlesstee> thanks
23:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea sadly not .\_. Getting the tuning right can be a bit annoying. Fokko managed pretty well in F-DDrace
