00:05 < bor> !en-fa hello
00:05 < Nimda> Translation: سلام
00:05 < bor> niCe , didn't think it includes persian 
00:08 <@deen> hi bor
00:35 < laxa> bor: it's noother's bot, great coder :)
00:35 < laxa> do that !help in private
00:35 < laxa> or !help translate
00:36 <@deen> i don't like this bot at all
00:36 < bor> deen: why not?
00:37 <@deen> it's evil
00:39 < laxa> !fr-de remplir
00:39 < Nimda> Translation: ergänze
00:39 < laxa> lol deen
00:39 <@deen> ?
00:39 < laxa> it's to help me build german sentences
00:39 < laxa> I should have pmed the bot
00:41 <@deen> can you disable plugins?
00:41 < laxa> yeah
00:42 <@deen> then disable the omegle spy plugin
00:42 <@deen> is there any other shit like that?
00:42 < laxa> omegle spy ?
00:43 <@deen> yeah, it connects yourself to 2 people, and pretends to them that they are talking to each other
00:43 <@deen> and you can read everything they write...
00:44 < laxa> hum ok lol
00:44 < laxa> !config
00:44 < Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !config.
00:44 < laxa> beh
00:44 < laxa> you are the boss
00:44 < laxa> :D
00:44 <@deen> that's just disgusting
00:45 < laxa> write that : !config omeglespy no
00:45 <@deen> !config omeglespy no
00:45 < Nimda> There is no such config variable in plugin Omeglespy
00:45 < laxa> wut
00:46 <@deen> That reminds me of an ictf admin i once had
00:46 <@deen> he wanted to know how he can read teamchat and whispers in rcon...
00:47 < laxa> oh my bad
00:47 < laxa> use that !config omeglespy enabled no
00:47 <@deen> !config omeglespy enabled no
00:47 < Nimda> Config variable enabled for plugin Omeglespy has been set to no for channel #ddnet on quakenet.
00:48 < laxa> Well, you are the boss of the chan, so, you can configer the bot however you like :).
00:51 <@deen> !config Please don't spy, Nimda
00:51 < Nimda> This plugin doesn't exist.
00:51 < laxa> xD
00:52 <@deen> no reports of any server crashes with the new changes so far!
00:52 <@deen> and the server looks less laggy to me, but that may be too early to tell
01:03 < laxa> Good night everyone.
01:03 <@deen> bye laxa
01:04 < laxa> Nimda is open-source deen, you can check if there is any spy code inside it.
01:04 < laxa> But I don't think so.
01:16 <@deen> i can't check if your local copy is modified
01:16 <@deen> and it's impossible to check a source code for something like this
10:34 < laxa_work> Hello from school@Mac book air :p
10:34 < laxa_work> deen: maybe we should make a poll about the cheated map don't you think ?
11:26 < laxa_work> qwd
15:01 < laxa_work> Savander: Witaj
15:01 < laxa_work> you should use irssi on your dedi...
15:01 < Savander> i did.
15:02 < laxa_work> and then ? :p
15:02 < Savander> tw_
15:02 < Savander> its on dedi
15:02 < Savander> but, i prefer web chat
15:02 < laxa_work> you are really weird
15:02 < Savander> i only read history on tw_
15:03 < Savander> why im weird?
15:04 < laxa_work> Cause it's way better to use irssi on a dedi than fucking webchats where you timeout all the time ?
15:10 < bor> deen: hi
15:12 < laxa_work> deen is away
15:16 < laxa_work> god, running a grep -r "text" / on my mac takes ages...
15:27 < ochristi> slow disk? :D
15:28 < laxa_work> it's a fucking ssd
15:28 < laxa_work> last generation of mac book air
15:28 < laxa_work> and only 128 GB size
15:44 < Savander> laxa, but
15:44 < Savander> i have history on dedi still
15:44 < Savander> but i don't like command lines
15:44 < Savander> so i using webchat
15:44 < Savander> ...
15:45 < Savander> i always have opened browser..
19:01 <@deen> hi. did anything happen?
19:03 <@deen> Oh, got the Kimsufi server
19:05 <@deen> Wow, ping is more stable than to GER
19:07 <@deen> should I call it FRA or EUR?
19:10 < laxa> FRA
19:11 < laxa> wtf with ping more stable ?
19:11 < laxa> what you mean I mean
19:18 <@deen> less jitter
19:19 <@deen> Hm, i installed debian but the interface says no OS installed
19:19 < laxa> who cares ? :)
19:19 <@deen> the OS doesn't boot
19:19 < laxa> beh
19:21 <@deen> new try
19:31 <@deen> Ahaha, already got an email that my server is broken^^
19:31 < laxa> xD
19:31 <@deen> But it works, I hope they ignore it
19:31 < laxa> I wanna do 2 polls for ddnet deen
19:32 < laxa> first about cheated maps and should we fix + reset them
19:32 < laxa> second about solo maps with no unfreeze
19:32 <@deen> meh
19:32 <@deen> i have the last word, so the polls are a bit useless in this case :P
19:32 < laxa> lol
19:33 <@deen> oh god, 16 GB
19:33 < laxa> ?
19:33 <@deen> RAM
19:33 < laxa> On the server ?
19:33 <@deen> I've never had a computer with that much ram
19:33 <@deen> yes
19:33 < laxa> Well, you knew you were getting 16Gb right ?
19:33 <@deen> yes
19:33 <@deen> but 2 GB would've been enough^^
19:34 < laxa> why they say your server is broken ?
19:34 <@deen> it didn't reboot
19:34 <@deen> but now it did
19:37 < laxa> do a livestream deen
19:37 <@deen> no
19:37 < laxa> "Setup of DDNet servers" !
19:37 < laxa> xD
19:43 <@deen> damn, that server is nice
19:43 <@deen> 6 seconds to compile the server
19:44 < laxa> french servers are the best 
19:44 <@deen> On Persian I waited 3 minutes
19:44 < laxa> To be honest
19:44 < laxa> I am sad that you didn't wanted DDNet FRA on my server
19:44 < laxa> and now you do it alone
19:44 < laxa> I hate you lol
19:44 <@deen> I do it mainly for the tournaments
19:44 < laxa> I would have bought a better server just for it
19:44 <@deen> Your server couldn't do tournament
19:45 <@deen> nah, you don't need to buy a better server for me
19:45 <@deen> also, i like to have exclusive access to servers :P
19:45 < laxa> Beh :(
19:45 < laxa> Are DDNet FRA up tonight ? :)
19:45 <@deen> too many bad experiences
19:45 <@deen> yes, soon
19:46 < laxa> fr.ddnet.tw ?
19:46 <@deen> fra
19:46 < laxa> why fra btw ?
19:46 < laxa> well
19:46 < laxa> I am stupid
19:46 < laxa> don't answer that question :p
19:46 <@deen> because you said FRA instead of EUR
19:46 < laxa> France - France are the same word for french and english l)
19:47 < laxa> question was more : why FRA, cause FRA is french
19:47 < laxa> but then after I realized it's good in english too
19:47 <@deen> I'm pretty pissed that i can't do ipv6 @ uniteddomains
19:47 < laxa> dunno what's that
19:47 < laxa> I don't know if ipv6 is used yet
19:48 <@deen> it's harder to ddos because noone uses it
19:48 <@deen> GER ipv6 never went down
19:48 < laxa> you don't have an ipv6 on the FRA server right ?
19:48 < laxa> but you have one on GER server ?
19:48 <@deen> yes, i do
19:48 <@deen> on both
19:48 < laxa> and no one ever attacked it ?
19:49 < laxa> oh you mean
19:49 < laxa> you can't use their DNS to redirect to IPV6 right ?
19:49 <@deen> well, it's not even public
19:49 <@deen> yeah
19:50 <@deen> fra.ddnet.tw should work now
19:50 <@deen> Pinging at least :P
19:50 < laxa> dns propaged already ? :)
19:50 < laxa> 176.31.125.151
19:50 < laxa> ?
19:51 <@deen> yes
19:51 < laxa> so you say
19:51 < laxa> that if I use my dns
19:51 < laxa> to redirect to IPV6 instead of IPV4
19:51 < laxa> I'll be less vulnerable to ddos ?
19:52 <@deen> yeah
19:52 < laxa> Hum...
19:52 < laxa> Your IPV6 on GER isn't public, why would anyone attack it lol then ?
19:52 <@deen> ^^
19:52 <@deen> exactly!
19:52 < laxa> btw
19:52 < laxa> megaman is back on skype
19:52 < laxa> don't know if you noticed
19:53 < laxa> haven't talked to him though
19:53 <@deen> i know, i told him to go on in skype
19:53 <@deen> well, i told his wife
19:54 <@deen> now the difficult part, connecting the database into the network
19:55 < laxa> you can do that
19:55 < laxa> prefix.ddnet.tw
19:55 < laxa> but
19:55 <@deen> i'm always thinking for minutes how to do it to prevent any ranks from being lost
19:55 < laxa> can you do that : ddnet.suffix.tw ?
19:55 <@deen> no, of course not
19:55 < laxa> weird
19:55 < laxa> ddnet.net.gg is more espensive
19:55 < laxa> than ddnet.gg
19:55 < laxa> oh it's not
19:56 < laxa> but you need to have a guernsey passport for it
19:56 <@deen> probably
19:56 < laxa> what type of record in DNS is ipv6 ?
19:57 <@deen> AAAA
19:58 < laxa> I can do that at Online !
19:59 < laxa> How can you lose ranks if you connect your database before launching the servers oO ?!
19:59 <@deen> complicated
20:00 < laxa> Ok ! Going to eat, brb.
20:00 <@deen> the databases are connected in a circle
20:00 <@deen> i have to open the circle, insert the new server and set everything to resync
20:33 <@deen> FRA running
20:33 <@deen> ping looks more stable for many =)
20:49 < laxa> Nice
20:49 < laxa> deen: how can I get my IPV6 adress ?
20:50 < laxa> It looks like this on "ifconfig", but doesn't seem good for the dns record : fe80::ea9a:8fff:fe13:8474/64
20:56 <@deen> no idea
21:25 <@deen> Savander: ddnet FRA
21:25 < Savander> savander hmm??
21:25 <@deen> DDNet FRA running
21:25 <@deen> new servers!
21:25 <@deen> ddos protected
21:25 < Savander> nice
21:25 < Savander> ;]
21:26 < Savander> so
21:26 < Savander> tournamnets soon
21:26 < Savander> ?
21:26 < Savander> ;D
21:27 <@deen> 21 September, Kobra 3
21:27 <@deen> is the current plan
21:28 < Savander> oki
21:28 < Savander> ;]
21:28 < Savander> not bad ping
21:28 < Savander> like ddmax :P :D
21:48 < laxa> deen: please test server for FRA :p
21:48 < laxa> so Lady Saavik will stop to be mad
21:54 <@deen> done
21:54 < laxa> deen: thanks
21:54 < laxa> now playing fly out of hell
21:55 < laxa> you'll see that I can finish 5 stars solo map :p
22:28 < laxa> deen: artkis is OK to make video for us
22:28 < laxa> deen: for you I mean xD
22:28 < laxa> for the hall of fame
22:30 < laxa> you need to find a time that could be good enough for people to make good ranks
22:41 <@deen> ?
22:41 < laxa> you don't remember me talking to you about Hall of Fame
22:41 < laxa> you even said it was not a bad idea
22:41 < laxa> :p
22:46 <@deen> can't you organize it without me?
22:46 < laxa> Well
22:46 < laxa> if you say I can
22:46 < laxa> yeah
22:46 < laxa> but we will need some things from you
22:46 <@deen> make a thread in the forum, collect maps, make videos, i put them on DDNet
22:46 < laxa> like a webpage :p
22:46 <@deen> but artkis' videos are weird
22:46 <@deen> i sent him a record by myself
22:46 < laxa> ddrace video are pretty simple to make
22:46 <@deen> you can't find it in youtube search and noone watches it
22:46 < laxa> nothing fancy
22:47 < laxa> link ? xD
22:47 < laxa> and we have yet to determine the time to wait before making the video too
22:47 < laxa> 1 week ? 2 weeks ? 1 month ?
22:48 <@deen> i don't understand
22:48 <@deen> http://youtu.be/LggaeXL66eA
22:48 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Race[7] - deen & Fudgyking | Rating: 5.00/5.00 | Views: 991
22:50 < laxa> 1000 views is pretty cool for tw deen :p
22:50 < laxa> well
22:50 <@deen> ...
22:51 < laxa> what oo ?
22:51 <@deen> Even my own videos got more views: http://youtu.be/qCP_Wj-ILtY
22:51 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Teeworlds DDRace Adrenaline 3 | Rating: 4.93/5.00 | Views: 4,838
22:51 <@deen> and you can find it with the search
22:51 < laxa> No idea why
22:51 < laxa> that I know why
22:52 < laxa> the principe of Hall of Fame is like that : a map is released, people play, run maps, try to run the map. We have to decide how much time we wait before taking #1 and making a video of it.
22:53 <@deen> eh, no
22:53 <@deen> don't like that idea at all, not going to happen
22:54 < Savander> weird
22:54 < Savander> its not weird
22:54 < Savander> you need to make good titles
22:54 < Savander> race[7] isn't good
22:54 < Savander> xd
22:55 < laxa> wtf
22:55 < laxa> you said it was good before oO
22:55 <@deen> i understood it very differently
22:55 < laxa> What you understood ?
22:55 <@deen> just good videos of races
22:56 < laxa> What's wrong with my idea oO ?
22:56 < laxa> #1 should make good race
22:56 <@deen> I'm really getting tired of these discussions with you every day =/
22:56 <@deen> i have to defend every single thing i do and you have so many ideas
22:56 < laxa> <_<
22:57 < laxa> You rejected nearly everyone of my ideas !
22:57 <@deen> yeah, but i spent hours thinking about them
22:59 < Savander> :(
23:00 < laxa> Well, I guess we won't have hall of fame then
23:00 < laxa> sad story
23:01 < laxa> deen: just so you know, they are weird bots on GER
23:01 < laxa> spamming hook + fire at start
23:01 <@deen> yeah, lots of people are working on bots recently
23:01 < laxa> hooking people to block them
23:02 < laxa> they have been kicked :p
23:04 <@deen> i think my change yesterday actually reduced lags on full servers
23:04 <@deen> i get much more stable ping
23:08 <@deen> and actually i think i added more ideas by you, laxa, than by anyone else
23:11 < laxa> yeah maybe, I do that for the greater good :p
