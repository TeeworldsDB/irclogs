10:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> jesus fucking christ
10:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i can use reddit and roblox tho
10:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
10:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its magic
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> they may have other emergency backends, idk Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ if I have more info, I'd tell you
10:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> damn
10:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can't even imagine how much something like this must cost
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> bad day for having shares

10:19 < bridge> <Melon> :pepe_stonks_down: :pepe_stonks_down: :pepe_stonks_down: :pepe_stonks_down:
10:19 < bridge> <Melon> at least my gacha games work :froggo_sip:
10:20 < bridge> <Assa> I can still do nouis on my phone, all fine ðŸ™‚
10:24 < bridge> <Assa> aws is not simply just down, probably some routing/network/firewall shit again
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** did ryo get a job at amazon?
10:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xddd
10:31 < bridge> <Assa> xD he just started a backup
10:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wayland is actually useless
10:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it keeps hiding the window close buttons for me
10:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and also hides windows entirely when i try to resize
10:36 < bridge> <Assa> are there alternatives besides xorg?
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> Not really, everything else is toy projects
10:54 < bridge> <Teero> wait 2 more years
11:11 < bridge> <Assa> I wouldn't say useless, without it I can't play whqd on my ubuntu laptop ddnet
11:11 < bridge> <Assa> thefore it has a single use case :3
11:11 < bridge> <Assa> therefore it has a single use case :3
11:12 < bridge> <Melon> you use.. buttons to close windows?
11:12 < bridge> <Melon> 
11:12 < bridge> <Melon> How dare you say that in front of my TWM
11:27 < bridge> <Assa> I also use buttons on my keyboard for that :thonk:
11:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hmm I donâ€™t see the chat message when a player gets banned in the logs
11:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did I mess that up?
11:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i can reproduce with ddnet omg
11:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Tee Window Manager?
12:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t use the buttons it still looks weird when they are bugged away
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Still better than bugging half the window away like the tor browser likes to do it in Wayland
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or the ENTIRE window
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like wireshark or ddnet
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just fully invisible with no way to recover it
12:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 you have 2 days to rebase https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10049 if you fail to meet the deadline i will do it for you
15:06 < bridge> <smetanolub> @developer make inp_mousesens integer pls
15:07 < bridge> <smetanolub> cant make inp_mousesense 2.xx
15:07 < bridge> <smetanolub> with high dpi it matters
15:08 < bridge> <0xdeen> float you mean
15:09 < bridge> <0xdeen> we don't support float configs I think
15:10 < bridge> <Teero> yea. idk why though. its trivial to implement.
15:11 < bridge> <Teero> we also don't have float sliders
15:12 < bridge> <Melon> The Internet being anonymous xd

15:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is a pending pr with it
15:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Valid crashout imo
15:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich knows I have a pending pr fixing that exact thing and he decided to conflict me anyways
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He could also just have merged my pr
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If I open such PRs robsi closes me
15:24 < bridge> <smetanolub> idk?? we can dp zoom 9.52 but cant do sens 9.52 that sucks
15:24 < bridge> <smetanolub> idk?? we can do zoom 9.52 but cant do sens 9.52 that sucks
15:36 < bridge> <kebscs> What about just a game flag?
15:37 < bridge> <kebscs> Shouldn't complicate the code
15:54 < bridge> <Teero> hehe my demo library works :)

16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> now add offscreen rendering support
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then it's gg
16:10 < bridge> <Teero> no no, this exports demo files for ddnet xd
16:10 < bridge> <Teero> this is not my own rendering yet
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then it's no gg
16:19 < bridge> <Teero> dw im working on it
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then it will be gg
18:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> zoom isnt stored to config
18:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich is working on ddnet today, pog
19:07 < bridge> <Assa> I like how the tile space conversion shader was moved faster than the other pure C++ PR doing a similar thing
19:14 < bridge> <learath2> I wish heinrich would come back to discord sometime ðŸ˜„
19:26 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i feel like he is lurking at least in irc
