10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pff
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nothing compared to win updtaes
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont mind updates even taking an hour
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was playing ddnet brutal for 30 mins then my pc shutdown and installed windows10 without asking me
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd love to see what it's doing tho
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that sucks
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh no i accidentally pushed 2 different commits in one pullrequest .-.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont like how this works why doesnt github let me choose in what pullrequest i want my commits in.
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon you should use different branches for different pull requests
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the way github lets you choose what commits go into which PR

13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> hey! Does anyone know in what file can I edit the stars location (stars that appear when tee is falling in freeze)? It should be possible to change it on server side, right?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it is
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> character.cpp i think
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah no
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gamecontext
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast in vanilla server
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> character.cpp in ddnet server
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> DDRaceTick()
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> what is the name of that stars?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> search for CreateDamageInd
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> in this file
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i guess ud edit the stars by changing what u pass to this
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ah, I see. That is what I wanted, thanks!
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or going to gamecontext.cpp and editing the fn itself
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> np
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> branches are crazy complicated o.O
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not git god
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are a easy thing
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen so should i delte my pr and do everything agian?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this is what you want https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628563/move-the-most-recent-commits-to-a-new-branch-with-git#1628584
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> Create two new branches (1 branch per PR), both based on the current master
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> force rebase your branches onto the current ddnet master and skip one of the commits (one time for your current PR and the other teamkill stuff)
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @cinaera sounds complicated af
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> @Learath2 hah i can imagine that super slow updating cuz of my bad internet.

17:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ChillerDragon: if you're familiar w/ other VCSes, git branches can be a bit odd
17:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> compared to traditional branches they are probably a bit misnamed
17:30 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/GitConcepts#Branch_model   
17:30 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> not sure what systems you're familiar w/
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not familiar with anything .-.
17:31 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ah...
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye sucks
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen ban him for wasting traffic
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, I wasted much more with time.gif
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ðŸ˜„
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> If i would put time.gif in my forum signature at midnight, would it run correctly forever?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't matter when you put time.gif in your signature I think
21:16 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> is time.gif one of those links to a remote server that dynamically generates a gif with the correct time?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's see how discord's servers handle this
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://hookrace.net/time.gif
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> awww.. no preview
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> @deen better fix it or it will be 1m tomorrow
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> lol
21:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> server isn't even loading for me
21:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> hanging
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> worstwish the god typing here
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hookrace.net 35.196.69.119 - - [05/Mar/2018:21:18:29 +0100] "GET /time.gif HTTP/1.1" 200 3716 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Discordbot/2.0; +https://discordapp.com)" 8.678
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 the bot tried for 9 seconds, then timed out I guess
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Googlebot keeps trying all the time, for 3 minutes each time
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nemo: browser?
21:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> now that chrome supports apng it can be fun to prank people with a link like http://m8y.org/images/static.png  only... to one of those jump gifs
21:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> people are suspicious of .gif, they aren't of .png yet
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, since file ending doesn't matter, you could always do that with .jpg as well
21:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: it's probably the network here. they block everything fun
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> deen: yeah. that only works if you control the server tho
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nemo: it works with imgur
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> not always possible if you're on a forum
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> oh??
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 just wanted to write the same, haha
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can just specify any file ending
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can upload a gif with .jpg ending
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and they show it
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> seriously...
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> link?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can also specify any of the file endings
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> independent of the actual one
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it always gives the same format
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> does that work on that awful suck main urls, or on the i.imgur.com ones too?
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.imgur.com
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dunno about the others
21:22 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> nice
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://i.imgur.com/U7QHF7H.jpg
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can actually write any file ending you want, even after uploading
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen was faster in finding a sample image
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 GG wp
21:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> cool. will have to remember that for pranking purposes
21:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> people trust imgur way more than my server
21:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> does that work with videos too?
21:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> webm w/ .jpg ending?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sound? you're evil
21:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Or he is pranked too much. And he want revenge
21:30 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> someone on HN was talking the other day about being at a convention and someone was rickrolling them with a directional mic
21:31 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> need to build one of those...
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rickrolling with a directional mic? how does that work?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on the 34c3, they had a fancy laser thingie in the main building
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they projected the lyrics of never gonna give you up to the wall
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> took a bit until I noticed what I was reading ðŸ˜„
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nemo: do you go to the ccc?
21:32 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I live in the US
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and have small kids
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> er. directional *speaker* not mic
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> sorry
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, US, fair enough
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> koda and sheepluva often go
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> there was a hedgewars event this year. often is
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> that's the extent of my involvement
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> wish I could go
21:34 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I went to the google mentor summit for GSoC once
21:34 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> not neaaaarly as much fun as CCC I'm sure
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know, haven't been involved with GSoC yet
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but maybe you can come in a couple of years, when your kids are old enough ðŸ˜›
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's probably quite expensive to go to europe from the US
21:35 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> depends on time of year
21:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I've visited europe a few times. if you buy well in advance and get deals, it isn't too bad
21:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> could combined ccc w/ visiting family or something
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should ðŸ˜‰ it's a unique experience IMO
