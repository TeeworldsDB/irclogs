03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Suggestion: seperate france servers and other europe servers from countries filter in ddnet tab
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> since i have bad ping on france server
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> since i have bad ping on france servers
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can search for "fra" or "eur" if you want to do it today
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and the only way to filter it out is to use exclude search bar
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh, "ger"
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but there is also poland
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does searching for "ddnet ger" work?
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and nobys fng which doesnt fall into the same category
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i mean it would
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I know it was seperated before when the only eur servers were ger1 and ger2
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savalic> since the last update, my client always closes when I map in the editor with shift. i.e. if I hold shift and drag freeze over several tiles
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savalic> is it just me or does anyone else have some trouble with that?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savalic> happens like in 1 out of 15 times
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yep i have the same but its not only since the last update.
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and i get random crashes too when im mapping
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet editor very unstable
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> suggestions :-Add a fonction that you can activated or desactivated to hide messages in the chat that uses "bad words",
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> It could look like this :
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> 
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> Select ‚ÄúBlocked Terms and Phrases.‚Äù
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> Set up words and phrases which will automatically be blocked in chat
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> Agreed, i think two additions that could improve this idea would be a txt based filter to make sharing block lists easier, and maybe letting users use regex to make blocking variations / combinations of words easier

15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u can get nouis ingame xd
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly? xd
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```vec2 TrollPos = vec2(-100000000, -100000000); // -3.125.000 ingame

15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the further u go the more wicked it gets, also the cursor gets buggy af xd but the -3mio is still "fine"
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> floating point stuff i guess
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i found the nouis thing funny xd

15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 does anyone have a pr laying around that fixes the corner case? I want to avoid it in special situations
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember anyone fixing it, but it shouldn't be too hard to fix
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could just always slip in the direction of gravity
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this what i think !?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you hit the corner at 45degrees exactly, pretend it's 46 degrees
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> smart
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> isnt it also for non 45?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't exactly remember the if statement to catch the corner case
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ive seen it
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if(Hits == 0)
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I've applied the fix for stoppers to go through them by heinrich and I now wonder how to handle corner cases, because with enough speed u can skip through a corner
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, that's what you mean? That's not really the corner case
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, i think ur right xd
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> used wrong name sowwy
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What corners can you skip? I don't think you can skip proper collision tiles that way
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its 2 stopper being diagonally to each other
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u can skip through that somehow
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 4 way stoppers? You need to tell me the exact setup because stoppers are just weird
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> TILE_STOPA
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 4 way yes
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1258
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i've had the ddnet moverestrictions way before and now added this
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/931554770110545980/unknown.png
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess the "corner case" would belong here?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uff, I think only @heinrich5991 would know this one as I'm not completely sure how the skip is happening exactly
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The move restrictions should be correct even if you are going straight through the center at 45deg
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is an explanation above
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This isn't ddnet code though
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't have a DirTwoway anywhere in the code
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It got removed again because it broke maps
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it serves my purposes and idk why it could break maps, i think heinrich only knows more
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/931556274024378458/ddnet.exe_2022.01.14_-_15.31.04.07.mp4
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats a 255 speedup i think
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you are able to get under this 18 subtiles border and pass through it, you are technically "on the other side"
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1258/files#diff-a0e5d95915df938ffb0e9b9b879a2e56b1459be64eda405ac51aad4b5763d9d5R619
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is that even TILE_STOPA?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> laser doors use TILE_STOPA, those are just laserwalls created by my ingame editor tool
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but they behave 1:1 the same
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess you are just clipping into them far enough that you end up on the other side at which point the moverestrictions are flipped around and you can drop to the other side
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> exactly
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> those speedups are also built using the tool btw :P
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess the issue here is that speeders are handled before moverestrictions are recalculated
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that was my guess too at first
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because handleskippabletiles is before handletiles
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could you try moving the recalculation of m_MoveRestrictions out of HandleTiles and do it before calling HandleSkippableTiles?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is there a reason for this order btw?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or can i just call skippables after handletiles
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't try
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD same
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gimme a sec
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That code is an absolute mess trying to keep old behaviour from ddrace 0.5
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do you happen to know what the OverrideCenterTileIndex is used for in GetMoveRestrictions()? i see what it does but dont understand it's need, as i couldnt refind it in the sent pr^
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Still clips
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, don't have any more time to look into it, heinrich will probably know what causes it given he fixed skipping/clipping into them once
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no problem
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <—ïŒ±‚àÇ‚ÑìœÉŒΩ—îüñ§> o no don't fix this bug pls its good bug
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <—ïŒ±‚àÇ‚ÑìœÉŒΩ—îüñ§> i found an other bug for go through laser
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <—ïŒ±‚àÇ‚ÑìœÉŒΩ—îüñ§> send me a screen of all blmapchill i will see u
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <—ïŒ±‚àÇ‚ÑìœÉŒΩ—îüñ§> send me a screen of all blmapchill i will surround
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <—ïŒ±‚àÇ‚ÑìœÉŒΩ—îüñ§> @fokkonaut
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> guys i have a question. i usually hhave 2400 fps
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> but when in f1 console there are 27~ pages of text my fps drops to 1600-1800
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> why is that?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> is there some setting to lock console to save only last 15 pages?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> clear_local_console helps but its manual thing im lazy to do
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <—ïŒ±‚àÇ‚ÑìœÉŒΩ—îüñ§> did u set fps limit in ur ddnet settings?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> no
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like a bug Smetanolub
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/929936505131114567
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should we rly be concerned u get 1600 fps instead of 2400
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the same happens when u tab in a 64p server
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just have to render more text
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah, rendering a lot of text is bound to lead to some fps drop
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes it happens even with 4 pages of text
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> maybe if the drop is caused by having a large backlog in the console, something could be optimized there
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it only loads 1 on screen at a time anyway
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> has anyone looked at this bug yet
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it still happens
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Smetanolub does the fps drop happen even if the console isn't open?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I am losing my mind here i got a delay in tw since days it feels like 80 ping but it shows a 30-50 ping any idea how to debug this? I called my internet provider but they dont really do well with me lagging in tw \:D the speedtest is fine
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ctrl backspace works for me in console
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> hey devs, it is possible to scale down the chat size ?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you have any idea about @fokkonaut's stopper clip issue?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you need to use two stopper wide lines if you want a diagonal wall
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant as in where in the code the clipping happens
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the fix tried to maintain backward compaitibility by still allowing people to clip into stoppers, just until you'd get through
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the logic used doesn't work for diagonal walls though, I think
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> yes
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> may be you are using not full screen mode? it cause dellay
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> may be you are using not full screen mode? it cause delay
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki @Robyt3 seems to be unrelated to the rendering
