18:46 < ubuntusr> hey
19:09 < goo> deen, and any others involved in ddnet client development very good work! super! added an update feature, thats hectic!
19:31 <@deen> Thanks
19:31 <@deen> hi kamillentee 
19:38 < goo> deen: is the map votelist done in source code or by config?
19:38 <@deen> config
19:39 <@deen> eh
19:39 <@deen> neither nor
19:39 <@deen> I have custom python scripts for it
19:39 < goo> ok
19:39 < goo> was wondering how to do headings without having to vote them, so it can be browsed like meny..
19:39 <@deen> mhm
19:39 <@deen> Could be done
19:40 <@deen> in the server
19:40 <@deen> so that heading votes only count for each client
19:40 <@deen> and don't affect others
19:40 <@deen> but i decided against it
19:40 <@deen> instead we have these votes and /map
19:40 <@deen> (which is currently disabled because of a bug)
19:41 < goo> so the python makes the headers?
19:41 <@deen> yes
19:43 < goo> is the python part of building, or can it be added after?
19:43 <@deen> i don't understand
19:43 <@deen> part of building what?
19:44 <@deen> ah, not part of compilation
19:44 < goo> the executable
19:44 <@deen> nono
19:44 <@deen> it just creates the configs
19:44 < goo> ok, but how is a heading added?
19:44 <@deen> actually i have a lot of scripts that create everything for ddnet
19:44 <@deen> i have a simple file
19:44 <@deen> and add an entry like
19:44 <@deen> 3|Kobra 2|Zerodin
19:44 <@deen> which the script parses
19:45 < goo> because i added a heading with add_vote, but then it needs to pass before i see sub menu
19:46 <@deen> yeah, same here
19:52 < goo> i ask Broken a question yesterday, but i dont think he got same meaning as me. how do you prevent map edit exploited records from getting into global database?
19:55 <@deen> i remove the exploited records by hand
19:55 <@deen> and we test maps properly before
19:55 <@deen> so bugs are rare
19:55 < goo> so you dont have problems with servers that edit a tele into map and gets cheated times?
19:56 <@deen> oh, that's what you mean
19:56 <@deen> I run all DDNet servers myself :P
19:56 <@deen> fully automatically
19:56 < goo> ok
19:56 <@deen> noone interfers with the maps
19:56 < goo> including other countries?
19:56 <@deen> yes
19:59 < goo> i dont mind if thats how it is done even if i buy hosting for south africa, but atm it is likely that i will be getting free hosting at an isp who provides a gaming service
20:01 < goo> but i will see what Zodiac ends up doing
20:02 <@deen> ok
20:03 < goo> i will have some limitations, ofcourse free will cause this, but i dont think zodiac wants to have ddnet servers per se, but wants to incorporate the features into omod
20:03 < goo> id rather have ddnet server south africa
20:04 < goo> with a vps
20:04 < goo> but cant afford it as a student.
20:06 <@deen> yeah, i tried talking to zodiac about that
20:06 <@deen> in december
20:07 <@deen> he said he had a plan for cooperating
20:07 <@deen> but never sent me anything
20:07 <@deen> and it's hard to find a good vps in SA
20:08 < goo> will try discuss with gamezone if they can put teeworlds servers on its own vps, and give remote access, rather than how they currently set it up
20:08 <@deen> ok, that would be really nice
20:29 < goo> what i meant by i will have some limitations was regarding going to a gamezone xD, just incase there was confusion, i wouldnt limit what you can do if i had a vps xD
20:30 < goo> will i be allowed to host other servers like zcatch, openfng mods, or would you prefer to not have me fiddle with a vps?
