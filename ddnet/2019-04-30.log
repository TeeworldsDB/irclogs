03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cyonns> Hello I want to report that I installed DDNet from scratch on my 32-bit Windows 7 PC, and everything seemed to be fine until I realized that the game doesn't work at all.  No server appears in the list even modifying the filters.
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> master servers are down
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cyonns> Ohh so that is!
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cyonns> Although I still think the 32-bit version has some errors.
03:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cyonns> In the filters section I can't select which countries to view.  Since they do not load the images of the flags of each country to select them.
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cyonns> Even before this problem, other errors occurred, for example, I could only connect to servers through the "internet" tab.  because the others never worked.
03:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cyonns> I know this is a free and voluntary development so I just hope someone can take the time to fix it.  To help those like me who don't know about programming.

18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> i have same
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> only ddnet works
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sounds like you canâ€™t retrieve info file
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> 
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/572823031320150018/unknown.png
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> LOL
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> when you choose INFO you cant find servers from internet xD
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CloudlÃ­nK> omg xD
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CloudlÃ­nK> in my case only the internet tab works the other tabs DDNet, KoG, continue not working
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CloudlÃ­nK> lol thanks @texnonik nic at least I can make the internet tab work
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Djinngus> internet doesnt work for me
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CloudlÃ­nK> lol thanks @texnonik at least I can make the internet tab work
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CloudlÃ­nK> try unchecking the option to see the maps you already finished @Djinngus
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Djinngus> what
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CloudlÃ­nK> in the filters section
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for the ddnet and kog tabs could you show me your console log?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> masters are under attack
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> upgrade to 0.7 :troll:
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Djinngus> who tf is attacking even
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably oy
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wanting ppl to update to 0.7 xd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Djinngus> syltoox :troll:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> are votes fucked again or are they fucked still?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what texnonic tried to point out is that if you currently join an empty server, any mapvote will most likely instantly fail
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what texnonic tried to point out is that if you currently join an empty server, any mapvote will most likely fail instantly f

20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (quite annoying btw)
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cant reproduce for me votes work fine
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> @Djinngus nice ðŸ˜„ read before xD https://gyazo.com/950ba931e61af072885e6ad8b911c4ed
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> thx for fast fix https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1695
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am really wonder why nobody reported it before because I lost already a lot of work even being aknowledged about it
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I suggest to force the release a little
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @BannZay well in the past it gave an error but didn't shut down. That was also new for me. So i also lost a bit of work now xD not much tho.
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> people reported it but they were not clear about it
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I didn't get it
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> maybe we could try to drop map to some temporary file on app crash so it give a chance to prevent data loss
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> some progamers here? when i enable open gl 3.3, my game stucks every few seconds
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> shakes
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> whatever, cant explain it well. have an idea? have rx580 newest amd driver
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Djinngus> :thonkery: opengl shiz
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> 
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/572867626079092736/1.JPG
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Djinngus ddnet uses opengl 2 if u dont have 3 enabled so u r always using it
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Shyzo | Alex u are not logging right
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make sure logfile in console shows nothing
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> can it also be cpu/ram issue? because I think with other hardware components (ryzen 5 2600, ddr4 3200 ram, asrock b450 pro4) i didnt have this problem. same graphics card though
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got a ryze 5 2600 ddr4 2933 and b450 mb and a r9 390
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no issues
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh other?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does ur current pc have xd
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> ye with this hardware i also didnt have issues i think. but with with same graphics card but other cpu/mainboard/ram i have. so idk
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur cpu is too bad it might bottleneck but idk if should happen in tw xd
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> current is rx 580, cpu 6600k, ddr4 2133 ram, and msi b250m pro-vdh
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> nah its not that bad xd
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Alex the person try opengl on but disable quality textures and high detail
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Alex the person btw
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Shyzo | Alex
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shit  i pinged another dude
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u have igpu enabled
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u do disable it
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its for integrated graphics only
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/572869386009051146/unknown.png
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> ryozuki. disable fsaa dude xD it lags
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no it doesnt for me
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> it does. you only dont notice
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt trust me i know
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It might add a single frame, right?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> well, if you say so. try insane gores maps with and without. you will notice a difference im 200% sure :D but for ddrace its whatever
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but with vsync off it probably doesn't matter
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have 144hz
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> me2
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> igpu is disabled already
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried on and without beforee enablign it
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt notice anything
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> ye, you dont notice immediatly. i had it on for long time and thought everything is fine^^
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it might also depend on driver
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Like on Windows I notice a delay with vsync while on Linux I don't
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> oh ok
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> "try opengl on but disable quality textures and high detail"
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> tried
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> no difference other than my entities looking like crap xD
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> logfile value also nothing
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Why you wanna use opengl then?
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> i dont want to use it. its just for testing purposes. because @Jupstar âœª doesnt believe me
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs my brother has same gpu xd
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hes ATH nobo and cant believe ddnet works just as fine, we tried everything, compiling all libs and clients for his architecture and stuff like that, now with his new pc same GPU he suddenly has laggs with OGL 3.3, its all strange
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he even tried linux xD
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think the electromagnetic field of the northpool is just moving towards his home, destroying all hardware he has.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ath sucks
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> im ath nobo, thats right. but i dont complain about that anymore. 
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> its just really weird that the same gpu makes problems now with opengl3.3 and didnt before on the other hardware
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> (im not making this up)
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> we havent compiled everything for me, liarrrrr
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Teeworlds is strange, i am used to lags:feelsbadman:  i never get good in my conditions xD
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the client and sdl
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rest is just loading stuff xd
