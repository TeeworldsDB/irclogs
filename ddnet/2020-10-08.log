16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to write redirects from the maps filenames with CRC to the maps with SHA256
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nginx's built in matching engine only supports case-insensitive matching or (probably costly) regular expressions
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I guess I'll have to write a service that nginx will then connect to
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how should I implement this, so that this service can run 10 years without me touching it?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Are you sure regex is too expensive?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I'm not
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd do that first. my assumption is the regex can be compiled once and should perform well enough for us for 10 years
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if we see nginx cpu performance problems, we can investigate
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was thinking about my map collection, but can investigate for ddnet maps too
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the documentation kinda implied that it matches the regexes linearly
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 that's so we can offer downloads for KoG?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good thinking
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll implement it for ddnet's maps too
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > the documentation kinda implied that it matches the regexes linearly
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and at 50k regexes, that sounds too expensive
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I didn't try it. do you think I should give it a try? @deen
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, you need one regex per map?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought just one regex for all, too bad
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just make symlinks on filesystem? ðŸ˜„
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess that could work, but that doesn't give me the nginx redirect I was looking for
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (need to be more precise with my requirements ^^)
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why a redirect specifically?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. good question
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't want to list them in the file listing anymore, but I guess that can also be achieved by rendering the file list myself
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the case insensitivity is annoying with Windows too btw
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> uwsgi + python is what we generally use for stuff like that in ddnet, but I don't know how stable it is in the long run
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nginx made a thing called nginx unit
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://unit.nginx.org/
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://unit.nginx.org/configuration/#configuration-python  :monkalaugh:

16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you use go u get even better perfomance
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763772900980817960/1Q-SA_KuLJQA9xswHj8b3Iw.png

16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it probs is a typo
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh nginx unit supports assembly, wanna re do the ddnet site in x86_64 assembly?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would still like to know what caused these bugs
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> Wait that also includes writing it in c++ and disasemblying it right?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> map download bug and the other one
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Soreu I replaced the grass_main tile bitmaps with svgs on https://zillywoods.github.io/ZillyWoods-web/ any comments/suggestions?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: You probably don't need to disassemble it, I'm sure they just run any binary you want
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> lol ok true
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> then lets write it in shell and compile to binary using the shellcompiler
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, they actually mean assembly lol
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller and his shell addiction
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ChillerDragon my only comment for now if that I seriously fcked something up xd
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763774385232281610/Screenshot_2020-10-08-16-46-05-673_com.android.chrome.jpg
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And no, it's not your fault
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> how?
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> is svg new for browsers? lmao
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> missing proper style for edge-cases
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nah, it's not related to change to svg
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @ChillerDragon where are the svg
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want them
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/images/tree/master/realistic/transparent
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd also a full mapres?
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> i was thinking about it
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> I almost finished all parts of grass_doodads so lets see
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> 4k remastered :D
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd love to have a 4k feature for ddnet
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> so do i
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs on 2k screens tw already looks slighty blurry
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> playing tw in 4k since years
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> well ddnet comapred to vanilla looks even more blurry :p
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how so
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we updated all mapres
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> skins and hud for example
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> probably the way its rendered
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> skins yeah, and hud ur pr will fix ðŸ˜„
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> no
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> wait what hud pr?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ur game.png
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> nah
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> it still looks worse
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why not
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> idk
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> ur the gfx guy
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> tell me
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs its wasnt dilated
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> oh maybe
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it should look the same
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt check after dilate
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> so im kinda activley working on the svg remakes and will let you know if i finished a full tileset
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah nice
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> so @Soreu what is going on? Even works on my safari on iOS
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sad that tw is so closed source about that mapres and stuff
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bit annoying
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> ye
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> super sad
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> even infecteus license
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd be happy to see optional higher quality graphics too!
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> what res do u play deen?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't play
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> lol
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he plays 5:4
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It will work everywhere, mobile Chrome messes the website look after browser header gets hidden on scroll
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was once considering adding an actual vector based renderer in there
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > i don't play
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> vector render oof
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> librsvg and render graphics to a few sizes at start
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> slug is such a great idea, vector graphics in the GPU
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I watch in 1920x1080 usually
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> would that increase performance?
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> probably huh?
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> and likley nice for zoozing
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probably not
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen we could just render to the selected resolution
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the opposite ðŸ˜„
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Wait, you mean replacing all graphics with SVGs?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no game does that
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for a reason i guess
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> browser gamesÃŸ
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> ?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no they dont
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reason is probably that they don't want to give out their assets in infinite quality ðŸ˜›
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rasterization is too expensive for soo many vertices
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't underestimate the greed of large corporations
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 I'm quite sure you're right
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rendering to a texture at start is useless then too, could just pre do it
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not sure
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> fuck the large corps that made bomberman and all the other flash games i play in my browser
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª well you can render it at any resolution needed, instead of shipping MASSIVE texture files
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The new call of duty no longer fits on a 250g ssd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yea, but space is too cheap
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> CPU and ram isnt
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> well you can ship svg and let the client compile it to bitmap on client start or res change lol
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have RDR2 on ps4 still undownloaded because it would take me like a week at my third world speeds
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> newgrounds good old times
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont play flash games anymore
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> but u still have flash installed right?
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> i keep getting download popups for it
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> downloaded it twice today
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The way modern programmers treat memory and CPU would suggest they are very close to free
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but not in game
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but not in games
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763776929605222430/unknown.png
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not for tripple A titles
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> flight sym
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah thats a good example
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> its a meme tho
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why u should still write good code
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> its like crysis 2
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At startup they are quite cheap, it already takes a shit ton of time to load, no one will notice a couple extra seconds needed to render the svgs
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 i get ur point
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh factorio optimized their game quite a lot
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> factorio best
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but we dont have todo the same mistakes xd
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after ddnet
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> after teeworlds
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeworlds at the bottom
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love the idea behind the new flight sim, it takes the old idea of streaming textures and does it so well
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn't think you could stream geometry that well over a reasonable connection
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> geometry?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt the map at the client already
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or am i missing smth
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it loads stuff like google earth i guess
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just higher res
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The base of the map is there, they stream features for the map though
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but why wouldnt that be on the client already
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt the game take 100gb
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the world
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is bigger than 100gb
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ;D
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we got games that are 250gb rn
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like the modern warfare
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-doesnt-fit-on-a-single-250gb-ssd-anymore/1100-6482933/
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well probs microsoft also wants dependency of bing
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so ppl are aware of it
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean microsoft gifts u meadi markt gift cards for using bing xD
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean microsoft gifts u media markt gift cards for using bing xD
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FS2020 has most of the world in the 100g, they just stream extra geometry and extra textures
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I love to see an old idea reused like this
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://youtu.be/hEmLMpLAnM4?t=35 :poggers:
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> absoluty no flight fan, but deffs has its charm
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this guy is a real pilot
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The handling is sadly a bit arcade, I guess to pump the sales up
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very niche really. I flew on FSX a bit back in highschool
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might be much more fun on fs2020 with the world actually looking decent. On FSX there was no point to exploring, so you just did standard commercial routes and those are quiiiite boring
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> normal particles
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763820305042767882/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_12.38.03_PM.png
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> weird color particles for this guy only
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763820335840886826/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_12.48.52_PM.png
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how is this possible in team mode? @Jupstar âœª @Learath2 o-o
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on newest client?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 15005
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> two ppl reported it, other has recent version too
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> rainbow particles when?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if i changed something in particles in the last 2 years
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that possibly a server side bug
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> team colors are calced in the client
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye right
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> let me see if skin changes can affect blood color
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do they have the bug always
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or just sometimes ðŸ˜„
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Jupstar âœª it was always just for 1 tee
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i think the tee left already
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, maybe blacktee or smth?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or a whitetee
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> n
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sec ill ask for demo
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe a skin prefix thing xddd
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be funny
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it possible to get shot in the tick u are unfreezed @noby ?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe its the ninja skin
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> possible but i think its very unlikely to happen on the same tee more than once per round
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u dunno the tee name?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sec
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sent demo
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tee name Ó¼Ó¥Ï£Ò£Ó¥â±ª
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> look around 1:00 and idk his skin name
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> where is the demo xd
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i sent u
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i didnt get it
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or its still uploading xd
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> defs interesting ðŸ˜„
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its just that skin
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also it happens when they get shot and when they get spiked
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what skin is it?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah its the blood color
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wait
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> saddo i guess
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> vanilla skin
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i have a stupid suggestion, but i should to announce it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe add tips below loading box?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> funny not reproducable only in demo ðŸ˜„
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but thats enough too see what the client does
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im trying to reproduce it with that skin a
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and cant (?)
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the guy was using 0. 7 client if it matters
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, but in demo its always
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i was guessing that
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll see, maybe its indeed server side, even if i dunno how
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> are the particles rendered with transparency
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe there was a dupe render that rendered over it
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> making it more red
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everything is rendered with trans
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh i meant like are the particles not opaque
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they saw it ingame
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well look into the image
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i guess they are bit transparent in the borders
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> we cant reproduce it with that skin even
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not even with 0.7 client?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well anyway i'll debug the demo soon
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> by biggest troll
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @noby well seems like it uses the color that the server sends for the particles, but gonna test it now, just to be sure
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it only overrides the skin color itself
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh weird
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so its not a new bug?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll test it now, i'll say more about it then
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now im sure
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @noby its server side
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> CPlayer::Snap(
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ty
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pClientInfo->m_ColorBody = 65280
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will reproduce
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it new
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i guess ddnet could just override it, bcs makes more sense actually
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> time to make rainbow effect
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xDD
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @noby yes pls ðŸ’¸
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> skin color is serverside, but if GAMEFLAG_TEAMS is activated I think the client has its own team values
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes but not for particles
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt override them
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b2b3b866cdac343bef8c39ea83d3269980ebc125/src/game/client/components/effects.cpp#L169
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes it does
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_ColorBody gets set
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah it clearly uses colorbody
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> to the team color
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not renderinfo.colorbody
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dude i just tested it xd
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it uses the info from the snapshot
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `    m_RenderInfo.m_ColorBody = color_cast<ColorRGBA>(ColorHSLA(TeamColors[m_Team]));
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but effect does not use renderinfo
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it uses a different var
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true, then thats the issue xd
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> effects have to use renderinfo ofc
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes ðŸ˜„
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also here PSA: maps now use sha256 https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/
