14:54 <+minus> deen: the video in the screen section of your latest blog post is broken fyi
14:55 <+minus> also, how much did you pay for the 6700k and the tv?
14:56 <+minus> also, the curvature of the tv seems too minimal to matter. been thinking about getting a new machine with 6700k and a 40" monitor as well.
14:58 <+minus> current i5-4210U locked to 1.6GHz because of bad cooling just doesn't cut it. intel tearfree + compton with vsync additionally eats shitloads of CPU but the only way to go tear+artifact-free (~300% CPU in fullscreen, the least spent on decoding)
14:58 <@deen> minus: thanks for the notification. Strange that it's been removed
15:00 <+minus> regarding hard/software video decoding that didn't seem to make much of a difference when i last checked
15:00 <+minus> so yeah, nice post, nice setup
15:01 <@deen> the curvature has a 3 m radius, so yeah, it's not quite enough when I'm sitting 1 m from it, but better than no curvature
15:03 <@deen> 290 for the cpu, 570 for the tv
15:05 <@deen> I'm surprised how well the cooling works now
15:07 <+minus> i was looking at this monitor https://geizhals.de/iiyama-prolite-x4071uhsu-b1-a1362847.html
15:08 <@deen> that was one of the 3 on my list, including the tv i went with
15:08 <@deen> I think I read some bad reviews about it and then the curve was a bit cheaper even
15:09 <+minus> what was the third option?
15:09 <@deen> and I even used the tv function one time so far :P
15:09 <+minus> is it a smart tv?
15:09 <@deen> yeah
15:09 <+minus> ugh
15:09 <@deen> are there any tvs that are not smart tvs nowadays?
15:10 <@deen> connecting phone to tv wirelessly is nice though for showing photos
15:10 <+minus> i guess it's a nice gimmick
15:11 <+minus> 290€ for the CPU doesn't seem that much cheaper than new (340€)
15:11 <@deen> https://geizhals.de/philips-bdm4350uc-bdm4350uc-00-a1414035.html
15:11 <@deen> yeah, just 50 €, but it gave me the excuse to delid without losing warranty :P
15:11 <+minus> oh yeah, came across that one too
15:12 <@deen> ah, but that one has burn-in
15:12 <+minus> how's that an excuse though, it should still have warranty if it's used
15:12 <+minus> burn-in?
15:12 <+minus> also it's over 100€ more and is 1.1m diag, the 1m TV already looks huuuuuge
15:13 <@deen> yeah, people reported that windows status bar burns in: https://www.amazon.de/Philips-BDM4350UC-00-Monitor-DisplayPort/dp/B01CO2QT4M
15:14 <+minus> ouch
15:16 <@deen> smaller with excellent picture quality would've been BenQ BL3201PT
15:16 <+minus> 32"?
15:16 <@deen> right
15:17 <+minus> i wouldn't want that because i don't want higher DPI, just more space
15:17 <@deen> same
15:18 <@deen> didn't want to figure out if proper scaling works already and lose my precious terminus font
15:18 <+minus> exactly
15:18 <+minus> (well, except i don't use terminus)
15:19 <+minus> btw, i have the original version of your headphones :P
15:19 <@deen> haha, good choice!
15:19 <+minus> ikr
15:20 <+minus> those make a huge difference compared to the 30€ AKG 512 i had before
15:21 <@deen> I went from more expensive ones to cheap Superlux and they still sound much better
15:21 <+minus> 290€, looks sketchy https://www.amazon.de/gp/offer-listing/B016UPDKIW/
15:21 <@deen> i noticed these kinds of amazon sellers a lot lately
15:23 <@deen> pretty sure it's a scam
15:23 <+minus> yeah
15:31 <@deen> Sigh, why do I always need to tell Chilean hoster when our server is unreachable so they fix it?
15:32 <+minus> they don't monitor their shit? sounds professional
15:33 <@deen> either that or they don't like us
15:34 <+minus> ask them which one it is :D
15:38 <+minus> so after looking at a review of that iiyama monitor on amazon i kinda wouldn't buy it
