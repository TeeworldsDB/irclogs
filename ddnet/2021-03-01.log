00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I like the conspiracy theory that Rockstar left that in intentionally to show more ads during load time and force players to stay online for longer since it takes so long to connect 😄
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This has to be intended. No one could miss this
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We wouldn't miss this, I can't possibly believe a massive studio like R* can't even use a profiler
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heck you probably couldn't get me to merge json parsing with sscanf in it
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have heard that software written in huge studios can be horrible
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe it was fast enough™ while developing, because the json was smaller
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that could make sense
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still who even bothers rolling their own json parsing except for lulz?
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rapidjson and nlohmann::json both work extremely well
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> much better optimized than I could ever hope to get an implementation
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> How does Server Exploration system works? What information is exposed to non joined servers?
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok i have a great idea
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> require everyone to solve a ddrace part captcha before joining a brutal or insane server :troll:
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> noobfilter
08:16 <+ChillerDragon> your ip is exposed i guess. Im not sure but i assume every server registeres on the master server with its ip. Then when a client refreshes the server browser it gets the list of server ips and then asks every server about a info packet containing slots/gametype/playercount/name etc so at least the client ip is sent I am not sure if anything more is sent.
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao at gta
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found this thanks to codeql :monkalaugh:
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> +1 ChillerDragon,
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well when you refresh your server you're doing a "request for information (fstd/gie3to each server from
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> +1 ChillerDragon,
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well when you refresh your server you're doing a "request for information (fstd/gie3) to each server from the list that master servers returns to you
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> +1 ChillerDragon,
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well when you refresh your server you're doing a "request for information" (fstd/gie3) to each server from the list that master servers returns to you
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Oh, so that's how they sniff legitimate IPs to ddos using ip spoofing?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont click the internet tab
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all shit servers anyway
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :troll:
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> There was someone with the same issue a week ago
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/811497319321174066
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and yes, I had this aswell. 😄
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can always use status.tw
11:25 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon did a lot of users also spam u on freenode?
11:26 <+Ryozuki> https://cdn.noby.world/1614594358.png
11:26 <+Ryozuki> xd
11:26 <+Ryozuki> they are  bots, and they say some rly weird shit
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> wtf
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> how do you know who has same skill?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> points
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> so if you finish all moderates you have 3601
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> and for all insane 1494
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so the mouse only doesnt work at start?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki what was the reason IgnoreLine in chat.cpp is checked so late?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a boolean
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that stops the repeating lines
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it doesnt return directly, it only checks for that late inside that function
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well it says for the log
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it also allocates the line
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (the new line)
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to make it concret, if you press U for showing all text and make a dublicated message, the message appears twice
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> once in the repeated line and once at the top of all chat messages
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ afaik deen changed that for the log
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe he knows
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok @deen ^
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> no Ryozuki but murii from ##oodnet is 
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Versions
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i generated it with this script https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Talk:Versions
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> js hacker
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen or @heinrich5991 do you know where is the script that generates https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to modify it to add it to the wiki too
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, have you checked ddnet-web, ddnet-scripts?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki I just run create.sh from here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/tree/master/client
16:05 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/client/commands.py
16:06 <+Ryozuki> this looks related
16:06 <+Ryozuki> ah i see
16:06 <+Ryozuki> thanks
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu Do you still use WinXP? Can you please test https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3662 I can send you the build if you can't access it directly
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (or anyone else who still has WinXP access)
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u run create.sh from the ddnet base dir?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think soreu wont be active anymore
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i tag him a while ago too, and he didnt respond
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, too bad
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> 1. Can moderator see player IPs
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> 2. If 1 is true, can someone see what IPs that moderator watched?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, they can. We have logs for 1 day of moderator actions, but if a mod runs `status` with a previous `show_ips 1` they will see all IPs
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> F, it may be too late. I'm suspicious that Soo dox people on rus blocker
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> F, it may be too late. I suspect that Soo dox people on rus blocker
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen @heinrich5991 https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Settings_and_Commands
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay!
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But should we have duplicated information?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sorry, I should have said that when you asked for the link already 😄
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it fits more to be in the wiki
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont mind
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> anyways can you please check wheter Soo (or Skrill) was issuing any ip checks yesterday?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Every mod will use status, so I assume so
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you have a problem about a mod, then report it *privately* to an admin
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> personally i think the wiki should aim to have all the possible info
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> less the maps and ranks
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa - OaSch> hello how i can add blue color on the `test` gametype?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa - OaSch> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/815977760296140850/unknown.png
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its client side, so only by changing client
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 what about adding an entry m_Color to the serverinfo for the gametype
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could maybe be done while doing the tokens for serverinfo
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just a colorcode that could be sent
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> next up server icon gif support :D
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nah
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not teeish
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/index.php?title=Main_Page&useskin=material
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at this skin
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most modern wiki ever
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (its a preview)
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/815988457028452375/unknown.png
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a bit buggy tho
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> not anymore haha
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Headshot
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `auto &&FChatMsgCheckAndPrint = [=](CLine *pLine) `
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ppl say rust syntax is uglier than c++
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the rust syntax is the reason i dont really want to learn it xd
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah some of the newer c++ stuff looks really weird
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but plain c syntax is pretty clean, there its more about design choices xd
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C has quirks too, e.g. due to the way they specify types
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess the best example is java vs kotlin
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kotlin looks weird and i dont see the sense in it over java
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also google wrote a converter to convert kotlin to java
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kotlin had closures before java I think
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah it probs has other advantages too
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the google android examples are always in both languages
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not an advantage anymore; they just forced java to become a better language 😉
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i always feel like kotlin looks weird xD
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a good end result, I think
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah ok 😄
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually dont see whats wrong with rust syntax
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is concise while also removing useless stuff like () in if statements that dont need it
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I could guess the ' for lifetimes
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and stuff like that
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the lifetimes is a new addition that other languages dont have
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> loop vs while(1)
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> while let if let etc
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the let stuff didnt exist before
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its an improvement
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd think "weirdness" means "stuff I don't know yet". with this definition, I can totally see how 'a (unclosed single quotes) can look weird
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean some editors will even highlight it incorrectly, because it's so uncommon in programming languages to have unclosed single quotes
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i guess
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the editor makes it not look weird
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never even thought about it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah the unknown and the explicity
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> explicity is good imho
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like adding all the let mut, fn etc
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fn?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let mut is cuz variables are immutable by default
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i know
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what the issue with fn?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> i have a vm
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its very explicit as said
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in c u just type the return type
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and if its void u type void
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fn x() {
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in rust if its "void" u dont type anything
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fn x() -> bool ...
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in c bool x()
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i think this is a matter of taste
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> indeed
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think this is particularly weird, it's just C-style vs say pascal style
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i learned pascal in school xd
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd even go so far as to say C is the outlier here
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well depends
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since java and c++ are kinda c like
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Has anyone noticed this chat render bug yet?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816017407016828999/t.png
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 just fixed it in my last pr
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yay
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ who was the blame
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen or me
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git blame :monkalaugh:
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, idc xD
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it was a mix from all
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the new chat system changed smth, that made this case obv
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if it also happened with the old one 😄
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why does macos always fail btw xd
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how is that even possible
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this was on linux btw
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean my pr failed to build
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and for some reason macos is broken often xd
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the github action builds
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazing description for the failure
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816019032452890654/lol.png
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> verbosity level: me
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess i should atleast try to use rust for stuff, where OOP isnt needed, to get used to it for future xd
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use rust where u would use oop
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its data oriented
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apart from the book this is also good https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well, oop is a rly broad word
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can implement traits for structures
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is kinda like interfaces
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i've seen that somewhere before
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 about your initial delay. I'm considering whether it would be a better idea to make this a command that temporarily sets this until the server becomes empty
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, to do it similarly to the map votes, that people joining an otherwise empty server are not affected
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your PR is probably still good, even without hte improvements
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is that not over complicating it?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which part? the latter?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the latter would help with globally setting it on all servers
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Both, it's such a tiny cute patch right now, maybe we can do some config trickery to make sure this gets disabled?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ i think rust does oop to, but in its own way
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'll become a mess if I add the auto-disable
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-01-what-is-oo.html
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 there's GameServer()->m_NonEmptySince that lets you implement the latter thing in a relatively easy way
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Rust takes a different approach, using trait objects instead of inheritance.
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well I'm not good enough to judge if this has drawbacks, or is just as good
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but good to know atleast
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is dnsbl ban not on by default?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do we even keep such an odd variable?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the map vote thing 😉
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the map vote thing even?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so people joining an empty server can start a vote, but people joining a full server can't immediately start a map vote
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I see
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that's really not what I want here
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like this kind of conditional complex behaviour
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feels like this warrants a CFGFLAG that means the option gets reset on reload
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds more overkill to me than making it a command that sets a variable that gets reset on reload
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pf, fine
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but before implementing
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you consider the other behavior complex?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "if you join an empty server, you can talk. if you join a non-empty server, you can't talk for 100 seconds"
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's conditional, conditional behaviour is hard to reason about for a player, it looks magical
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it worked fine for the map votes
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides, it's not really what is wanted either but rather a workaround that sort of achieves the same thing(maybe)
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I doubt anyone has even noticed it
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For map votes we literally wanted people to be able to vote on empty servers
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here we want this setting to not persist
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> coming from this point of view, I understand your opposition
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually no, what if you want it always on? I don't want to make this change
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could also say that you want existing players to be shielded from join→chat spam, but there's no sense in protecting an otherwise empty server from it
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if we don't want to change net code, we can make another json file for gametype colors
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if we don't want to change net code, we can make another json file for gametype colours
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but isnt that a downgrade?, having all mods in a signel color makes it easier to differenciate between them
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do you mean client side?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3664/commits/3b55d5b07057cf114c1e45d045b01626b82de7e2
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I'd also be concerend about the lack of uniformity
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3664/files#r584989463
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, i guess player can decide what does he prefer
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> why most of the zcatch server not accesable on ddnet client but only on 0.7 ?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> they are 0.7 servers
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> and there is no way to acces them from ddnet client?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'm done for the day, I wanted to do #2990 to finish up my other PR but it's just so annoying to work with UI code now
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2990
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's stuck in some confusing state where we have some stateful, some stateless UI, some only graphically cached sort of stateless UI. I guess we finally managed to create the worst of both worlds
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i fixed that today locally, but for some reason it only works for themes and skins, not for the player list in server browser
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commit/e023ff1bbb059512080c1d205f06b3ec58ebb847
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dunno when it doesnt work, atleast for skin i count reprod the bug anymore
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dunno when it doesnt work, atleast for skin i coudnt reprod the bug anymore
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This isn't really completely the correct fix but I guess it sort of works
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah its a mathematical fix, but not really nice xd
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it's good enough I think, maybe PR it
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well it doesnt work for player list in server browser
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe it uses a different list
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we have like 2 lists xd
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really need a lot of UI patches for cleanup
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Scrollregion and Listbox would be great abstractions to have
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the editor also has quite alot of dublication, bcs it doesnt use the UI code
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #3395 is fixed for normal gui, but not editor gui, even tho its the same function(just that it doesnt share the same impl anymore) xd
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3395
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was really hopeful with the editor2 branch on 0.7 but LordSk is really slow with it
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 0.7 is slow in general
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816047989684437033/unknown.png
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a professional setup
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice how fast it starts xd
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shutting down my computer with systemd for the last time
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816048480203702342/20210301_214446.jpg
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Been waiting for like 3 minutes on systemd-udev to quit but it's the final time I'm going to have to suffer through it so I'm cutting it some slack
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In an hour or so I'll finally have glorious eudev
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are u on some unstable system?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, "systemd" 😛
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i sometimes have it when a packet is broken
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stole my joke
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you wouldn't copy a joke!
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking of going btrfs this time around
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tell me how it works out
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't believe it's going down in flames for it's last shutdown
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816049540254662736/20210301_214912.jpg
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like poettering programmed it to detect it's about to get deleted and hang onto life with all it's might
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice rolling papers xd
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Haven't smoked in so long those are probably crumbling at this point
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lolol
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I might have to put it out of it's misery with sysrq
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rq
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol what does sysrq mean
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> God bless REISUB
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a key on the keyboard
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> never had one of those
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> hey, can someone help me with `cl_download_skins`? My `cl_skin_download_url` is set to `https://skins.ddnet.tw/skin/` and `cl_download_skins` is 1 but the client doesn't seem to download any skins. How is this supposed to work?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it only downloads on demand
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so only if its used ingame by anyone
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> ah i see, i thought it would sync my folder with the skin database. thanks for the reply :)
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that rly a systemd problem
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's all components of systemd that's holding the shutdown up, I can't find anyone else to blame
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> device or resource busy :monkalaugh:
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is the DNSBL stuff a library?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or how does it work (did not look into it at all yet)
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System-based_Blackhole_List
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik what it is, i mean how is it implemented in ddnet?
