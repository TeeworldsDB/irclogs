17:50 < goo> Evening
18:57 < fumoffu> hallo?
18:59  * fumoffu slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
19:43 < goo> deen, not sure if anyone else has had this idea, but what i know about teams, pretty much each taem in ddrace recreates an instance of certain layers. How would one go about implementing joining a team and voting a new map for that team only
19:44 < goo> would it be possible?
19:56 < goo> this would mean much can be done with one server
20:17 <@deen> Eeeh, why would you want that?
20:17 <@deen> Then you can't spectate other teams
20:18 <@deen> Wouldn't it be easier to just have multiple servers?
21:08 < goo> uhm, no reason, was just asking if its theoretically possible, well anything is with enough work, so maybe if its possible with using whats there already, just making small changes or additions
21:11 <@deen> no, would be pretty big changes
21:11 <@deen> in the server
22:46 < goo> when in solo, there is still a bug where lasers can affect other players in solo at same part, like the laser shooting entity
