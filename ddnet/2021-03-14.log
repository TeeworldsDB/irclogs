08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noctua> i see top3
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> cringe
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noctua> just lost

15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ping is a tough issue, due to routing there are people in germany getting worse ping than me to some GER servers
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> There is a problems with ranks on japan server
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I was thinking to update the ping when connected to the server
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The save/load issue is pretty odd. If you have larger groups of 4 or 6 players, only one person gets to load the save. The other 3 (5) can't load the save
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> have you looked into that yet @heinrich5991 ? probably related to the c api change
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have not looked into it yet

19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Would it be possible that when accessing the vote screen, the focus is on the search text box? This would be faster to search a map to vote to. What I envision is a Windows-like behavior after bringing up the Start Menu.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, I can try
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at the moment you can press ctrl-f already btw
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can we add [tab] to switch text boxes too maybe?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that one is a bit harder I think
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I'm not going to implement it
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (but would accept a PR)
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> Real news, fix pls
