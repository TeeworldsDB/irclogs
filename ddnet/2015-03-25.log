00:10 < eeeee> tsin says ok? good luck with that :D
00:14 < laxa> guys
00:15 < laxa> what's the name of the command/thing you use to give more priority to process on unix ?
00:15 < laxa> ok, I remember, it's nice
00:18 <@deen> eeeee: yeah, tsin will never say ok
00:19 <@deen> laxa: if that's your condition, we can stop the whole effort right there
00:19 <@deen> also, ionice for io priority
00:21 < Learath2> tbh maps dont belong to tsin
00:22 < laxa> well, since I took them from the official ddmax server directly
00:22 < Learath2> i think noother would say ok but dont think he cares much about tw
00:22 < laxa> I don't feel like "sharing" directly those maps to you
00:22 < laxa> I think noother would not be too worried about that idea
00:22 < laxa> though, I think he might say "ask Tsin, idc"
00:23 < Learath2> and if he says k would you still need tsin to okay it >
00:23 < Learath2> ?
00:23 < laxa> I don't wanna be the "bad" or "sneaky" guy or anything, hurt anyone etc by "giving" away those maps
00:23 < laxa> no
00:23 < laxa> since it's noother's server
00:23 < Learath2> and did you ask him 
00:23 < Learath2> ?
00:23 < laxa> for what ?
00:23 < laxa> to release the maps ?
00:24 < Learath2> yep
00:24 < laxa> well, not yet
00:24 < laxa> thought about waiting for the poll result or smt
00:24 < laxa> but he is back online on Quakenet
00:24 < ochristi> you have to ask every map creator to be correct ;)
00:24 < laxa> I can ask him
00:24 < laxa> ochristi: yep, but right now, there are 453 maps on the ddmax server
00:25 < laxa> and those mappers agreed to have their map on ddmax I guess
00:25 < ochristi> were are all crated in context to be used "on ddmax"
00:26 < Learath2> well ddmax belongs to noother and tsin who could let us host them 
00:27 < Learath2> either way idk any mapper that wouldnt want their old maps to be hosted again instead of dead
00:27 <@deen> I don't know what everyone has with asking for permissions to host maps
00:27 <@deen> not a single mapper complained about having their map hosted so far
00:27 < laxa> well, we could say those maps have open source license or anything
00:28 < laxa> I just don't want anyone to blame me ^^
00:28 <@deen> they have no license if the mapper didn't specify any, so the mapper can decide what they want to be done with the map
00:28 < laxa> I asked noother, will the his response later
00:28 < ochristi> laxa open source does not imply right to redistribute
00:28 < laxa> ochristi: yeah, if I am not mistaken, GPL license you can do everything with it right ?
00:28 <@deen> laxa: no
00:29 < eeeee> sounds like you should start licensing ddnet maps. like under cc-by or so
00:29 <@deen> eeeee: I passionately hate licenses
00:29 < Learath2> laxa: just accidentaly upload the maps to my server so i can accidentaly find them and there would be noone tp blame
00:29 < laxa> Learath2: xD
00:29 < eeeee> but licenses make these cases super clear
00:29 < Learath2> and maps arent licensed so its not  like anyone could say anything
00:29 < eeeee> if ddmax maps were cc-by then we wouldn't have to have this talk
00:30 < laxa> Learath2: the tarball is already on my server, I am just waiting to put on my public web server
00:30 < laxa> ok ok ok ok
00:30 < ochristi> yup, would be nice if that had been the case :)
00:30 < laxa> let me think about this
00:30 <@deen> Learath2: by default (in most countries) the creator has all rights, so they can just come and say "don't change a bit in my map" and you'd have to comply
00:30 < laxa> I'll say asap if I release them
00:30 < laxa> cause I think it's a shame that those maps are "dead"
00:31 < laxa> I think that 8 months and tsin hasn't done anything to put ddmax back online
00:31 < laxa> so...
00:31 <@deen> I asked Tsin about this exact idea long ago, he said no
00:31 < laxa> I might say "yes"
00:31 < Learath2> deen: and you have the right to not host the buggy maps
00:31 < laxa> deen: yup, I read about that.
00:31 <@deen> Well, actually he didn't say "no"
00:31 < Learath2> could ask tsin again if you want 
00:31 < laxa> Learath2: go on please :)
00:31 <@deen> he said "yes if you throw out all ddnet mods and admins and instantiate ddmax admins instead..."
00:31 < Learath2> thats funny 
00:32 < Learath2> the only admin i remember on ddnet was saavik and tsin
00:32 < ochristi> who cases about mod/admins?
00:32 < laxa> Learath2: I was admin too
00:32 < ochristi> *cares
00:32 <@deen> ochristi: especially since our admins aren't even active. I think none of them even have the rcon pw, haha
00:32 < laxa> anqel / aaa / tsin / saavik / obst were admins on ddmax afaik
00:32 < laxa> all of us have ftp access
00:33 < ochristi> whats this ftp, something to eat?
00:33 < Learath2> I really dislike talking to tsin but will ask tomorrow
00:33 < ochristi> last time I read about ftp was like 100 years ago :D
00:34 < eeeee> i'm on gtalk with tsin right now but not gonna ask him :P
00:35 < Learath2> eeeee: doit
01:01 <@deen> We already host many ddmax maps anyway, probably 50-100
01:32 < laxa> deen: you there ?
01:32 < laxa> https://ddracepro.net/files/DDRacemaX.rar
01:32 < laxa> HF
01:37 < eeeee> breaking news: ddmax maps leaked! hacker group takes responisility.
01:39 < fstd> tsin mad?
01:48 <@deen> thanks laxa
10:26 < laxadedi> eeeee: :D
16:25 < blub> hey
17:59 <@deen> laxadedi: you also have a list of the maps assigned to easy, next, pro?^^
18:10 < Nimda> ZeroX by Kosho just released on Novice at 2015-03-25 18:05
18:28 < laxa> deen: well, I could have been smarter and I would have kept them in their respective folder :D
18:28 < laxa> I am getting the files that you need
18:30 < laxa> https://ddracepro.net/files/DDRacemaXMapsListing.tar.gz
19:29 <@deen> haha
22:09 <@deen> Any ideas about this graphics bug?: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/177
22:10 <@heinrich5991> deen: what triggers the bug?
22:11 <@deen> it just seems to be there from the start
22:12 <@deen> there already is a rendering difference with quads, maybe this is a reincarnation of the same
22:12 <@deen> where the quad is split differently into 2 triangles on nvidia and amd
22:13 <@deen> you notice when the quad has a color shift
22:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: what do you mean, from the start? how did you make a screenshot of the correct behaviour?
22:16 <@deen> on another system
22:16 <@deen> with a non-AMD GPU
22:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: does this also happen with the vanilla client?
22:19 <@deen> probably, let me ask
22:20 <@deen> yes it is
22:20 <@deen> yes it does*
22:22 <@deen> ok, it's the old issue
22:22 <@deen> it's fixed with gfx_quads_as_triangles 1
22:24 <@deen> which caused huge performance problems for some
22:26 <@deen> but it's apparently more pixelly
22:28 <@heinrich5991> mh
22:28 <@deen> hm
22:28 <@heinrich5991> I wonder why that is, rendering them as triangles should only half the performance as I understand it
22:28 <@deen> well, that's pretty terrible, halving the performance..
22:33 < fstd> that shouldn't half the performance
22:34 < fstd> the overhead of dealing with the opengl state remains the same
22:35 < fstd> and rendering a quad is probably more costly than rendering a triangle, because in all likelyhood a quad becomes two triangles at some point
22:56 <@heinrich5991> s/only/at most/
23:13 <@deen> yes, so we thought
23:13 <@deen> and that's why I made gfx_quads_as_triangles the default
23:13 <@deen> then people complained that they can't play with 144 fps anymore, so we're back to disabling it by default
23:28 < fstd> are you using display lists?
23:29 < fstd> well vanilla isn't anyway
23:29 < fstd> but that could probably cause quite some reduction in rendering cost
23:43 <@deen> no idea, same as vanilla i guess
23:43 <@deen> since i changed nothing
