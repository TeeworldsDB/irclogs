09:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> foreach($array as $key => $value) { $array[$key]['id'] = $value['id']; }
09:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> The fuck?!
10:06 <@heinrich5991> mh
10:06 <@heinrich5991> it looks like php to me(?) that sets each value's ['id'] to itself if I understand it correctl
10:07 <@heinrich5991> dunno if the ['id'] thing is special in PHP
10:10 <@deen> welcome back heinrich5991 
10:11 <@heinrich5991> hi :)

12:39 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: could you test aio on windows? :)
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> definitely don't have a windows pc at hand
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh my god
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> read through definitely more than 1000 messages in this channel
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you people suddenly write a lot more when I'm away
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also: ddnet on steam when?
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you managed to crash clang? nice ðŸ˜®
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„ updating clang fixed it

13:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see my point? ðŸ˜„
13:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ˜„
13:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can these deepfly issues be fixed?

13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I bet starting my windows installation is going to have problems
13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's see
13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> â€¦
13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "Working on updates", so far so good
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
13:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now I see a black screen with a mouse cursor which I cannot move
13:35 <@deen> running it in wine is not good enough?
13:36 <@deen> I can provide wine builds
13:36 <@deen> windows buildS*
13:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh. update resets after force-reset
13:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: I'd prefer to test under windows
13:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only know that the bug happened there
13:48 <@deen> Nightly builds in case someone else wants to test: https://ddnet.tw/news/nightly-builds/
13:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Restoring your previous version of Windows
14:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yay, I booted windows ðŸ˜‰
14:10 <@deen> not that impressive, I manage that 5 times a week ;)
14:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just remembered that only @Learath2 saw the issue
14:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on which computer did you see it? windows version?
14:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on my desktop, Windows 7 64bit
14:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 when can you access that?
14:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In 10 days sadly
14:58 <@deen> how about just merging it back and I build nightlies and we ask users to test?
14:59 <@heinrich5991> we can try

17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (windows 10)i have an issue: on some of my fullscreen games i can see the top left volume bar when i change the volume or mute. on teeworlds i cant, is there a way to get it, so that these windows things can go over the game?
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it will probably show if you choose borderless window
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i triwd
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> didnt work
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tried already
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. with restart?
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> works with borderless window
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me try it again
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i wouldnt suggest you to use it
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have 1 screen only
17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that makes your game slower and if you use high refresh monitor it adjust the hertz of it
17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> other games probably allow it since directx support it or something
17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (doesnt work with borderless window)
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then your windows is broken
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess its not :)
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah you have to disable fullscreen ofc too
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah xD
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doesnt work
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> got it
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> borderless window and fullscreen off
18:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but still i wouldn't recommend you to turn off fullscreen
18:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you very probably have less fps then
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats not the problem with my computer^^ the only thing that is f*** me up is that when i press win key the game doesnt minimize as before. other games do that, but ye. because of that i will turn it back to normal
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nightly is up btw
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 you went afk when ddnet made a release, i guess thats why so many messages ^^
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª i notice no fps change, i play with borderless since always
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i got 1
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i got a 144hz screen and a 60hz one
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it never messed up with that too :o
20:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe freesync saves you, but actually as soon as 1 pixel lefts the  high refresh monitor, the gpu adjust it to the other
20:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and borderless window/windowed adds 1 pixel too much
20:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and fullscreen was invented, because the exclusivity lets windows optimize the render output(like dont render anything on that screen meanwhile)
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://prnt.sc/j2zsn3
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have awesome pixel art skills
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is sadly, my best level at drawing xD
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> tileset for tw?
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> na
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im making a game now
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then it sucks anyways
20:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :p
20:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> xd
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.aseprite.org/assets/images/frames.gif if i could do this rofl
20:53 <@deen> something broken with the new nightly? I often see tees randomly flying around. first thought it's my internet but don't see problems elsewhere
20:56 <@deen> or maybe really my internet, ping problems too now
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is opengl 3.3 supported widely?
21:13 <@deen> yes
21:13 <@deen> works fine on my 10 year old laptop, that seems wide enough
21:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
21:16 <@deen> ah wait, 3.3?
21:16 <@deen> I thought you mean opengl3, like we use in ddnet
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it is 3.3
21:19 <@deen> ok
21:19 <@deen> then I guess driver just emulates the parts that the gpu can't do, right?
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> basically khronos was like mhh lets change opengl completly with 3.3 xD
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt they can't do anything of it
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> static shader pipelines aren't extremly different
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but depends on the hardware ofc
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but shader exists since 2.0 or smth
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and most of the rest is more driver dependend then hardware
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but shader exists since 2.0 or smth
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and most of the rest is more driver dependend than hardware
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Sonix> Flags are inverted in the kill logs, also one is not rendered

21:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh isnt that indeted direction, the color bug, ok
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> seems so, in standard client atleast xd
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah you mean the color is wrong now i get it xd
22:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thorught the flag direction
