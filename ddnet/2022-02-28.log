00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Could you please give me your opinion on my pull request (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4761)? What do you think, is it excessive to offer four different positions? Can we agree on one? Personally, I think it is good to offer four different poitions.

00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, excessive in my opinion
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4761
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if we have features that only a few people use, then the combinations of these features are essentially untested
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> most people won't set anything in F1
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd also like to rather reduce config options than add some
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Should we then just stay with the old position or should we aim to improve the position but only allow that single one? Personally, it bothers me that the arrows are covered by the names,  even if you can hide the nameplates in principle, I would find it great if you can have both parallel beautiful.

07:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> I would also somewhat agree that it's excessive, and I think the user wouldn't intuitively understand 0, 1, 2, 3 -- the names could be more descriptive in my opinion
07:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> I just wanted to mention that post-tournament new-player engagement is really great in Korean community. Nice work! :)

07:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> I think there are also some that are eager for the next one. Since hosting the tournament is manual work, what about automating it for new map releases? Like a scheduled Jenkins task for the weekends, possibly randomising the times for different time zones
07:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> the problem is a lot of maps arent very suitable for tournaments
07:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> maybe there could be certain automated events that are similar to tournaments
08:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that is the maximum description size for a command
08:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that is the maximum description length for a command.
08:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that is the maximum description length for a command. All longer descriptions will be truncated (I think).

Like a scheduled Jenkins task for the weekends, possibly randomising the times for different time zones (just an example)
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah of course, that's expected I think, so not all maps would be in the map pool
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if we do them more often, could automate a bit. right now it's so rare that it's not worth it
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://vittorioromeo.info/index/blog/wordlexpr.html this is getting out of hand 😄

19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love the way chinese quote stuff
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they use this weird <<
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to another lang? no
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it may change in content
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u never know
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need to make a extension to automatically convert all internal links in translation to append /zh for example
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> lots of info in https://docs.qq.com/doc/DWGFrV0xPRmVWVkla
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt load for me

21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> As far as I can see, maybe I'm wrong of course, at the moment there is a problem with players evading the ban. 
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> After thinking about it, I have an idea. 
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> It would be possible to collect innocuous traces of players. Some purely individual settings. For example, game window resolution, mouse sensitivity, sound volume, client version.  All this to improve detection. 
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> From less innocuous options, you can also collect local computer time, a list of binds (I think with the help of a list of binds you can generally uniquely identify the player). From the not so harmless, the amount of disk space, the frequency of RAM, CPU and GPU. 
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> The more traces are stored, the easier to unambiguously determine that right now there was a banned player and he should not be allowed into the game. 
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> The advantage of all this is that the most ordinary player will not notice anything at all.

21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> The less obvious the principles by which a player is detected, the better.
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whatever you collect, the bots just wont send properly. Open source games can't rely on these tactics
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I've been thinking about that, too. You could try destroying all unofficial clients and stop letting them onto the server altogether. Make a poll from the client server, and if he did not answer correctly, not to let him in. But I forgot how I thought about the "certificate" forging thing.
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> won't happen
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> this community is very open source
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I understand. Naturally, this disadvantage can be seen there. You'd have to manually decide which clients are still worth letting in.
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Is there nothing we can do with players evading bans? :(
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> not really, even many AAA games can be evaded easily
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> nothing would really work except paid accounts which won't happen
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As long as we want people to join with self-built clients there is just no way
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually non paid accounts can help
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you stand to lose 14k points if you get banned, you just don't bot
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> Even with paid accounts, many games were extremely evaded, take CSGO, take pugb (both free now)
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> now people might troll with standard accounts, but I actually have an idea, we can do PoW so it'd take about 30 minutes to create an account
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> It seems like the last time registration ideas were rejected, or something else. I'll probably do it again. It would be nice to really introduce registration and make it really hard to make more than 1 account (unless you ask moderators to do so). 
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Way 1, as I understand undesirable, to link to a Steam account. Here I think I can not explain.
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Way 2. 1 account for 1 pair of mail, discord, login, something else. With the inability to reuse. If such a mail was - you can't create an account, such a discord was - you can't recreate an account, such a login was - also. There was registration from such IP - prohibit. Registration with VPN, and even more so with TOR - prohibit. The more things involved in creating an account, the better. Ultimative method would be tying
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> noone stops anyone from creating multiple emails, discords, getting multiple sim cards, these kind of verifications are the easiest to avoid

21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Ultimative method would be tying to your phone number, but I think the players will not like it.

21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Yes, I understand that, the point is that now the fight against evyderov would look not (here I would throw a screenshot as a player logged in, he was banned, he logged back in and so 11-15 times, after which the moderator went on his business), but it was much more exhausting for the offender.

21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Doesn't the phone participate in the creation of a Steam account?
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Here with Steam and phone nuance is that to make them on an industrial scale to register will not work.

21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I certainly would not be lazy to ban the same person 30-60 times a day, until he runs out of means to circumvent blocking, but I really do not like this situation.

21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I know about 4-6 such players in Russia alone.
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> not necessarily, free games are accessible with only an email authentication
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> thx

21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with sha256
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try to guess the hash

22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You still don't understand the problem. An attacker does not need an account or the Teeworlds client to attack. He only needs the IP of the server and he gets it with a single valid login.
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Regarding the DDoS problem: We could also run the DDNet server in Intel SGX enclaves (edgeless.systems develops similar concepts). Then everyone could simply run a private server that provides a SGX enclave for the DDNet admins. In the enclave the DDNet server is running and communicating with the master server and thus also supporting global ranks. This is not 100% secure, but an attacker must have a lot of knowledge to manipulate ranks.
