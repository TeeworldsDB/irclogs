00:07 < eeeee> weekend :)
00:10 <@deen> so, got the issues with HH cleared up, still investigating the server
00:11 <@deen> some issues were caused by ddos mitigation. another one because i was running apache instead of nginx
00:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/lJRusg
00:26 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 630e843 def: Fix: Show 0 finishes in /mapinfo
03:17 < eeeee> deen: EastByte: as promised, here's the js repo https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet/commit/af2965d5513a938b1d0ffddd6dce291c7a6cedb2
03:23 < eeeee> i'll do some js bindings for it tomorrow (loading the data files from http instead of using --preload-file, loading arbitrary .demo file from http, demo start/stop/other buttons in html page)
03:23 < eeeee> lmk if you have any other ideas
03:23 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!

11:32 < Nimda> DDNet EUR went back online!
11:46 < xrothx> ddnet eur :(
11:46 < xrothx> deen:  Got a moment
11:47 < xrothx> The blmapNEWwill not have upgrades anymore, So I wanted to add jetpack gun
11:47 <@deen> xrothx: sure
11:47 < xrothx> But I cant find it?
11:47 <@deen> it says JETPACK on the tile, so it's easy to find
11:47 <@deen> are you using ddnet client?
11:47 < xrothx> Got it.. forgot to change the tiles
11:47 < xrothx> nop
11:48 < xrothx> cant use ddnet client
11:48 < xrothx> because its protected ma
11:48 < xrothx> because its protected map
11:48 <@deen> then you can't use most new ddnet mapping features
11:48 < xrothx> :o
11:48 <@deen> why do you want it to be a protected map?
11:48 <@deen> you can't use tuning zones for example
11:48 < xrothx> So I should unlock + Edit in ddnet then
11:49 <@deen> if you want some more fun features from this list, yes: http://ddnet.tw/map/
11:49 <@deen> i need to add map sounds there
11:49 < xrothx> ok
11:52 < xrothx> using any admin stuff can not if test cmds isn't enabled? 
11:57 <@deen> you mean cheats?
12:06 < xrothx> I mean teleport
12:08 <@deen> that's disabled indeed
12:10 <@heinrich5991> xrothx: "protected"?
12:12 < xrothx> deen: 
12:12 < xrothx> I cant upload? 
12:12 <@deen> xrothx: sorry, not right now
12:12 < xrothx> can you? 
12:12 < xrothx> or I should wait? 
12:12 <@deen> test somewhere else
12:14 < xrothx> such as? µ
12:16 < xrothx> I will wait
12:28 <@deen> I'm currently moving the main server, so there are some problems
12:31 < xrothx> To ger? 
12:31 <@deen> no

14:47 < BeaR> deen: you know some good haskell tutorial :D ?
15:00 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #104: Fix editor sound replacing (DDRace64...pr_replace) http://git.io/Dop_QQ
15:05 <@deen> BeaR: yes!
15:06 <@deen> BeaR: if you want to write real haskell programs: http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
15:06 < BeaR> thx (:
15:06 <@deen> this one is popular but i haven't read it: http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters
15:07 <@deen> my favorite is "Graham Hutton: Programming in Haskell"
15:07 <@deen> really short and nice to read
15:07 < Learath2> why haskell ?\
15:08 <@deen> here it is: http://bin-login.name/ftp/pub/docs/programming-in-haskell.9780521692694.33359.pdf
15:08 < BeaR> nice, even free as pdf (:
15:08 <@deen> not legally i guess^^
15:08 < BeaR> heh
15:08 < BeaR> whatever gonna take a look into it
15:09 < BeaR> Learath2: because I always wanted to learn it (and now I have to)
15:11 <@deen> thanks for still working on sound code, BeaR =)

16:14 <@deen> 320 players on GER and no ping jumps, nice
16:14 <@EastByte> on eur there are :/
16:15 <@deen> EastByte: not for me, constantly or just sometimes?
16:15 <@EastByte> it's just that some port looks really throttled
16:15 <@EastByte> like there has been an attack before
16:17 <@EastByte> eur needs moaar ips :)
16:17 <@EastByte> one ip per server and mitigation works completly independent from server to server :D
16:17 <@deen> ips are a bit expensive for that^^
16:18 <@EastByte> but it looks awesome
16:18 <@EastByte> the attackers will think that we've bought dozens of servers
16:20 <@EastByte> I wish my friend would have his server in strasbourg
16:20 <@EastByte> he is able to get a full /8 ip block for free
16:20 <@EastByte>  /24 *
16:20 <@deen>  /8 would've been big^^
16:20 <@EastByte> ^^
17:49 < ochristi> something wrong with network @GER, got ping 4x higher than usual

21:01 < laxadedi> currently trying redbull with jagermeister
21:02 < laxadedi> does't taste good :(

21:19 <@EastByte> SyntaxError: 09 is not a legal ECMA-262 octal constant
21:19 <@EastByte> wut
21:20 <@deen> EastByte: where do you get that error?
21:20 <@EastByte> javascript
21:20 <@EastByte> I wanted to prepend zeros before one digit numbers
21:20 <@EastByte> to make it better understandable
21:21 <@EastByte> nvm
21:21 <@deen> but when you write that it's interpreted as an octal number
21:21 <@deen> starting with 0
21:21 <@EastByte> I just realized that^^
21:24 < laxadedi> who wants to play a drinking game with me and anqel ? There is no point to play with only 2 :(
21:24 <@EastByte> I can't drink right now^^
21:24 <@EastByte> why are you only two?
21:25 < laxadedi> cause we are only 2 at anqel's flat
21:25 <@EastByte> ah
21:25 <@EastByte> don't drink too much
21:25 < laxadedi> otherwise I wouldn't be on IRC
21:25 < laxadedi> Why not EastByte ? :D
21:25 <@EastByte> just sayin^^
21:25 < Learath2> who is anqel even
21:26 <@EastByte> ddnet player
21:26 <@EastByte> it's a girl
21:26 < Learath2> omg girl teeworlds player ???

21:26 < laxadedi> lol EastByte 
21:27 < laxadedi> anqel is reading the screen byw
21:27 < laxadedi> btw
21:27 <@EastByte> hi anqel :>
21:27 < Learath2> the only one i remember from when i playd is Saavik and i wasnt even sure 
21:27 < laxadedi> hi east :) (from anqel)
21:29 <@EastByte> ^ did she smile like that?
21:29 < laxadedi> Yeah I guess so
21:29 <@EastByte> ah
21:29 <@EastByte> I'm more like =D
21:30 < Learath2> if only i had anything to drink i'd join you in a drinking gaim
21:30 < laxadedi> She is drinking energy beer, I am drinking jagermeister + redbull
23:20 <@deen> wow, ddnet server makes so many syscalls
23:31 <@heinrich5991> deen: are you stracing it?
23:31 <@deen> yes
23:31 <@deen> now i try to use valgrind with collect-sytime=yes but get a segfault
23:31 <@deen> systime*
23:44 <@deen> looks ok. the most expensive syscalls are recvfrom, sendto and select
23:45 <@deen> time_get is still the most used syscall, but it's pretty cheap
23:46 <@heinrich5991> time_get is a syscall?
23:46 <@heinrich5991> which one?
23:46 <@deen> ehm, get timeofday*
23:46 <@deen> via the time_get function
23:46 <@deen> in system.c
23:54 <@deen> maybe we could just cache the value of time_get until the next tick?
