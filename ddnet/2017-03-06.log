00:54 < Learath2> we should test ourselves before releasing this stuff :/
00:56 < Learath2> like in a small batch of testing servers
00:59 < Learath2> necropotame: have you considered a setting like sv_force_time_sync which could be applied to maps which require synced animations so for the rest of the maps the vanilla users can also enjoy the pretty gametimer
00:59 < Learath2> ?
07:44 <@EastByte> Learath2: afaik there is no way to properly sync quads as long as the game timer isn't synced over all clients
07:45 <@EastByte> this update should now allow us to create moving entity areas based on quads (with vanilla support)
07:58 < necropotame> Learath2 is right. One could detect if there is animations in the map, and if not, let vanilla client see the racetime with the old system
07:59 < necropotame> But then the experience will not be coherent from one map to an another
08:00 <@EastByte> oh, I misread the message
08:07 < necropotame> Btw, I recommend to create an official branch "animation" because all this stuff will required several PR
08:29 < nameless-tee> It seems moderator passwords is leaked [again] and someone ban everyone on different servers. Change the password please.
08:30 <@EastByte> nameless-tee: might giving a server port example?
08:31 <@EastByte> *mind
08:33 < nameless-tee> EastByte: I dunno. The guy ingame told me and there are few posts about it on forum.
08:34 <@EastByte> okay
08:34 <@EastByte> soon we will have username/password authentifications per moderator :)
08:35 < nameless-tee> nice!
08:48 < nameless-tee> SP | Someone is doing this right now on rus server 194.67.208.6:8321
09:06 <@EastByte> should be fixed now
09:28 < Learath2> necropotame: well the experience should seem coherent enough, as i understand it this PR shouldn't change anything in maps that dont utilize synced animations
09:29 < Learath2> i wouldn't even bother checking if there is animations but offload that to the mapper as sv_force_sync
09:30 < necropotame> Learath2, I was talking about vanilla noob that got different timer depending if the map
09:31 < Learath2> meh true, i guess there is no good way out of this
09:57 < Welf> Hey Guys, it seems like SP someone stole Mod PW. Please Change it asap
10:01 < Welf> You defs are Not releasing maps nor caring about major problems
10:02 < Welf> Before a few weeks i suggested somebody who could so map releases, but you didn't want
10:02 < Welf> Wtf is wrong
