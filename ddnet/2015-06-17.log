13:00 < Shiki> deen: EastByte oops, sorry for being away guys
13:01 < Shiki> I'm currently busy with my bachelors but I'm planning to get back to teeworlds code at the end of this week
13:01 < Shiki> I hope I will finally fix autorecorder issues once and for all
13:02 < Shiki> fix was intended mainly to enable OnStartGame call after restart and avoid calling OnStartGame during pause or other states in which new round tick is being sent continuously
13:03 <@EastByte> Shiki: no problem
13:03 <@EastByte> I think we should add another demo recorder for that kind of vanilla round recording
13:03 < Shiki> nah, no need, truly
13:04 < Shiki> I think it can be fixed without including additional hacks
13:04 <@EastByte> but it would be much more clear
13:04 <@EastByte> since auto demo recorder should just record everything
13:04 <@EastByte> independent from gametime
13:05 < Shiki> hm, I see
13:05 < Shiki> although statboard for vanilla needs OnStartGame to be called after restart to clean stats
13:06 < Shiki> if all my changes to gameclient.cpp were reverted then statboard won't be reset until server reload
13:06 <@EastByte> looks like OnStartGame is not needed for auto
13:07 < Shiki> oh
13:07 < Shiki> I haven't thought about it :)
13:07 <@EastByte> then we should seperate it
13:07 < Shiki> any ideas on how to separate it?
13:07 < Shiki> my current use case for demos recording includes recording demo of each complete vanilla high level game
13:08 < Shiki> and I like it when demo contains only the game itself, not countless minutes of random chatting before restart
13:09 <@EastByte> yes, that's why a vanilla recorder would be nice
13:09 <@EastByte> which replaces race recorder in case of a vanilla mod
13:10 < Shiki> I still don't like the idea of spreading demo recorder code among 3 files
13:10 < Shiki> it was quite tricky for me to learn about race_demo.cpp in first place
13:11 <@EastByte> looks like the auto recorder only needs this line: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1852
13:12 <@EastByte> so we can keep it out of OnStartGame
13:13 <@EastByte> well that kind of trickiness does not only go for demo recorders
13:13 <@EastByte> but yea, I don't like it either
13:13 < Shiki> but is there a way to reset demo recording after restart without creating demo_vanilla?
13:14 < Shiki> I'm answering to this: > 
13:14 < Shiki> > so we can keep it out of OnStartGame
13:16 <@EastByte> what do you mean by creating demo_vanilla?
13:17 <@EastByte> I thought auto recorder is meant to record everything from the moment on you are connected until disconnect
13:17 <@EastByte> so no need to restart
13:18 <@EastByte> and I suggested a vanilla recorder as solution for vanilla round recording
14:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #224: Create directory for statboard screenshots (DDRace64...pr_statboard) http://git.io/vLCjg
14:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vLWeG
14:17 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 839db0a BeaR: Create directory for statboard screenshots
14:17 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 acda1b1 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #224 from cinaera/pr_statboard...
14:39 < Shiki> EastByte: I mean demo_vanilla.cpp, a separate file for vanilla demo recording code
14:40 < Shiki> can we avoid creating said file if we remove demo recording start from OnStartGame?
14:47 <@EastByte> no need for demo_vanilla.cpp
14:47 <@EastByte> the code will mainly be in gameclient.cpp anyways
14:49 <@EastByte> another question would be how to seperate vanilla demos from race/auto demos
14:51 <@EastByte> meh this is getting complicated
14:56 <@deen> so, 50 MB/s incoming on the block2 server
14:56 <@deen> causes 120 MB/s outgoing
14:57 <@EastByte> from which ip?
14:57 <@EastByte> it might be 76.74.249.76
15:03 <@deen> ok, it's actually a single server, I'll just report it
15:03 <@deen> to his provider
15:03 <@deen> iptables rule running now
15:04 <@deen> at least no more outgoing traffic
15:04 <@deen> but kernel still has trouble
15:04 <@EastByte> was it the ip I posted?
15:04 <@deen> no
15:04 <@EastByte> okay
15:07 <@deen> there we go, reported to his hoster
15:07 <@deen> sometimes he gets it up to 50 MB/s
15:07 <@deen> but him just having 1 host doesn'T make it too ba
15:08 <@EastByte> whay do you actually write when reporting a server?
15:08 <@EastByte> what*
15:10 <@deen> EastByte: http://ddnet.tw/dosmail.txt
15:10 <@EastByte> ah that's quite simple
15:10 <@deen> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm that's running on his IP
15:10 <@deen> looks like he owned the server
15:11 <@deen> i doubt that's his own
15:11 <@EastByte> ehm 76.74.249.76 is from serverbeach aswell
15:11 <@deen> ah
15:11 <@EastByte> I find this quite strange
15:11 <@deen> damn iptables is only single threaded
15:12 <@deen> single-process
15:12 <@deen> ah, looks like it's over
15:12 <@deen> or not, back again
15:12 <@EastByte> http://pastebin.com/Gw9QHRYY
15:13 <@EastByte> this is the code cider apparently used
15:13 <@deen> let me check, i have tcpdump
15:13 <@deen> yesp, that's it
15:13 <@EastByte> okay
15:13 <@deen> same message
15:13 <@EastByte> so since there are no things like raw sockets in the code
15:13 <@EastByte> it shouldn't be spoofed
15:14 <@deen> oh right, didn't even think about spoofing
15:14 <@deen> but if it was spoofed, he should be able to change ip
15:14 <@deen> which he hasn't
15:14 <@EastByte> right
15:14 <@EastByte> but it might let you think that it's a single server
15:17 <@deen> this is the first time the abuse mail worked for me btw
15:18 <@EastByte> oh it worked?
15:18 <@deen> usually people attack from some russian hoster where abuse@hoster isn't even registered :P
15:18 <@EastByte> oh
15:18 <@deen> at least they sent me an automated reply that that they will be looking into it
15:18 <@EastByte> that's nice
15:19 <@deen> and no more traffic incoming. so either he gave up or they blocked him already
15:20 <@deen> i guess we need an iptables rule to limit traffic per ip in general
15:20 <@deen> to prevent this stuff in the future
15:20 <@EastByte> shouldn't nfoservers treat this as an attack?
15:20 <@deen> nah, it's just 20 MB/s from a single ip
15:20 <@deen> nothing special
15:20 <@deen> 20-50 MB/s
15:20 <@EastByte> but it's small packet flooding
15:20 <@deen> apparently they don't, it's back^^
15:21 <@EastByte> a pps limit per ip would be nice
15:22 <@deen> yeah, sth simple like: after 10k pps for 5 seconds, ban ip for 10 min
15:25 <@deen> EastByte: don't tell him that sendmmsg would send more packets :P
15:26 <@EastByte> I can't^^ WolfAlex kinda has indirect contact to him
15:27 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: might cider also be known as float 7.0f?
15:32 <@EastByte> deen: so 50MB causes 120MB outgoing?
15:32 <@EastByte> do you think it's worth it to implement a protection against reflection attacks?
15:32 <@deen> EastByte: yes
15:32 <@deen> no
15:32 <@deen> i think that should be handled with iptables
15:32 <@deen> so, talked to the guy again, he said he can buy a 30 gbit/s server and dos us harder^^
15:33 <@EastByte> oh that's cute
15:33 <@deen> oh wait, he said he can "get" a server
15:33 <@deen> i think buying would be a bit expensive
15:33 <@EastByte> "get"
15:34 <@EastByte> so if iptables also handles outgoing traffic then it's fine
15:35 <@deen> 30gbit/s servers are crazy expensive. i see prizes around 500 € / month
15:36 <@deen> and you still have to pay for bandwidth of course
15:36 <@EastByte> and still not enough to face against ddnet directed attacks
15:36 <@EastByte> ah right
15:37 <@deen> guaranteed 10 gbit/s costs about 8000 € / month, nice
15:39 <@EastByte> then I understand why datafabrik wanted to get rid of you :P
15:40 <@deen> haha, yeah
15:40 <@deen> their prizes made no sense, don't get anything like that elsewhere
16:10 < bigman> hi
16:10 <@deen> hi
16:11 < bigman> how i can compile ddnet with vs13
16:12  * bigman slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
16:13  * bigman slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
16:13 <@deen> no idea
16:13 <@EastByte> hmm
16:13 <@deen> bigman: like this? https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
16:14 < bigman> there is no compile_release.bat that can compile with vs13
16:14 < bigman> ?
16:15 <@EastByte> you have to work with bam
16:15 <@deen> if you have built bam
16:15 <@deen> you should just run "bam release"
16:17 < bigman> suck
16:17 < bigman> such
16:17 < bigman> :D
16:31 <@deen> ?
16:44 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/nimtw/
16:45 <@EastByte> me again reimplementing the tw protocol
16:56 <@deen> nice!
16:57 <@deen> EastByte: when you have multiple vars, you can use a var block
16:57 <@deen> and I wouldn't have a space before the : for type
16:58 <@EastByte> yea I'm yet kinda stumbling with the code format
16:59 <@deen> https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki/Style-Guide-for-Nim-Code
17:00 <@deen> 2 space indentation is a bit controversial, but i always preferred it :P
17:00 <@EastByte> I'm okay with it
17:01 <@EastByte> although I kinda have a poor eyesight and sometimes can't keep blockes apart^^
17:01 <@EastByte> blocks*
17:04 <@EastByte> "Why shout CONSTANT? Constants do no harm, variables do!" hehe
17:04 <@deen> ^^
17:04 <@deen> EastByte: bigger font?
17:04 <@deen> i always switch around font sizes
17:04 <@deen> on the fly
17:04 <@EastByte> hm I never did
17:04 <@EastByte> but a bigger font might be good
17:05 <@deen> using urxvt?
17:05 <@EastByte> yep
17:05 <@deen> https://gist.github.com/def-/a06ead61ec090ae4fe90
17:05 <@deen> this helps in the .Xdefaults
17:05 <@deen> to change font size with a key bind
17:06 <@EastByte> oh so many binds?
17:06 <@deen> the really big ones are for showing code to other people, on a beamer
17:06 <@EastByte> ah
17:07 <@deen> and everything is for 2 fonts, because terminus doesn't have all characters
17:07 <@EastByte> hm since I have a bluetooth keyboard now, it would be awesome to type while sitting in bed
17:07 <@deen> also, lines 19-20 are fun on a laptop in sunlight
17:07 <@deen> can just switch black-on-white to white-on-black
17:07 <@EastByte> ah, nice
17:08 <@deen> my most important line in xdefaults is this one though: urxvt.print-pipe: "cat > /dev/null"
17:08 <@deen> otherwise when you cat a random file, it sometimes contains commands to print something on the printer
17:08 <@EastByte> huh?
17:08 <@EastByte> wut
17:08 <@deen> lots of fun when the printer suddenly prints 100 pages of garbage while I'm afk
17:09 <@deen> there was some key bind to print the current console output and of course random text on the terminal can trigger it
17:10 <@EastByte> well I don't have a printer installed
17:11 <@deen> it's pretty terrible that we still use the old terminal standards like vt100
17:12 <@deen> http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm
17:12 <@deen> <ESC>[i Print the current screen.
17:13 <@deen> EastByte: i don't know if ClientSeq is any cleaner than seq[Client]
17:14 <@EastByte> hm I don't remember why I made a type for that
17:15 <@deen> ptrmath is evil of course :P
17:15 <@EastByte> tell me how to do binary parsing in a safe way :((
17:15 <@EastByte> +efficient :P
17:15 <@deen> where exactly?
17:16 <@EastByte> hm
17:16 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/nimtw/blob/master/network.nim#L32
17:16 <@deen> and not sure if i would write "var bits: uint32 = 0" or just "var bits = 0'u32"
17:16 <@EastByte> 0'u32 looks cleaner
17:18 <@EastByte> so recv() returns the buffer in a string
17:18 < o_be_one> hello
17:18 <@EastByte> I'm not sure how to use this string like a c array
17:18 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
17:18 <@EastByte> to do parsing
17:18 <@EastByte> hi o_be_one 
17:18 <@deen> EastByte: i may be blind, where do you use pointer magic?
17:18 < o_be_one> deen, just to let you know, V3R was updated this night. A DDoS happend and made all players left (there was just 8 players online atm)
17:18 <@deen> pointer math*
17:19 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/nimtw/blob/master/network.nim#L42
17:19 <@EastByte> and below
17:19 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, i'm trying to handle the DoS
17:19 <@EastByte> p[0] ...
17:19 < o_be_one> ive took this luck to shutdown the serv to get it updated ^^
17:19 <@deen> "luck" :P
17:20 <@EastByte> and deen already made an abuse report
17:20 <@deen> and iptables rule to block it
17:20 <@deen> but 50 MB/s still causes some slight lags
17:21 < o_be_one> es theres always a way to ddos easyly, but is it many ips or just one ?
17:21 <@EastByte> this time the flooding causes happy cpu load
17:21 <@deen> it's a DoS, not distributed
17:21 <@deen> single ip
17:21 <@EastByte> lol did I write happy?
17:21 <@EastByte> huge*
17:21 <@deen> yes, cpu is very happy^^
17:21 <@EastByte> absolutely^^
17:22 < o_be_one> am i allowed to know this ip ?
17:22 <@deen> EastByte: you could just cast to an array[10000, uint8]^^
17:22 <@deen> o_be_one: http://ddnet.tw/dosmail.txt
17:22 <@EastByte> o_be_one: 76.74.249.76 also was used
17:23 <@deen> just hijacked servers i think
17:23 <@deen> maybe i should also write to tutorialspoint
17:23 <@EastByte> deen: okay, but casting to array[10000 also is unsafe
17:23 < o_be_one> ok
17:24 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, i know. hide everything between a safe binary parsing interface
17:24 <@deen> behind*
17:24 <@EastByte> what exactly do you mean?
17:24 <@deen> write a binary parsing library
17:24 <@deen> and use it
17:24 <@EastByte> well that's probably unefficient
17:25 <@deen> internally you can do your pointer math
17:25 <@deen> or even transform the code at compiletime with a template
17:25 <@EastByte> deen: also when casting to array[1000, uint8], wouldn't there be runtimechecks then?
17:25 < o_be_one> some players thinks that deen doesnt dev x) ... Someone told me that you was not able to fix the nick & skin change exploit cause the fix went from SAI ^^
17:26 <@deen> EastByte: not with -d:release
17:26 <@EastByte> wasn't deen the culprit of the bug?
17:27 <@deen> EastByte: http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface-unchecked-pragma
17:28 <@deen> EastByte: at least then you don't need ptrmath
17:28 < o_be_one> what do you think about meskalin quizzbot ?
17:28 <@EastByte> kill it with fire
17:28 <@deen> o_be_one: it's as annoying as it was 1 year ago
17:28 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?p=16653#p16653
17:28 < o_be_one> some players seems to like it, i dont know what to think about it
17:28 <@EastByte> what I don't like is that you can't permanently ignore it
17:29 <@deen> EastByte: exactly
17:29 <@EastByte> and all other players are spaming aswell
17:29 <@deen> i don't get why they need a quiz in TW
17:29 < o_be_one> XXLTomate, you there ? Seen a branch on github with docker ????
17:29 <@deen> just go on one of the millions of quiz websites
17:29 <@EastByte> deen: some people like to chil+play though
17:30 <@deen> EastByte: i have 2 screens, so no problem :P
17:30 <@EastByte> ...
17:30 < o_be_one> well i think its like quizz on IRC
17:31 < o_be_one> its best way to chill and play at the same time
17:31 <@EastByte> it's worth than that
17:31 <@EastByte> the tw chat is too small
17:31 < o_be_one> sure
17:32 <@EastByte> deen: speaking of, we wanted to reduce game messages
17:32 <@EastByte> maybe using the playerflags for status information is a proper way
17:33 <@EastByte> I guess I will mention it in the issue
17:34 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?p=16767
17:37 <@EastByte> I'll replace the pointer magic with an unchecked array
17:52 <@deen> hi BeaR_ =)
17:52 < BeaR_> hey deen (:
17:54 <@EastByte> c:
17:54 <@deen> BeaR_: seen this? https://github.com/east/nimtw/
17:55 < BeaR_> jup
17:55 <@EastByte> btw. I found a possible overflow while parsing chunks
17:56 <@EastByte> but it's not critical enough to cause a crash
17:57 <@EastByte> deen: "Prefer to return [] and "" instead of nil, or throw an exception if that is appropriate."
17:57 <@EastByte> wouldn't [] or "" allocate a new object on gc?
17:57 <@deen> yes, they would
17:57 <@EastByte> hmm
17:57 <@deen> but nil could cause a crash if the caller doesn't expect it as a valid return value
17:58 <@deen> ah, and [] doesn't allocate, @[] does
17:58 <@EastByte> well that's what I want in case a function is used without knowing about it's result
17:58 <@deen> [] is an array, @[] a seq
17:58 <@EastByte> so returning [] is more efficietn than "" ?
17:59 <@deen> i don't think [] exists :P
17:59 <@deen> that would be an array of size 0
17:59 <@EastByte> I always prefered returning a null value
17:59 <@deen> you have to decide if you want more safety or more performance here
17:59 <@deen> or throw exceptions
17:59 < BeaR_> "exceptions" :/
18:00 <@EastByte> I don't think returning nil is unsafe, it could only crash which always is good
18:00 <@EastByte> and yes "exceptions"
18:00 <@deen> EastByte: no, it's implementation specific whether accessing a nullpointer crashes
18:00 <@deen> unspecified behaviour
18:00 <@deen> undefined*
18:00 <@EastByte> oh
18:01 <@deen> so Nim is getting nil-pointer checks
18:01 <@deen> afk
18:04 <@EastByte> hm the compiler could test the system against a nil segfault and add/leave out the nil pointer checks then
18:04 < BeaR_> huh?
18:05 <@EastByte> why not?
18:05 < BeaR_> what do you mean with 'test against a nil segfault' ?
18:07 <@EastByte> doing something like *((char*)0) = 0; and see what happens
18:10 < BeaR_> ah
18:48 < Nimda> Goldshire by Åmol & FunCat just released on Brutal at 2015-06-17 18:43
18:50 < bigman> hi again
18:50 < bigman> when i compile the ddnet src it gives me alot of errors
18:50 <@EastByte> hi, that's bad
18:50 <@EastByte> what did you try?
18:50 < bigman> ddnet needs python ?
18:50 < BeaR_> y
18:51 <@EastByte> so you got bam running?
18:51 < bigman> yeah i just edited my old compile_release.bat to use vs12
18:52 < bigman> and that resolved the problem
18:52 < bigman> the problam was not from bam
18:52 <@deen> yeah right, also install python2
18:52 < bigman> ok thanks
18:53 <@deen> That's where Nim would be nice, can do nice compile time stuff in Nim, and efficient runtime code in Nim as well, no need for a 2nd or 3rd language (C++, C, Python, Lua)
18:53 < BeaR_> ^^
18:54 <@EastByte> deen: well I also need to implement tw game messages
18:54 <@EastByte> I could try that using macros
18:54 <@EastByte> replacing python datasrc
18:54 <@EastByte> or just c2nim the generated sources
18:54  * BeaR_ is fighting with eclipse .-.
18:54 <@deen> that's not what c2nim is for
18:54 <@EastByte> say no to IDEs!
18:54 <@deen> EastByte: templates/macros are the way to go
18:55 <@EastByte> hm right
18:55 < BeaR_> I also dislike most of the IDEs but well sometimes I can't avoid them ):
18:56 < bigman> ide is good for times when you know you want to do :D
18:56 <@EastByte> deen: how do I properly cast a string to an unchecked array?
18:56 < BeaR_> and it eats up 90% of me CPU, 1gb ram and crashes all the time ):
18:56 < bigman> :DDDDDDDDD
18:57 <@EastByte> var p = cast[Uint8Array](packet.data[0] <- it compiles atleast but not sure
18:57 <@deen> EastByte: looks right
18:57 <@deen> )
18:57 <@EastByte> hm so the problem I get is somewhere else
18:57 <@deen> ehm
18:57 <@deen> no
18:57 <@deen> addr packet.data[0]
18:57 <@EastByte> that's what I thought but: Error: expression cannot be casted to Uint8Array
18:58 < Shiki> BeaR_: wow, is it latest version?
18:58 <@EastByte> looks like it cannot cast a ptr to uncheck array
18:59 < BeaR_> Shiki: I think so, could be also caused by Android plugin
18:59 < Shiki> try idea if you're coding java
19:00 <@deen> EastByte: weird, i can reproduce^^
19:00 <@EastByte> I think that's also where I stuck before moving to ptrmath
19:01 <@deen> EastByte: fixed =)
19:01 <@deen> EastByte: want to report the bug yourself?
19:01 <@deen> https://gist.github.com/def-/ee85afc5712915e55077
19:01 < BeaR_> Shiki: setting up that android stuff was already pretty much work and I even tried using android studio but eh..
19:01 <@EastByte> no :<
19:02 <@EastByte> I bet it's supposed not to be done like that^^
19:02 <@deen> I noticed today that I have full permissions on the Nim repo
19:02 <@EastByte> D:
19:02 <@deen> Wooo, now i can add backdoors!
19:02 <@EastByte> gz :>
19:02 < BeaR_> array[0, uint8], is this even legit?
19:02 <@deen> they moved it to nim-lang and I'm entered as an owner of nim-lang group
19:03 <@EastByte> Araq said the dev branch currently is a playground^^
19:03 <@deen> BeaR_: the {.unchecked.} should make it valid, yes: http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface-unchecked-pragma
19:03 <@deen> wait
19:03 <@EastByte> I did 0 .. 0
19:03 <@EastByte> 0 seems to be 0 .. -1 ?
19:03 <@deen> yeah, same problem with 0..0
19:03 <@deen> doesn't matter anyway, should not have any compiletime or runtime checks
19:03 <@deen> since it's unchecked
19:04 <@deen> hmmm, the unchecked array still checks at compile time
19:04 <@deen> maybe that makes sense#
19:04 <@deen> in this case it also works with array[8, uint8] because then "foobar" fits
19:05 <@deen> so i guess it's ok, hmmm
19:07 < BeaR_> doesn't compile with the latest stable release /:
19:07 <@deen> https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/2943
19:09 <@deen> wait, the manual even says: The bounds checking done at compile time is not disabled for now, so to access s.data[C] (where C is a constant) the array's index needs needs to include C.
19:09 <@EastByte> ehh
19:09 <@EastByte> so what is unchecked for?
19:09 <@deen> to disable runtime checks
19:10 <@EastByte> k
19:12 <@EastByte> eh when I use array[0 .. 100_000, uint8] instead gcc errors
19:12 <@deen> haha
19:12 <@EastByte> error: lvalue required as unary ‘&’ operand
19:13 <@deen> eh wait
19:13 <@deen> that creates an array of size 100_001 on the stack and copies into it
19:13 <@EastByte> oh I see
19:14 <@deen> so a ptr to an array^^
19:15 <@EastByte> using a ptr array I need to do p[][index] I guess?
19:19 <@deen> probably, ouch =/
19:20 <@EastByte> hahaha, ptrmath I'm coming =D
19:21 <@EastByte> hm it's kinda hard for a beginner to do lowlevel stuff in nim
19:23 <@deen> i don't know, is it?
19:24 <@EastByte> e.g. you need to do a lot of type converting to work with bitmasks and single byte numbers
19:24 <@EastByte> you need to include unsigned
19:25 <@EastByte> and doing simple c array stuff is painful
19:29 <@deen> there is more and stricter typing than in C
19:30 <@EastByte> I probably just used to the C typing
19:33 <@EastByte> the dot operator and optional parentheses are probably what I like most in nim
19:54 <@EastByte> looks like fetching chunks works
19:56 < bigman> How i can change the order of typed characters in teeworlds source ?
19:57 <@deen> bigman: for persian text output?
19:57 < bigman> yes
19:57 <@deen> https://www.google.de/search?hl=de&q=teeworlds+right+to+left
19:57 <@deen> it's a problem
19:58 <@deen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/394
19:58 < bigman> hmm thanks 
19:58 <@deen> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10397
19:58 < bigman> let me look at this
19:58 <@deen> ok
19:58 <@deen> maybe sdl2 would fix it
19:59 <@deen> or help
19:59 <@deen> but i don't think so
20:01 < bigman> Is it possible to detect if user is changed his input language ?
20:02 <@EastByte> no
20:03 <@deen> detect how, where?
20:18 <@EastByte> I guess he meant the client language, doesn't make sense though
20:20 <@deen> well, you can detect the client language inside the client
20:21 <@deen> i guess he wants to invert the UI when an rtl language is used
20:21 <@deen> mirror*
20:22 < bigman> hmm @deen where is the font that teeworlds uses ?
20:23 <@deen> data/fonts/DejaVuSans
20:23 < bigman> thanks
20:26 <@deen> bigman: you also can't type farsi in TW, right?
20:26 <@deen> that would be fixed by sdl2
20:27 < bigman> no we can type farsi
20:27 <@deen> oh
20:27 < bigman> but characters being inserted from left to right
20:27 <@deen> then i misremembered and some other languages don't work
20:27 < bigman> so سلام becomes م ا ل س
20:27 <@deen> yeah =/
20:27 <@deen> learn to type in reverse?
20:28 < bigman> lol
20:28 < bigman> ?
20:28 <@deen> ?esrever ni epyt ot nreal
20:29 <@deen> anyway, good luck^^
20:29 < bigman> :/
20:29 < bigman> :D
20:29 < bigman> one of my friends resolved this problem but he does not share the sourde
20:30 < bigman> :D
20:30 <@deen> nice friend!
20:30 <@EastByte> haha that makes sense
20:30 < bigman> no bad friend :/ using open source but not sharing your own source :/
20:30 <@EastByte> to be the onoly one using the language
20:31 < bigman> no he shared the client 
20:31 <@EastByte> ah okay
20:57 <@deen> Woohoo, livestream on Sunday will be in English, by Hallowed1986, the famous livestreamer and Aoe, the mapper of the map
20:57 <@EastByte> cool
20:58 < bigman> @deen can u please tell me in which file typed string exactly becomes printed to output ?
20:58 <@deen> bigman: what typed string?
20:58 < bigman> into screen
20:58 <@EastByte> src/engine/client/text.cpp
20:59 < bigman> ok thanks
20:59 <@EastByte> the font part of teeworlds is really complicated
21:09 <@deen> now big attack destroying cpu
21:11 <@deen> this time actually distributed, tcp
21:11 <@deen> looks like another attacker
21:11 <@deen> syn-flood i guess
21:12 <@deen> woah, every single packet from a different ip
21:12 <@deen> nice spoofed ip
21:18 <@deen> let's see if it helps to block tcp to unused ports
21:18 <@deen> that was only 10-20 MB/s
21:18 <@deen> I'm already expecting problems for the next tournament
21:20 < Savander> hi
21:20 <@deen> hi
21:29 <@EastByte> deen: did you dump some packets?
21:29 <@EastByte> Savander: hi
21:30 <@deen> EastByte: sure, want them?
21:30 <@EastByte> yea :)
21:34 < Shiki> now I wonder who can be so keen on dosing ddnet and what his/her motivation
21:34 < Shiki> does it happen regularly?
21:34 <@EastByte> there was a quite long pause
21:34 <@EastByte> but before, ddnet sometimes was unplayable due to attack
21:35 <@EastByte> s
21:35 <@EastByte> we even had +40gbit
21:35 <@deen> i think it was up to 100 gbit/s
21:36 < Savander> for dynamic menu in header (only for it) we should use javascript to implement it to every single page?
21:36 < Savander> or just php/python
21:36 <@deen> Savander: what's a dynamic menu in header?
21:36 <@deen> I asked Soreu the same, but no answer^^
21:36 < Savander> we mean
21:36 < Savander> if we changes something in menu
21:36 < Savander> it should change in every single page
21:36 <@deen> Shiki: from what I hear all games (and everything big on the internet) get ddosed
21:36 < Savander> without editing every single page xd
21:37 <@deen> Savander: i use jekyll, so just make a template
21:37 <@deen> no need for any programming
21:37 < Savander> okay
21:37 <@deen> and no, please don't load any parts of a page by JS!
21:38 < Savander> i said it too
21:38 < Savander> to soreu
21:38 < Savander> xD
21:38 <@EastByte> why not :D
21:38 < Savander> but
21:38 < Savander> or nvm.
21:38 < Savander> we have a prototype already
21:38 <@EastByte> what actually are you talking about?
21:38 <@deen> I guess I can give you 2 access to my ddnet-web repo of the entire website
21:39 <@deen> they're remaking the ddnet website, EastByte 
21:39 <@deen> because my webdesign sucks :P
21:39 < Savander> <hoh, noo, whyyy!?>
21:39 <@EastByte> waaaat
21:39 < Shiki> liar, ddnet.tw looks awesome!
21:39 <@EastByte> yep
21:40 <@deen> Shiki: not everyone agrees^^
21:40 < Savander> ddnet need freshness
21:40 < Savander> xd
21:40 <@deen> Shiki: personally I prefer minimalistic design (ddnet.tw had that too very early): http://hookrace.net/
21:40 < Shiki> ddnet got more freshness than teeworlds(.com) will ever get it seems
21:41 < Savander> XD
21:41 < Savander> ok.
21:41 < Savander> you're right.
21:41 < Savander> so
21:41 < Savander> fuck this project
21:41 < Savander> ddnet.tw should stay as is.
21:41 <@EastByte> you have to finish it now
21:42 < Shiki> yeah, I've seen hookrace.net, it looks very cool too tbh
21:45 < Shiki> oh, btw, about teeworlds and ddnet
21:46 < Shiki> wasn't teeworlds forked like 4 years ago to create ddrace?
21:46 < Shiki> and then you forked ddrace?
21:46 <@deen> ddnet*
21:46 <@deen> yes
21:47 < Shiki> hm, I thought it's like that teeworlds -> (forked) ddrace -> ddnet
21:47 <@deen> i think at some point i added all the changes from TW into ddnet
21:47 <@deen> ehm, yes it is
21:47 <@deen> ddrace was also based on some other mod
21:48 < Shiki> are you planning to merge with teeworlds 0.7?
21:48 <@deen> maybe
21:48 <@deen> ehm, no
21:48 <@deen> i'm not planning
21:48 < Shiki> it looks like this will lots of  work
21:48 < Shiki> will be*
21:48 <@deen> i don't see any work going into tw 0.7
21:48 <@deen> and no reason to switch over
21:48 <@heinrich5991> let's see when and whether 0.7 will get released
21:48 <@EastByte> "this year" :D
21:48 <@deen> when 0.7 is released and actually gets played, then we can start thinking/working on it
21:49 <@heinrich5991> (don't worry, in the start, all new teeworlds version were not played ^^)
21:49 < Shiki> I just wonder what happens if teeworlds.com releases 0.7 but ddnet community stays on 0.6
21:50 <@EastByte> 0.7 probably will be on steam then
21:50 < Shiki> ah, right
21:50 < Savander> haha
21:50 < Savander> btw
21:50 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: 0.7 replacing 0.6 on steam, is that possible?
21:50 < Savander> on 0.5 teeworlds
21:50 < Savander> people still play
21:50 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I'd like to avoid that
21:50 <@EastByte> hm
21:50 <@heinrich5991> I hope there's a different option
21:50 <@deen> 0.5 is still played, so what's so bad about ddnet staying at 0.6 (at least for some time)?
21:51 < Shiki> because it's more than half of active tw players?
21:51 <@heinrich5991> 0.5 is barely played IIRC
21:51 <@deen> well, i just joined a 0.5 ddrace server and was banned^^
21:51 <@EastByte> we could simply keep the ddnet server as they are and implement a bridge to 0.7
21:51 < Shiki> :O
21:51 <@EastByte> as some of you already did^^
21:51 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, i worked on that, but too much work, will only do that when 0.7 is out
21:53 <@deen> and on another 0.5 server they're explaining a noob how to bind keys and play the game
21:53 <@deen> doesn't look 100% dead^^
21:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: how many players does it have right now?
21:53 <@deen> heinrich5991: 10 i think^^
21:53 <@heinrich5991> in total?
21:53 <@heinrich5991> well...
21:53 < Savander> i saw few people on teeworlds 0.7 with slopes! wow, modification.
21:54 <@EastByte> Savander: wasn't that a 0.6 patch?
21:54 < Savander> nope
21:55 < Savander> Download windows: http://savander.pl/upload/teeworlds-0.7.0-slope-win.zip
21:55 < Savander> Download Linux: http://savander.pl/upload/teeworlds-0.7.0-slope-linux_x86.tar.gz
21:55 <@deen> nice, TW 0.4 still has a few servers
21:56 <@deen> ddrace servers
21:56 < Savander> o.O?
21:56 < Shiki> wow, I didn't even know ddrace existed back then
21:56 < Savander> ye, me too
21:56 <@deen> something is weird with them, can't connect
21:56 < Shiki> how long have you been playing ddrace, deen?
21:56 <@deen> Shiki: only 3 years or so
21:57 <@deen> or 4
21:57 <@deen> started in 0.6
21:57 <@deen> when HellGate 3 was released
21:57 < Shiki> :)
21:57 < Shiki> how comes you remember exactly that?
21:58 <@deen> i only played that map, for months
21:58 <@deen> until i finally finished it
21:58 <@deen> 1 day later i had rank 1 on it =)
21:59 < Shiki> that truly is pro's spirit!
21:59 < Savander> :D
21:59 < Savander> 0.4 doesn't works for me too
21:59 < Savander> (connection)
21:59 <@deen> then we speed-raced all next maps on ddmax
22:00 <@deen> well, actually i found a few cheats and we cheated most of them^^
22:00 <@deen> but no one ever noticed
22:00 < Shiki> and since we're talking about history here, what was the motivation for ddnet?
22:00 <@deen> Shiki: well, then I was perma-banned from ddmax
22:00 <@deen> and same for all the other ddnet founding members
22:01 <@deen> so we started a new server where everyone could play without fear of being banned
22:01 <@deen> that was years ago
22:01 <@deen> two*
22:02 < Shiki> emm, who were the admins of ddmax? Tsin is the only name that comes to my memroy
22:02 <@EastByte> deen: I remember that I started playing ddnet from the moment on you used my webgl viewer
22:02 < Shiki> not sure if it's the correct name though
22:02 < Savander> Tsin
22:02 < Savander> yes
22:02 <@deen> Shiki: yes, Tsin was the main guy, and the one we all had problems with
22:02 < Savander> i had too
22:03 <@deen> the other ddmax admins are all nice guys
22:03 < Savander> i was in project with him ;)
22:03 <@deen> many of which help or helped ddnet then
22:03 < Savander> (new DDmax, you know)
22:03 <@EastByte> I never had problems with Tsin :<
22:03 <@deen> EastByte: me too, until i made a joke about him once =/
22:03 <@EastByte> haha you aren't even funny :D
22:04 <@deen> oh, and i also started ddrace development then
22:04 < Shiki> btw what was the name of the guy who was on top ddmax together with aaa?
22:04 <@deen> I implemented distributed ban server for ddmax so tsin could keep us banned :P
22:04 < Savander> when he when he discovered, i'm helping ddnet. He told me, if i'll tell them anything about project, he will ban me etc.
22:04 <@deen> Shiki: Crytical?
22:04 <@EastByte> ^^
22:04 < Shiki> nah, there was some other guy
22:04 <@deen> Shiki: Virus2k, Vergeboy?
22:04 < Shiki> yeaah, 2k
22:05 < Shiki> I only remember him because he came to vanilla once
22:05 < Shiki> and got pwned real hard
22:05 <@deen> I played with Lady Saavik in official Vanilla Tournament. I think I had minus points in the end^^
22:06 < Shiki> some 2o2 tournament?
22:06 <@deen> yes
22:06 <@deen> the one where you could win money and we signed up as Team DDNet
22:06 < Shiki> hm, we usually don't consider 2on2 being a timeworthy game in vanilla
22:06 < Shiki> 5on5 is the right choice!
22:09 <@deen> anyway, ddmax was great while it existed. i hope people enjoy ddnet now the same we enjoyed ddmax back then
22:12 < Shiki> hm my ddr pro friend, Wombat, complained back then that all ddmax maps look the same
22:12 < Shiki> at least on medium skill level
22:12 < Shiki> he seems to really enjoy ddnet now though
22:13 <@deen> yes, ddmax converged into all maps having a similar style
22:13 <@deen> so ddnet tried to differentiate by asking mappers to do creative maps
22:13 <@deen> i got lots of complaints when I added some of the typical ddmax maps to ddnet
22:14 <@deen> and now we're adding all ddmax maps into their own category, as you may have heard
22:14 < Shiki> not only heard but finished few of them already!
22:15 <@deen> great!
23:25 < Learath2> oh i missed the nostalgia time 
23:46 < o_be_one> theres more and more weird players on v3royal x)
23:46 < o_be_one> ive met a kamikaze, named kamikaze, who just go next to you, put an angry smile and do a self-kill ...
23:47 < o_be_one> now, there's someone who just go to you, make some heart, and go to other tee, do hearts, etc etc.
23:49 < masoudd> lol
23:58 <@deen> o_be_one: sounds like they don't understand block. neither do i
