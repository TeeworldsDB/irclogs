10:29 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 4de7b45 def: Select SDL2.framework instead of SDL.framework on Mac OS X
12:00 < Henningstone> Hum, can somebody help me with a little problem about (missing) shared objects? If I compile DDNet for a friend of mine on my linux x86_64 machine, he cannot run it with the following error: https://gyazo.com/e87dedc8fa2e62b5147764ac837214ec But if he downloads it from ddnet.tw, he can run it. So what do I have to do different when compiling?
12:00 < Henningstone> Note: he has also a linux x86_64 machine
12:01 <@deen> Henningstone: there are two problems there
12:01 <@deen> he needs the libmysqlcppconn or you statically link it in
12:02 <@deen> and libstdc++ is not statically linked as well, he could update it on his server
12:02 <@deen> and he could also install libmysqlcppconn
12:03 < Henningstone> I know he could, but I would like to do it without requiring him to install stuff, thanks for you advice :) Gonna link it statically then.
12:03 <@EastByte> not sure whether statically linking libstdc++ works well
12:04 <@deen> yeah, we stopped doing it in ddnet
12:04 <@deen> maybe he just has an older libstdc++ version on his system
12:04 <@EastByte> you could set up a chroot container with the same distribution he has and compile it in there
12:04 <@deen> or compile it on his system directly :P
12:06 <@deen> ah, the idea to statically link mysqlcppconn is to set mysql.use_mysqlconfig = false in config.lua
12:06 < Henningstone> Oh it's actually that easy? Nice!
12:06 <@deen> i think so
12:07 <@deen> but then it uses the bundled version instead of your system one
12:07 <@deen> and the bundled one caused problems with login for some people, so not sure
12:07 <@deen> you'll notice if the binary is 10 MB bigger, then it's static
12:08 < Henningstone> Just gonna try and hope it works. Otherwise I have to explain him how to compile teeworlds :3
12:09 <@EastByte> no need to explain, just put all commands in one bash line :p
12:12 <@EastByte> that moment when the rescue cd of your vps provider doesn't support ext4 and you have to edit the disk image remotely
12:16 <@deen> EastByte: fun
12:17 <@EastByte> I'm glad to have a decent internet link
15:57 < Savander> hi :). I found something, weird :). 
15:58 < Savander> on Dummy Chamber, when is too many people on spawn point (there is only one). You can't join to game
15:58 < Savander> not only me, few other people had the same problem
15:58 < Savander> if you want to see, join to me

19:38 <@deen> For 5 minutes I thought I had a mouse movement bug in DDNet client
19:39 <@deen> until I noticed that my mouse had power saving activated and stopped reacting without movement for a few seconds...
19:39 < Gabee_> lol
21:04 < paperman> Hi
21:05 < paperman> I have lower fps in new version with SDL 2 on my old laptop
21:06 < paperman> my cpu throttle is set on 2
21:06 < paperman> I also have some kind of rendering problem I think
21:06 < paperman> What should I do?
21:06 < paperman> I'm using DDNet 10.1
21:07 < paperman> my gpu is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] RV515/M54 [Mobility Radeon X1400]
21:07 < Henningstone> And on which operation system are you on?
21:07 < paperman> Kali rolling release
21:08 < Henningstone> Hm, I'm also on linux with AMD graphics, and my fps stabilized again after installing SDL 2.0.4 instead of 2.0.2, dunno if that trick is universal or not :D
21:12 < paperman> version of libsdl2-2.0-0:amd64 is 2.0.4+dfsg1-2+b1

21:35 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 61e4742 def: Clean up debug messages a bit (lower case, no useless errors)
21:42 <@deen> paperman: cpu throttle 0, gfx_asyncrender_old 1, vsync on/off?
21:42 < paperman> When I move there's a horizontal line that frames above and below it are not in the same column.
21:42 <@deen> sounds like a vsync/double buffering problem
21:43 < paperman> my vsync is on
21:43 <@deen> another possibility is that it's about being able to resize the window now on linux
21:43 <@deen> that should never happen with vsync, strange
21:44 <@deen> out of curiosity, free driver or proprietary?
21:44 < paperman> Free I think
21:44 <@deen> ok, so same one as I use
21:44 <@deen> I get exactly the same fps
21:45 <@deen> with an rv710 though
21:46 <@deen> it's possible that sdl2 uses some more advanced opengl and your gpu has problems
21:46 <@deen> not supporting it, so it's SW emulated
21:46 < paperman> hmm... That's sad 
21:47 <@deen> you could google around for sdl2 problems with old amd graphics
21:47 <@deen> maybe there's a magic setting
21:47 <@deen> because basically we're still doing the exact same thing
21:48 <@deen> running a manual opengl context and just displaying it in sdl, performance shouldn't depend much on the sdl version
21:48 <@deen> gfx_resizable 0 has no effect?
21:49 <@deen> the free amd driver is still pretty sad performance-wise, especially on old cards
21:51 < paperman> gfx_resizable 0 --> no difference.
21:52 < paperman> Actually my fps was low in previous version in some maps but enabling a background tile got my fps almost fixed on 60. Now background tile doesn't work as well as before
21:53 <@deen> background tile?
21:53 < paperman> page down disables those background images and replaces them with a background color
21:54 <@deen> ah yeah. you know, i wrote that because i had to switch from proprietary to free amd driver and was annoyed at lower fps on maps :P
21:54 <@deen> good to hear other people used it for the same purpose
21:54 <@deen> have an example of a map where it worked well?
21:55 < paperman> :) almost all maps 
21:55 < paperman> for example openfng5
21:57 <@deen> gfx_finish 1 has no effect, i guess
21:57 < paperman> I'll try
22:00 <@deen> my guess is just that SDL2 does more HW-accelerated
22:00 < paperman> fps is varies in different maps
22:00 <@deen> and the free amd driver has bad performance, see for example https://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?t=9620&sid=5461c1d674b1c9acfe4b3f66883d7bba
22:00 < paperman> does the proprietary driver support my gpu?
22:01 <@deen> nope
22:01 < paperman> great :|
22:01 <@deen> they stopped supporting our old cpus long ago
22:01 <@deen> gpus*
22:01 < paperman> poor us
22:01 <@deen> maybe you can force sdl2 to disable hw acceleration
22:02 <@deen> can you compile ddnet client on your own?
22:03 <@deen> then you could play around with some sdl2 hints and see how they impact performance
22:03 < paperman> I think I can. 
22:04 <@deen> in src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp before SDL_CreateWindow, you can try these:
22:04 <@deen> SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION, "0");
22:04 <@deen> SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION, "opengl");
22:05 <@deen> SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION, "software");
22:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Ryozuki opened pull request #458: Added cl_showping (master...pr_showping) https://git.io/vwSkb
22:05 <@deen> SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_RENDER_OPENGL_SHADERS, "0");
22:05 <@deen> SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_RENDER_VSYNC, "0"); // and "1"
22:11 < paperman> ok I'll get my hands dirty tomorrow. Thanks and good night. (it's probably not night there though)
22:12 <@deen> good night and good luck. if you want some fun, you could download the win version and run it with wine, it's sometimes faster than native :P
22:12 <@deen> meh, too late
