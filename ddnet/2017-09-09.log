21:26 <@heinrich5991> deen: no, I don't have a mac
21:26 <@deen> i see
21:26 <@deen> so not easy to fix for you as well
21:26 <@heinrich5991> no
21:27 <@deen> what's wrong with the mac travis build?
21:27 <@deen> it didn't like my change?
21:27 <@deen> it always says "build cancelled" and job log is empty
21:27 <@deen> https://travis-ci.org/ddnet/ddnet
21:27 <@heinrich5991> probably something to do with https://www.traviscistatus.com/
21:28 <@deen> ok, so not about my mac changes
21:28 <@heinrich5991> macOS jobs for public and private repositories builds are stopped. 
21:28 <@heinrich5991> quote unquote
21:28 <@heinrich5991> "major outage"
21:29 <@deen> The best way to enable POST would be to add a parameter to CFetchTask I think
21:29 <@deen> like a fixed size char array with the data
21:29 <@deen> but I'm not sure what size to choose
21:30 <@deen> and all ddnet servers run on debian 9 now
21:30 <@deen> only ger and rus still need to be restarted when I catch them being empty
21:30 <@heinrich5991> is that realted?
21:30 <@deen> nope
21:30 <@heinrich5991> does GER have a time where it's completely empty?
21:30 <@deen> 5-6 am maybe 5-10 players
21:30 <@deen> during the week
21:30 <@deen> but GER will be restarted on Monday at 6 am anyway because of a Xen vuln.
21:31 <@deen> Makes me worried that nfoservers is the only hoster that even restarts servers when vulnerabilities get fixed
21:31 <@deen> ...
21:31 <@deen> I guess the other hosters don't give a fuck
21:31 <@heinrich5991> ._.
21:32 <@deen> well, not much to expect from 5-10 â‚¬ virtual servers
21:59 <@deen> Learath2: bot broken again
22:35 <+eeeee> maybe other hosters aren't running xen or are doing live migrations?
22:36 <+eeeee> or using ksplice
22:51 <@deen> eeeee: yeah, xen is well known for having lots of security problems. but i'm not as hopeful as you :)
23:59 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: it seems that the bot is dead?
