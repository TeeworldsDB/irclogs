06:52 < bridge> <blackkkent> hi chiller
06:52 < bridge> <blackkkent> 2025-07-12 09:52:10 I chat/server: *** Account stuff is turned off.
06:52 < bridge> <blackkkent> how to enable account? sv_account_stuff "1"
07:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent to fix the twbl compile error make sure you have the submodules. Did you clone with git? ``git submodule update --init --recursive``
07:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to turn on accounts for the old version it used to be ``sv_account_stuff 1`` yes but the new one uses ``sv_accounts 1``
07:23 < bridge> <blackkkent> thx chiller, how i how to make russification
07:23 < bridge> <blackkkent> i tried through code but there the coding didn't go right and white cubes appeared
07:23 < bridge> <blackkkent> and how to give vip?
07:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> add ``sv_language ru`` to your config
07:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> getting white cubes when trying to translate to russian is hilarious btw :D 
08:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent for vip checkout the chat command /sql
08:04 < bridge> <blackkkent> will everything be translated automatically?
08:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no only the strings i translated manually
08:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> contributions welcome btw my russian is not the best 
08:05 < bridge> <blackkkent> okay im from russia and i can translate the whole text very well, where can i change it?
08:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can start by just opening an issue with the text you would like translated here @blackkkent https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues
08:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> once that works out well i can show you how to edit the code
08:06 < bridge> <blackkkent> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1393473647556952094/image.png?ex=68734cf7&is=6871fb77&hm=33a4f991c2aff9390fbca9b0ab7568d48d68637e2b3f652f1d4528abf824e54f&
08:06 < bridge> <blackkkent> im opened
08:07 < bridge> <blackkkent> in visual studio code
08:07 < bridge> <blackkkent> your fork
08:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> *insert pulp fiction scene*
08:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which @jxsl13 ?
08:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never seen it xd @jxsl13 
08:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> the ine about english
08:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye
08:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> know that one
08:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> the one about english
08:08 < bridge> <blackkkent> chiller
08:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye?
08:08 < bridge> <blackkkent> how to enable double moneytiles but not use rcon
08:08 < bridge> <blackkkent> in confing
08:08 < bridge> <blackkkent> config
08:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``sv_min_double_tile_players 1``
08:09 < bridge> <blackkkent> thx
08:09 < bridge> <blackkkent> what your command translated?
08:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat are you planning to fix the bugsis or should i?
08:14 < bridge> <blackkkent> chiller, why don't you make a translation in a separate file where there will be English words and their translation into Russian in your ddnetpp
08:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you can fix stack bug and I will add sanitizers
08:16 < bridge> <blackkkent> 2025-07-12 11:16:04 I chat/server: *** �� ��������� �������: s. ��������� /cmdlist ����� ���������� ���� ���� ������.
08:16 < bridge> <blackkkent> how to fix this
08:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat u got the ez task -.- i will go crashout if you complain about my memory management tho :p 
08:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sure lets do it
08:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent did you edit the code?
08:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent yea i was too lazy to add a proper translation system for now its just simple string compare in the code 
08:20 < bridge> <blackkkent> yes
08:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent then i assume you added a bug?
08:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont edit the code xd
08:20 < bridge> <blackkkent> im translated english to ru
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: where do you think to add malloc for strings?
08:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot malloc for strings?
08:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ok, how would you fix the bug?
08:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Or you don't know yet?
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> malloc payload with max payload size? xd
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am currently going full ``const`` everywhere for starters
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then ill check again
08:26 < bridge> <blackkkent> chillerdragon ignor me:(
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ignore what
08:27 < bridge> <blackkkent> how i can translate:(?
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i told you already
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> open an issue with the text you want translated. I am not going to give you a coding tutorial right now here in the chat.
08:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did not ignore you i responded to every message. If you accuse me of ignoring again or circle the conversation one more time im gonna ignore you fr. You are the one who ignored what i said.
08:31 < bridge> <blackkkent> okay chiller i won't bother you
08:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent dont you dare rq on me. Open an issue now!
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat my idea was just to move that from the stack to the heap and be done with it? ``uint8_t payload[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];``
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that should work right?
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: In theory yes, but I tired it yesterday and the version string was not full length
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh shiet
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> asan to the rescue i guess xd
08:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Maybe I did something wrong tho
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> iirc you once made me remove the payload buffer from the packet right?
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am planning to add that ._.
08:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg i keep using both "len" and "size" i hate it. Which one is better @milkeeycat ?
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm a len kinda guy
08:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> len it is
08:43 < bridge> <blackkkent> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues/484
08:43 < bridge> <blackkkent> im created bro
08:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> epic
08:44 < bridge> <blackkkent> and im wait
08:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Iirc I googled once "len" vs "size" xd
08:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
08:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean len is shorter soo
08:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent i was more thinking you send both the english text and the russian text in the issue and then i go do it for you
08:44 < bridge> <blackkkent> chiller how to enable showing lvl in tab instead of time
08:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chat cmd /score level or config ``sv_display_score level``
08:45 < bridge> <blackkkent> im lazy 🙂
08:45 < bridge> <blackkkent> I would like to do it little by little myself, but it will be faster for me
08:45 < bridge> <blackkkent> thx
08:46 < bridge> <blackkkent> can i change vip command settings? for example add /weapons command or remove some command
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont think so
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its a good idea
08:47 < bridge> <blackkkent> hah
08:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: why do tests pass now? 0_o
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they always did
08:49 < bridge> <blackkkent> chiller why did you stop playing copy love box 2s
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was just the non happy path that was weird
08:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blackkkent idk i didnt?
08:49 < bridge> <blackkkent> hah
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: what do you think about malloc'ing strings here https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/ddnet_protocol/blob/9203c4ae5f03ebac786c487f7d2afaf17eba4022/src/packet.c#L33 instead of the whole payload?
08:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it breaks my brain milkeey xd
08:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :c
08:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that function is called for each decoded chunk
08:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it seems more complicated and slower to allocate all individual fields
08:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> malloc is expensive
08:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``			.chunks = malloc(sizeof(Chunk) * packet.header.num_chunks),``
08:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we have this already? xd
08:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bro im lost
08:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try malloc entire payload quickly
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bru where asan @milkeeycat xd
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we split the tasks wrong
10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat my neovim wants tabs in the cmakelists txt somehow btw
10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> super annoying
10:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> why malloc anyway, just have a 2000 bytes array on the stack
10:52 < bridge> <melon> :feelsbadman:

14:08 < bridge> <melon> ```

14:08 < bridge> <melon> 
14:08 < bridge> <melon> its a habit of doing these commands via ClientID
14:09 < bridge> <melon> and the fact that muting works via ClientID, but the index stores it as an IP, so muting the main and dummy of a player has only one index entry
14:10 < bridge> <melon> why do we even have vote_unmute and vote_unmuteid, and why are mods restricted to not use id

14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> #10170
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> i think crashes bcs it just runs out of memory
14:18 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10170
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> the map is too big
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> i get random heap corrupted crashes
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> I wish I had either
16:25 < bridge> <robyt3> The ASAN error says heap-buffer-overflow. I don't think it's an allocation failure, the `new` would have crashed. And it shouldn't be running out of memory for a map that only contains a single 500x500 layer.
16:29 < bridge> <robyt3> We always had commands to unmute by list position and client ID. I saw no reason to break the existing command. I suppose mods should have access to `vote_unmuteid` though.
16:41 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks I wanted to track down why my renderer used a lotta memory. Then I noticed it fluctuates between 8% and 72% memory usage. Heaptrack only shows me 4GB peak. I suppose it is probably the gpu driver for some reason? o.o
16:41 < bridge> <patiga> (4GB is more like 8%)
16:44 < bridge> <patiga> ig update drivers and hope for the best?
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno. Driver or wgpu.
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is when abstraction makes it hard
16:56 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 no idea how to make it with snapshots
16:56 < bridge> <kebscs> but it works fine with this patch
17:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> what about backwards compatibility
17:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh wait if its an extension then its fine
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> its backwards compatible
17:04 < bridge> <kebscs> old clients will unpack new demos correctly
17:04 < bridge> <kebscs> old clients will unpack new msg in demos correctly
17:04 < bridge> <patiga> but wgpu would show up in heaptrack, no?
17:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> alright makes sense

17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Add a new member to an appropriate snap object, or a new snap object if there isn't one. When in doubt, create a new object. There already is `protocol7::CNetObj_GameDataRace` for 0.7 which serves this purpose (see `IGameController::Snap`). I'd add a new `NetObjectEx` `GameDataRace` (name subject to be changed) for DDNet with only the current server record. The 0.7 object also contain precision and flags, but we probably don't need those.

18:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> all that drama about thor is so annoying tbh
18:29 < bridge> <melon> isnt there a huuge shitstorm towards him rn?
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> I never liked Thor anyway, after his horseshit opinion on stop killing games
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> glad people are picking on him

18:30 < bridge> <melon> i only saw like 2-3 X posts about people ranting because he hit on an initiative that is supposed to stop greedy gamedevs from being greedy
18:30 < bridge> <melon> and he bragged about working at blizzard every second sentence
18:30 < bridge> <melon> 
18:30 < bridge> <melon> yet he cant really code
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> I know exactly the kind of person he is, very high ego fueled by nothing but his popularity
18:33 < bridge> <melon> -# ~~sounds like me!~~
18:33 < bridge> <learath2> I'd be glad if he'd just fade into obscurity and we can all get on with our lives
18:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> does his opinion actually matter
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> tens of thousands of people watch him
18:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> everything should be taken with a grain of salt, but maybe the fact he worked at blizzard makes him more trustable in some way
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> most of the people that watch him are not devs at all
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> otherwise that drama would have started a lot sooner
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> It's a false appeal to authority. He keeps repeating it because it's what gives him some legitimacy. Remove that and he is just like Mike Kern, technically didn't achieve anything
18:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah it's completely true, without his "20 years of game development" he is just a regular game streamer
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> he barely codes on the streams
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> but it's so funny to look at the code sometimes
18:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk I never even got to hear his opinion on stop killing games
18:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I got him recommended like two or three times, heard him being an idiot with just about everything he said, and blocked his channel from my recommends
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> I dislike and click not interested everytime he shows up on my youtube but the algorithm really likes him for some reason
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> He keeps popping back up
18:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Try the "Don't recommend channel" button
18:43 < bridge> <totar> I didn't really understand why he has such a following in the first place, I watched one of his streams for 10 minutes a few months ago and I didn't hear anything insightful from him. But I saw him doing collaborations with people who do have credibility or at least real experience like primeagen so idk.
18:43 < bridge> <learath2> He does the paint thing that asmongold also does which the twitch crowd loves. Explain something complex with boxes drawn in paint
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> Understanding complex things makes people feel smart, I'm guessing it's that feeling
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> Understanding complex things makes people feel smart, I'm guessing it's that feeling that they chase
18:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think of it as gesturing
18:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Primeagen is cool at times but I haven't heard him criticize many people... Like, especially not fellow "content creators"
18:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> because he is smart at avoiding drama, no one wants that
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> I saw Primeagen at twitchcon, he appeared to be a fairly humble dude from the 5-10 minutes we chatted
18:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> pffft imagine being socially responsible
18:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> irl?
18:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> correction: internet responsible, it's much worse
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> aye
18:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah he seems pretty humble and likes to praise people a lot for being better at technical things than him
18:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> his videos or rather live stream vods are really repetitive
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> yeah I don't much enjoy his content either tbh, but his opinions don't seem to be very wrong in general
18:47 < bridge> <totar> Yeah I stopped watching them after a while, hes pretty funny but the article readings get old eventually
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> though there is one thing that not many people like, his reviewing sometimes steals the audience for an article/video
18:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I still watch him occasionally but only when the topic is something a bit less usual
18:48 < bridge> <pilonpl> theo is pretty funny
18:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> he changes his stack every video lol
18:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> seems like he switched to postgres now
18:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> i wonder what db he's gonna switch to next lol
18:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> should hop on the BASH stack
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> postgres ❤️
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> I should try to port ddnet to postgres
18:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> what does it use now?
18:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> mariadb
18:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: not sure if I missed it. But I feel like 2rockets is such a missed opportunity for Easter eggs. You did it so nicely with nudeldragores. The 7 yr old shreko video was so epic.
18:51 < bridge> <totar> Ddnet has pretty basic db usage anyway
18:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> i like sqlite
18:51 < bridge> <totar> postgres gets fun with recursive CTEs
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe, dunno if e.g. wgpu allocates staging buffers without clearing them directly or similar
18:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't know much about databases but from what I understand it's that when in doubt, use postgres
18:52 < bridge> <totar> Its not strictly the best at everything
18:53 < bridge> <totar> Notably upgrading the version sucks compared to some other dbs
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> do they change the whole format or what xd
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> shouldn't it be just replacing the binary
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> well dbs are more complex than i understand
18:54 < bridge> <totar> https://andreas.scherbaum.la/post/2022-06-22_postgresql-upgrades-are-hard/#_content
18:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> well a fair bit of the performance comes from how the data is organized, so I guess they'd try to improve that 🤔
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah they should use teeworlds huffman compression and teeworlds ints!
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> profit
19:00 < bridge> <totar> This isn't the article I was looking for but I remember seeing a horror story one about someone having to upgrade a postgres cluster and it taking multiple days per instance but they couldn't do it incrementally because it didn't support version mismatch within the cluster, and for some reason MySQL had some feature that would have avoided that.
19:00 < bridge> <patiga> ow damn, right
19:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> so in the end mysql isn't that bad
19:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> i hear everyone say that postgres is superior to mysql
19:02 < bridge> <totar> At this one specific task yes
19:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> well it is an important task
19:02 < bridge> <totar> It is yeah
19:02 < bridge> <totar> But not every usecase will run into that issue
19:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why would anyone use anything other than mongodb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs&t=5s
19:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> i don't like mangos
19:14 < bridge> <learath2> Truly web scale
19:16 < bridge> <teero777> what?
19:17 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks ok yup its wgpu. if I create the wgpu device with the setting `MemoryHints::MemoryUsage` instead of `MemoryHints::Performance`, it stays at 4% ram usage 😮
19:31 < bridge> <melon> i'm not joking when i tell you that i'd help
19:31 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> I'm just a tad busy writing a passable academic looking enough paper that is decently researched in 5 days
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> After that maybe we can give it a go
19:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> golang mentioned
19:53 < bridge> <chairn> what's the topic 🙂 ?
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> A brief exploration of Secure Boot. It's not supposed to be anything novel really, just an academic writing sample
20:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> rip
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> I had a feeling that'd happen, that's why I didn't merge it 😛
20:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> when is that happening
20:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1393657854753247374/image.png?ex=6873f885&is=6872a705&hm=0e98aaa312763d2c2fe2bd64d962d63f1456f5922cc82317bcf625123f4b58b9&
20:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> it's been years i think
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> With QUIC
20:19 < bridge> <learath2> I was hoping it'd happen 2nd or 3rd quarter of this year
20:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> it all depends on heinrich
20:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> no one else dares touch quic
20:40 < bridge> <learath2> Did y'all know microsoft wrote the windows 11 start menu in react-native? 😄
20:40 < bridge> <learath2> It slurps your cpu when launched
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Any noticeable perf diff?
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No way
20:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1393666691791065199/image.png?ex=687400c0&is=6872af40&hm=3bbf1fb9d676f80027625b17298d81a418e41e5ecbce25dc79aa09c4f1b5671c&
20:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> why
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> a result of ban being registered twice I guess
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, `// overwrites base command, todo: improve this`
21:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: dat's crazy xd
21:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1393668625566666882/image.png?ex=6874028d&is=6872b10d&hm=473bcf7938334da3b6bb2cbccc6052574d61be6e6650239a0698ce17d2c786fd&
21:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> wtf i found an out of date comment
21:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> there are so many issues in this game lol
21:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> there are no issues
21:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> only features
21:15 < bridge> <aegisub> yeah
21:15 < bridge> <aegisub> nothing says "microsoft" more than 50 half-finished systems by different teams that all work differently
21:59 < bridge> <louis> @coverushka cool volleybot lol
22:04 < bridge> <louis> did u try training for longer / without skip ticks?
22:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> Another pr
22:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> Fixing basically a typo lol
22:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's always an improvement i guess
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> if you want easy 1 line pr you can look at this <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/.clang-tidy#L9>
22:11 < bridge> <kebscs> `DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling` is fixed, `-readability-use-std-min-max` easy to fix if not already fixed
22:11 < bridge> <kebscs> etc
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> huh
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1393686204888780800/image.png?ex=687412ec&is=6872c16c&hm=f159f022ad5c8f88e614de4b50680f3d6a349ef1afe8414d2ec25c95b197e510&
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> but performance!!!
22:12 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet good enough performance
22:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> can be better
22:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> imagine saving 2 bytes
22:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> in a single struct
22:12 < bridge> <kebscs> you can disable the check and see if any changes make sense
22:12 < bridge> <kebscs> for me clang tidy compiles too long
22:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks for contributing to my repo

22:30 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> https://youtu.be/ZfzoedHlJQ0 this had so many stylistic devises. Could have yoinked one of them as Easter egg
22:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like you did with this one https://youtu.be/kFEgXGuTmfE don’t find yours .. Unlisted L
22:39 < bridge> <teero777> this? xD
22:39 < bridge> <teero777> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtZIMO4Vi5g
22:39 < bridge> <teero777> but why would you want run_2Rockets like this
22:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean the same idea of taking the map authors video style for the tas run
