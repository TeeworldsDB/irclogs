00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> i dont see my messages rip
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> lmao that won't even get you a window up
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> vulkan was always meant to have some sort of middle ground engine/library for 90% of users
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> i think they are trying to push some QoL stuff like the new dynamic rendering extension lets you forget about all the mobile crap like subpasses and dependencies
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why doesn't refreshing the server list sometimes do nothing since the update?

10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sorry, fixed
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PapotaV> :heartw:
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thx deen

12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @joji what do you mean by "nothing"? you see no changes?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's always re-downloading the list from the master server, but it doesn't throw away the old one until the new one arrives
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it kept the server list as it was like 5 minutes ago and didnt refresh when i pressed f5
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently master1 was down today
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe that was the problem
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although it shouldâ„¢ fallback to master2 in this case
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The UX with the silent refresh isn't great. Errors should result in some visible change. Refreshes should be more obvious
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the error should be displayed somewhere, yes
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> refreshes more obvious, idk
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yea
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I think that the UX with silent refresh is very much better than what we had before, simply reverting would decrease UX in the common case, I think)
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk i had zero issues the way it was before
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for some people, refreshing takes a long time, thus they didn't like pressing the refresh button
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also didn't like that it'd throw away the old list before it was sure it could get a new one
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but thats visual feedback and visual feedback is important in stuff like that
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that in your case you couldn't have joined any servers anymore after refreshing
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because they'd be all gone
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'm all for a better error display, see abvoe)
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I agree with izanagi there. The refresh making the page disappear for a second is very common
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm just saying that I think the state we had before was worse
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, proper ux for the current version is even better
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you need to say more why "common" is good
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you mean that users expect it?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> today when i refreshed and the master was down, i didnt see that it didnt refreshed
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it shouldnt be like that
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would you rather have had the server list deleted?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> what do you mean by that?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> previously, the way you'd see the error was that you couldn't see a server list anymore
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yea thats way better
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok ^^
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> at least i didnt have any issues with that
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd enjoy still being able to join servers
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Learath2\: i copied those bois into ddnet and prefixed NETMSGTYPE\_.. with protocol7\:\: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/f35da54b6f2c5f9fd4bbd4559f887ccf8f8cc526/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L307-L330but it does not seem to ship it to the 0.7 client. Any ideas?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: when wireshark dissector update? \:)last commit 7 months ago \:c
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you need? 0.7 support? ^^
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yep
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but id take anything
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (common per se isn't a good argument, but user expectation is one)
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 0.6 isnt fully covered is it? like snap data
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yes
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hogspeed> https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/welcome/important-message-from-the-gwb/
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Learath2\: ? \:c
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do i need a magic - somewhere?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is a gamemsg even
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i use it for flag events
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> like grab capture etc it creates sounds for example
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and translated chat messages
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet it get's dropped in CServer
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> okay why would it be dropped and whereÃŸ
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> okay why would it be dropped and where?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> drop outgoing data?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually, did you use SendPackMsg?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i only prefixed protocol7\:\:
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no other changes
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Use SendPackMsg there
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok ty
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/0d916e2ef6a18e76bca60cad27b23360ac4c1b6c/datasrc/seven/network.py#L377
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hmm it has no arguments
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (SendPackMsg is a template function, which will do template magic to make sure your protocol7 messages don't get inappropriately re-translated)
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> vanilla uses up to 4 ints as arguments should i just edit network.py?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are there 4 int arguments in the vanilla network.py?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ou idk lemme check
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah there its the same
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but they dont use packmsg
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hate having special cases everywhere :(((
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i guess i have to implement template magic in SendGameMsg then?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No wait a second let me read
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im not working on a pr so it can be ugly \:D
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, create your msgpacker with 3 arguments
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The third argument, should be true for the message to not be translated at a lower layer
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After that you need to by hand make sure you only send this to sixup clients
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i am not following
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm crying
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how to create a msg packer
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `CMsgPacker Msg(NETMSGTYPE_SV_GAMEMSG, false, true);`
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ou
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you sure you know how to use C++? ðŸ˜›
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok now i get it thanks lemme try
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can send the Msg with `SendMsg` but as I said, you first need to make sure the recepient is a sixup client
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea i was planning on doing that anyway
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The protocol7 stuff sadly turned out to be such a mess ðŸ˜¦
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think its fine
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> soon we drop 0.7 anyways... right? ;)
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 0.6\*
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg the typo of doom
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh translating some of the protocol at cgamecontext, some in cserver and some by hand is very meh
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hrmm
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah now it works idk
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks a lot babe \<3
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wow Server()-\>Sixup() returns 208 \:D that was unexpected
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean `IsSixup()`
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That smells like garbage memory :/
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ikr
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> meh but ubsan doesnt catch it
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> must be one of those release only buggos
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> asan &&/|| ubsan should be complaining imo
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nope there its 0
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> classic
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh but 0 is also wrong
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> since im on 0.7 \:D
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> IsSixup(-1)
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ðŸ§ 
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> shouldnt asan or ubsan warn for out of bound access?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They donâ€™t? ;/
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> well i did IsSixup(-1) and it printed 0 just fine without any complaints
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For -1 you need to implement the loop I have in SendPackMsg
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah wait
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the ddnet readme example doesnt print to stdout
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but to logfile
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nvm it got catched
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i am used to direct feedback in stdout
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ik -.-
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i guess its fair to explain that after i asked on how to create a msgpacker haha
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> okay now all works wonderfully thanks a lot @Learath2  \:)
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> any chance we can get some unused SendGameMsg funcs in ddnet ? \:D
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Itâ€™s already a mess I wonâ€™t add them without reworking large parts of how translation happens, and Iâ€™m fairly scared of touching that
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oke
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> May I ask questions about 4k resolution Assets which can affect performance?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Or is there anything that I need to be careful of?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Or is there anything that I need to be careful of when comes from 4k resolution Assets?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I unfortunately don't know
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> http://boringtechnology.club/
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Robyt3 what's the rationale for making the array longer?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ingame names will be capped to 16
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be confusing to see a different name in settings
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I see, if that happens anyway then it should just copy without breaking codepoints
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we have str_utf8_copy or so
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> str_utf8_truncate
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you already do that
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, you can use `str_utf8_copy` there ^^
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> ah, yeah it's just shorthand for that
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but it switches the order of the size parameter again ..
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> sometimes size is second parameter sometimes last
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> should be fixed now
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's this way because strcpy/memcpy has the order dst, src, size
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and all others put the order next to the pointer
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> bug: -Selecting an Entity in the Editor, while switching from one Game Layer to another, it won't update the 
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> selected entity to place and overwrite other entities. Reselecting it will let you place and overwrite
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> entities with again.
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Can't post on Github cuz my account is shit
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> and it's annoying bug
