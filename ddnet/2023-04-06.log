01:44 < bridge> <7mzom alonso> guys anyone help me pls
01:45 < bridge> <7mzom alonso> i am playing on phone i cant join ger 10 white list servers
01:45 < bridge> <7mzom alonso> why this proplem
01:45 < bridge> <Voxel> did you whitelist
01:45 < bridge> <Voxel> on mobile
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> click here http://ger10.ddnet.org/ @7mzom alonso
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> also trol for playing on phone xd
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki in libtw it says "Huffman compression has an extra byte if the actual end is at a byte boundary." did you know that? for you buggy huffman :)
11:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah probs
11:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill fix it someday
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> i see my self using ur crate
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> soon(tm)
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> where can i pre order?
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 are the first two bits of the packet header unused? I wanted to double check here https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/quirks.md but it didnt mention it
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> what a bloated protocol did we waste 2 bits of bandwith for EVERY tw packet ever sent over the network in the last 4 decades?
11:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, disgraceful
11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> imagine the alternative
11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> bitpacking nightmare
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.dragonflydb.io/
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> has anyone tried this
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> redit alternative
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> claimingto be way faster
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sadly its c++
12:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is scaling related so maybe @Avolicious knows the man of scalability
12:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is calloc more efficient than malloc + memzeroing?
12:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> calloc zeroes btw
12:19 < bridge> <Learath2> It should be but you can only know by knowing the exact platform to be deployed on
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur lovely x86
12:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Calloc can skip the memset theoretically if the allocator has a piece of memory already zero'd
12:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why is there no version of malloc that has the interface of calloc, elements and single element size? is there no possible optimizations knowing more info?
12:22 < bridge> <Learath2> Also if you calloc I think it's also allowed to be lazy and give you a CoW zero'd page
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> malloc(n, size) that  doesnt zero i mean
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Iirc jemalloc had something of sorts. But honestly afaik even calloc doesn't use that information for anything, atleast as far as I know in x86
12:24 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe in some exotic platform it can be used for alignment?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess without knowing the data type for e.g. cache lines it's not really optimizable?
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also do u know what malloc_consolidate is, i have a segfault ystday with llvm
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think it happens when everything is doomed
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe a malloc that doesn't guarantee the given size is the size of the returned memory would help
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `malloc_consolidate(): unaligned fastbin chunk detected`
12:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also do u know what malloc_consolidate is, i had* a segfault ystday with llvm
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> another morning with my lovely gentoo
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1093482242694713344/image.png
12:28 < bridge> <Learath2> If I recall correctly malloc_consolidate is called so unused chunks can be merged back
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what more pleasure than compiling ur own software
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do u even know about it xd
12:28 < bridge> <Learath2> You may have accidentally over or underflowed your allocation corrupting a struct header
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 probably, this is the problem with C, im using a C api that wraps a c++ api and they have  poor docs
12:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I wrote a malloc implementation as an exercise once upon a time. I remember looking into other implementations to see what they do
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so im not safe like in rust
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just remake llvm in rust
12:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, malloc_consolidate is called on free to try merge the newly freed memory into the tail of a previously freed chunk
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Where are the safe llvm wrappers xd
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its hard to make a safe wrapper of such a big api
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> llvm is quite brittle ngl
12:31 < bridge> <Learath2> What are you doing with the llvm api anyway?
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i use the llvm C api to use it from rust
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i use it for work and my own language edlang
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they claim to have a C api so u can make bindings
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> c++ is harder to interop
12:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Ryozooki, why don't you link to rust core for your malloc?
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but they rly focus more on the c++ side xd
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i didnt implement any malloc
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this error was from llvm breaking
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> by me using the api in the wrong way
12:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Ohh, llvm is using the malloc
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not me executing my compiled program
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
12:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, asan should find this extremely easily
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo u a smartass compiler dev now. Just make own llvm in rust
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is why i dont code in c
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont wanna use asan absan and ur mom
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust just works
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw rust has MIR for unsafe

12:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> miri*
12:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ooops
12:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/miri
12:36 < bridge> <Learath2> Then just don't overflow bozo :yeecool:

12:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > You can use Miri to emulate programs on other targets, e.g. to ensure that byte-level data manipulation works correctly both on little-endian and big-endian systems. See cross-interpretation below.
12:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> interesting

12:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> webgpu name is a misnomer but yeah
12:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > WebGPU is a new API for the web, which exposes modern hardware capabilities and allows rendering and computation operations on a GPU, similar to Direct3D 12, Metal, and Vulkan. Unlike the WebGL family of APIs, WebGPU offers access to more advanced GPU features and provides first-class support for general computations on the GPU.

12:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 17,600 MT/s
12:43 < bridge> <Learath2> I think we are way past speeds relevant to the consumer. I bet these are great when you are running 500GB of ram on a caching proxy server at a datacenter
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> considering specs required for ai. We are just getting started. Tho maybe not so much system ram ^^
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I want personal ai ofc
12:45 < bridge> <Learath2> If local ai instances are going to become common place I think we'll be getting ai accelerators
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but ais will always require lot of ram and good speed
12:45 < bridge> <Learath2> Or at the very least some die space used for matrix extensions on even home cpu/gpus

12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As soon as we hit speed limits hardware wise the fastest os design wins
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh shit
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> psql15 dropped
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In first run this might be Linux. In long run probs smth completely new
13:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Isn’t psql15 old news?
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Are u using a rust news client or what
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryozuki uses javascript. It takes longer
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But yeah very old news lol
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah ye
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk i got it on my gentoo
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or forgot to upgrade
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/12cxpsb/rustcs_stablehasher_just_got_a_lot_faster/
13:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > What this means: faster incremental builds, since this is the component rustc uses to hash the incremental compilation data.
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I heard gccs unordered map is faster than rusts hashmap
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did that change now xd
13:49 < bridge> <deen> I started using that at work as a replacement for sanitizers in Rust. It seems a bit slower than sanitizers though, and has some limitations
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust uses a conservative hashmap
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hash *
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can change it
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u code in rust?
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i think its pretty in development, and is specially made for rust
13:50 < bridge> <deen> Mostly python, but some of our testing code is Rust
13:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
13:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why testing? xD
13:52 < bridge> <deen> My job is writing code that finds bugs, aka testing 😄
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ohhh
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> MIRI is like an abstract machine or smth
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > The implementation of the Rust abstract machine - miri - stops execution of Rust programs when they exhibit undefined behavior.
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > C, C++, etc. don't even have implementations of their abstract machines. They don't have one existing as a goal. And they are happy to make certain operations exhibit undefined behavior even if that implies that it would make an implementation of the abstract machine that traps impossible.
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > This is why even if you were to combine valgrind with address sanitizer, memory sanitizer, thread sanitizer, undefined-behavior-sanitizer, and other existing C and C++ tools, there is still a lot of classes of undefined behavior that these tools can't detect.
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > That's fine in C and C++, but not fine in Rust. In Rust, if we add a new type of undefined behavior, the constraint is that it should be (demonstrably) possible to extend miri to detect it, such that if a user doesn't know whether some program exhibits undefined behavior for some inputs, they can just run it under miri, and miri will precisely pinpoint which part of their code exhibited undefined behavior and why, and how their program execution 
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> can a sanitizer catch access to an invalid union field?
13:59 < bridge> <Voxel> i just entered chat and the first thing i thought was "the code can not unionize"
13:59 < bridge> <Simon'> is it possible to do custom commands instead of binding keys?
14:00 < bridge> <Voxel> define custom commands
14:01 < bridge> <Simon'> for example /command exec file.cfg
14:01 < bridge> <Simon'> no wait
14:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xDDD
14:01 < bridge> <Simon'> i want to do bind command exec file.cfg
14:02 < bridge> <Simon'> a whole word instead of just a key
14:03 < bridge> <Voxel> arent those just a long list of binds
14:03 < bridge> <Simon'> yes but im out of keys which i can press fast
14:03 < bridge> <Simon'> mouse only have 5 buttons
14:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> do multi binds, like one key you can press to cycle throw a list of binds which will then change the command for another key. U only need 2 keys for that. Use echo messages to tell yourself which "mode" is activated right now
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ctrl+k
14:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 1 key, x .cfg files, another key for the bind to be executed
14:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> e.g. `n` will change the command and an echo to tell urself which one is it currently, and `m` will execute it.
14:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yo @Ryozuki what do you work that you build compilers at work?
14:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> stuff
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im not sure about sharing more personal details about me xd
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just stalk his gh
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller tell us
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what do u work as
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He contributes to some stuff xd
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or is ur life just staying afk in ddnet
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller is millionaire chilling his life
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whenver i start ddnet ur there
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> afk
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and if i talk to u ur bot says ur afk
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
14:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> In how far does telling what u work leak ur personal information? I mean we all work as programmers, so much is clear
14:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok fair same here
14:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tell me the name of ur company, website, address, etc

14:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its me
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well if i worked at google i would say it
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I meant what field you work in and what your current project is that it involves such low level things
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think its that weird
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah my company likes to try new stuff
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> honestly im happy im paid to do this interesting stuff
14:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would be ashamed to work for google xd
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I want to join u
14:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Google > EA
14:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> jk it’s a flex. to work at evil corp

14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its insane
14:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the market
14:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> roblox is played by 15 year olds
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> much bigger player base
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fortnite is dying anyway

14:26 < bridge> <Simon'> the cfg file can be a normal text file right?
14:26 < bridge> <Simon'> do i store it in the appdata or in the folder with the ddnet exe?
14:28 < bridge> <Simon'> if i press key to exec the file it just says it failed to open the file
14:30 < bridge> <Dragere> it should be in appdata in the same folder as settings_ddnet.cfg
14:30 < bridge> <Simon'> yes it is
14:30 < bridge> <Simon'> does it have to be the same fily type?
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can u enable file type in your explorer
14:32 < bridge> <Simon'> yes i got windows
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then do it
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then copy the full name and exec the full name
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's enabled if u see settings_ddnet.cfg as one word

14:48 < bridge> <Simon'> now it works
16:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think i have to do the yearly thermal paste change
16:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> got some new fans too including cpu one

16:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gotta prepare for the summer heat in this world with climate change kek
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why yearly?
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u need to do this maybe all 5 years
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or is ur computer getting so hot lately?
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think i added too little last time
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my cpu is getting at 85C
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when compiling for a bit
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it shouldnt even get hot without paste
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (hotter than expected)
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats the expected for 5800x
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but my case fans are rly old
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like 4 or more years old
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and they are not PWM
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so i got pwm ones
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> less noise when nothing and more power when full
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> + the noctua fan for the cpu cooler
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that shit costs 36€ xd
16:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 2000rpm
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow my CPU is almost 4 years old already.. time passed so fast damn
16:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the thermal paste is rly important iirc
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i seen benchmarks where they used none, it was ok
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but ofc the paste will close the gaps
16:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > In general, changing thermal paste every one to two years is a good idea. However, we would not recommend relying solely on timeframes to monitor when you need to change your thermal paste.
16:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> random website
16:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me ask chatgpt our lord and savior
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet u never changed the thermal paste of your GPU in your life
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😉
16:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i did once
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for my old r9 390
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that shit was hot af
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 90C sometimes
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh gg
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> openening a gpu is really struggle xd

17:28 <+ChillerDragon> you call it accept_connection which in my head maps to CONNECTION_ACCEPT which was replaced by ACCEPT in 0.7
17:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d3fc0807d5f59d88661c8e58854805b064db3c4d
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think heinric is in a asian timezone
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is always wake late
17:30 <+ChillerDragon> so imo in tw.rs is should still say accept_connection but in tw7.rs it should say just accept
17:30 <+ChillerDragon> weeb5991
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki how u know? u saw his insta story? xd
17:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> by when he is online
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> sherlock

17:32 <+ChillerDragon> using metadata
17:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Friend of mine had a gpu that performed like horseshit out of the factory. It was overheating too, when I opened it up the thermal paste wasn't anywhere near the gpu die, like half the die was uncovered. So not a horrible idea to check if you get unexpected temps
18:21 < bridge> <Teero> thank god that i use a microwave oven 😮‍💨
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> python has the worst eco system of them all. Its even worse than c++. Change my mind.

19:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> whats your opinion on the node (npm) one?
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> its bad too but better from my expirience so far
19:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cargo build
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> also bad but much better
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> so far the only problem i have with cargo is its super big and slow git index you have to keep updated
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> but they are on it heinrich promised me
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a fix already
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not enabled by default yet but it will soon
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> ok then cargo the only eco sys i have no problems with yet
19:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```python
19:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> def foo():
19:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   return 8 * 8
19:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```@Learath2 leratooooooooooooo!!!
19:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> daily python trivia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!do you pay for for the 8 \* 8 multiplication at runtime?

19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> read
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> probs not
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> yes dis heinrich sent last timne i bitched about it xd
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> indeed ryo pro
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean its rly obvious
19:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and stupid if not optimized
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```python
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> import dis
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> def foo():
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ...   return 8 * 8
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ... 
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> foo()
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 64
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> dis.dis(foo)
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (64)
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon>               2 RETURN_VALUE
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> 
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> you can get python bytecode with python o.O
19:28 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf are these code words
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> wot?
19:29 < bridge> <Voxel> dis? foo?
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> foo is my function
19:29 < bridge> <Voxel> you can not say these with a straight face
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> dis is from python to get python bytecode
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```python
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> def foo():
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   a = 2
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   return a * a
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```@Ryozuki you reached level 2 of daily lerato.py trivia!
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> same question new code
19:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> same
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> and here your streak ends
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> python slow
19:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then python sucks
19:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```python
19:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> def foo():
19:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ...   a = 2
19:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ...   return a * a
19:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ... 
19:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> foo()
19:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 4
19:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> import dis
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> dis.dis(foo)
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>               2 STORE_FAST               0 (a)
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   3           4 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>               6 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>               8 BINARY_MULTIPLY
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>              10 RETURN_VALUE
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> >>> 
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
19:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so bad
19:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe this pyc code is not optimized
19:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well whathever this is
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> idc if there are optimization levels of python bytecode
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> idk*
19:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> https://stackoverflow.com/a/62656844 i fear there is no python way to tell the compiler to optimize
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like the best way to write python is to write rust ._.
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ofc
20:50 < bridge> <Chairn> also depends on DRAM vendor, some allow to zero out directly in place
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh didnt know
20:51 < bridge> <Chairn> but x86 has optimization to only mark null cache line instead of transferring them
20:55 < bridge> <Chairn> which ironically allows some nice data leak 😄
21:20 < bridge> <mezeskremes> hi is there any plan to port the game to consoles? didnt find anything about this just curious
21:23 < bridge> <gerdoe> money
21:47 < bridge> <mezeskremes> wha-
21:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Nope, honestly the game doesn't work very well with controllers to begin with
22:03 < bridge> <gerdoe> is it a thing? i remember cen94ok showed me his controller gameplay on 0.7 and everything seemed good to him
22:04 < bridge> <Learath2> You can play with a controller in ddnet right now too, I didn't enjoy it too much but maybe you'd
22:51 < bridge> <mezeskremes> The thing is i use ps4 pro with keyboard and mouse
22:52 < bridge> <mezeskremes> Dont have a setup to play tw with, so was wondering if it could work out or nah
22:53 < bridge> <mezeskremes> And i play tw since 2011 so it wont feel great not to be able to play
