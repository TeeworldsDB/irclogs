01:28 < bridge> <timakro> i want to start testing the beta of a new version of ddnet trashmap soon. could i maybe have a channel on this server to direct people to for feedback? @Discord Mod (i hope i didn't ping too many - can't figure out how to see who is part of a role on discord)
01:33 < bridge> <syrinok> Click members at the top of the list, you pinged murpi and heinrich

02:04 < bridge> <vseejd> :gigachad:
03:02 < bridge> <devinci24> if you only want feedback from everyone maybe a #town-hall post can suit your needs.
09:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Oke, I don't know how it has to be written but my way for checking types is just bunch of nested if statements xd https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/df8418c4835b856337d801bd98a3b2e31660a2e6/src/passes/type_checker.rs#L218-L284
09:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> does ur lang support type inference?
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i.e, if u do x == 2, does it infer the 2 type to be equal to x (if possible?)
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> if so, u should read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference
09:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye, it infer types for integer literals
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> type systems are the hard part of frontend compilers xd
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ` left.type_(scope)?`
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> why type_
09:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i have some kind of autism but i cant help seeing names like that xdd
09:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat my tip is to use rust powerful enums as much as possible
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ie u can declare a enum of builtin types with a variant of a id of a user type
09:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/df8418c4835b856337d801bd98a3b2e31660a2e6/src/types/types.rs#L11-L27
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> well a builtin type can be a struct with the given fields who are also types
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and those are what user types are made of
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> why is struct a string and not a vec of types ??
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> Vec<Self>
09:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's just a name for entry in a type table
09:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah i see
09:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> well u should use maybe a numeric id
09:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> more efficient
09:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> string requires heap alloc
09:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> or a Uuid, which is copy
09:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> (its a u128 iirc)
09:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my whole problem is that it doesn't work, optimization isn't the thing i care the most right now xdd
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah i see why u type type_
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust tip for you
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can use the keyword reserved type name
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> using
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> `r#type`
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> as the name
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Eq, Hash)]
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub struct TypeArray {
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub r#type: Box<Type>,
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub length: usize,
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho i recommend just "ty"
09:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> class :greenthing:
09:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> r#type looks ugly
09:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 😬
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye xd
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use ty
09:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rustc also uses ty
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its dope u can use keywords
09:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i like type_
09:52 < bridge> <ar1gin> have you guys seen the new `do yeet` keyword in rust? 😎
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a name to prevent bikeshedding xd
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sos developers idk how to do memory management. Im still stuck at using the sql code -.-
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/5a4d8e26e61e4b2f7990eec172572e233c7a60b3/src/game/server/score.cpp#L39-L42
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am trying to pass a type here that is not a string
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have a bunch of classes that all inherit from a base class and i would like to pass then to the sql worker thread
09:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can i have the ``CSqlPlayerRequest`` hold it on the stack and do a mem copy from a pointer or something like that? :D 
09:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i know how to do with if the ``CSqlPlayerRequest`` holds a pointer to the base class but that would then remove the RAII and i have to free the memory on all exit branches of the worker thread
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat for type inference, u basically have points in the code which gives you types for variables, these are usually in "let" statements (where u declare a variable, like `int x` or `let x: 2`, in function parameters and in function return types), from those points u can start infering
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> Usually this is done with a "unify" method
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> To briefly summarize the union-find algorithm, given the set of all types in a proof, it allows one to group them together into equivalence classes by means of a union procedure and to pick a representative for each such class using a find procedure. Emphasizing the word procedure in the sense of side effect, we're clearly leaving the realm of logic in order to prepare an effective algorithm. The representative of a u n i o n ( a , b ) {\displaysty
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> unify(ta, tb):
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     ta = find(ta)
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     tb = find(tb)
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     if both ta,tb are terms of the form D p1..pn with identical D,n then
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>         unify(ta[i], tb[i]) for each corresponding ith parameter
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     else
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     if at least one of ta,tb is a type variable then
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>         union(ta, tb)
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     else
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>         error 'types do not match'
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway u should either read a bit or just go by ur heart and do if elses
09:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i saw `unify` method in rustc :clueless:
10:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks, ill read about dis stuff
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok i think i got it
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least it doesnt crash and valgrind does not complain. But i feel dirty for using malloc and memcopy im sure i introduced some UB.
10:47 < bridge> <timakro> yes that works for me
10:47 < bridge> <timakro> i for got about discord forums :D
10:47 < bridge> <timakro> i forgot about discord forums :D
11:12 < bridge> <timakro> @Discord Mod no need to create a channel then

12:30 < bridge> <zakharkosh> Hello, I want to create a list server for my client that I am practicing, can anyone help me?
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a "list server" is a master server?
12:36 < bridge> <zakharkosh> mean server list
12:37 < bridge> <zakharkosh> How can I put my own servers in the section that is for the server list?
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not very easy if you don't know a lot about how computers work
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/LAN_Server#Setting_Up_Your_LAN_Server_for_Online_Play
12:40 < bridge> <zakharkosh> I don't mean server LAN
12:40 < bridge> <01000111g> open a thread in #town-hall
12:40 < bridge> <zakharkosh> I don't mean server LAN @jupeyy_keks
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You didn't even read the link
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Setting Up Your LAN Server for Online Play"
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you want to host a server on a VPS that is even harder
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You should read/watch some tutorials first
13:34 < bridge> <shedevroverhiz> hello all
14:18 < bridge> <zakharkosh> how can fix this error?
14:18 < bridge> <zakharkosh> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284488505300353116/Screenshot_2024-09-14_152746.png?ex=66e6d0a4&is=66e57f24&hm=3e211c154580a1e64701f64a57560f9fa7d1cb9529ac9d450950d2a77789cb16&
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what are you even compiling xd
14:19 < bridge> <zakharkosh> mastersrv
14:19 < bridge> <zakharkosh> HAHAHAHA
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if mastersrv was ever tested for windows
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> guess you have to use linux
14:20 < bridge> <zakharkosh> ok
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why do u even want a own mastersrv?
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not very easy to use that
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you want to register your server to the server list, follow the tutorials
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the mastersrv has nothing to do with that
14:28 < bridge> <zakharkosh> @jupeyy_kekswe have server in iran
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I thought ddnet persian is already hosting a master. Can't you register there? @zakharkosh 
14:42 < bridge> <zakharkosh> no is privet
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats annoying
14:42 < bridge> <zakharkosh> 😂
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so soon there will be two custom persian clients with two master servers? -.-
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you better make yours open then :p 
14:43 < bridge> <zakharkosh> damn no
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no?
14:43 < bridge> <zakharkosh> x
14:43 < bridge> <zakharkosh> d
14:43 < bridge> <zakharkosh> <ChillerDragon> so soon there will be two custom persian clients with two master servers? -.-
14:43 < bridge> <zakharkosh> no
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought you are working on that?
14:44 < bridge> <zakharkosh> Yes thats right
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So if you succeed you will create a master server and a custom client?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Then there will be two? Or what do you mean by "no" xd
14:45 < bridge> <zakharkosh> I have a separate client procedure, I do work
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?
14:46 < bridge> <Cellegen RiH> 🐴
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you have a linux server @zakharkosh ?
14:46 < bridge> <Cellegen RiH> martix gang
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> matrix sok :p 
14:47 < bridge> <zakharkosh> yes chiller
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice
14:48 < bridge> <zakharkosh> I ran into an error i compile mastersrv on windows and get this error  , you know what is this?
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont see images you send on discord
14:49 < bridge> <zakharkosh> error: reference to packed field unaligned
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i dont use windows and i recommend you to also just compile it on linux and ignore windows errors
14:49 < bridge> <zakharkosh> oo sure ok
14:50 < bridge> <zakharkosh> Chiller, what do you think about making a ski mod?
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but if i had to debug this i would probably play with versions. with the rust version and with the version of the dependency that throws the error
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zakharkosh i cant imagine how a ski mod looks like
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ski is about slopes there is no smooth slope prediction right now. Would have to be something cursed with speedups i guess.
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh but you make your own client so you could ship prediction yeah
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyways i was never into sports games so for me personally it doesnt sound like fun
14:53 < bridge> <zakharkosh> So what do you think about adding gambling to DDNetPP? 😂
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Edgy as I am ofc do I appreciate drugs, gambling and hookers
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there actually already is 
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zakharkosh `/StockMarket buy` to gamble in ddnet++
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its pvp based gambling i never really got hooked in pve based gambling
14:59 < bridge> <zakharkosh> No, don't let it go, young people will be miserable
15:34 < bridge> <dizyyy123> how to install plugins on the server
15:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @dizyyy123 the only thing that comes close to a plugin system is antibot modules but there arent any public ones available.
15:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @dizyyy123 what kind of plugin are you looking for?
15:39 < bridge> <dizyyy123> register, money, shop
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i recommend using a custom server for that
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lucky you these days you have 3 open source projects that implement exactly that
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> There is https://github.com/0xfaulty/ddnet-mode which is a huuuuge feature rich modification also known as 0xf it is actively maintained by russian developers checkout there public servers for a preview search "0xF"
15:51 < bridge> <dizyyy123> and how is it all done?
15:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then there is https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/ developed by the german potato fokkonaut. Known for its BlmapChill server. Has 128 support and also a strong set of features.
15:51 < bridge> <dizyyy123> how to do it on the server trashmap
15:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: when own :nobot: module?
15:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then there is https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP DDNet++ which was mostly developed by me with contributions from both the 0xF team and fokkonaut! Its barely maintained these days and has lots of bugs. But the shop is customizable so you can chose which entries you want in the shop.
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @dizyyy123 you can't put it on trash map its for maps not for servers you should buy a linux server and host it your self. Or you can rent a fully managed tw server from me for 1 euro a month.
15:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i thought about it. But i don't enjoy developing closed source software that produces bans too much both things i despise. Also I never really had problems with botters on my servers. I was playing with the idea of an open source module for the public but i think heinrich recommended me not to do it.
15:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye, i meant open source antibot xd
15:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was thinking about becoming the next cloudflare for teeworlds tho. That sounds more interesting to me. Some kind of reverse proxy flood protection human captcha in game shenanigan system.
15:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> another thing i wanted to do is build a antibot module just to explore the api and see how much can be done. And then spam prs to ddnet extending it to become a generic plugin api. It would be really cool if it had more hooks and would allow loading multiple modules.
15:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then we could send this dizyyy guy some shop.dll and he could just plug and play
15:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i love how in minecraft as a non technical server admin you can really build your own modification without knowing how to code by mix and matching a bunch of plugins
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess i should open a discussion issue for that. I just remembered how much i wanted it 
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> The free speech absolutist probably also supports the rights of botters
16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> spinbotters and chat botters for sure i was always protecting them
16:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unfair advantage in game such as aimbot is not nice! i still prefer kick, jail, freeze or stuff like that over a mute/ban at all times.
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the fact that you say that spinbotting is not an unfair advantage only bcs you like it, is already concerning
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it defs creates confusion and makes the opponent harder to read
16:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not an unfair advantage the onlything sus about it is that it can be used to mask aimbots
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> It's fair if everyone bots :think_bot:
16:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have low respekt for spinbotters since i take pride in manual spinning but i dont think they should be banned
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if everyone would be allowed to, teero & tater would win :lol:
16:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 oh yea that too! bot vs bot i enjoy minecraft anarchy servers where everyone runs around with a hack client
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Libertarian moment
16:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not sure how fun a anarchy server in tw would be that embraces hacking i guess depends on the gametype
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it would be fun until you notice you actually like the game
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then you cry
16:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think all the pvp gametypes like CTF/zCatch and so on would get boring quite quickly
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but new players would join and try it out too
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet most csgo hackers alrady stopped bcs lost fun
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but then new players arrive
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with the same goal
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe i dont care about hacks in minecraft that much because i never got good in the game but in tw there is something so nice about learning the skill on how to play and seeing others being good that i feel like it would be sad if its full of botting
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I also don't like the current TAS hype at all. It devalues the highlight clips made by actual humans.
16:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> classic `x:μ⇒e∼μ′λx.e∼μ→μ′.`

16:17 < bridge> <learath2> Classic issue that we cant say yes to directly :pepeW:
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well thats why its a issue not a pr
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to discuss it 
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also why not say yes -.-
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> In principle we'll probably say yes to plugins. Then we'll end up agreeing on an architecture that you don't like
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the architecture is already there or what do you think is something i won't like?
16:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is basically me asking if i can send a pr that allows loading more than one antibot module at a time and then we go from there
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you can load one, you can also load many
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no need to upstream it
16:29 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing you like the current way we hook the antibot in. I would want a unified wasm plugin system
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess he just wants multiple .so files
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or not
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ so the one loads the others? sure i havent thought about that yea sounds good to me
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and he can do so now, by having one "master" so file that loads the others
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ye

16:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 I like the current way. But what i like about it the most is that it is there already and it works. I don't feel comfortable implementing WASM but if you do i would mind using it i guess.
16:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wouldn't
16:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> wdym implementing wasm - it's called dd-pg and its great :o
16:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dd-pg has no 0.7 support
16:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> (this is non related, i have no idea what you guys were talking about and i'll see myself out)
16:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> why would you think that - it's obviously planned with you as the main contributor!

16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ofc
16:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> neat
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in theory you could compile a virtual machine to wasm
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and literally start windows -> roblox
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
16:47 < bridge> <zhn> its still closed source chiller :troll:
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly why everytime you make one of these issues I cry
16:52 < bridge> <zhn> thank you god jupeyy for no 0.7 support :justatest:
17:18 < bridge> <destroyed230> Oh yeah, i can't play on their servers from a client i built from source
17:20 < bridge> <zhn> i do play with self build client there though
17:20 < bridge> <zhn> self built*
17:22 < bridge> <destroyed230> I don't know, the loading screen just stops at "Loading map file from storage". I also tried to join from a client i download from the site and then join from a self built one right after that and it magically worked
17:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is your self compiled client based on latest ddnet?
17:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can join there with chillerbot-ux just fine
17:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But yea i also sometimes get stuck connecting to specific servers. I usually fix it by connecting to another server and then the client gets in a good state somehow :D 
17:27 < bridge> <destroyed230> yep, 18.5
17:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0XF in particular has some special map sending stuff to filter out bots
17:29 < bridge> <destroyed230> i still don't get why the official client from the site works but my self built one doesn't
17:29 < bridge> <furo> That was a bug with master, should be fixed now though.
17:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chiller gives you ideas to code and you like em :feelsbadman:
17:30 < bridge> <destroyed230> nope, i still can't play on their server
17:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send repo of your custom client
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git fetch --all
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git rebase upstream/master
17:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafk rebase?
17:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that requires force push jopsit
17:32 < bridge> <zhn> afair 18.5 bug related to map loading wasn't fixed
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> robyt3 can disprove it ig
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> or prove
17:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ladies and gentlemen, how do you checkout pr's code
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> did u update to current master?
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i usually add the contributors remote and then do a regular checkout
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but there is also some /pulls things which works for github
17:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ive made alias for dat
17:34 < bridge> <destroyed230> no
17:34 < bridge> <zhn> thats the problem
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git fetch upstream pull/5085/head:branch
17:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `pr = !"f() { git fetch origin pull/$1/head:pr_$1 && git checkout pr_$1; }; f"`
17:34 < bridge> <zhn> do what jupeyy sent to ur message
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 5085 would be pr 5085
17:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and you can type `git pr 5085` xd
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not sure but i vaguely remember it being a bit different on gitlab
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> `git pull origin pull/999/head`
17:47 < bridge> <learath2> `git fetch origin pull/999/head`
17:53 < bridge> <destroyed230> alright. i did that and it solved the problem
17:55 < bridge> <destroyed230> idk, i didn't get what you meant or something, i feel stupid
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> he just stated that bug was fixed on latest
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> and u just got updated so ur on latest now
21:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @robyt3 is this a "bullet smoke trail effect" from #8537?
21:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284590161325457540/image.png?ex=66e72f50&is=66e5ddd0&hm=682d05b05066511b1348b09ced2922084fa9583c0a05be0b27c47af389bf5eec&
21:02 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8537
21:03 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the gun bullet trail effect
21:04 < bridge> <supportbro> How to fix it
21:04 < bridge> <supportbro> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284590554797052044/image.png?ex=66e72fae&is=66e5de2e&hm=d67d8b4b59d59c87bcfcfecc0c11cbaefd29b10388e89cd9b16e01d9bf536ad1&
21:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it doesn't disappear for me :thonk:
21:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Try rendering on slow speed
21:05 < bridge> <supportbro> чаво
21:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe it's related to some uninitialized memory though so might not happen on every system
21:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Use less custom skins and assets, update your graphics cards driver, restart PC
21:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I rendered it in 0.5 speed and then played it, and it works
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I can still reproduce it. Record bullets trails at 0.1 speed, then after rendering is done, quickly play back the same demo again
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I can still reproduce it. Render bullets trails at 0.1 speed, then after rendering is done, quickly play back the same demo again
21:08 < bridge> <supportbro> OK, thank you
21:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I dunno, I play that play demo button faster than professional Super Smash Bros players and it doesn't work, can you send your demo pls?
21:15 < bridge> <robyt3> I just shoot once. Start rendering with 0.1 speed, wait until done, then start playback again
21:15 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284593459105370142/test_bullettrail.demo?ex=66e73263&is=66e5e0e3&hm=16c2105b4436907336e30d0e2a7ec617bbc73e7ddd8eecef8cbc65972e6ea42a&
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I... can't reproduce 😦
21:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, might be Windows or compiler specific then
21:27 < bridge> <Ewan> any time you see this screen the problem is always stated in the second paragraph
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like whenever u start the game with a controller plugged in and have joystick inputs, mouse movement is treated as joystick input even when no controller is connected
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284607931257589931/2024-09-14_14-10-04.mp4?ex=66e73fdd&is=66e5ee5d&hm=e96c03cd9068c9f913502d7fd92410ad03388fbf71ffec3aa2f72b04649d33a0&
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> actually i just reopened the game and it's still doing it even with no controllers ever having been detected
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284608326872731728/image.png?ex=66e7403b&is=66e5eebb&hm=6177dedd5d19a2ba17486446780c43ce99533ca46651f247bb530f8e3d4fd396&
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> 🐪
22:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> :greenthing:  that's why steam displays ddnet with no controller support :kekw:
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the steam release
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess it doesn't happen on the ddnet 18.3 pkg
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> steam weirdness or xwayland weirdness (nixpkgs ver using native wayland)
