14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Uhm any suggestions on how to proceed when i need a slightly modification in curl for my tw mod :/ ?
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I thought about putting whole curl in src/engine/external/curl and then mofiy it but it seems like a bloated approach
14:54 <+Learath2> Don't modify curl?
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can i overwrite just a specific function
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
14:54 <+Learath2> It's a pretty well built and flexible library, I'm sure there is a way to do what you want to do
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ...
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk how
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its probably faster to edit it than understand how to flex it
14:55 <+Learath2> Just google it?
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what?
14:55 <+Learath2> Or tell me what you want to do and I'll google it for you, since you seem incapable of reading documentation of any kind
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/escape.c#L59
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to remove . and ~ here
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so i can escape strings and use them as filenames
14:56 <+Learath2> Easy, wrap the function yourself
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
14:58 <+Learath2> Create a new function, chillerdragon_escape, then remove . and ~
14:58 <+Learath2> then call curl_escape
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that was my first attempt
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it did not find all the curl helper methods
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>

14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess i can only include those
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and escape.c needs those
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/650697560624726049/unknown.png
14:59 <+Learath2> wat?
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm i want to change the curl_easy_escape method
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which calls stuff like Curl_saferealloc
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and idk how to include the files which hold Curl_saferealloc etc
15:01 <+Learath2> to be absolutely honest with you, I can't even begin to understand tf you are trying to do
15:01 <+Learath2> You want a version of curl_easy_escape that doesn't escape tilde and .?
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it should escape tilde and dot
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> default doesnt
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because those are ascii and thus valid in url or something idk why they are not escaped
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i want to escape tw usernames and then use it as filenames
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so . and ~ are problematic
15:02 <+Learath2> Okay, you create a new function, that either first calls curl_easy_escape, then escape the ~ and . by hand. Or you do it the other way around
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont want to remove them
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to escape them
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i dont want to write crazy string manipulation code that resizes a string
15:03 <+Learath2> So let me get this straight, you want to resize a string without resizing a string?
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want '.' to become "%2E" which is longer :/
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah i want curl to handle rezising
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cuz i trust curl devs
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but not my code
15:04 <+Learath2> It's not rocket science....
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is
15:04 <+Learath2> Each character can at most become 3 characters, you allocate a string 3 times the size, do your replacing, then call curl easy escape on it
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is easier to remove those two chars from the switch case for sure
15:04 <+Learath2> You don't get to modify other libraries
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
15:05 <+Learath2> Especially safety critical libraries...
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i rather edit safety critical libs than writing safety code my self
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> big brain
15:06 <+Learath2> Escaping a character is pretty hard to get wrong, especially the way I mentioned with generously allocating memory
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never allocated memory :/
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i did one time it was a mess xd
15:07 <+Learath2> Why are you all programming without learning to program is beyond me :P
15:08 <+Learath2> You know it's much easier to use a language after you learn it right? :D
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not about programming
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont like programming :/
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want fng stats ðŸ˜„
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i feel like a 12yo rn
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u program if u dont like to program
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¡
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > i want fng stats ðŸ˜„
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its just a tool to satisfy my tw cravings
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i also get hangovers and i dont like em
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym fng stats
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> saving stats about kills etc to file
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use sqlite
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wanted to try files ðŸ™‚
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sql was a mess in ddnet++
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u did it a mess
15:49 <+Learath2> files and file parsing is usually much more of a mess
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just have to edit libcurl then all should be fine xd
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that sounds horrible
15:51 <+Learath2> or just write like 10 lines of code that does the very simple string manipulation you want
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im tryin rn
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont feel like its goign well
15:54 <+Learath2> If you don't feel comfortable about doing it yourself, maybe just steal someone elses str_replace?
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im tryn rn
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont feel like its goign well
15:56 <+Learath2> you are having trouble copy pasting someone elses code?
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u dont?
15:56 <+Learath2> You are a very interesting person
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im close to add curl as a submodule xd
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well my abused fork*
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> don't modify curl! don't even think about it!
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u all rude
15:58 <+Learath2> not like you can figure out how to get cmake or bam to link it
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ez
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
15:59 <+Learath2> tbh, sometimes I feel you are just doing all this weird stuff to be quirky :D
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can understand that
16:00 <+Learath2> Who thinks of modifying an external library just to avoid 10 lines of code
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but trust me, no
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i person who is rly struggeling with the 10lines
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> compiling and linking it will definitely be way harder ðŸ˜„
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well probably
16:03 <+Learath2> Oh I know the chillerdragonest way to handle this
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> why do you need curl for handling stats at all?
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye it doesnt make sense
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought its easiest :/
16:04 <+Learath2> Just do sed s/./%2E/g
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this is ma boi
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> system();
16:05 <+Learath2> Well not that easy, you also need to pipe the output
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why i say we should rewrite tw in bash
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bash is easy af
16:05 <+Learath2> popen handles that if you don't mind POSIX
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> noobs like me can write whole webservers and frameworks in bash in a few days
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> for what? the only stats things this might be useful is some rest api you want to use ðŸ˜„
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> for what? the only stats things that might be useful is some rest api you want to use ðŸ˜„
16:06 <+Learath2> Now a rest api, I was actually working on
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just pipe it to file and read file in c
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i use curl to escape characters @redix
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nothing else
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> O.o
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but now i endeded up escaping them my self
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cuz learath bullied me
16:06 <+Learath2> I got bored of writing my own http server, but I didn't want to link in an entire server
16:07 <+Learath2> @redix he literally patched libcurl to escape ~ and . instead of just calling curls escape then escaping the ~ and . himself...
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> great ^^
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i should do a pr on libcurl
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there lib is obv broken
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> their

22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> at least not translatable on the Hungarian translation
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> For better translation update to 0.7 even game messages like join and leave are translated there
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but im not going to product translation to 0.7 vanilla :troll: ddnet is better
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also these are the only ones that i must translate
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so i could post the latest version
