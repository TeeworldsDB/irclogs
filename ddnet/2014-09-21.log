12:29 < Savander> Hello
12:30 < EastByte> hi

12:35 <@deen> hi
12:40 < EastByte> looks like we are complete?
12:48 < Savander> :D
12:59 <@deen> hi Welf
12:59 < Welf> hey 
13:03 < laxa> Welf: hi <3
13:04 < EastByte> hi Welf 
13:05 < laxa> Welf: if you intend to come on IRC regurlarly, you should install a proper client like mIRC, or find a remote shell to use irssi :p
13:24 < EastByte> my twstat daemon often receives packets with invalid source address
13:25 < EastByte> I wonder how this can happen
13:25 < EastByte> like some servers responding with a different ip
13:25 <@deen> EastByte: weird
13:26 <@deen> maybe the packet gets corrupted
13:26 <@deen> or someone is trying weird stuff with fake ip addresses
13:26 < EastByte> ^ I think so
13:28 < EastByte> hm should be easy to analyse what triggers those packets
13:28 < EastByte> will try that if I have time :)
13:28 <@deen> yeah, half the requests until you find the culprit
13:33 < EastByte> deen: using nim bigbreak I can't even compile a test because of lib errors
13:33 <@deen> yeah, pretty disheartening
13:33 <@deen> also they wanted to release 2 weeks ago but didn't...
13:33 < EastByte> meh
13:38 < laxa> deen: what can we do against fucking kid ? They are so annoying.
13:38 <@deen> ?
13:38 < laxa> I play a map with 2 players with me
13:38 < laxa> the guy block us then leave...
13:38 < laxa> zzz

13:38 < EastByte> team?
13:38 < laxa> in team 0
13:38 < laxa> we play for 30 minutes together
13:38 < laxa> then he decide to block us and leave
13:39 < EastByte> ah
13:39 <@deen> and what do you want me to do?
13:39 < laxa> well, nothing lol
13:39 < laxa> if I flood server with "kill" when kill protections is enabled
13:39 < laxa> is server protected ?
13:40 < laxa> I am just saying this is fucking annoying...
13:40 <@deen> protected from what?
13:40 < laxa> from flood
13:40 <@deen> protected from what happening?
13:40 < laxa> well, I'll try something
13:41 < EastByte> that's like flooding /pause I guess
13:42 < laxa> deen: I was able to spam kill without being dropped or kicked.
13:42 < laxa> not sure if you can crash server doing that
13:42 < laxa> or ddos it
13:46 <@deen> you can ddos any tw server much easier
13:52 < Savander> xDD
14:08 < Savander> question, where i can found spawn event?
14:08 <@deen> ?
14:08 < Savander> You know, when you die
14:08 < Savander> and the respawn
14:08 < Savander> where is this "respawn" xD
14:09 <@deen> character.cpp Spawn?
14:09 <@deen> or player.cpp TryRespawn
14:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Laxa opened pull request #43: Added cl_reset_wanted_weapon_on_death (DDRace64...upstream) http://git.io/i5D6eA
14:14 <@deen> huh, i thought i added that already?
14:14 <@deen> why do we need an option?
14:14 < laxa> better to have an option
14:14 < laxa> so people can choose
14:15 < laxa> if you play vanilla, you might wanna change this 
14:15 < EastByte> vanilla in ddnet branch?
14:15 < EastByte> or do you mean ddrace vanilla
14:16 < EastByte> !help
14:17 <@deen> many play other mods with ddnet client
14:17 < laxa> I mean, if you play vanilla with ddnet client, you might wanna change this option
14:17 < laxa> I think it's always better to have a choice than not
14:17 < EastByte> ah it's client side
14:17 <@deen> laxa: add an option in the menu as well?
14:18 < laxa> hu
14:18 < EastByte> !ping
14:18 < Nimda> Pong!
14:18 < EastByte> hm
14:18 < laxa> it's a little thing, not sure we need to add a context option
14:18 <@deen> noone finds these f1 options
14:19 < EastByte> ah I know what api cmd twstat needs
14:20 < EastByte> find all servers of ip
14:33 < EastByte> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/servernamesof/185.37.147.11

14:34 < EastByte> ["[EVIL] Clanserver 2","ChillerDragons Public Block Server [Chilli.*]"]
14:36 <@deen> nice
14:37 < EastByte> seems to be a free vps on http://haphost.com/
14:37 <@deen> free vps?
14:37 < EastByte> haphost offers free vps, they say
14:37 <@deen> can't quite believe that
14:38 < EastByte> I read their forum a little bit
14:38 < EastByte> I think it's true
14:38 < EastByte> but the rules are strict and I don't wanna know what they are doing with your data
14:48 < laxa> deen: added a button, it's in the pull request
14:53 < EastByte> " Your VPS Service request is submited. Please wait for admin confirmation."
14:53 < EastByte> will take some days I guess
14:55 < laxa> I guess you don't have root access
14:55 <@deen> that looks like the wrong location, laxa
14:55 < laxa> hum ? :D
14:56 <@deen> i would say in General -> Game, close to "Switch weapon on pickup"
14:56 < EastByte> laxa: nonroot wouldn't make sense reading their plan
15:04 < laxa> deen: should be good now :)
15:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #43: Added cl_reset_wanted_weapon_on_death (DDRace64...upstream) http://git.io/i5D6eA
15:06 <@deen> no, that doesn't look fine, laxa
15:06 <@deen> maybe test your commits before making them
15:08 < EastByte> ^ said deen

15:12  * EastByte is now coding a C preprocessor
15:12 < Savander> Yay
15:12 < Savander> respawn protectiona dded...
15:12 < Savander> to zcatch mm 
17:27 < EastByte> btw. how do I walljump?
17:28 < EastByte> some secret technique?
17:28 < EastByte> right to wall, jump, back left, right, jump seems to work
17:29 < EastByte> but sometimes not
17:33 < EastByte> is there a delay?
17:34 < EastByte> are it does only work with dj
17:36 < EastByte> but how do I know whether I just double jumped or wall jumped
17:37 < Savander> your feets
17:37 < Savander> when you don't have jump
17:37 < Savander> are darker
17:37 < EastByte> no they are always dark
17:37 < Savander> if you have jump have normal color 
17:38 < EastByte> while walljumping my feets are dark
17:38 < Savander> noo
17:38 < Savander> look at me
17:38 < Savander> and look at my feets
17:38 < Savander> okay?
17:39 < EastByte> but they are dark when leaving the wall
17:39 < Savander> noo
17:39 < EastByte> yeees
17:39 < Savander> when you don't have
17:39 < Savander> jump
17:39 < Savander> I KNOW WHAT I SAID
17:39 < Savander> it's in code
17:39 <@deen> "walljump" just gives you double jump
17:40 <@deen> you have to push against the wall while falling down
17:40 < EastByte> okay I got it
17:41 < EastByte> you also have to leave th wall first
17:42 < Savander> ye
17:42 <@deen> yes
17:42 <@deen> otherwise it would be boring
17:42 < EastByte> my keyboard sucks for stuff like that
17:42 <@deen> someone else implemented walljump in some mod,but it was boring
17:42 < Savander> it works
17:42 < Savander> like in transformice
17:42 < Savander> :P
17:43 <@deen> i know :P
17:43 <@deen> that was my reference
17:43 < Savander> :D
17:44 < EastByte> I think I will buy a keyboard with flat keys for tw
17:44 <@deen> Ah, you have one with the big keys?
17:44 < EastByte> takes too long to press these mechanicale keys down
17:44 < EastByte> mechanical*
17:44 <@deen> right
17:45 <@deen> there are some mechanical gamer keyboards but no idea if they're any good
17:45 < EastByte> and I still have the problem that sometimes keys aren't pressed
17:46 <@deen> I'd like one without numpad but they're always so expensive
17:46 <@deen> something like this: http://geizhals.de/corsair-vengeance-k65-compact-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-ch-9000040-de-a968281.html

17:46 < EastByte> this is mine
17:46 <@deen> ah, nice
17:47 < EastByte> but I think mine is fak
17:47 <@deen> looks like the happy hacking ones
17:47 < EastByte> e
17:47 < EastByte> ya
17:47 <@deen> except that happy hacking are crazy expensive
17:47 <@deen> over 250 € iirc
18:27 < Maple> yo
18:27 < Maple> getting ready for tournament ~
18:30 < EastByte> hello Maple 
18:31 < EastByte> we still have time :)
18:31 < laxa> !twp Maple
18:31 < Nimda> Maple is currently playing The Beginning on server : DDNet GER - Moderate [DDraceNetwork].
18:33 < laxa> Savander: your chat protection on zcatch is fucking gay.
18:34 < Savander> chat protection?
18:34 < laxa> well, maybe it's respawn protection
18:34 < laxa> but it's gay
18:35 < Maple> !twp laxa
18:35 < Nimda> laxa is currently playing ctf5 on server : DDForce.net: zCatch Grenade Pro.
18:35 < Maple> thats nice
18:35 < laxa> any idea for a new plugin for the bot Maple ?
18:35 < laxa> Savander: your server lag
18:38 < Maple> hm
18:38 < Maple> maybe whispering to someone in game without having to be there
18:38 < laxa> it's possible
18:38 < laxa> but I don't have the skill for it
18:38 < laxa> or maybe not
18:38 < Maple> hm
18:38 < Savander> and
18:38 < Savander> sometimes lag
18:39 < Savander> maybe
18:39 < Savander> but always when i played 
18:39 < Savander> i never had lags
18:39 < Savander> so..
18:39 < Savander> and why is gay?
18:39 < Savander> nobody can't kill you
18:39 <@deen> maybe the routing is just bad for some locations
18:39 < Savander> and you can't kill anybody
18:39 <@deen> on DDNet FRA some people also lag
18:39 < Savander> for 1-2 second
18:39 < Savander> for 1-2 seconds
18:39 < laxa> server clearly lagged for everyone
18:40 < Savander> maybe some problems from my isp
18:40 < Savander> i don't know
18:41 < Savander> Everybody have stable ping
18:42 < Maple> oh i get it
18:42 < Maple> Nimda is admin backwards
18:42 < Maple> :)
18:46 < laxa> Savander: server crashed, or I don't know
18:46 < Savander> hmm
18:49 < laxa> server crashed
18:49 < Savander> when
18:50 < Savander> [541f0166][game]: kill killer='2:laxa' victim='2:laxa' weapon=-3 special=0 [541f0166][chat]: *** 'laxa' has left the game [541f0166][game]: leave player='2:laxa'
18:50 < Savander> not a crash?
18:50 < laxa> before that
18:50 < laxa> fels was voted
18:50 < laxa> when he was kicked, server crashed
18:50 < Savander> weird :o
18:51 < laxa> maybe change hexa time into normal time
18:51 < Savander> can you join to me?
18:53 < Savander> wtf
