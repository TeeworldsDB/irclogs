11:16 <+ChillerDragon> LiveOverflow tweeted that the guy made 100k in 15mins and twitter would pay 7k bugbounty for a account takeover vuln :D
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 where do u find all these articles u post here commentless?
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs from here https://news.ycombinator.com/
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea that thing
11:20 <+ChillerDragon> do you guys visit that site manually?
11:20 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt find a flow to not forget about hackernews after 5mins browsing it :D
14:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that particular one was from the comments from this unanswered question on re.se: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25451/how-can-i-practically-approach-vm-obfuscated-code-with-symbolic-analysis-executi
14:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the other links are interesting as well
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 that VTIL looks like a great idea, hope it pans out
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should try to write our own unpacker one day ðŸ˜‰
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe one that doesn't try to hide much
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean packer?
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, unpacker
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> take some random packer, don't look at its source code and try to produce an unpacker from that
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, just as an exercise?
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could be fun
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.security-camp.or.jp/event/gcc_tokyo_program.html
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know how one finds stuff like the "global cybersecurity camp" before they happen? ^^
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like this hasnt happened yet
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh what? I think it happened in february 2020
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> What year are you living in @Learath2 ? ðŸ˜„
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 for recurring conferences you can search in Microsoft Academic and it will tell you the top conferences.
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hadn't seen a year, assumed it's next year
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> A cybersecurity camp in tokyo would be so cute
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ok volvicc
18:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @deen what bind for autoconnect to server when i priss a key (   bind [Key] connect [IP] dont work
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @deen what bind for autoconnect to server when i press a key (   bind [Key] connect [IP] dont work    )
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Volvicc> ok Nouaa
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Nouaa only the F keys work in menu, so try `bind f6 connect ger.ddnet.tw`
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but this is dangerous when you're already connected to another server
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no ddnet server
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i can't with ip?
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes you can
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm ok
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> instead of `ger.ddnet.tw` write your ip
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no joke??!!
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> xd
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ty bro
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> an alternative that I would prefer is to make shortcuts
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hu yes
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and in your shortcut you can do `DDNet "ger.ddnet.tw"`
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and in your shortcut you can do `DDNet "connect ger.ddnet.tw"`
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and then you can have a shortcut for each of your favorite servers on your desktop or wherever
