01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tech Guy> can i advertise a server? i need friends
06:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Tech Guy I think it was fine in #off-topic
09:24 <+ChillerDragon> i want to see ads @Tech Guy :)
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tried out D today: https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day11a.d
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> deen tried some D
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks nice
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you write D before?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't like how awkward it is to deep copy a multi-dimensional array
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yeah
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```d
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> foreach (y; 0 .. ns.length) s[y] = ns[y].dup;
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same problem exists for py btw, if you don't reach for copy.deepcopy :/
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but I couldn't find deepcopy for D
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't find any either üòÆ
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> searching for d seems to be hard ^^
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so many unrelated results
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> search for "dlang"
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that works in google
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> @ReiTW u here?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> WAT

18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> also fix bombay server it does not allow the name length ChillerDragon :/ and also my password does not fit in max pw len
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noob using same pw on every server
18:59 <+ChillerDragon> no i dont
18:59 <+ChillerDragon> i just use longer pws than they allow
19:00 <+ChillerDragon> usually
19:00 <+ChillerDragon> i just realized my fddr pw is sok lemme fix that
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> maybe we want a bigger buffer here since sha map sums https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1607710491.png
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> wait or is the file ending .gho and not .ghost?
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm its .gho
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> i thought its chopped of
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> i assume who decided on gho vs ghost also uses index.htm :D
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, old fat only supported 3 char file endings
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and 8 char names
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Christmas tourny

19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen this table makes the web look bad on mobole
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mobile
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz it puts whole page at that with
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe set some overflow horizontal
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or auto
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Width*
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki can you fix it with css? I tried once and failed
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I can, when i get home
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ChillerDragon sry I don't talk to noobs so i'll contact u directly
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :kek:
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen fixed
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ‚ù§Ô∏è
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> css pro
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> im sure using negative margin @Ryozuki u hacker
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> hm overflow auto
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> i liked ur pr cuz im fan
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> u weekly star some random rust libs
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> i see it all
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz im making my own full stack rust web
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> i check my github feed more often than a instragram addict
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill make a project template starter
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then ill make some websites
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> wew
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> i also started my web framework
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i found out the mustache template lib is from 2018
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> written in bash ofc
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so im gonna write it myself
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mustache.github.io/
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> pro
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm sure there are too few web frameworks üòÖ
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (which is definitely the reason you started it ^^)
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 in rust there isnt any web framework that makes it easy like django
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah ok
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can definitly automate 70% of web development
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> oh ryo building next django
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> invest now!
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wel it will be a rly opinionated framework
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that suits my needs
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> im sure it will be most used framework 2025
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> look at how all the good stuff started
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> all smol
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> java was even a temporary language :D
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how they started
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> rust was a mem
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always want to use GPL license cuz i like to enforce freedom to the face of ppl
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im not sure
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> its no freedom if GPL forces you to rls code
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since in rust most is statically linked
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> force != freedom
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its not forcing, it ensures your freedom
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since it propagates
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> it is not giving freedom to the devs using it
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "enforcing freedom" itself is an oxymoron
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that the word?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> makes licensing combination trouble
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> haha oxymoron
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> memorys to school start to fade
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> i think its correct
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye it is
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> u so smart
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> pepe_straight
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> :pepe_queer:
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it means straight as in looking at u straight
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> thats homophobic
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich ban him
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> :D
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be cool to figure out how deen writes these news, i think its markdown, if i can know i may be able to wrap dates in a span and with a little js u can show the date using ur local timezone
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since now we are so international
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> wait wat
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> and where is the js run?
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> in my client?
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> or web news i guess
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> i think we should enforce CET to demonstrate german dominace in tw community
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> GPL tries to ensure freedom of users, non-GPL usually ensures freedom of developers
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like the GPL model better
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> open source is a term made by companies
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh? no
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it allows them to use software without giving back
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by the open source foundation AFAIK
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is not the FSF and they dont care about freedoms
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > The term "open source", as used to describe software, was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.[3]
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> according to wikipedia
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
20:32 <+ChillerDragon> well users can simply not use closed src software :p @heinrich5991
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. This is why we do not agree with open source, and do not use that term.
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what u think about using GPL in rust which is basically statically linked
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a power difference between users and developers
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw a big discussion in reddit
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> hm
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> in which direction=
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> u think devs are stronger than the opinions of their users?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he says devs and users can have different freedoms
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or rights?
20:34 <+ChillerDragon> "power difference"
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would say rights
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a open source license ensures the devs rights, but may not ensure the user freedom
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. producers of goods have more power than the end consumer, so there's consumer protection agencies
20:35 <+ChillerDragon> but isnt the consumer shaping the request and thus decinding what is produced?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, explain why we have consumer protection agencies üòâ
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787039851186749470/unknown.png
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks fixed
20:35 <+ChillerDragon> if society would care and dislike closed src there would be an disatvangae for producers to stay closed
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should be fixed everywhere too
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> open source seems trendy to me
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if society would care and dislike broken products, we wouldn't need consumer protection laws that allow us to get 2 years guarantee on every electronic item
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of companies try now to go into open source
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it doesn't work that way
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> society doesn't like broken products. but that alone doesn't seem to suffice for some reason
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'm not even talking about software yet)
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> hm
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 well in fairness u may not be able to ensure something doesnt get broken
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> f society then :D
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> add Discord Rich Presence to the client. something like this
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787040347213135872/rpc.png
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> so we need a software protection law heinrich? :)
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not software as is
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> digital protection
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.eff.org/
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hav u seen they caught a american exposing real covid data
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is in prison iirc
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, we need consumer protection for the internet world as well
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the eu continued in a good way with the gdpr
20:39 <+ChillerDragon> do we have that in ger?
20:39 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, we do have consumer protection laws in germany
20:39 <+ChillerDragon> the only thing the gdpr gave me was annoying cookie banners
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just companies trying (and failing) to comply in bad faith
20:40 <+ChillerDragon> gdpr is not more open source
20:40 <+ChillerDragon> i think open source is not only good for the user but also for society in general to share our knowledge
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gdpr has nothing to do with open source
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its about data protection
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> ye
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> but heinrich said gpl good because it protecc users
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> well idk
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> i still use gmail and iphone so yee
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> so hard to life the open source lyfe
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k94eff/florida_police_raid_covid_data_whistleblowers/
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/k8suwj/florida_state_police_raid_home_of_covid/
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one is bigger
20:44 <+ChillerDragon> wat is it
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Florida State Police Raid Home Of COVID Whistleblower, Point Guns At Her & Her Family, Seize All Her Computer Equipment
20:44 <+ChillerDragon> ye
20:44 <+ChillerDragon> but what was blown
20:44 <+ChillerDragon> what can u whistle blow about a virus? :D
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a covid database
20:44 <+ChillerDragon> oh
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  Earlier this year, we wrote about Rebekah Jones, the data scientist working for Florida, who put together that state's COVID-19 database (that had received widespread praise), and who was fired by the state for her failure to fake the data to make it look like Florida was handling the pandemic better than it actually was. Governor Ron DeSantis had made it clear he wanted data showing good results in order to justify reopening the state.
20:44 <+ChillerDragon> why wasnt it public in the first place?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Since then, Jones has been running Florida COVID Action, which is a dashboard of Florida COVID information, like the one she used to run for the state.
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> like with names and shit?
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> oh
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> feke news
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it isnt public because it shows the failure of the state
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> obviously
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> i see
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> whistleblwoing in the US is always such an inconvience
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> but its also not nice to point out ppls mistake :D
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > "Once they are no longer associated with ESF8 they are no longer authorized to access the multi-user group," the FDLE affidavit said. All authorized users use the same user name and password."
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> LMAO
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this was their security
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> its as secure as a tw server
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> also only 1 admin pw
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> when pr usernames to vanilla ryo?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont pr to vanilla anymore

20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they still havent decided o nthis

20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how fast tw is
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> the sounds?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y

20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> its just too complex
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> :D
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> ok enough troll
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> gn8 bois
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GDPR is a step in the right direction and many websites have decent implementations that are not abusive
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As long as it's as easy to decline cookies as it is to accept them the cookie banners are great
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I missed the licensing debate. In that one I like the freedom for everyone approach. MIT, BSD are great licenses that don't force anyone to do anything
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "I like the freedom for everyone approach"
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> MIT does not ensure ur freedom
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the thing
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just lying to urself
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It ensures the code I write is free for anyone to use for any purpose
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe it ensures ur developer freedom but not ur user freedom
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how that's not free
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz someone can use that in a private manner without showing the code or modifications
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thus not ensuring ur freedom
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Users freedom to do what exactly? See the source code to anything?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the four essential freedoms
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's not a right granted to you as the user by anything
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just dont want full freedom, its ok
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah these freedoms. What law grants you these? These are freedoms you might desire, sure. But you can't get them since there is such a thing as people owning the stuff they make
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> when some big company violates GPL, nothing really happens anyway, right?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so a law has to grant u the freedoms for the freedom to exist?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats bullshit
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We all agree on a common constitution in the respective countries we live in, that grant us all some freedoms
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see how GPL is anti constitutional
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just dont want full freedom
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not hard to admit
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not, it is a choice you can make. But don't pretend it's freedom for everyone
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i wonder why u think like that
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur not a company nor represent one
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would u want something that doesnt benefit you
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it bafles me
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think companies don't benefit us?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is freedom for everyone
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> companies dont care about you in any way shape or form
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the benefit u get is like a carrot in a stick
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to lure you
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are greedy, evil sons of bitches sure. But haven't they been spending billions on research getting us innovation?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sure would love to live in a dream world where there is no money and we all get together to improve our world
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> innovation? no they research to get their pockets filled with money, if they did research they would have helped people in need
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it's not this world
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats also a carrot in a stick
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "innovation"
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, they are motivated by money, status, power and in exchange they give us goods
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a simple trade
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt mean anything
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I sure would love to live in a dream world where there is no money and we all get together to improve our world
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why companies dont put all their money in a research for this model?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see how this innovation is pointless
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can protect the consumer without destroying the corporations
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no you cant
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The EU is a great example of this compromise
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gdpr doesnt protect u much
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the EU is not a saint either
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because like all human constructs they need motivation. What is there to gain for them in such a society? They are motivated by pure profit. If we share everything they can't profit
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is going a bit astray, but a interesting convo nevetherless
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we should reach that model and at that point "profit" would be meaningless and we would search another thing
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a rly good example is star trek
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no currency
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and what they do?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> advance technology and  explore
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The gdpr lets me use google without giving them my entire life. I can now request whatever they have on me and I can compel them to delete it legally
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> google gets ur life data anyway
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Profit can only really be meaningless if we have infinite goods. How do you propose we partition the goods?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i think if everyone gets their basic needs assured no matter what people would change how they think
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true there may always be a greedy person seeking "profit2
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it wouldnt have that importance
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I want more than the basics. What do I do?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right now society is based around money
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd say money is basically a way to distribute resources
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think money is the problem, just how you distribute that money
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Communism and Marxism work great if we all decide to not be humans. So we start to either cheat (USSR) or we compromise. How much do we compromise? If we compromise too much you reinvent capitalism (USA). If we try a balancing act, we get "socialism" (EU?)
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe getting infinite or nearly infinite resources is not something impossible
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One could argue that humans can get over their greed or that it's not an inherent feature of the human. But I don't really see how we get there without infinite goods
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just need the technology for it
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for example if we could get to the point of making a dyson sphere we would solve our power problems forever
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and with infinte power u can make lot of things
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well yes, probably. But is it really within our reach right now?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who knows
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A dyson swarm let alone a dyson sphere is an IMMENSE undertaking for a civilization
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> research and effort towards that may be a start
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would require more materials than there is materials on earth
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but as long as u focus on short term greed u probs will never have that
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 to go to a near planet and gather resources
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would require so much power to construct the thing I don't even know what could power it :P
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even making not all the sphere but a part would already give lot of power
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why its possible
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a incremental game
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Someone needs to innovate. For that either we all pool together our resources (I don't believe it's happening unless there is an exostential threat) or people motivated by money innovate
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine pooling resources together
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> research would go way faster
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> covid vaccine would getdone way before
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the perfect example
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> secrecy slows it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we should do our very best to stop the corporations from exploiting the people while they get the innovation done
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to get the juicy money from the vaccine
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we did get a vaccine ready in record time. There was both an existential threat and monetary motivation
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It did great imo
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it could have been faster
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We dangled the carrot(money) and the companies just got it done
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk if they are efficient but ye
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well interesting convo, i gotta go eat my corporation food now
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cya later
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could it? I think a lot of time was spent on testing. Moderna said they had the candidate they are releasing only after a week or so of starting development
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should get to sleep, I feel so extremely tired :/
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Just wait till the first countries start to cancel their orders
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when are we banning the use of languages with pass by reference semantics?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a few days before we decide to disallow mutating values at all
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might become a functional language advocate after aoc, pythons transparent pass by reference semantics are exceptionally annoying
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd honestly rather work with immutables any day of the year
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you know that copying a list of list of strs doesn't copy the strs? üòÑ
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, same in D
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wasted 2 hours
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I noticed today during aoc as well .D
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you know that copying a list of list of ints does copy the ints?..
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Heh, that's ununituitive
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> python does a weird thing with numbers under 256 iirc
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its related
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306313/is-operator-behaves-unexpectedly-with-integers
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The current implementation keeps an array of integer objects for all integers between -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you actually just get back a reference to the existing object.
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
