00:03 <@deen> Mysterious
00:04 <@deen> How can someone connect to a TW server with any faked IP address?
00:50 < savander> deen: iftop in linux console to check traffic, and ip. If this attack is from another server, maybe we can check address ip and send message to his provider? (who.is -> address ip, company name).
00:51 <@deen> savander: it's from many DNS servers
00:51 <@deen> but they just get used as amplifiers

00:52 <@deen> oops, a bit more than i wanted^^
00:52 <@deen> Anyway, this a thousand times every second
00:53 < savander> ye i see
00:53 < savander> wOw strange guy
00:53 < savander> But for what
00:53 < savander> xD
00:54 <@deen> If he keeps this up
00:54 <@deen> we will run out of traffic and shut down
00:55 < savander> It doesn't make sense... to ddos these servers lol;o
00:57 <@deen> right now it's not really a DDoS, just 20 GB of DNS traffic every day
00:58 <@deen> but he manages to make the servers lag
00:59 < savander> I know it's not really ddos, but i think it's same guy.
00:59 <@deen> Maybe, I'm not even sure
00:59 <@deen> the attacks look pretty different from time to time
00:59 <@deen> sometimes I get NTP attacks too
00:59 <@deen> sometimes it's 100Mbit/s, sometimes 1000 Mbit/s
01:17 < savander> So goodnight
08:43 < EastBite> deen: I'm trying to understand the spoof protection
08:43 < EastBite> it looks like it tries to require the client to interact with the server by doing a fake mapchange with random size
11:13 <@deen> yes
11:14 <@deen> and then checking that the client requests the correct random number of packages
11:14 <@deen> or something like that
11:15 < EastBite> that's cool
11:16 < EastBite> hm I guess ip spoofing still is a big problem
11:16 <@deen> Oh shit
11:16 < EastBite> attackers can hold slots
11:16 < EastBite> oh shit?
11:17 <@deen> The guy who made the ip spoofing protection also told me about a much more serious attack
11:17 < EastBite> D:
11:17 <@deen> and now I get a message by the persian that he seemingly is getting exactly this
11:17 <@deen> I'm wondering why noone attacks DDNet like this
11:18 < EastBite> something with the tw master servers?
11:18 <@deen> yes
11:18 < EastBite> ahh
11:18 < EastBite> I think I know
11:18 <@deen> and ip spoofing too
11:19 < EastBite> an attacker can pretend to be a master server and cause a ban
11:19 <@deen> ifyou connect your server to the master server you get every ip of every TW player
11:19 < EastBite> yes
11:19 <@deen> then you can go on a server and spoof these ip+port combinations and send disconnect packets
11:20 <@deen> and if you time it well you can find out the admin's ip address and send rcon commands
11:20 < EastBite> hm there was a thread on ddnet.tw
11:20 <@deen> Maybe it's because i never open the internet tab
11:20 < EastBite> you should care about that :D
11:21 < EastBite> is it possible to send the disconnect packet without syn/ack stuff?
11:21 <@deen> apparently yes
11:21 < EastBite> hm that's bad
11:22 <@deen> I'm actually studying for an exam tomorrow so I can't really look into all this stuff
11:22 <@deen> but the guy said he did all this sucessfully
11:22 < EastBite> well here is some easy fix: the client should use a different source port for server browsing
11:22 <@deen> exactly
11:22 <@deen> I even helped him implement that yesterday
11:23 < EastBite> oh
11:23 <@deen> Another problem is that on Windows your new port is not random
11:23 < EastBite> oh that's really great
11:23 <@deen> instead you get them in order, so you need to create a random number yourself^^
11:23 < EastBite> if windows allows that
11:23 <@deen> Yes it does
11:23 < EastBite> k
11:27 < EastBite> but what about this situation: an attacker spoofs the ip of a master server, floods the ddnet servers and causes the master server ip to be banned from ddnet
11:27 < EastBite> heartbeats wouldn't work out anymore I think?
11:27 < EastBite> so master ips have to be whitelisted or something
11:28 <@deen> Hm, good question^^
11:28 <@deen> Yeah, a whitelist would be good
11:29 < EastBite> hmm I don't have the possibility to spoof 0.0.0.0/0
11:29 < EastBite> I wonder which providers are being used for that
11:30 <@deen> Russian ones from what I heard
11:30 <@deen> but I don't really know
11:30 <@deen> I can't spoof anything either from any of my servers
11:34 < EastBite> well, the next is in a few days, today you should rather be studying instead of caring about ip spoofing^^
11:34 < EastBite> the next tournament*
11:34 <@deen> ^^
11:35 <@deen> Just got a mail from my hoster
11:35 <@deen> They're currently testing a DDoS protection and once the testing is over we will get it for free
11:36 <@deen> I really don't know how I got this great of a hoster
11:36 < EastBite> I have no idea how they want to block ddos but sounds cool^^
11:36 <@deen> I'm paying 10 € / month for 6 Ivy Bridge cores, 2 GB Ram, 10 Gbit/s connection and now even this
11:36 < EastBite> nice
11:36 < EastBite> which provider?
11:37 <@deen> http://datafabrik.de
11:37 <@deen> Unfortunately they don't offer virtual servers anymore
11:37 <@deen> Good morning Savander 
11:37 < Savander> Oh hi ;)
11:38 <@deen> New fun hacks: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=308
11:39 < Savander> deen
11:39 <@deen> EastBite: I guess it would work by throwing away the traffic way before it reaches the server, but no idea
11:39 <@deen> yes?
11:39 < Savander> you remember other topic?
11:39 <@deen> yes
11:39 < Savander> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=234
11:42 <@deen> Yeah, I guess I have to write up a fix for this quickly
11:42 < EastBite> it might be not that easy
11:42 < EastBite> the tw protocol seems to have some weakness in the session
11:42 <@deen> Why not just a new connection for server requests with a different port?
11:43 < EastBite> ah that one
11:43 <@deen> Then the attacker would have to guess port + sequence number, as you said
11:43 < EastBite> I hope so^^
11:43 <@deen> should be a bit harder
11:44 < EastBite> maybe I'm going to dive into the protocol to learn more about that^^
11:45 < EastBite> matricks also couldn't explain why disconnecting is possible
11:45 <@deen> if you just need the sequence number it's easy, right?
11:46 <@deen> you just send the disconnect paket for every possible seq number
11:46 < EastBite> but I don't know how hard it is to pass the right one
11:46 <@deen> Seemingly easy
11:47 < EastBite> and this has to be fixed
11:51 < EastBite> deen: could you ask "that guy" whether control messages are even involved in syn/ack stuff?
11:51 < EastBite> I have the strange feeling that they are not
11:52 <@deen> Yeah, he said something like that
11:52 < EastBite> grr
11:52 <@deen> you speak german?
11:52 < EastBite> ja
11:52 <@deen> [00:20:21] deen: IP-Spoofing ist mir schon klar
11:52 <@deen> [00:20:36] deen: aber ich dachte man bekommt von server ne sequenznummer und muss die acken
11:52 <@deen> [00:20:41] deen: aber kann auch sein dass ich mich täusche
11:52 <@deen> [00:20:44] Paddel~: nicht bei allen paketen
11:52 < EastBite> okay
11:53 <@deen> So that was the first thing I wondered about yesterday^^
11:55 < EastBite> lol
11:56 < EastBite> NET_MAX_SEQUENCE = 1<<10 = 1024
11:56 < EastBite> talking about 0x100^4 possibilities -.-
11:56 <@deen> meh, saving a lot of space^^
11:58 < EastBite> the seperate source port might be the best network fix since ever
11:59 <@deen> Nice that 3 people had the same idea =)
11:59 < EastBite> :D
11:59 <@deen> I'm trying to make it work right now
11:59 <@deen> because he's off
11:59 < EastBite> and I just wanted to go outside doing some sports :D
12:00 <@deen> Have fun
12:00 < EastBite> thanks, until then^^
12:01 <@deen> Got it working!
12:01 < Savander> that source port? 
12:02 <@deen> yes
12:02 < Savander> n1
12:02 <@deen> and sweeeeet, this also fixes another bug I've had forever in ddnet client
12:02 <@deen> ping is now always correct in favorites tab
12:03 < Savander> double n1 :o
12:04 < Savander> i have no idea how works network ( so i can't help you), i'm still learning and learning, but now my skills are bad.. 
12:05 <@deen> No problem, Savander =)
12:05 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/5436e45e2fb913c39d3fe6701d6aa33a879edb17
12:05 <@deen> Pretty simple fix I would say
12:06 < Savander> k
12:06 < Savander> it make one port more? or what xD
12:06 <@deen> yes
12:06 <@deen> and chooses a random number for all ports
12:06 <@deen> because on Windows it's not random apparently
12:07 <@deen> Hm, I think my laptop is dying
12:07 <@deen> got 4 kernel panics in a minute
12:09 < Savander> let's throw your laptop through the window
12:09 <@deen> No^^
12:09 < Savander> it'll be fine :P :D
12:09 <@deen> I'm compiling ddnet client+server on it :P
12:09 < Savander> meh :P:D
12:10 <@deen> all these virtual machines, terrible
12:14 < Savander> btw. few days ago, im testing something really simple in code with hookthrough tiles (and unhookthrough), It maybe not working how i wanted... but maybe you have idea how to fix it ;p
12:14 < Savander> you want see?
12:14 <@deen> Not now, sorry =/
12:14 < Savander> ok :]
12:14 <@deen> I have an important exam tomorrow
12:14 <@deen> just have to fix this now and go off
12:14 < Savander> Ah okay, no problem :P :D
12:14 <@deen> But maybe you could post in ddnet forum, I think some good programmers are there
12:15 < Savander> no, it's not important
12:18 <@deen> Savander: do you have windows?
12:18 < Savander> yup
12:18 <@deen> ok, can you try if the new client works ok? =/
12:18 < Savander> ok
12:18 <@deen> because i just got a network warning in my windows vm, i hope not everyone gets that now
12:18 <@deen> maybe it's because it's strange to choose a random port on Windows
12:19 <@deen> Savander: alright, it's available
12:19 <@deen> 4.7.4
12:20 < Savander> where i can see "the warnings ?"
12:20 < Savander> because i didn't see ;P :D 
12:20 <@deen> Alright good =)
12:21 <@deen> Just the usualy Windows warning when you start a network program
12:21 <@deen> whether it's allowed to access network
12:22 < Savander> so no warnings
12:22 < Savander> ;]
12:22 <@deen> =)
12:22 <@deen> Thanks
12:22 < Savander> no problem ;p.
12:55 < EastBite> deen: nice work, good luck for your exam tomorrow^^
12:55 <@deen> thanks
12:56 <@deen> but it causes the windows firewall to ask if you want to allow the third connection =/
12:56 < EastBite> meh
12:57 < EastBite> "11:25:59 EastBite | if windows allows that"
12:57 < EastBite> win sucks^^
12:57 <@deen> ^^
12:57 < EastBite> argh, I found a telephone guy outside
12:57 < EastBite> need to ask him something about vdsl
12:58 <@deen> Haha
13:04 <@deen> Hey, at least Windows doesn't ask every time we change the random port :P
13:05 < EastBite> at least :D
13:05 <@deen> So, getting VDSL?
13:05 < EastBite> sure :P
13:05 < EastBite> the telephon guy was gone :(
13:06 < EastBite> I'm hoping for 50mbit down
13:06 <@deen> 10mbit up is even nicer
13:06 < EastBite> ^
13:06 < EastBite> is that possible with vdsl?
13:06 <@deen> yes
13:06 < EastBite> cool
13:06 <@deen> that's the regular upload speed you get with VDSL
13:07 <@deen> vectoring is even sweeter with 100 mbit down and 40 up
13:07 < EastBite> hmkay
13:08 < EastBite> well I'm using my 50kbyte/s upload all night to outsource data on my server
13:08 < EastBite> 10mbit would be awesome
13:09 <@deen> EastBite: heard about the virus thing with DDNet client?
13:10 <@deen> compiling with gcc instead of visual studio gave a few "virus detections" on virustotal.com
13:14 < EastBite> hmm
13:14 < EastBite> didn't heard of that
13:14 < EastBite> but I find it common
13:14 <@deen> Yeah, but players were scared and spamming me about it^^
13:14 < EastBite> mingw is doing strange things
13:14 < EastBite> hmm
13:14 <@deen> Since I updated gcc it's only 1 virus heuristic now
13:15 < EastBite> it's really hard to fight heuristics
13:17 < EastBite> one should make a build bot with visual studio
13:18 <@deen> I tried but couldn't get it installed. I have no idea about all this windows stuff
13:18 < EastBite> and I tried to leave windows behind me^^
13:20 < EastBite> I have visual c++ 2010 on my vm
13:22 < EastBite> hmm I dunno, maybe I should try to install visual C++ on my friends windows vps^^
13:23 < EastBite> that would be practical for a build bot
13:23 <@deen> Not sure, since I'm not getting any complaints anymore, I could just keep going with mingw
13:23 < EastBite> would be easier^^
13:26 < EastBite> but at some point you'll need a buildbot for release versions^^
13:26 < EastBite> I'm going to have lunch
13:26 < Savander> Wow
13:26 < Savander> same result?
13:26 < Savander> https://www.virustotal.com/pl/file/6b473a0622e0c451d1ac2d62f3dd4973b1cafffc46a77bd74172c71c93184b55/analysis/1407929143/
13:26 < Savander> i compile it on my windows ;p
13:27 <@deen> Ah nice
13:27 < EastBite> urgh mcafee
13:27 < EastBite> ah before I forget, deen you could also remove the virus from source :)
13:27 < EastBite> </troll>
13:27 < Savander> .xD
13:27 <@deen> ^^
13:27 < Savander> i have some warning
13:27 < Savander> i have some warnings
13:27 <@deen> hm?
13:28 < Savander> on this shity os
13:28 < Savander> smth like: 
13:28 < Savander> [163/178] #1 c++ src/game/editor/editor.cpp src/game/editor/editor.cpp: In member function 'void CEditor::CreateUndoStep()':  src/game/editor/editor.cpp:4349:8: warning: unused variable 'CreateThread' [-Wun used-variable]   void *CreateThread = thread_create(CreateUndoStepThread, this);         ^
13:28 < Savander> you have to ye? or not ;P
13:29 < Savander> or http://www.savander.pl/img/VvNNV6vW7720
13:29 <@deen> Well, you could make a special case for windows
13:29 <@deen> i get these warnings as well
13:30 <@deen> if you want to fix them, feel free to do so
13:35 < Savander> meh, all works fine. it's just my computer ;o
15:02 <@deen> EastBite: Seems like 0.7 has a fix for this ready, but not merged for 2 years: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/986
15:06 < EastBite> ohh so much information and discussion and I thought it was something new
15:06 < EastBite> sadly there isn't any progress on 0.7
15:07 < EastBite> but in ddnet we can't drop vanilla support either :/
15:10 <@deen> I only thought these attacks were theoretical
15:10 <@deen> not that anyone was actually doing them
15:10 <@deen> which is why this pull request landed in my "consider for hookrace" todo list
15:11 < EastBite> hookrace?
15:11 <@deen> new game I'm planning / working on
15:11 < EastBite> something new?
15:11 <@deen> but it's very early, so I've been mainly poking around libraries and programming languages
15:12 <@deen> http://hookrace.net/
15:12 < EastBite> oh that's cool
15:12 <@deen> at least I got svg rendering working
15:13 < EastBite> once you were talking about a dropping teeworlds and working on a whole new game
15:13 <@deen> there are just a lot of things i can't do wile keeping vanilla compability
15:13 < EastBite> I didn't take it that serious^^
15:13 <@deen> compatibility*
15:14 <@deen> well, it's not really serious yet
15:14 <@deen> I just liked the hookrace domain, and finding and fixing bugs in a new programming language is fun as well
15:15 < EastBite> hmm nimrod, I've heard that name before
15:15 <@deen> that's surprising
15:15 <@deen> they won't even let us have a wikipedia page
15:15 < EastBite> why?
15:16 <@deen> not relevant enough
15:17 < EastBite> ddrace is absolutely worth it to make a new game
15:17 <@deen> yes, exactly my thought
15:17 <@deen> i've neverseen this gaming concept before and it's about the only game I've enjoyed in over 5 years
15:17 < EastBite> ^
15:18 <@deen> not that i play much anyway
15:18 < EastBite> and it's a concept in which you get easy into teamwork
15:18 < EastBite> and coop is the most fun thing in the world
15:19 <@deen> I'm just not sure when I should write it
15:19 <@deen> because now my Masters thesis is coming up
15:20 < EastBite> ah
15:21 < EastBite> hm
15:24 < EastBite> I think I'm going to look into nimrod
15:24 < EastBite> this is a good starting point: gpn14-5892-de-Nimrod_h264-hq.mp4
15:24 < EastBite> :D
15:24 <@deen> noooooooo
15:25 <@deen> I didn't know all that much about Nimrod back then^^
15:25 < EastBite> but you look delicious
15:25 <@deen> Have been writing a lot of code since then, but the slides should still be ok
15:25 < EastBite> okay^^
15:27 <@deen> I found out a few days ago that the Nimrod author works about 100 meters from where I'm studying
15:27 < EastBite> hehe
15:31 < EastBite> deen: do you visit the c3?
15:31 <@deen> usually not
15:32 < EastBite> well, since it's in hamburg I don't have to drive long
15:33 < EastBite> I'm going to be on 31c3
15:33 <@deen> quite a bit from Karlsruhe
15:33 < EastBite> yes
15:57 < Savander> deen: who's admin od ddnet? (without you?)
15:57 <@deen> Savander: Depends on what you mean by "admin"
15:58 < Savander> who have permissions to console and can force votes for example
15:58 <@deen> Theoretically Delo and .me' should have rcon, but i don't know if they even use it
15:58 <@deen> or remember the pw^^
15:58 < Savander> yesterday
15:58 < Savander> someone
15:58 < Savander> force vote
15:58 < Savander> to kick someone
15:58 <@deen> that was me most likely
15:58 <@deen> i forced a few as nameless tee
15:58 < Savander> didn't saw him
15:58 < Savander> ah
15:58 < Savander> maybe
15:58 < Savander> ;]
15:58 <@deen> that was me, not .me' :P
15:59 <@deen> .me' won't be online for a few weeks
15:59 <@deen> no idea where delo is hiding
16:00 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/staff/
16:01 < Savander> aaaa
16:37 < EastBite> https://eastbit.net/public/demoslice.png
16:37 < EastBite> dat gfx skill
16:37 < EastBite> hm the third button isn't mine
16:41 <@deen> ^^
16:41 <@deen> googlemail doesn't like me
16:42 < EastBite> and nobody likes googlemail
16:42 <@deen>     gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[2a00:1450:4010:c03::1a] said: 550-5.7.1

16:42 <@deen> Meh, that's my forum registration mail..
16:42 < EastBite> oh
16:42 <@deen> from ddnet.tw
16:43 <@deen> had to disable mail activations
16:43 <@deen> because gmail does that
16:43 <@deen> but on the other hand i haven't had a single spam message since i have these tw specific questions at the forum registration
16:43 <@deen> "what does ddnet stand for?"
16:43 < EastBite> I hardly was able to solve it yesterday :D
16:44 <@deen> Someone asked me what the answer is^^
16:44 < EastBite> lol
16:44 <@deen> but i guess it was more of a language barrier
16:44 <@deen> we have many on ddnet who don't speak english
16:44 <@deen> Have you seen the Russian anime thread?
16:45 < EastBite> no
16:45 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=265
16:45 < EastBite> in ddnet forums?
16:45 <@deen> That's hilarious
16:45 <@deen> Go into an english teeworlds forum and make a russian anime thread
16:45 < EastBite> haha :D
16:47 < EastBite> yep teeworlds wouldn't have that many players if it wouldn't be international
16:48 < EastBite> and sadly the light is just to slow to make as play together^^
16:48 < EastBite> us*
16:48 <@deen> well, if there were perfect fiber connections
16:49 <@deen> direct ones
16:49 <@deen> you would get ping 19 to Frankfurt from anywhere in Europe
16:49 < EastBite> yes, maybe
16:51 < EastBite> but I also have a friend in australia
17:12 <@deen> Clearly you should send neutrinos directly through the center of the earth. Would only take 43 ms in one direction, which is good enough if you have client side prediction :P
17:13 < EastBite> yep, that might be enough
17:14 < EastBite> although I don't know how that works
17:15 <@deen> client side prediction or neutrinos?
17:15 < EastBite> the latter one
17:16 <@deen> they fly with nearly the speed of light
17:16 <@deen> and since they are pretty small you can send them through the earth without any problems
17:16 <@deen> just the detection is difficult
17:16 < EastBite> yay
17:17 <@deen> Detectors look like this: http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/wme/PH13-bottom-yoko-1-wm.JPG
17:18 < EastBite> ah^^
23:04 < Savander> hi whats up
23:26 <@deen> hi, nothing
23:26 <@deen> i'm busy
23:37 < Savander> exams tomorrow?
