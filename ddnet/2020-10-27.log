01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> has anyone else had this bug where the game randomly freezes and then starts flashing angrily and you have to kill it?
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> has been happening to me for a few last updates at random
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well nobody wants to debug xd
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I could debug but it happens seemingly whenever it wants to and I'm not doing anything special
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it only happens on windows and on intel devices
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that would be correct
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we arent sure if its the ddnet code or the intel driver since windows update
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you can reproduce, you can enable asan in visual studio, to find a memory leak
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well you know I'm coding-illiterate
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well to me it happens just every few days for no reason
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but if you want join trashmap with multeasymap(non halloween) louis sad it happens there always
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it freezes, then I alt tab out the game and after tabbing back in it flashes black until I kill it
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but if you want join trashmap with multeasymap(non halloween) louis said it happens there always
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> to me it happens on any map
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> often on my home server when testing own maps or on any ddnet map
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis wanna debug xd
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie you could ofc try a newer intel driver, but seems like the new one has other issues
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's fine, this isn't much of a problem to me but just reporting
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't play the game enough to have this kill a run lol
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, i'd love to know whats causing it, but yet only intel users reported it 😄
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and only windows
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and only since a few weeks xD
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hm I've had *similar* things happening for maybe a few months
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think at one point it was flashing white instead but I might be remembering it wrong
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it could be the ddnet code ofc
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i cannot reproduce on amd hardware under linux
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and under linux u have pretty good tools to find such errors
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what I can say is, this time it happened when someone joined the server
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but this isn't always the case since this also happens when I'm completely alone on lan
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> our only current finding is that something is wrong in prediction code, sadly deen caught it randomly, so we don't know when it happened xD
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw ive always had it near the start of a map
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or when i first join a srv
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis i'd really like to know if its still reproducable with trashmap with that multeasymap
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you want i can setup a trashmap quickly
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sure
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> trashmap.ddnet.tw:8575 pw is Test
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie 
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/ASan-Blog-Post-Image-0.png
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Jupstar ✪
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have it frozen
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and i have asan on
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> (i think)
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now what
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do i pause it?
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Asan should have output smth
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> In the output
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its a bunch of exeption thrown for memset
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do i rly have to dig thru it to find asan
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just copy the whole output
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ctrl a
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its literally just tons of exception thrwon at index 0x0000 smth
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im looking thruw hole thing
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but the asan output looks very clean
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It should say smth like address
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or sanitize
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but use ctrl f
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just search the output
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the addresses don't resolve, you are missing llvm-sanitize in your path
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i was in windows and tested it btw
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> llvm-symbolize*
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just using the SLN project and added /fsanitize=address was enough
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the symbols
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ that wouldn't link properly for me no matter what I tried
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> dont have anything
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> strange, i also used a clean vs 2019 tho
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then its not inside of ddnet
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or it's not a memory issue
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but must be actually
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else the 10000 triangles make no sense
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ try ubsan
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i tried everything under linux 😄
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we are overflowing sth
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean on windows
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis just to be sure, can you search the file graphics_threaded.cpp
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for what
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the right of vs u can search it
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll quickly do an overflow to check if asan was working
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wih u guys could just be on my comp and do it for me
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but im nto gonna remote access 👀
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vs2019-hello-world-code.png
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> top right
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> search solution explorerer
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just search the file there
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> inside the file search for
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mem_copy(Cmd.m_pVertices, m_aVertices, VertSize * NumVerts);
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and replace it with
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mem_copy(Cmd.m_pVertices, m_aVertices, VertSize * NumVerts * 200000);
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then compile and run
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should crash and output stuff from asan
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie got a SLN file?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770465097469919252/unknown.png
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> where?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis looks good
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie or how did u compile it
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with cmake gui?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah built it from within vs
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh i think that didnt really work @Ravie 😄
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but louis tested anyway
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and asan showed nothing
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and now we proved that asan was on, bcs the overflow by ourself was triggering
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i feel like my comp has like an obscure bug and provides negative results
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if it also crashes with opengl 1.x
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gfx_opengl_major 1
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> one intel user said, he even had a crash with gl 1.x
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait how is it not an issue in gamecode if its so reproducible on spexific maps
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well this tool finds all overflows, and it has to be an overflow, since your debug showed a invalid variable
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it must have been overwritten by something
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if its not detectable by asan it might not be reachable by asan e.g. by the intel driver 😄
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh that would make most sense, deen and me already used asan and ubsan quite often lately, the only bug we found lately that could have caused something was a bug reported by asan
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its inside opengl and intel knows about it dbg_gfx 1 would probably show it
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my amd driver and the mesa software renderer doesnt show anything tho
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so i need to change my drivers till i find one that works?
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie 
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the right see the DDNet project, right click properties
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> add this:
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/ASAN-Blog-Post-Image-2.png
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then set the ddnet project as start project
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> build and run
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis thats my fear yes
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis dunno if u ever used linux, e.g. from a bootable usb stick but you could try it
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> done
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel is open source udner linux
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye i have
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how would that help
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie when running it will probably crash inside a "memset", just ignore that one
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis i assume intel drivers under linux are better, bcs heinrich and deen use intel both
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> xd well i cant use linux just to play ddnet
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i can understand that
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, they release a driver once per month or smth
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the next driver will be better 😄
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe ill try linux again to see if fl studio support isnt total trash anymore
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats the downside of linux, its not well supported desktop wise from the industry 😄
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so should it throw an error somewhere when it crashes?
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> asan should output alot of stuff in output bottom right @Ravie
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh yeah
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not the memset thing
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait what
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it really has to contain a stacktrace and address sanitzer in the name
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's a lot of access violations
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it really has to contain a stacktrace and address sanitizer in the name
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes but they false positives or smth
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `The thread 0x289c has exited with code 0 (0x0).`
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not the report from asan
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also not a bad thing
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just a info
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> alright so how do I filter out asan
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just ctrl + f and search address
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's a million entries long list of violations
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or sanitizer
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or "sanitize" to be safe
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> same for louis
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing for sanitize and for address it only found irrelevant ones
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and louis even tried if asan is enabled
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i could be wrong, but the chance that its not inside ddnet code is not small
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll wait for deen tomorrow, maybe he has in idea
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> did my messages in game go through?
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client works
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also what others reported
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its really just the visuells broken
03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These sanitizers are all useless if we can't trust them...
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On linux I know that asan won't miss anything, I know that ubsan will never generate a false positive
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On windows god knows
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ikr
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but on linux it doesnt show anything either xD
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah this bug I don't know what causes it
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the fact that it's reproducible for some people is odd to me
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ do you know which generation of intel cpus we are getting trouble with?
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only since 2017 gpus
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> late 2017
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a couple different generations with iGPU I can test on the weekend
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i even tested some 10 years old intel and it had no problems xD
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh I don't have a kaby or coffee lake either
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll try a haswell and a broadwell
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> actually mine seems to be from late 2016
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> i3-8145u with hd graphics 620
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The one I tested was an i3 ivy bridge or something like that
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ash yeah 620
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I think Louis has 6xx too
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770481977304023040/unknown.png

08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Hi! sorry to disturb with that again, but looks like nobody really understand my problem, tho i'd love to be able to fix it myself I have no idea how :
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> * I'm on macOS, using the official DDNet from the website.
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> So, the problem is about the skin fetcher, the downloadedskins folder really gather the fetched skins from the database, but the problem is that i don't see those in the client at all. Neither from the skins menu and ingame.
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I could totally just download the database and put them in the data/skins folder, but i'd have to do it at each little update ddnet releases
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> In Windows I know that it behaves correctly, so the problem is really on mac
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Thanks for reading 🙏
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770543731371147274/unknown.png
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> (the downloadedskins folder from the "Application Support/Teeworlds" folder, that have the downloaded skins)
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> You are not supposed to see them iirc. Download the skin your want and put it in skins folder instead of downloadedskins
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> The downloadedskins folder is for downloading other ppls skins when you encounter any. It does not download the entire database.
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you should see the skins if someone is using them ingame. Is that working @Neben ?
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe someone with Mac can reproduce it, but I remember it worked for @Learath2
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oh he said in game
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> my bad
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> You are not supposed to see them (edit: in menu) iirc. Download the skin your want and put it in skins folder instead of downloadedskins
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Neben can you run client from command line and check console output?
10:09 < ChillerDragon> when your merge with ddnet upstream fails because the "save_replay" (demo replays) is already defined in your codebase :justatest: :robot:
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Can I just replace the latest .exe in my old folder to get the update?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> That can break things
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> You should always update everything
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Bruh
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i redownload the .app when i want to update and it works fine for me
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Nice, but broken shaders or missing textures won't fix it
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @deen Ya, here it is : https://pastebin.com/jTiNngXJ
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bomb> Idk if this was already suggested, but what about adding a button to launch a local server and some gui for its config?
