01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> has anyone else had this bug where the game randomly freezes and then starts flashing angrily and you have to kill it?
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> has been happening to me for a few last updates at random
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well nobody wants to debug xd
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I could debug but it happens seemingly whenever it wants to and I'm not doing anything special
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it only happens on windows and on intel devices
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that would be correct
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we arent sure if its the ddnet code or the intel driver since windows update
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you can reproduce, you can enable asan in visual studio, to find a memory leak
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well you know I'm coding-illiterate
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well to me it happens just every few days for no reason
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but if you want join trashmap with multeasymap(non halloween) louis sad it happens there always
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it freezes, then I alt tab out the game and after tabbing back in it flashes black until I kill it
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but if you want join trashmap with multeasymap(non halloween) louis said it happens there always
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> to me it happens on any map
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> often on my home server when testing own maps or on any ddnet map
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis wanna debug xd
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie you could ofc try a newer intel driver, but seems like the new one has other issues
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's fine, this isn't much of a problem to me but just reporting
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't play the game enough to have this kill a run lol
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, i'd love to know whats causing it, but yet only intel users reported it 😄
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and only windows
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and only since a few weeks xD
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hm I've had *similar* things happening for maybe a few months
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think at one point it was flashing white instead but I might be remembering it wrong
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it could be the ddnet code ofc
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i cannot reproduce on amd hardware under linux
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and under linux u have pretty good tools to find such errors
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what I can say is, this time it happened when someone joined the server
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but this isn't always the case since this also happens when I'm completely alone on lan
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> our only current finding is that something is wrong in prediction code, sadly deen caught it randomly, so we don't know when it happened xD
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw ive always had it near the start of a map
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or when i first join a srv
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis i'd really like to know if its still reproducable with trashmap with that multeasymap
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you want i can setup a trashmap quickly
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sure
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> trashmap.ddnet.tw:8575 pw is Test
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie 
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/ASan-Blog-Post-Image-0.png
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Jupstar ✪
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have it frozen
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and i have asan on
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> (i think)
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now what
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do i pause it?
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Asan should have output smth
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> In the output
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its a bunch of exeption thrown for memset
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do i rly have to dig thru it to find asan
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just copy the whole output
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ctrl a
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its literally just tons of exception thrwon at index 0x0000 smth
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im looking thruw hole thing
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but the asan output looks very clean
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It should say smth like address
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or sanitize
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but use ctrl f
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just search the output
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the addresses don't resolve, you are missing llvm-sanitize in your path
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i was in windows and tested it btw
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> llvm-symbolize*
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just using the SLN project and added /fsanitize=address was enough
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the symbols
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ that wouldn't link properly for me no matter what I tried
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> dont have anything
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> strange, i also used a clean vs 2019 tho
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then its not inside of ddnet
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or it's not a memory issue
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but must be actually
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else the 10000 triangles make no sense
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ try ubsan
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i tried everything under linux 😄
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we are overflowing sth
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean on windows
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis just to be sure, can you search the file graphics_threaded.cpp
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for what
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the right of vs u can search it
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll quickly do an overflow to check if asan was working
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wih u guys could just be on my comp and do it for me
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but im nto gonna remote access 👀
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vs2019-hello-world-code.png
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> top right
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> search solution explorerer
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just search the file there
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> inside the file search for
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mem_copy(Cmd.m_pVertices, m_aVertices, VertSize * NumVerts);
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and replace it with
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mem_copy(Cmd.m_pVertices, m_aVertices, VertSize * NumVerts * 200000);
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then compile and run
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should crash and output stuff from asan
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie got a SLN file?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770465097469919252/unknown.png
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> where?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis looks good
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie or how did u compile it
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with cmake gui?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah built it from within vs
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh i think that didnt really work @Ravie 😄
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but louis tested anyway
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and asan showed nothing
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and now we proved that asan was on, bcs the overflow by ourself was triggering
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i feel like my comp has like an obscure bug and provides negative results
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if it also crashes with opengl 1.x
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gfx_opengl_major 1
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> one intel user said, he even had a crash with gl 1.x
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait how is it not an issue in gamecode if its so reproducible on spexific maps
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well this tool finds all overflows, and it has to be an overflow, since your debug showed a invalid variable
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it must have been overwritten by something
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if its not detectable by asan it might not be reachable by asan e.g. by the intel driver 😄
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh that would make most sense, deen and me already used asan and ubsan quite often lately, the only bug we found lately that could have caused something was a bug reported by asan
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its inside opengl and intel knows about it dbg_gfx 1 would probably show it
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my amd driver and the mesa software renderer doesnt show anything tho
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so i need to change my drivers till i find one that works?
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie 
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the right see the DDNet project, right click properties
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> add this:
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/ASAN-Blog-Post-Image-2.png
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then set the ddnet project as start project
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> build and run
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis thats my fear yes
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis dunno if u ever used linux, e.g. from a bootable usb stick but you could try it
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> done
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel is open source udner linux
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye i have
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how would that help
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie when running it will probably crash inside a "memset", just ignore that one
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis i assume intel drivers under linux are better, bcs heinrich and deen use intel both
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> xd well i cant use linux just to play ddnet
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i can understand that
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, they release a driver once per month or smth
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the next driver will be better 😄
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe ill try linux again to see if fl studio support isnt total trash anymore
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats the downside of linux, its not well supported desktop wise from the industry 😄
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so should it throw an error somewhere when it crashes?
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> asan should output alot of stuff in output bottom right @Ravie
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh yeah
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not the memset thing
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait what
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it really has to contain a stacktrace and address sanitzer in the name
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's a lot of access violations
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it really has to contain a stacktrace and address sanitizer in the name
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes but they false positives or smth
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `The thread 0x289c has exited with code 0 (0x0).`
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not the report from asan
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also not a bad thing
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just a info
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> alright so how do I filter out asan
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just ctrl + f and search address
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's a million entries long list of violations
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or sanitizer
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or "sanitize" to be safe
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> same for louis
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing for sanitize and for address it only found irrelevant ones
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and louis even tried if asan is enabled
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i could be wrong, but the chance that its not inside ddnet code is not small
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll wait for deen tomorrow, maybe he has in idea
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> did my messages in game go through?
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client works
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also what others reported
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its really just the visuells broken
03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These sanitizers are all useless if we can't trust them...
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On linux I know that asan won't miss anything, I know that ubsan will never generate a false positive
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On windows god knows
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ikr
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but on linux it doesnt show anything either xD
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah this bug I don't know what causes it
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the fact that it's reproducible for some people is odd to me
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ do you know which generation of intel cpus we are getting trouble with?
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only since 2017 gpus
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> late 2017
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a couple different generations with iGPU I can test on the weekend
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i even tested some 10 years old intel and it had no problems xD
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh I don't have a kaby or coffee lake either
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll try a haswell and a broadwell
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> actually mine seems to be from late 2016
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> i3-8145u with hd graphics 620
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The one I tested was an i3 ivy bridge or something like that
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ash yeah 620
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I think Louis has 6xx too
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770481977304023040/unknown.png

08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Hi! sorry to disturb with that again, but looks like nobody really understand my problem, tho i'd love to be able to fix it myself I have no idea how :
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> * I'm on macOS, using the official DDNet from the website.
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> So, the problem is about the skin fetcher, the downloadedskins folder really gather the fetched skins from the database, but the problem is that i don't see those in the client at all. Neither from the skins menu and ingame.
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I could totally just download the database and put them in the data/skins folder, but i'd have to do it at each little update ddnet releases
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> In Windows I know that it behaves correctly, so the problem is really on mac
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Thanks for reading 🙏
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770543731371147274/unknown.png
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> (the downloadedskins folder from the "Application Support/Teeworlds" folder, that have the downloaded skins)
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> You are not supposed to see them iirc. Download the skin your want and put it in skins folder instead of downloadedskins
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> The downloadedskins folder is for downloading other ppls skins when you encounter any. It does not download the entire database.
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you should see the skins if someone is using them ingame. Is that working @Neben ?
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe someone with Mac can reproduce it, but I remember it worked for @Learath2
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oh he said in game
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> my bad
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> You are not supposed to see them (edit: in menu) iirc. Download the skin your want and put it in skins folder instead of downloadedskins
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Neben can you run client from command line and check console output?
10:09 < ChillerDragon> when your merge with ddnet upstream fails because the "save_replay" (demo replays) is already defined in your codebase :justatest: :robot:
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Can I just replace the latest .exe in my old folder to get the update?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> That can break things
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> You should always update everything
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Bruh
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i redownload the .app when i want to update and it works fine for me
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Nice, but broken shaders or missing textures won't fix it
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @deen Ya, here it is : https://pastebin.com/jTiNngXJ
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bomb> Idk if this was already suggested, but what about adding a button to launch a local server and some gui for its config?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is a button for the server
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just no gui for config
12:27 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603797958.png
12:27 < ChillerDragon> lmao 
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> We have a small style check problem in main branch @dev
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ r u  still down for that language ui thing?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what language ui thing xD
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we discussed it yesterday
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u want to write it?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the .teestyle xD
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we need to discuss this a lot before doing anything like this
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is there no minimal css3 + html lib?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its lot of work and if its not wanted and well thought it will be bad
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a issue to discuss
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd prefer a simple css + html lib, bcs thats easier to use xD
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then say it there
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets say it like this
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer a focused language
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u really interested in it
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd defs be interested in ur impl
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dont want to plan style language just so that nobody ever implements it bcs its too much work xD
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do u want to compile it to the current ui code?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i am interested in making a language
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so this is a interesting project
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ to current ui code was the idea
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe modify the ui code to make compilation easier
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ fix style in ur pr nobo :monkalaugh:
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > src/game/client/render.cpp:180:43: error: code should be clang-formatted [-Wclang-format-violations]
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess who created that error @Ryozuki xd
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/05d6201a72579d73547e79af0ed4773a19cdbf86
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah, theses whitespaces.. always the same xd
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i'm confused, the ddnet download page still has graphic tools with borderrem/add etc. but your commit removing them is tagged as 15.1.3, is the zip on the website outdated?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hi guys
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> (save the best demo of each race) this make record automata all time right? but if you die or not finished map. would lost the record ,
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> some time i get good shot but because me not finished the map this  useless
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770673487588229140/694ab87a41a3b522.png
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so my suggestion , put any method for save automatake even if me die
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so my suggestion , put any method for save automatake even if you die
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so my suggestion , put any method for save  the automatake even if you die
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so my suggestion , put any method for save the save automatake even if you die
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Yes that would be dope.
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Or at least some button with save anyway or something. And not just drop the demo with death
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we have 2 optiuons
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> auto demos and replay demos
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats enough
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we have 2 options
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yeah, I haven't updated that in a while
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh ok didnt know they updated manually 😄
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @hussainx3 @b3z save_replay seconds in F1
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> And you have to enable replays
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> ah I didn't know it was possible yet
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the exec myServerconfig.cfg doesnt work for me
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> merge #3190 pls
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3190
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it still collides with my pr
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it's becoming too old, I want to delete this branch and update everything to match master xD
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u dont need to touch that branch
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also just close the pr, bcs my pr changes the margin again, we just havent decided yet what we want to use appearently
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770710307185885214/unknown.png
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just do git checkout -b new_branch and ignore the other one
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> this is like 1000000 commits behind now
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt matter xD
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> havent deleted a branch since like 2 years bcs im too lazy
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> terminal master race
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770712742260768798/unknown.png
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh its christmas already
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wot
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its halloween
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks like a half christmas tree
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ this one is even better
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770714444127797248/unknown.png
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"`
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a alias for git log
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "git lg"
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> too much % for my brain
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why u use alias
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Where can I check if my static variable is true and if so - DoButton?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Needs to happen every frame in CMenus
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know you can google a bit
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Google for ddnet code
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> To know where u fkin call frame logic updates
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should learn more about static variables
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Ofc
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they not only exist here :)
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Дядя Женя if(variable) DoButton() ?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Am I really that dumb in english?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I wanted to know where you do all the input logic
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Already figured it out
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you really make people want to help you
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> But to make it clear:
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I've created Color Picker. The code works that way:
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 1. You call for something like `RenderPicker(pColor)`, it renders simple Square with the color you provided
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 2. This method checks, if you pressed this square. If you do, it makes static Color Picker be "linked" to this color and turning Color Picker on, if it wasn't enabled
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 3. **Here I was when asked the question** Now I should check every frame if the Color Picker enabled and if it is - draw it for "linked" color
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Didn't really make it clear, but whatever...
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> wait for the best color picker in ddnet client
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> and ban Ryozuki
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> color picker for what
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> everything. For colors?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but which colors
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for tee it makes no sense
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Something like you have in editor
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> > for tee it makes no sense
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Jupstar ✪ why?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs it clamps the light value
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with HLS values u can modify  colors differently than wiith RGBA
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and it clamps the light value there
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Color Picker is hsl, isn't it?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> depends on what u call a color picker
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but normally its rba
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770736173773226014/unknown.png
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but normally its rbg
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but normally its rgb
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> oh, I think I see it now
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> no, I don't
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then make sure for tees that the values that cant be selected arent even shown
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else it just confuses ppl
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Does HSL have different color range from RGB?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats not the point here, the problem is tee colors are clamped
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the color picker crosshair in the editor is hard to see when its on greyish values btw
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Ceosshair is shit, I'm making my own color picker anyway
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Crosshair is shit, I'm making my own color picker anyway
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> If I'll do it good enough, I'll apply it for editor I think
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> > thats not the point here, the problem is tee colors are clamped
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Jupstar ✪ oh, from 0 to 100...
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> To not let it be black and white
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I see
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Дядя Женя e.g. u cant have black skins
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i think half of the lightness values are not allowed
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but learath is the color guy, he knows all the HLS tricks
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> It just have slightly clamped range
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Should be easy to fix
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ye
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I'll try to just scale that square of picker
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I mean... Doesn't matter, thank you for pointing it out
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/770748334608613386/unknown.png
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 🤔 🤔 🤔
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ew hsl
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Now I should guess what colors refer to what values in vec4
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait thats not hsl
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> And now I just realised it uses RGB, so should make new method for drawing HSL nice
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/447043157469954069/770758743112941588/unknown.png

22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I knew which part of the code you were talking about before looking at the code snippet you posted 😄
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the server list doesnt load for me
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> restart fixed it
