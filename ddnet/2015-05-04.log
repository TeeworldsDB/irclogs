01:35 < savander> finally
13:24 < DMTee> hola
13:24 < DMTee> konntest du denn mit den infos was anfangen deen?
13:35 <@deen> DMTee: hi. i don't know what we were talking about
13:42 <@deen> New Nim article ;) http://hookrace.net/blog/nim-binary-size/
13:52 < DMTee> about the foot server settings
13:52 < DMTee> tdeen
13:53 <@deen> DMTee: no, didn't help. I'm running the wrong mod and can't find the right one anywhere
13:53 <@deen> it should be called teeball, not football
13:53 < DMTee> teeball is the wrong one
13:53 <@deen> well, then there was another football mod
13:53 < DMTee> u have the right one we have the same
13:53 <@deen> because the settings you sent me don't exist in the mod
13:54 < DMTee> i ask my server hoster to send me the complete mod
13:54 < DMTee> with the right settings
13:54 <@deen> i don't need a binary, only the source code
13:55 < DMTee> ok i will do my best
13:58 < DMTee> cucu <3
14:45 <@EastByte> deen: awesome article!
14:46 <@EastByte> reducing binary size and getting rid of glibs are topics I have been really interested in
14:46 <@EastByte> glibc*
15:21 < savander> which distribution of linux do you use?
15:24 <@EastByte> arch linux
15:29 < savander> EveryTime when i hear about Arch linux, i heard "it's really difficult distro to use and install"
15:30 <@EastByte> yes, you need to learn how to linux first
15:31 <@EastByte> experienced linux users mostly chose between arch and gentoo (or some bsd)
15:31 <@EastByte> choose*
15:32 < savander> im not really experienced
15:32 < savander> :D
15:32 < savander> so it'll be very hard for me i guess
15:34 <@EastByte> all depends on why or for what purpose you want to use linux :)
15:37 < Learath2> arch isnt that difficult
15:37 < Learath2> gentoo was painful to get used to tho
15:41 < savander> For learning
15:41 < savander> and for programming xD.
15:43 <@EastByte> set up a linux using a vm software and learn :P
15:43 < savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/hIlP1MvI8345
15:43 < savander> as you can seexD
15:43 < savander> xD
15:44 <@EastByte> :
15:44 <@EastByte> :)
15:44 < Learath2> debian is much friendlier to begin with tbh
15:44 < savander> i'm using debian on VPS
15:44 < savander> ;d
16:07 < savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/E9fxN7lN8407
16:10 <@deen> Learath2: the trick is to start with Gentoo, then go to Arch and finally Debian
16:10 <@deen> (which I did)
16:11 <@deen> EastByte: thanks!
16:11 <@deen> EastByte: Actually I just wanted to test what cool stuff GCC 5.1 brings, then I noticed that my binary was getting smaller and smaller
16:19 < Learath2> deen: i did windows -> ubuntu -> debian -> freebsd -> gentoo -> arch (for mere 20days) -> gentoo -> debian -> windows
16:19 <@deen> Well, I'm still using all my distributions^^
16:19 <@deen> I just install them once and they're running since then, must be 8 years by now
17:05 < o_be_one> hi all

17:34 < nuborn> hi
17:44 < nuborn> I think the thing that causes weak/strong also causes a difference in player collision, and causes misprediction when tees bumb into each other, so I tried to fix that
17:45 <@deen> nuborn: hm, yeah
17:46 <@deen> the code is a bit weird^^
17:46 <@deen> I'll pull it and change a bit i think
17:46 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #203: (antiping) improve prediction of collision between players (DDRace64...predict_player_collision) http://git.io/vJ2fg
17:46 <@deen> thanks
17:46 < nuborn> ok, but I guess you see what it does :)
17:46 < nuborn> it can probable be shortened
17:46 < nuborn> np, and thanks :)
17:47 <@deen> oh, and please use tabs instead of spaces for indentation in the future
17:48 < nuborn> oh! hmm, yes, I will. sorry about that, I think I have to learn how to configure vim properly
17:48 <@deen> :set noexpandtab
17:49 <@deen> and I use visible TABs, that also helps
17:49 < nuborn> what is the command for visible tabs?
17:49 <@deen> set listchars=tab:»·,extends:>,precedes:<,trail:¬
17:50 < nuborn> thanks!
17:53 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vJotd
17:53 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 9dc63ed def: Clean up a bit
18:15 < savander> :D
18:16 < savander> archlinux installed! 
18:20 < savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/SMV2W0uT8517
18:20 < savander> yay, first time on arch!
18:21 < savander> with cinnamone
18:27 <@deen> cool
18:30 < savander> EastByte: 
18:36 < ImJustAskinDude> deen!
18:36 < ImJustAskinDude> deeeeeeen!
18:36 < ImJustAskinDude> are you out there ?
18:37 < ImJustAskinDude> bring back bombing 1.2, you brought football, bombing deserves the same treatment!
18:37 < ImJustAskinDude> and bombing is way more fun
18:44 <@deen> ImJustAskinDude: no one played the bomb mod
18:44 <@deen> if no one will play football in a few weeks, I'll also remove it
18:44 <@deen> I always get shit from people for running empty servers
18:49 < ImJustAskinDude> oh yeah, i think i actually asked you to do it already like a year ago
18:50 < ImJustAskinDude> fuck me, but bombing was super fun, people were just not ready for that level of fun yet
18:50 < ImJustAskinDude> i'm sure they're ready now!
18:50 <@deen> aren't there other bomb servers?
18:50 <@deen> i see a few, with low ping and always empty
18:50 < ImJustAskinDude> i can even give you the right map and settings
18:50 < ImJustAskinDude> foh rlziz ?
18:51 <@deen> yes, WRA for example
18:53 < ImJustAskinDude> the hell, what is the exact name of that server
18:54 < ImJustAskinDude> cuz i can't see none of tat
18:54 < ImJustAskinDude> shit, i messed up that sentence
18:55 < ImJustAskinDude> let me rephrase "cuz i aint seeing none of that
18:55 < ImJustAskinDude> "
18:55 < ImJustAskinDude> there ya go
18:55 <@deen> Name is: //w®a* Oldschool ~ Bomb
18:56 <@deen> and 2 russian ones
18:58 < ImJustAskinDude> just visited all of them, none of them have the map that was awesome for bombing
18:59 < ImJustAskinDude> and now i think i rememeber, i didn't ask you for bombing, but for kukurice
18:59 < ImJustAskinDude> eeeee is probably not here yet, so maybe you know if i can just put a map somewhere for you to view it ?
19:00 < ImJustAskinDude> not on a server ?
19:00 < ImJustAskinDude> you've got that soft on your page, don't you ?
19:02 < ImJustAskinDude> geebus, goes to show how long have i been playing this game, the map is 7 years old
19:04 < savander> øóåé®åéóþßð
19:04 < savander> wtf
19:37 <@EastByte> oh in firefox my bookmarks button is gone
19:38 <@EastByte> glad I'm able to create a textfile and paste the url
19:40 <@deen> huh?
19:41 <@EastByte> I just found it
19:41 <@EastByte> using "customize"
19:41 <@deen> ctrl-b?
19:41 <@EastByte> I don't know firefox shortcuts
19:41 <@EastByte> and my menubar is gone so...
19:41 <@deen> me neither, i always click that accidentally :P
19:41 <@EastByte> heh
19:43 < heinrich5991> menu? tool bar? pentadactyl!
19:45 <@deen> heinrich5991: exactly!
19:48 <@EastByte> what currently is going in with youtube
19:49 <@EastByte> buffering videos is like 50K/s and stops for several seconds
19:49 <@deen> EastByte: change your dns server
19:49 <@deen> Many providers like to cache youtube inside their own network
19:50 <@deen> 8.8.8.8 should be fine
19:50 <@EastByte> yea seems to work, but I'm pretty sure I already tried that yesterday
19:52 <@deen> maybe your provider is just overloaded
19:53 <@deen> YT must be the main traffic source of the internet by now
19:53 <@EastByte> nah the bandwidth is fine
19:53 <@deen> I mean your provider's line to YT
19:53 <@EastByte> hm sounds not realistic
19:54 <@EastByte> but I didn't know about youtube caching
19:55 <@EastByte> I thought using https, the videos also are loaded encrypted
19:57 <@deen> woah, looks like you're right. crazy to encrypt video transmissions
19:58 <@EastByte> the webbrowsers would alert unsafe https otherwise
19:59 <@EastByte> but encrypted also means there is no caching
19:59 <@EastByte> except providers are authorised for that
20:01 <@deen> I thought the video traffic goes through flash so the browsers wouldn't even notice ;)
20:02 <@EastByte> oh, forgot flash
20:02 <@EastByte> maybe because it's likely dead ;)
20:03 <@deen> Hacker News has such a weird algorithm for ranking submissions
20:03 < savander> Shieeet 
20:03 < savander> EastByte:  i forgot to add "vote" to mod_command
20:03 <@EastByte> deen: why your article is near top, so it's fine
20:03 <@EastByte> :p
20:03 < savander> sorry  :(
20:03 <@deen> When many people comment on a story it's regarded as a "flame war"
20:03 <@deen> and moves down very quickly
20:03 <@EastByte> oh
20:03 <@deen> EastByte: I'm not answering to comments anymore since I know that :P
20:03 <@deen> makes the story stay up much longer
20:04 <@deen> There's another submission that was posted 2 hours after mine, has twice the points, but 4 times the comments, so it's way down allready
20:04 <@EastByte> savander: done
20:04 < savander> thank you <3
20:05 <@deen> savander: now you can use linux to build a 150 byte binary!
20:05 < savander> in nim?
20:05 <@deen> sure
20:05 <@deen> or 149 in C
20:05 < savander> haha
20:05 <@deen> Can't translate the trick to save the last byte to nim =/
20:05 <@EastByte> "now you can use linux to build a 150 byte"
20:05 <@EastByte> haha
20:05 < savander> i read your article
20:08 <@EastByte> deen: btw. the first hn comment was definitly at the right place
20:08 <@deen> hm?
20:08 <@EastByte> "WOW. 10/10"
20:08 <@EastByte> I wonder if you are pulling people from reddit^^
20:08 <@deen> what do you mean?
20:09 <@EastByte> that's not a comment you usually read on hn
20:09 <@deen> Yeahyeah, HN is going down, becoming the next reddit, etc
20:10 <@EastByte> :p
20:11 < xRoThx> Hello
20:11 <@EastByte> hi
20:12 < xRoThx> What did I miss the last months? 
20:12 < xRoThx> ^^
20:12 < xRoThx> I hear some people complaining about lags? :/
20:14 <@deen> xRoThx: yes, but seems to be over
20:14 <@deen> hi
20:14 <@deen> GER seems to be running great now, so I stopped GER2 for now
20:26 < xRoThx> We should do something special ? 
20:27 < xRoThx> for the 6months stable server GER? :)
20:28 <@deen> heh
20:28 <@deen> I don't know, I'm just happy it works
20:28 <@EastByte> not taking it down would be great
20:39 < xRoThx> I won't
20:40 < xRoThx> Isn't that much for me, but it means a lot for many people, so, I m happy to help :)
20:40 <@deen> Yeah, it would be much for me^^
20:41 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/stats/807.png
20:41 <@deen> To see how nicely full the server was
20:45 < xRoThx> Nice :) 
20:45 < xRoThx> Love to see that
20:45 < xRoThx> I often get emails from attacks
20:50 <@deen> oh?
20:50 <@deen> they still happen?
20:50 <@deen> Would be cool if you could forward those emails to deen@ddnet.tw
20:50 <@deen> I don't have any information about whether an attack is ongoing or not
20:51 < xRoThx> Will try to think about it every time :)
20:51 <@deen> Hm, too bad it can't be automated
20:51 < xRoThx> gmail :)
20:51 < xRoThx> it could
20:52 < xRoThx> if I would make special email adress for that
21:07 < eeeee> ImJustAskinDude: sup
21:08 < eeeee> y u wanna do bombing? are you the usa?
21:16 <@EastByte> eeeeew
21:46 < seymour_> another nim post on hn >.>
21:47 <@EastByte> what's so >.> about it ? :D
21:51 < seymour_> no its cool but its only been a few days since the last one XD
22:46 < savander> eeeee: How long you are waiting for activation of the account on AWS? :)
23:01 < eeeee> huh
23:01 < eeeee> dunno
23:01 < eeeee> don't think i waited, probably was instantly available
23:03 < eeeee> i registered a couple years ago though, maybe that've changed. but amazon isn't some small shitty one-man hoster, everything should work instantly there i guess.
23:03 < eeeee> savander: ^
23:03 < savander> 24 hours gone, and i still don't have :D.
23:04 < eeeee> what do they say?
23:04 < savander> Nothign
23:04 < savander> card added.
23:04 < eeeee> then how do you know it's not activated?
23:04 < savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/PrEUvk2P8620
23:05 < eeeee> hmm, that's weird
23:08 < savander> yup.
23:17 < ImJustAskinDude> oy doodles, how come you hate reddit so much ? just interested
23:22 <@deen> huh?
23:25 < ImJustAskinDude> why do you dislike reddit ?
23:25 <@deen> I didn't know I do
23:25 <@deen> Why do you think so?
23:25 < ImJustAskinDude> a hunch
23:25 < ImJustAskinDude> based on this
23:25 < ImJustAskinDude> [20:09] <@deen> Yeahyeah, HN is going down, becoming the next reddit, etc
23:26 <@deen> That's just paraphrased from https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html
23:26 <@deen> "If your account is less than a year old, please don't submit comments saying that HN is turning into Reddit. It's a common semi-noob illusion, as old as the hills."
23:27 < ImJustAskinDude> uuuki dookie, but that also implies, that reddit is lesser, do you know why ?
23:29 <@deen> Some modern form of Eternal September, where too many new people flow in and the quality of comments goes down: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September
23:30 < eeeee> same thing is happening with this chan, totally turning into reddit with all these noobs like ImJustAskinDude flowing in
23:30 <@deen> Let's make it invite only, like the next HN (lobste.rs)
23:30 < eeeee> :P
23:32 <@deen> Also why there are noob filters on DDRace maps
23:35 < eeeee> noob filters are teh shit, i don't usually have patience to race the whole map so i only race noob filters
23:35 < ImJustAskinDude> so to tally it up, the hype for "ima big boy nou, me no lik reddit animoar, i us X" just calls for a cleaner page, that doesn't involve pointless posts about pointless shit
23:36 < eeeee> y u keep calling websites "page"s?
23:36 < ImJustAskinDude> cool cool, i don't really get the superiority of that, but whatevs
23:36 < ImJustAskinDude> cause im hardcore, dad
23:37 < eeeee> son, i'm disappoint
23:37 < ImJustAskinDude> we were not talking for 15 years now, and that's what you have to say to me ? im disappoint more
23:38 < eeeee> no i
23:46 < ImJustAskingDad> im disapoointmentsorry
23:53 < savander> grrr
23:54 < savander> i don't like VirtualBox
23:54 < savander> xD
23:54 < fstd> xDDD
23:54 < savander> i always have trouble with this fucking resolutions XD
23:54 < savander> Virtualbox Guest Install doesn't exists for debian 8
23:54 < savander> YEA
23:54 < savander> XDDDD
23:54 < fstd> XDDDDDDDDD
23:54 < fstd> so funi
23:55 < savander> i have installed archlinux
23:55 < savander> with everything
23:55 < savander> but debian 8, NOPE
23:55 < savander> YOU CAN"T
23:55 < Learath2> you can 
23:55 < fstd> what are you gibbering about?
23:55 < savander> im to noobdy
23:55 < fstd> s/ob/bo/
23:55 < savander> don't know how to install video drivers properly
23:56 < Learath2> omg deen how did you become a user of the 1337 community of Lobste.rs
23:56 < savander> fuck it, i'll do it tomorrow :c...
23:56 < savander> fstd:  i'm just raging.
23:57 < fstd> savander: dunno what's the current preferred debian way to do that, but it will boil down to modprobe(8)
23:58 < savander> modprobe == modules in kernel??
23:58 < savander> first time i heard about it today... when i installed arch xD
23:58 < fstd> yes, most drivers are kernel modules
23:59 < fstd> although Xorg has its own driver infrastructure, not sure how that fits in
23:59  * fstd usually doesn't bother with proprietary video drivers
23:59 < savander> https://wiki.debian.org/VirtualBox#Debian_8_.22Jessie.22
23:59 < savander> o.O
