00:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @Scrumplex again new launcher?
00:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How many rebrands and forks does it need watafak
00:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> what new launcher
00:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://youtu.be/FyS8ELbafN0?si=qKDdtkubgBebly2S
00:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Our boi scrumplex is being called by name at 6:28
00:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> One of our more famous contributors hehe being GitHub showcased in a 25k clicked video o.0
01:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ur outdated
01:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> prism is the norm since long
01:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> he will not be stopped, he reworked his skin proxy into rust aswell!
01:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> he will not be stopped
01:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @ryozuki: yea was like years ago I see. I am still kinda half way in the process updating from MultiMC to PolyMC haha
01:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Seems like I can skip straight to prism
01:22 < bridge> <louis> foss minecraft launcher community seems like such an esoteric community
03:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> quick ques. rust can have memory leak right? like in GC languages where you holds references unintentionally.
03:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://youtube.com/watch?v=-KE3HRgdETs&si=4UKzG_SQFnBYxFEJ
03:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @ryozuki
03:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/gamedolphin/unrust bevy inside unity
04:07 < bridge> <tela> Big sur lol. I update like once every 5 years when I'm forced to
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> ok u got a little while still lol
08:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It can leak, but only if you can it explicitly or if two shared references store a strong reference to each other
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats the point
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to use bevy renderer
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> etc
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt watch the video sry
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only read blogs
11:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
11:22 < ChillerDragon> im too stoopid to debug other peoples code. I wanna see what http calls some random ass script does when i run it on my system 
11:22 < ChillerDragon> wireshak refuses to help because https hides all the interesting info
11:22 < ChillerDragon> is there some LDPRELOAD i can set that just prints some debug info for tcp or better even just http
12:06 < ChillerDragon> found the bug. I blame microsoft for it!
12:07 < ChillerDragon> but still would be interested in some http debugger its a recorring theme that i want to see which api calls some program does that i run
12:07 < ChillerDragon> recorring
12:07 < ChillerDragon> chiler typing be like
12:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> tip: dont use microsoft products like windows
12:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks good tip
12:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> BTW I wasn‚Äôt
12:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I was using ms vscode js lib
16:01 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> hello were there any changes to antiping? Feels different in 17.4.2(commit c0ed140)
17:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @nuborn: ^
19:57 < bridge> <nuborn> Can't think of anything, but also haven't played in a couple of weeks, so not sure
20:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what will happen if you change the gamecore.cpp content and make a server  ?
20:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> does the server feel buggy for other people ?
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on the change you made
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> the prediction code baked into the client is mostly for ddrace
20:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs why the moving freeze in kog feels laggy, or any sort of custom entity behavior like in f-ddrace
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be cool if you could communicate a per-entity type ‚Äúprediction scheme‚Äù from server to client and the client could use the scheme to predict said entity type
21:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so the only bug prone is prediction stuff, am i right ?
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> things that have to be predicted yea
21:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i changed some friction in the gamecore.cpp and made a server with it, the server was unplayable with default client üôÇ
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah that would do it
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> client has no idea of this
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> when you press d to move right before you get a response from the server accounting for you moving right, the game has to fill the gap on what's happening based on what it does know about the game
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it knows that you're holding d to move and it knows the friction of the default physics so unless you're somehow able to change the prediction on the client to use the new friction then there'll be a discrepancy
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it would probably manifest as tiny rubberbanding incidents
21:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there a way to scheme a prediction list for the client on server side ?
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> no
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> prediction is mostly hardcoded
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl get around this by making custom clients like f-client (even tho it has the same physics, iirc it can predict the changes in entity behavior)
21:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to implement jetpack boost for every kill the player gets in my block sv what is the best options ?
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> u can turn antiping off
21:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i do that but wont work
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it's not a real solution
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> any physics change is gonna freak the client out
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing u can do baout it except propose a more modular solution like the one i described
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> as i recall though you are new to cpp and coding in general so i would not try that üòÉ
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> you'd also have to know a fair amount about network code
21:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yeah, but i don't wanna make custom client anytime anyway
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's sounds like scam or something :justatest:
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i would not download a custom client to play on someone's server
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> most ppl probably wouldnt
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> if u play fng u can notice that the hammers are weird sometimes for this reason
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> the hammer velocity delta is exaggerated in fng and the client doesnt know
21:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but there is a tune that you can change the strength of the jetpack, can i work around that to make it specific for individual players ?
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> also merry christmas germans
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> and merry christmas eve to the rest
21:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> europeans*
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i think uk is 25th as well tho
21:12 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Unfortunately the Tune is global. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7288
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> so just like some europeans
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> is it spain as well?
21:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> for germans its still 24
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> its 24 here too
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> no i mean
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> germans celebrate christmas on the 24th
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> everyone else on the 25th
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> everyone does christmas eve
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> that's what jup told me
21:14 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if the per_character was the thing i wouldn't need to learn c++  üòÇ
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> xd

21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> sry for the ping i tried to @silent it but u have to do it at the start of ur msg
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> dont let me interrupt ur christmas üòÉ
21:23 < bridge> <chairn> no, french people do it on 24th too
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
21:29 < bridge> <furo321> What's with the hurry? Be patient, not everyone has time to respond 24/7.
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt expect him to respond right now
21:29 < bridge> <furo321> but if you have nothing to do, you can squash your commits.
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> why bother
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> they all get squashed when they are merged
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs one extra button
21:30 < bridge> <furo321> They don't.
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> do they not have squash merging on
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> No, the merge queue doesn't do that
21:32 < bridge> <robyt3> And I agree, the commits should be squashed when you are done
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Archaic policy
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> is it not on by default?
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests>
21:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Squash isn't possible with merge queue right now I guess: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/14818
21:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Not every merge should squash commits
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> this one should
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> and that policy is not configuring it to be the default, it's allowing the behavior
21:36 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It should not be ON or OFF by default, as some commits should not be squashed. The rule of "one PR -> one squashed commit" is a no-go üòÑ
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> well it links to the pr in the commit name by default so it's not like it's hard to see the full revision history
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> commit becomes "pr name (#x"
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> commit becomes "pr name (#x)"
21:38 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not the point. Tools like git blame and git bisect work with commits. Sometimes PRs have multiple commits to separate different independent changes.
21:39 < bridge> <Ewan> ok so what you are saying is squashing commits is bad
21:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but you want me to squash my commits
21:39 < bridge> <robyt3> No, I fully agree with @kaffeine0
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what he is trying to say
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> obviously it's situational
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i never said every single pr should have its commits merged
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, and in case of your PR it adds exactly one feature so it should be one commit
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yes and there is exactly one github feature for that...
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> It's not?
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> There's not way to squash or do anything else except a normal merge with this button
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1188582228414976040/image.png?ex=659b0c76&is=65889776&hm=dd4f782ae6c6a08edbf40d741dfa48284337f8cb962c1127e4f16bd550ed94fb&
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> There's no way to squash or do anything else except a normal merge with this button
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1188582228414976040/image.png?ex=659b0c76&is=65889776&hm=dd4f782ae6c6a08edbf40d741dfa48284337f8cb962c1127e4f16bd550ed94fb&
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> had to make a new repo and update my laptop access token for this üòÜ
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1188583569019379763/image.png?ex=659b0db5&is=658898b5&hm=9063331999f823848eb8375d619d75f4a9c19778d0f4bbf1e1a0f505349dc981&
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it;s been allowed by default as long as i have used github
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess the repo is too old or it's been manually disallowed
21:47 < bridge> <robyt3> As I says already, we are using the merge queue, which as of now does not support squashing
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> but it seems to be compatible with merge queue
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> the issue you linked is just ppl saying the name of the pr commit is wrong. and later saying it's been fixed
21:48 < bridge> <robyt3> You are not using the merge queue in this screenshot?
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a new feature
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i havent used the merge ueue
21:49 < bridge> <robyt3> The issue is about some GitHub beta so I assume that merge queue will get squash feature at some point but we don't opt-in to beta features
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
21:50 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway i sympathize with your inability to use this feature but many people use it and it's sort of standard to expect the merging maintainer to choose whether to squash or not with their own discretion
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> merge queue is newer than the squash thing
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah it doesnt support it
21:56 < bridge> <archimede67> I'm sorry but every dev here always squashed their commits when asked to do so. And I think you should follow that behavior too instead of just comparing to "many people". And I agree with @furo321, your PRs aren't the only ones, there are many other PRs to look at so just be patient.
21:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i squashed it
21:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i just think it's funny that they can't
21:58 < bridge> <archimede67> I don't get what's funny, we ask you to squash your commits yet you argue. What's the reason?
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what u are arguing for
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i just think it's funny
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it is humorous to me
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> that he can't squash them without manually checking out the pr and squashing like a caveman
21:58 < bridge> <learath2> Let's relax. It's just a squash, no need to fight over it
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i messed something up
22:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you squash the entire project? :kek:
22:00 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1188587014900158485/image.png?ex=659b10eb&is=65889beb&hm=32eeb62d3154dd7546b874638bbd12007f429cb9cf3a6580c9e818b702adf9fb&
22:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Time for `git reflog` I guess
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> shhh
22:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess it's time to google it
22:01 < bridge> <Ewan> my git knowledge has failed me
22:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Github shows you the commit before you force pushes, so you could reset to that
22:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
22:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just had to git rebase -i <initial commit here>
22:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> and fixup all but first
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> my problem was that i was using master as a reference for which commits not to squash but my master is old tclient
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i didnt do upstream master
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> `git revase -i upstream/master`
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> revase
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u want a vase?
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> `git rebase -i upstream/master`
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> cant hide it now!
22:05 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > it's sort of standard to expect the merging maintainer to choose whether to squash or not with their own discretion
22:05 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Making good (e.g. atomic, self-descriptive, complete) commits is a sort of respecting the reviewers and all the other developers who 'll have to read and comprehend your changes.
22:05 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Do proper commits and then let the maintainer to decide if it still does worth it to squash them (typically it does not).
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> this does not align with my development style
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> git commit -m"ok"
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> that's what i do
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> git commit -am fuck
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> not uncommon
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> u sound american, i do this and my way is better
22:06 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Sounds like "inability" to make proper commits.
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its sensible to adapt to the project
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> call it what you want
22:07 < bridge> <archimede67> "my"
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do ur nameless commits and before pushing the final pr
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> edit and squash em
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> the comment
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> a feature is better in 1 commit alone most of the time anyway
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes i amend but i dont like force pushing
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> so i'd have to refrain from pushing to revise my commit
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> which defeats the point
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway it's rly funny seeing everyone so salty over the way i use git
22:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> force pushing should be norm in prs
22:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> specialy for cleanup
22:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its how i see it
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> makes sense
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i usually do not have to deal with this you see
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> because
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> the maintainer can squash
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes i ask them to squash
22:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :justatest:
22:13 < bridge> <archimede67> We don't care how you use git, only when you contribute to the project you should follow the guidelines.
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> what guidelines asshole
22:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft cmon
22:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:14 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :justatest: :justatest: :justatest: :justatest:
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i read the page
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i do things as they are meant to be done
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont see what guideline i am disobeying
22:14 < bridge> <archimede67> What @robyt3 just told you, instead of complaining and telling "just press the button they'll get squashed"
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i already said i (tried to) squash it
22:15 < bridge> <archimede67> And yeah go ahead and insult me, why not
22:15 < bridge> <scrumplex> ChillerDragon: All your TeeWorlds mods are belong to us >:)
22:16 < bridge> <scrumplex> ChillerDragon: All your Teeworlds mods are belong to us >:)
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i do not appreciate your attitude much considering (a). i don't know who you are and (b). i'm doing my best to contribute to ddnet in an orderly and professional fashion and you continue to tell me things i already know and cherry pick parts of my phrasing you don't like
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> you are an asshole
22:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> guys if this in any way gets personal i would draw a line from both sides, come on its christmas time!
22:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im in on your side c: all my mods are open source. Including graphic svg files. Server settings. Map update discussions. And infrastructure scripts.
22:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> when's your tier 5 aimbot open source then?
22:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> good
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> all my mods too
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> teesmash for everyone
22:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :poggers2:
22:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have chillerbot-zx which is chillerbot-ux plus some features that would potentially cause harm if abused in public hands
22:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So I keep it private
22:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But it‚Äôs not much. I am not sure if I get life banned if I further explain what I kept closed source xD
22:19 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> nah you wont get banned, they'll just drop bridge support üôÇ

22:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs mostly automated movements. And I actively use it on servers where admins granted me permissions
22:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @scrumplex: I just pinged you here like 2 days ago because I saw you on YouTube!!! Did you see that ping?
22:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> uh nope :O
22:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe I failed to ping
22:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> I don't check IRC often üëÄ

22:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> famous scrump scrump! - also yes chiller you failed to ping
22:22 < scrumplex_> Hello
22:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ur on irc?
22:22 < scrumplex> Wait
22:22 < ChillerDragon> wot
22:22 < ChillerDragon> i tried to ping ur discord
22:22 < ChillerDragon> i did @Scrumplex
22:22 < ChillerDragon> where were you chetting from just now?
22:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1703452959_ubeeV7.png

22:22 < ChillerDragon> dude own image hosting?
22:22 < ChillerDragon> cring
22:23 < scrumplex> lol
22:23 < scrumplex> What if I told you that it was written in Rust? Does that make it better?
22:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> every time he sents a screenshot he flexes with it i swear
22:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> you should see him livestream :justatest:

22:24 < scrumplex> @scrumplex
22:24 < ChillerDragon> @scrumplex
22:24 < ChillerDragon> did it work?
22:24 < scrumplex> I think the WebHook just doesn't allow pings
22:24 < ChillerDragon> it does
22:24 < scrumplex> yup those worked
22:24 < ChillerDragon> so lowercase

22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> when ddnet drama so we become famous and get yt vids done about the drama
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> they should document
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> the 0.6 vs 0.7 dev wars
22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> the neverending account discussion
22:30 < ws-client> <chiler> @Scrumplex its basically fake discord frontend for irc xd 
22:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> omg make it a full movie
22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> "how devs cant change even the tiniest of physics in the game"

22:30 < ws-client> <chiler> come to #off-topic
22:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> "how devs are concerned about the potential backlash associated with accounts while overlooking the benefits they bring"

22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i will squash the rest later
22:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> "the eternal rust holy church and the war in dev"
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> going to church to witness a divine reenactment of the nativity scene by rich church ppl
22:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> speaking of rust, anyone heard smth about voxel?
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> no he‚Äôs gone man
22:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :feelsbadman:
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it‚Äôs hard to tell
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> cultural differences in sense of humor + barrier of a non-native English speaker + the implicit loss of tone in text
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> made it seem like the rust preaching was just to piss him off
22:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think our english is at a low level where there is a barrier
22:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> its more his personality
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> that too
22:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> im mostly joking but i sometimes take it too far, i guess taking it that far is where i find it funny xd
22:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> that said, rust > c++
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
22:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> üòÉ

22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol just do it
22:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i will make it coca cola certified americanized santa claus log
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> it makes kids more involved
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> as in
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> the kids give food to the log
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> at night
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> then (parents eat it when they sleep lol)
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it looks like u feeding it
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it gives u presents
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> we do that for santa
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> but he gives us the presents anyway
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should get coal
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur a cpp devg
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> üò¨
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> rude
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you can get a big old bag of iron oxide
22:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> the memory safety santa is mad
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> since u love rust so much
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> make some thermite
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> destroy your home
22:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
22:50 < bridge> <Ewan> then write a book about it called highly effective rust
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm not religious but i appreciate what the church does ( in the usa )
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> the good ones are more of a social zone and a charity than a temple
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> mega churches and everyone involved with them can burn in hell tho
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> but they seem mostly harmless
23:00 < bridge> <Ewan> just stupid
23:05 < ChillerDragon> u guys cant be serious
23:05 < ChillerDragon> voxel was actually offended by ppl talking about rust?
23:05 < ChillerDragon> i did not see that happen
23:05 < ChillerDragon> why would he even care xd i dont belive that
23:06 < ChillerDragon> its not like while praising rust someone was shitting on something voxel was emtionally attached to
23:06 < ChillerDragon> the only thing we bullied him with is that he will be replaced by AI
23:07 < bridge> <learath2> Atleast that's when he quit. Ryozuki said sth about rust and voxel wasnt having any more of it
23:07 < ChillerDragon> woah
23:07 < ChillerDragon> as in he left the discord?
23:08 < ChillerDragon> or what even happend
23:08 < bridge> <cipy29> He left life (rip)
23:08 < bridge> <cipy29> Rust proves to actually be quite unsafe afterall
23:09 < ChillerDragon> too dark
23:09 < ChillerDragon> suicide jokes on christmas xd
23:10 < ChillerDragon> i hope it is a joke i honestly dk wat happend to voxel
23:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> he left after my message: 
23:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1186754133215154227
