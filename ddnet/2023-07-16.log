01:39 < bridge_> <Iza> this is kinda ironic to me, as I've seen you using upwards of 4 ddnet connections to one server a few times
01:39 < bridge_> <Iza> talking about blocking slots
01:40 < bridge_> <Iza> I can just hope this is some joke
02:45 < bridge_> <Alice Mattielo> Hi there!!
02:45 < bridge_> <Alice Mattielo> my name is Alica mattielo 
02:45 < bridge_> <Alice Mattielo> how are you doing today, and how is everything going over there and your family,I am from Liverpool UK, though the situation in here isn't friendly, we are dealing with tyrant governments.¬† How is your year going off ?
06:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> Omg a real person
09:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> The server wasn‚Äôt full there were always enough slots left
09:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@wvvv)
09:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Im used to GitHub. It works nice to sync across all my devices and I am already authenticated anyways.

11:07 < ChillerDragon> omg im this close to downgrading to debian 11
11:08 < ChillerDragon> using touchpad moves the in game cursor only 50% of the time in debian 12 any other ideas than downgrading?
11:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy mouse
11:10 < ChillerDragon> that indeed is a good alternative to touchpad
11:10 < ChillerDragon> but im touchpad gamer when on laptop :D
11:10 < ChillerDragon> just so annoying to travel with mouse also often there is no space for a mouse anyways
11:11 < ChillerDragon> i should switch to keyboard only gaming mouse always making trouble
11:11 < ChillerDragon> can we add aim assist to ddnet for keyboard only players?
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can we add move assist for mouse only players
11:12 < ChillerDragon> :D 
11:12 < ChillerDragon> mouse only players lmao
11:13 < ChillerDragon> thing is you can move way better with mouse than aim with keyboard
11:14 < ChillerDragon> maybe i just need a few angle binds on my laptop its not like im doing ESL gaming from ma hotspot in some cafe
11:14 < ChillerDragon> eventho i did pretty well in a gctf tourney once axaxax
11:15 < ChillerDragon> jopsti wanna hear latest 0.7 dev progress?
11:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure, please post a very detailed list
11:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast 20000 sites
11:15 < ChillerDragon> currently the client whispers its timeout code to a random person on the server on connect
11:15 < ChillerDragon> :D
11:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds good enough
11:16 < ChillerDragon> however i managed to bug that
11:16 < ChillerDragon> i will fix it today because its 0.7 weekend
11:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wish you best of luck

11:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this is likely a side effect of enabling rebase-merge. I can turn it back to merge-merge
12:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, that would be easier, although the history isn't as readable in that case
12:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 thanks! https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6861
12:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> changed it to merge-merge
12:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> Thanks, that should make my script work much easier again, the workaround (`git range-diff --left-only PR-Branch...master` for every individual branch) would have made it much slower
12:07 < ChillerDragon> wot script
12:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Uses `git branch --merged` to get all local merged branches and then deletes them automatically, and uses `git remote prune origin` to prune references to deleted remote branches.
12:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> And updates my fork's master to upstream's master
12:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I have a weird liking for the rebase merge üòÑ
12:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure why the non-linear history bothers me ^^ but I see no actual benefit of the linear history, so whatever

12:55 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Does anyone have some advice on how to format the changes of the current branch? Previously I just formatted before every commit, but somehow my editor does not format only modified lines anymore.
12:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> are you using the scripts/fix_style.py script?
12:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that one should format it just like in CI
12:57 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I tried but it formatted everything. Let me try it again
12:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but in the rest of the code, it shouldn't format anything, as it *already is* formatted
13:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> The issue is if you have a newer clang-format version it will start using a different format for comments (adding one space after every `//`)
13:00 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Oh was about to ask if that may cause problems, I was using clang-format-17
13:01 < bridge_> <robyt3> Are you on Windows using Visual Studio?
13:01 < bridge_> <marmare_314> No debian
13:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> scripts/fix_style.py should verify the clang-format version
13:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> before executing it
13:02 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Is there not an option to set the commet-style? Otherwise I will have to figure out where to get clang-format-10
13:03 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Yes it does, but I changed it üòÑ
13:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I mean you might wanna stop hitting yourself üòÑ
13:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-tools-static-binaries
13:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can get the right clang-format version here ^
13:10 < bridge_> <marmare_314> There is `SpacesInLineCommentPrefix`, but only from version 13 on. Does it throw errors on unknown options?
13:14 < bridge_> <robyt3> At the moment it probably will, unless we are using this flag https://reviews.llvm.org/D86137

13:35 < ChillerDragon> windows moment
13:35 < ChillerDragon> do you have rust installed?
13:37 < bridge_> <shahriar_ghanbari> I don't think I have installed it
13:38 < bridge_> <shahriar_ghanbari> How should I install?
13:41 < bridge_> <learath2> Can you believe tokio still doesn't have a condition variable?
13:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://rustup.rs/
13:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Imagine living in 2023 and not being able to use a condition variable
13:45 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't even know what really replaces it but just polling on an atomic with exponential backoff
13:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can you use a semaphore maybe?
13:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure what exactly a condition variable is, sorry
13:47 < bridge_> <learath2> You don't know what a `pthread_cond_t` is?
13:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> correct
13:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes, but it's a fairly delicate process coding one out of the other
13:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> condition variable supports the following? waiting to be signalled
13:48 < bridge_> <learath2> http://birrell.org/andrew/papers/ImplementingCVs.pdf thankfully it's documented
13:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can at most one thread that's waiting be signalled?
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > ‚ÄúCondition Variable‚Äù with operations Wait, Signal and Broadcast
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what are these three operations?
13:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Condition variables allow you to wait on a "condition", when you wake up you are guaranteed to be holding a mutex
13:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah
13:50 < bridge_> <learath2> The condition is over a shared variable that is protected by said mutex
13:50 < bridge_> <shahriar_ghanbari> I have installed rust but I am still facing the previous error
13:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's basically a mutex with wait function?
13:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Mutex with conditional wait
13:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can you open a terminal an execute `rustup default stable`?
13:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> where does the "condition" come from?
13:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the "condition" is the other thread signalling the mutex?
13:52 < bridge_> <learath2> No it's like an actual predicate, when you modify the shared variable changing the predicated you drop the mutex and signal the condvar
13:52 < bridge_> <shahriar_ghanbari> Yes
13:52 < bridge_> <learath2> If there is anyone is waiting, they will be woken up and they will be guaranteed to have the mutex when they do
13:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so you can additionally specify a condition that is checked whenever someone releases the mutex?
13:53 < bridge_> <learath2> s\/predicated/predicate/
13:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's the output of that? does it work afterwards?
13:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Whenever someone releases the mutex AND signals the condvar, so a change in predicate is not guaranteed to wake you up
13:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> wait, so someone releases the mutex AND signals the condvar AND your user-provided condition changed?
13:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Anyway, the desired behaviour is to wake someone up on changes, you just need to follow a protocol
13:55 < bridge_> <learath2> If someone is changing the condition, they need to first be holding the mutex, then when they are done changing, they drop the mutex and signal the condvar
13:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I see
13:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but the condition is only checked on the thread that's waiting?
13:56 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes, (or threads in case of `Broadcast`)
13:56 < bridge_> <learath2> There are also spurious wakeups, so you have to check the condition, even if the signaller had checked it before
13:56 < bridge_> <learath2> It's not the most ideal but it's the only way I know of waiting on a change in a variable without polling
13:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @learath2 can you simply use a `std::sync::Mutex` and `std::sync::Condvar`?
13:57 < bridge_> <learath2> I think that'd pause the entire thread then none of the other async stuff could progress
13:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, true, condvar doesn't work
13:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> mb
13:57 < bridge_> <learath2> Maybe I could steal a thread from tokio for this one process actually
13:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (standard mutex would)
13:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is there a reason you need this atomic being-signalled-and-taking the lock?
13:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Does it? Wouldn't a standard `std::sync::Mutex::wait()` block the entire thread?
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant u use channels
13:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you could use a broadcast channel to signal change and take the mutex manually
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> XY problem?
13:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, it would, but it's kind of desired AFAI: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html
13:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, it would, but it's kind of desired AFAIK: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html
13:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Contrary to popular belief, it is ok and often preferred to use the ordinary Mutex from the standard library in asynchronous code.
13:59 < bridge_> <learath2> It's the only non-polling way of waiting on a condition I know that doesn't require kernel functionality, futex/WaitOnAddress
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye it is explained somewhere
14:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> broadcast channel
14:00 < bridge_> <learath2> Doesn't handle the case of a waiter missing the signal
14:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what does that mean
14:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have a receiver, take the lock, check the value, release the lock, then wait for the broadcast signal
14:01 < bridge_> <learath2> If I start waiting on a change message on the channel right after one went through I'm stuck forever
14:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> i.e. you need to have the receiver beforehand
14:01 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess that is a reasonable compromise
14:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd also be interested in what you want to achieve in a big picture
14:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd also be interested in what you want to achieve in a bigger picture
14:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the issue with cond vars is task cancelattion iirc
14:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Something absolutely trivial as always, I just want to properly terminate my program in a sane way
14:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> doesnt tokio provide that
14:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/signal/index.html
14:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> depending on how many people need to listen, a broadcast channel or a oneshot channel seem appropriate
14:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tokio.rs/tokio/topics/shutdown
14:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/sync/struct.CancellationToken.html
14:04 < bridge_> <learath2> This is how my main thread is waiting on the ctrl_c
14:05 < bridge_> <learath2> This is what I was looking for, I guess in this case it replaces a condvar
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 look the blog post i sent too
14:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it shows the cancel token
14:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130108096010797147/image.png
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> I was going for a broadcast channel, but I was having trouble making sure everyone properly got the signal. It seems `CancellationToken` has my desired behaviour of immediately returning when the task is already cancelled
14:16 < bridge_> <learath2> Spurious wakeups are allowed for condvars, that's a perfect way to work in cancellation
14:53 < bridge_> <smetanolub> Idk I just played with dummy on multieasy

15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess so
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they got quite expensive since the war :/
15:26 < ChillerDragon> where can i do that?

15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well depends
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do u want to have for that in exchange?
15:28 < ChillerDragon> anything
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like a vPS or root server
15:28 < ChillerDragon> i take either
15:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> root server is a german word
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well try it out
15:29 < ChillerDragon> jopsti ban
15:29 < ChillerDragon> for using german
15:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think server hosters have abused it so much that it doesn't mean anything anymore
15:29 < ChillerDragon> are there even 1euro root servers? :D
15:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you might mean dedicated server, but hosters also use that word for VPS
15:29 < ChillerDragon> i though root means dedicated and starts from 40 euros 
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well its not truely dedicated
15:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they only guarantee the core is fully yours while u use it

16:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130139500450955367/image.png
16:11 < bridge_> <matodor> renders only specified tile numbers?
16:11 < bridge_> <matodor> yes its enabled
16:11 < bridge_> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130139609326694562/image.png
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> entities mlife?
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if these also change some internal mode, but i guess the editor drops the tiles as invalid?
16:12 < bridge_> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130139884707905586/image.png
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3
16:12 < bridge_> <matodor> > renders only specified tile numbers?
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well apparently yes
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dunno if thats indented
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> intended
16:13 < bridge_> <matodor> but its render switch number and delay index
16:13 < bridge_> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130140160223346868/image.png
16:13 < bridge_> <matodor> without image from tileset
16:14 < bridge_> <matodor> strange behavior)
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah that is what u mean i understand
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the tiles are there but not rendered is your complain
16:14 < bridge_> <matodor> and stops rendering after saving the map and loading
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah weird
16:16 < bridge_> <matodor> front layer work correctly
16:18 < ChillerDragon> lmao clickbait yter on ddnet frontage xd
16:18 < ChillerDragon> didnt expect to ever see such thumbnails on a tw video xxxxxxxxxxD
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it say its semi clickbait üòÑ
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://youtu.be/typCY28F214?t=129
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: here u can see the tiles are actually gone
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> physics wise
16:23 < ChillerDragon> maybe clickbait is the wrong wording
16:23 < ChillerDragon> the concept of removing tiles to mimic world record it self is mainstream youtube strat
16:23 < ChillerDragon> i mean the font etc
16:23 < ChillerDragon> the red arrow
16:24 < ChillerDragon> the white outline on the tees
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is clickbait for u? XD
16:24 < ChillerDragon> as i said clickbait might be the wrong word
16:24 < ChillerDragon> more like mainstream youtube tryhard shit
16:24 < ChillerDragon> only thing missing is him saying pls turn on the bell
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i think i seen that before
16:24 < ChillerDragon> in tw?
16:24 < ChillerDragon> i didnt
16:25 < ChillerDragon> i dont rember seeing it
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i couldnt tell for sure, but i guess there was
16:25 < ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp4wXgS3uO4
16:25 < ChillerDragon> there is this
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that guy does it in every video xD
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDDDDDd
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought its 3d game
16:27 < ChillerDragon> yea idk something about this style really triggers me
16:27 < ChillerDragon> its used by all the shallow yters
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQdhY0fFz70
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDDDDDD
16:27 < ChillerDragon> that have zero content and passion they only produce to produce and to generate views not because they care about content
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> from shyzo, whom else
16:27 < ChillerDragon> yea xd touche
16:28 < ChillerDragon> but i gotta say Gazebr perfected it more
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tru
16:28 < ChillerDragon> shyzos looks way more like a tw yter
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its funny how thumnails differ
16:28 < ChillerDragon> being inspired by watch yt
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> beautemps puts bloom on max xD
16:29 < ChillerDragon> shyzo makes runs cuz he likes gores
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130144084527419442/image.png
16:29 < ChillerDragon> then he decides to share those runs
16:29 < ChillerDragon> and with Gazebr it feels more like he couldnt care less and just thought of a concept that will be clicked
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> crack does art contests in his thumbnails xD
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1130144262575632436/image.png
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rqza is lazy af
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he doesnt even creates thumbnails
16:30 < bridge_> <matodor> @jupeyy_keks "allow unused" not working after map reloaded
16:30 < bridge_> <matodor> i mean tiles not rendering)
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah report it as bug
16:31 < ChillerDragon> but ye its a nice video and Gazebr has good quality i should stop hating
16:31 < ChillerDragon> the style is just posioned by some money farmers with ai content
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon lmao no need to have midlife crisis now
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why kog
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> üòÆ‚Äçüí®
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it my fault that only kog hosts gores xd
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet clearly isnt interested
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks lets make a network
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> RustNet
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> GGnetwork
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ggoresnetwork
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's nice that we have a couple of independent networks. you making your own would be appreciated
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont want to spent so muhc money
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we have ddnet and unique which are open source, then kog which is closed
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet has good ecosystem
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd prefer to use its
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we can just ask for donations, in a clear transparent way
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im sure many ppl would be interested in a kog alt
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a few for sure
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but most probably simply dont care
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and creating a new community isnt ez
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> would be cool if something new appears
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not gores i mean
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tee smash network
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
16:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw whats nice about it xd
16:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you prefer to have closed networks over ours? or simply bcs of maintaince?
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if ddnet is open to host _any_ open source mod its attractive too imho
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like the wario mod thing
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was popular for like 2 days xd
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs deen announced it etc
16:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's nice that we don't have a single point of failure, that people can e.g. search for the community they want. that not everything goes through the same people, e.g. me being a discord moderator here, but people can also chat elsewhere. that new features can be tested independently of ddnet, e.g. the accounts thing. better bot protection
16:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh very awesome, if u dont play gores u like it
16:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I play gores
16:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Rank 4981. with 262 points"
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u play it indeed
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but 200 points is also not a lot
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then let me rephrase: you dont take gores very serious
16:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most points were made 2 years ago
16:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.org/players/heinrich5991/
16:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> most points were probably made 2 years ago
16:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or even earlier
16:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I find it kinda bad that you go to people's profiles to tell them "no, you don't actually like xy"
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i'd not say you are part of the kog community just bcs u played a bit of gores 2 years ago lmao
16:44 < ChillerDragon> point shaming axaxax
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i basically know all ppl there and played with them, were VC with them
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDDDDDDDDD
16:44 < ChillerDragon> never saw u in gores jopsti
16:44 < ChillerDragon> random
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i even played with u
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
16:45 < ChillerDragon> e
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> back when u had ur spin bot xDD
16:45 < ChillerDragon> under wat name
16:45 < ChillerDragon> watf
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> too many to remember
16:45 < ChillerDragon> i never
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: i remember there was a time where chiller was a famous prefix among many ppl xD
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what happened to your fanbase
16:50 < ChillerDragon> it didnt notice any reduce
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh true chiller has fans
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> honestly if ddos wasnt such a deterrent i might consider making a network
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe with the servers the davide guy shared its doable
16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rust based infrastructure, without docker or kubernetes
16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> psql database instead of mysql
16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no python 2 scripts
16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no hardcoded paths
16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> AGPL license
16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the dream
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i agree with most stuff
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. no python 2 scripts => no python at all
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> agpl would have prevented kog closed source
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i doubt u could sue them
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs nobody cares
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can talk to the FSF
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and they can bring lawyers
16:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think the FSF is comitted to defend free software in court
16:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably not necessary
16:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you license under agpl, people will probably not make closed-source forks in the first place
16:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh sure xD
16:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet u could go to any random company and find legal issue within them bcs they use software in a way that is not legal in the way the software defines its legal usage
17:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> oh, I think it prevents a closed-source serverside antibot btw ^^
17:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have no problem with that
17:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i cant relicense my fork of tw under agpl i think
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki give up on that, be a future human
17:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why not?
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can?
17:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't know why you wouldn't be able to do so
17:04 < ChillerDragon> nobody would use ur fork tho ryo xd
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the other way around is more interesting
17:04 < ChillerDragon> go mc ryo
17:04 < ChillerDragon> mc is full of gpl
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how much do i have to obfuscate the code to relicense under cc0
17:05 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:05 < ChillerDragon> 1 chat gpt prompt is enough
17:05 < ChillerDragon> pls reorder code
17:05 < ChillerDragon> thank
17:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk chiller
17:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im providing software to peopel who value their rights
17:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if they dont want to use it cuz x license up to them
17:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> let me bring a quote
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >  I make my code available for use in free software, and not for use in proprietary software, in order to encourage other people who write software to make it free as well. I figure that since proprietary software developers use copyright to stop us from sharing, we cooperators can use copyright to give other cooperators an advantage of their own: they can use our code.
17:07 < ChillerDragon> gpl worst
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> best actually
17:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/yuankunzhang/charming
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> uh no license
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> "MIT/Apache-2.0"
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess they forgot in repo xd
17:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> open an issue üôÇ
17:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> done

17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> RustSmith: Random Differential Compiler Testing for Rust
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 how much % r u done with quic if i may ask
17:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> client and server can connect, both via 0.6 and via quic protocol and to legacy clients/servers. needs some tweaking around disconnects. lots of smaller features missing, too, e.g. timeout protection. I have only tested it locally, so windows/mac support and cross-compilation support also still missing
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i see, thanks for the status
17:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://no-ht.ml/
17:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://nocss.club/
17:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's the reason for your interest? üôÇ
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to see how well it works xd
17:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how fast?
17:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> haven't measured that tbh
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if u implemented 0.5 rrt
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but stuff like that
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how fast it responds, how fast connections are etc.
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> benchmarks are semi interesting.. if u have 1million packets throughput or 700k is not interesting to me xD
17:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I implemented even worse rtt handshakes üòâ
17:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> mandatory RETRY frame for new connections, to fight IP spoofing
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not optional?
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean i can understand why
17:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I haven't really built any options there
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if there is no direct attack üòÑ
17:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, that'd be a perf optimization, I'm postponing/not doing that right now
17:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
17:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> although I think 0.5rtt handshakes aren't really suited for TW
17:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they're important more important for protocols with short-lived connections IMO
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the gain on huge pings is ofc insane üòÑ
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tested with increasing the loopback ping
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> one less RTT, you mean? yea
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess we could try cleaning up the rest of our connecetion though üòÑ
18:08 < bridge_> <chairn> lol, rust compiler in c++
18:08 < bridge_> <chairn> https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc
18:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> interesting that there are ppl have this kind of motivation xD
18:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, it's pretty amazing
18:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would you say if u used a proper game engine and are tryhard, u could implement most stuff for teeworlds in one week? xdd
18:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am impressed how far away i still am from vanilla support, i feel like i'm at like 30% only yet xD
18:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't think so. I don't even know any game engines
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok but assuming u'd know one already
18:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also, projects like these are always harder than they appear ^^
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u play the game u think ez simple game xD
19:25 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't think we have any left anymore :coolcry:
19:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
19:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> $ rg python2 servers/scripts | wc -l
19:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 49
19:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
19:28 < bridge_> <learath2> NOOOO
19:29 < bridge_> <learath2> Maybe none that we use actively? Some are old toys for broadcasting cubes and stuff
19:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm, info.py seems to be python3 at the very least üôÇ
20:49 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> python2 moment
20:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there are no python2 moments
20:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its dead
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even know what you talking about
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> today chairn said smth about old windows versions
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did he mean win10?
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only know win10 and win11
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> OpenG what?
20:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rust stable?
20:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki in ryoOS do forced nightly updates xDD
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @chairn is it true some modern cpus u can write code that modifies the cpu itself?
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> physically
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like a fpga
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-to-fuse-fpga-ai-engines-onto-epyc-processors-arrives-in-2023
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well idk if its this
20:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/xilinx-deep-learning-solution-on-amd-epyc-processors.pdf
20:53 < bridge_> <chairn> i guess, Intel did the same with Knight CPU with FPGA integrated
20:53 < bridge_> <chairn> but they stopped doing it because it wasn't worth it
20:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Xilinx Reconfigurable Acceleration Platform
20:53 < bridge_> <chairn> you can't accelerate programs when the bottleneck is not the computing but the rather slow memory

20:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @chairn
20:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> french know?
21:03 < bridge_> <Iza> didnt know england has it this good
21:11 < bridge_> <metallkobra> guys im a dev
21:11 < bridge_> <metallkobra> uwu
21:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> owo
21:38 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> UwU
21:39 < bridge_> <gerdoe> owo
21:56 < ChillerDragon> it has been years since auto demo behvaior got changed i gotta say i still miss the old one
21:56 < ChillerDragon> where you could stop the auto demo
21:57 < ChillerDragon> or is that still working and the button shows it wrong?
21:58 < ChillerDragon> nah ye you can just start recording a manual in addition to the auto not stop the auto
21:58 < ChillerDragon> that used to be a thing and was what i used before there were demo markers to mark stuff
21:58 < ChillerDragon> also its nice to view demos while being in game
21:58 < ChillerDragon> playing back demos while they are being recorded is always a bit wonky
22:42 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 be honest did you see the impact of your gameplay change coming?
22:42 < ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/heinrich_hammer.mp4
22:42 < ChillerDragon> check this out that part is intended to be more complicated than a strong hammer throw its supposed to be a swing plus hammer boost
22:43 < ChillerDragon> and the new mechanics allow to just hammer the floor and gain the same amount of speed :D
22:46 < bridge_> <Iza> I don‚Äôt see the problem
22:46 < bridge_> <Iza> It‚Äôs normal that you gain that amount of speed why you dj and then hammer 2 freezed people under you
22:47 < bridge_> <Iza> It‚Äôs normal that you gain that amount of speed when you dj and then hammer 2 freezed people under you
22:48 < ChillerDragon> ye sure :D
22:48 < ChillerDragon> i wanna see you pull off that move without heinrichs patch
22:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he is no oldschool player
22:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:48 < ChillerDragon> oldschool?
22:48 < ChillerDragon> that happend like last week
22:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he doesnt know the non patched version
22:48 < ChillerDragon> was even post steam release wasnt it?
22:48 < ChillerDragon> post vanilla steam release

22:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Your video
22:59 < ChillerDragon> thouzght so
23:00 < ChillerDragon> you gotta admit its gameplay affecting tho
23:00 < ChillerDragon> bro wanted to fix hammerfly start and added easy super hammer throw replacement
23:01 < ChillerDragon> and then i get called our for breaking the client by adding ``eval_if_cmd`` xd
23:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Never said it's not gameplay affecting
23:02 < ChillerDragon> it disrupted the industry
23:03 < ChillerDragon> now you can not hammer boats if a spike is in 20 tiles distance
23:04 < ChillerDragon> nah lerato it is fun and its not too bad actually given how crazy of a change it is
23:04 < ChillerDragon> but im just asking heinrich if he saw that coming
