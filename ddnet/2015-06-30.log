14:30 <@EastByte> eeeee: ip spoofed voting incoming, looks like the patch will be neccessary
14:42 <@deen> EastByte: how did you hear about that?
14:42 <@deen> i heard that people use it on qshar's server, but not on ddnet so far
14:44 <@EastByte> I saw it on a random server
14:46 <@EastByte> wasn't ddnet
14:52 < Learath2> what does ip spoofed voting accomplish ?
14:53 <@EastByte> you can complete a vote
14:56 <@EastByte> the attacker connects multiple ip spoofed clients and affects the result of a vote
15:53  * Meskalin slaps EastByte around a bit with a large fishbot
15:57 <@deen> hi Meskalin 
15:57 <@deen> Meskalin: stop distributing your botting client
16:01 < Meskalin> i can ban people from using it on ddnet. But its still not a botting client at all, just because it has some cheat-like functions
16:03 < Meskalin> You can't just run arround and say people i can remote their PC's if you don't have any proof. I can however send my source to a trustful person (you?) so he could confirm its not maleware. Plus im looking forward to ban many features on DDNet/Race anyways
16:04 <@deen> I'm not going to review your code for you
16:05 <@deen> And I saw people use the bot functions of your client on ddnet
16:06 <@deen> at least half the things in your client are grounds enough to ban users of it
16:08 < Meskalin> well ban them then i guess
16:10 < Meskalin> But stop saying im spreading maleware, its just not true
16:12 < o_be_one> hello :)
16:12 < Meskalin> hello
16:13 <@deen> Meskalin: your old client had malware, so why not your new one?
16:14 < Meskalin> It was not maleware, its just not true
16:14 < o_be_one> sn0wflake ? :o
16:14 < Meskalin> I just could control the lcon
16:15 < Meskalin> everything stays in the sandbox
16:15 < o_be_one> lcon ? misspelling or ?
16:15 <@deen> controlling the lcon is good enough to read out all system passwords and private files
16:16 <@deen> and even apart from that, players don't appreciate when you send messages with their name while they're playing, or kill them
16:16 <@deen> or that you can control votes with your client's botnet
16:18 < Meskalin> not true
16:18 < Meskalin> i cant access ANY files from the lcon
16:18 < o_be_one> what is lcon ?
16:18 <@deen> like rcon, but local
16:18 <@EastByte> local console I guess
16:18 <@deen> f1
16:18 < o_be_one> oh ok
16:18 < o_be_one> ty
16:19 <@deen> Meskalin: how do you sandbox the client? exec /etc/passwd works for me for example
16:19 <@deen> to read out the content of that file
16:19 < Meskalin> well thats prob. true, i didnt even notice... but i could see any outputs so...
16:19 < Meskalin> i could just send commands
16:20 <@deen> ok, so just that part: "players don't appreciate when you send messages with their name while they're playing, or kill them"
16:21 < Meskalin> i did never abuse it.
16:22 < o_be_one> Meskalin: i think that now, idk why, you want to help and participate to the community, so why not just follow the DDNet mind by listening on how you can enhance your client ? deen suggests to you, here, to just remove (if there is this feature) the possibility to work with lcon, and reduce cheat features (maybe by limiting it ?).
16:22 < Meskalin> I used it in your favor: i quitted clients that i found were cheating too much with the distributed features
16:22 < o_be_one> follow the mind and there will be no more problem :)
16:22 < Meskalin> well o_be_one: there is no lcon control in my client, you missed the first part of our conversation
16:23 < o_be_one> but Meskalin with this you are erasing the ddnet moderation system and mind ... Deen wants to know, and it's normal, who can admin his servers. So it's hard to have someone that can do many things over the server itself (and players can think its cause of DDNet, not of you ..)
16:24 < o_be_one> no ive read it about lcon, just wanted to point it for your new client (if i understand well)
16:45 < Learath2> deen: is it safe to download meskalin's client or should i get a vm ?
16:46 < Learath2> im looking to analyze some traffic see if its distinguishable from ddnet client
16:46 <@deen> no idea, haven't run it
16:46 < o_be_one> by security get a vm, but i think that now meskalin is no longer in the "dark side" ... Just my opinion, be careful.
16:46 < Learath2> maybe we should ask him to send a identifying packet so we can easily filter it out of ddnet
16:47 <@deen> i can identify it already
16:47 <@deen> on server
16:47 < Learath2> but needs human interaction i was thinking more of a patch 
18:29 < Nimda> Masquerade by Forris just released on Solo at 2015-06-30 18:22
18:33 <@deen> If anyone wants to fix something: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/229
18:38 <@EastByte> not long ago I worked with the tw text rendering engine
18:38 <@EastByte> and I'm not exactly sure why this is possible
18:39 <@EastByte> let's see
18:45 <@EastByte> deen: and it would be nice to have the actual string causing such a line break
18:45 <@EastByte> afk
18:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vtD5B
18:47 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 ce465b5 def: Add sv_rescue_delay and rename sv_allow_rescue to sv_rescue
18:47 <@deen> i couldn't copy the string out, but you can google for this unicode stuff for vertical writing and should find it
18:47 <@deen> they use it everywhere online to break user interfaces
18:51 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/229#issuecomment-117253312 which codepoints are used?
18:52 <@heinrich5991> deen: also, have you considered *whitelisting* unicode character classes?
18:52 <@deen> sigh, yeah, would probably be better
18:52 <@deen> but then people would come complaining 
18:53 <@deen> i found it a bit weird that TW forbids all non-unicode chars now
18:53 <@deen> vanilla servers*
18:53 <@deen> non-ascii*
18:57 <@deen> this sounds about right http://unicode.org/reports/tr50/
18:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #230: added language scripts and improved german language (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vtDAr
19:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: you don't have to forbid all unicode, but I guess there are some good guidelines
19:15 <@heinrich5991> deen: can you give me the log file, or at least that excerpt?
19:16 <@heinrich5991> python tells me that the bytes 0xc0 0x8a don't decode to valid utf-8
19:16 <@heinrich5991> oh fuck wait :D
19:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: that's probably '\n's
19:16 <@heinrich5991> wrongly encoded
19:16 <@heinrich5991> yup
19:16 <@heinrich5991> lol
19:17 <@heinrich5991> just fix teewords' utf8 decoder to correctly error out on overlong utf8 sequences
19:17 <@EastByte> wow
19:41 <@deen> oh^^
19:41 <@deen> that's even worse^^
19:42 <@deen> heinrich5991: http://ddnet.tw/foo.log
20:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: why even worse?
20:04 <@deen> i didn't even think of that
20:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'm coding that right now, so you don't have to do it
20:23 <@deen> alright, great
20:33 < Learath2> !ddnetpeak
20:33 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 468
20:33 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:49 <@deen> player numbers haven'T been groing for quite some time
20:51 <@EastByte> oh noes
20:58 <@heinrich5991> did they go down?
21:00 <@deen> i think they've been rather stable for the last 6 months
21:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #231: Error out on overlong UTF-8 sequences (DDRace64...pr_utf8_decode_ddnet) http://git.io/vtSsv
21:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: that bot spoils everything :P I always want to tell you that I opened the pull request
21:21 <@EastByte> deen didn't even know about the github irc service before I told him to set it up^^
21:22 <@deen> haha
21:22 < eeeee> imo there aren't any new players because maps are too hard
21:23 <@deen> eeeee: definitely
21:23 <@deen> Also because there is no way to find out about DDNet if you're not playing TW
21:23 < eeeee> people who have experience with vanilla have some chance of finishing novice maps, if they're lucky to find at least similarily experienced teammate and figure out what they're supposed to do
21:23 <@deen> but I commisioned a new Kobra map for the noobs :P
21:23 < eeeee> also i think the very first ddrace maps were very easy
21:24 <@deen> a tutorial map for ddnet would still be great
21:24 < eeeee> and then they gradually evolved into what we have today
21:25 < eeeee> maps that were considered extremely hard back then are now in novice
21:25 <@deen> I started out on Moderate 3 level, but I guess most new players don't want to spend multiple days until they finish their first map
21:25 <@deen> actually we do have a few really easy maps
21:25 <@deen> but no one plays them, so the noobs don't even get to see them
21:27 < eeeee> i was thinking of making a contest for mappers, for the best tutorial map
21:27 < eeeee> but i'm not sure how to judge
21:28 < eeeee> i could arrange prizes though
21:28 <@deen> just a jury of 3 people who can guess what noobs can do, and whether the map is good and well-designed
21:29 <@EastByte> I think it would be nice to get people who never played teeworlds before and let the try
21:29 <@EastByte> them*
21:30 < eeeee> yeah that's a good idea, but takes time to find and convince enough people
21:31 < eeeee> perhaps jury would select a few maps and then do a second round with people
21:31 <@deen> anyway, I'm happy for any effort to make the game more noob friendly
21:32 <@deen> well, if the noobs played 1 of the maps already, they're not total noobs anymore
21:32 <@EastByte> well since we can offer a oneclick link using the webclient it wouldn't be that hard to find people
21:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vtSWK

22:17 < Learath2> my ddnet client cant save its settings for some reason
22:22 <@deen> Learath2: how?
22:41 < o_be_one> hey heinrich5991 what is this for ? https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/0e37dcac4e54f83fcc98
22:41 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: patching the map download vulnerability in binaries
22:41 <@EastByte> does a lot of magic
22:52 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: why asking? :)
22:52 < o_be_one> just cause someone told me about a crash to fix in my xxlddrace servers and gave me this link
22:53 < o_be_one> so wanted to get your feedback about this
22:55 <@deen> yep, should run that, especially with Meskalin's client around now
22:55 <@deen> because that client uses that exploit to crash servers
23:10 < o_be_one> the last one ? oh -_-
23:13 < o_be_one>   File "twfix.py", line 38
23:13 < o_be_one>     print("{:2d}, {:2d}".format(offset_prev_mov, offset_prev_imul), end=", ")
23:13 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: try python 3
23:14 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: or add "from __future__ import print_function" as the first line
23:14 < o_be_one> oh ok
23:15 < o_be_one> ok and the filename is the bin ?
23:15 < o_be_one> (first line works well, ty)
23:17 < o_be_one> ah no seems to must be source, but idk what
23:17 <@heinrich5991> mh.. don't understand your last line
23:18 < o_be_one> oh ok
23:19 < o_be_one> just asked what must be the file to patch, please heinrich5991 ^^
23:19 <@heinrich5991> if you ask how to patch a specific executable with this, it's "python fix.py <executable>"
23:20 <@heinrich5991> the result is in the same folder, named "<executable>_patched.exe", regardless of the OS
23:20 < o_be_one> ok cause i did it on my xxlddrace executable for my server
23:20 < o_be_one> and just go some errors
23:21 <@heinrich5991> from the script? can you show me the errors?
23:21 < o_be_one> http://pastebin.com/SXXfx0pu
23:21 < o_be_one> my command : python twfix.py Blmap4/XXLDDRace-Server_64
23:22 <@heinrich5991> ah, that's a python2/3 problem too :/
23:22 < o_be_one> oh ok well
23:23 < o_be_one> so i see if i can update to python 3 from debian 7
23:24 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: I think you usually install both side-by-side
23:24 <@heinrich5991> try installing apt-get install python3
23:25 < o_be_one> its some dedicated VPS for TW, and some are used to compile too, so it's ok i'm doing it ^^
23:25 < o_be_one> i dont remember why i have python installed already
23:26 <@deen> need python to compile tw
23:26 < o_be_one> oh ok thats why, compile will be ok with python3 too ? Or i'll need to tell him to use python 2.7 ?
23:27 < o_be_one> thanks heinrich5991 it worked :)
23:27 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: TW was fine with either 0.6 and 0.7 IIRC
23:28 < o_be_one> good to know :)
23:32 < o_be_one> ive segment fault with patched one oO
23:32 < o_be_one> [15-06-30 17:31:10][register]: chose 'master3.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats
23:32 < o_be_one> Erreur de segmentation
23:34 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: did it segfault before, too?
23:38 < o_be_one> no
23:38 < o_be_one> ive tried with the no patched bin, it works
23:41 <@heinrich5991> my script is a huge hack, probably something went wrong
23:41 <@heinrich5991> whatever that something might be :/
23:42 < o_be_one> ill search for solution in 2 days i think
23:43 < o_be_one> btw thank you again heinrich5991 for the patch :)
23:43 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: do you have the source available for xxlddrace?
23:45 < o_be_one> sure its on github let me look for the url for you
23:45 < o_be_one> heinrich5991: https://github.com/XXLTomate/XXLDDRace/tree/XXLDDRace64
23:46 < o_be_one> ive just edited a line in the code to fix a member bug
23:46 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: that thing already has the fix
23:46 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/XXLTomate/XXLDDRace/commit/24af7d99739313a6ed76cf72b4e7f61433473198 this commit
23:47 < o_be_one> oh you mean about your patch ?
23:47 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:47 < o_be_one> ok so i'll compile last source, i was sure i already had it
23:47 <@heinrich5991> my patch isn't needed, it's already in there
23:48 < o_be_one> oh ok
23:48 < o_be_one> i must check sources that ive used
23:51 < o_be_one> ok i did the update in april so it's ok, i'll try to see thats really curious that some player report me the crash
23:51 < o_be_one> maybe i just forgot to update one server, i'll check this
23:51 < o_be_one> thanks a lot again for you support heinrich5991 , it's really appreciated :)
