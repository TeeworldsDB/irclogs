00:03 <@deen> laxa: it's about 00:30 if you change a few digits
00:10 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'd appreciate it if you could hand me a list of ddracemax maps and their crcs
00:11 <@deen> i don't have one yet
00:11 <@deen> I guess I would try putting them into ddnet-maps github repo
00:11 <@deen> which github will probably complain about at some point^^
00:14 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'm mainly interested in the unmodified crcs, so if you modify them to fix bugs or so, please give me the CRC from before
00:19 < ochristi> deen, things someone plans not always work out
00:20 < ochristi> btw, I got bunch of maps by tpaul have not seen them for a while
00:25 < laxa> deen: I'll think of it before going to bed I think
00:26 <@deen> I asked Tsin about exactly that before, he was strongly against it of course
00:26 <@deen> but that was 6 months ago or more
00:46 < cris272> hello guys, i have a error whie compiling ddnet and i dont know how to solve it, anyone can help me ? : usr/bin/ld: other/curl/linux/lib64/libcrypto.a(dso_dlfcn.o): undefined rerence to symbol «dlclose@@GLIBC_2.2.5»
00:46 < cris272> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
00:46 < cris272> collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
00:46 <@deen> looks like -ldl is missing
00:46 <@deen> can you try adding that in the bam.lua
00:46 <@deen> ?
00:46 <@deen> but it actually should be there, hm
00:47 <@deen> that's weird
00:47 <@deen> oh wait, glibc version too new?
00:47 <@deen> or too old?
00:47 <@deen> oh god
00:48 < cris272> i get the last code from git
00:48 <@deen> hm
00:48 <@deen> does it work with 1 version older?
00:48 <@deen> before i switched to new libcrypto?
00:48 < cris272> i will try, sec
00:52 <@deen> and if not, do you have some nice suggestion for how to fix this all?
00:53 <@deen> i guess we should just opt for the system libraries by default or sth
00:57 < cris272> with version 7.3.1 ihave this error : 
00:57 < cris272> other/curl/linux/lib64/libcurl.a(libcurl_la-openssl.o): dans la fonction « ossl_connect_common »:
00:57 < cris272> openssl.c:(.text+0x2ee3): référence indéfinie vers « SSLv2_client_method »
00:59 < cris272> and no error with 7.2.1
01:01 < ochristi> hmm I have no issues compiling besides some warnings
01:03 <@deen> sigh
01:03 <@deen> yeah, it depends on what glibc version you have, that's pretty stupid
01:04 < ochristi> 2.19
01:05 < ochristi> not the newest apparently
01:06 < cris272> 2.19.1
01:07 <@deen> hm
01:09 < ochristi> cris272: glibc not glib, yes?
01:09 < cris272> yes
01:10 < cris272> but you are right, i have not -ldl in bam.lua
01:11 < cris272> but i am not familiar with this file, where should i add it ?
01:11 <@deen> it should be in there
01:11 <@deen> settings.link.libs:Add("dl")
01:13 < cris272> ah yes i have it
01:17 < laxa> deen: uploading maps on the server !
01:19 <@deen> or maybe we should just disable the autoupdater by default?
01:19 <@deen> because people who build from git don't need an auoupdater anyway
01:23 < cris272> and enable it for the compilied version from ddnet.tw ?
01:25 < laxa> deen: you know that ddracemax is 453 maps ?
01:31 <@deen> woah, that's a lot
01:31 <@deen> cris272: exactly
02:19 <@deen> hi, i guess
02:19 < not_deen> hi not me :)
16:52 < DoNe> does any1 know if there is a way to pass gcc arguments to bam?
18:35 < Nimda> Topsy Turvy by TheZyZya just released on Moderate at 2015-03-24 18:33
23:12 <@heinrich5991> deen: have you gotten the ddmax maps already?
23:22 <@deen> nope
23:23 <@deen> not really rushing, just wanted to make sure that we can get them
23:41 < laxa> heinrich5991: I have them, I'll give them when noother or tsin says ok
