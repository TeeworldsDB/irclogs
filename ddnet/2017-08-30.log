00:01 <+sctt_> heinrich5991: it's ok for you to use this style?
00:01 <+sctt_> https://ibb.co/bQ36U5
00:02 <@heinrich5991> mhmh. dbg_msgs are usually one line
00:02 <@heinrich5991> if you do it this way, the first line will have [] stuff and the others won't
00:02 <@heinrich5991> is that intended?
00:02 <+sctt_> heinright591: maybe i will just issue more dbg_msgs?
00:03 <@heinrich5991> yea
00:03 <+sctt_> ok :)
00:03 <@heinrich5991> but if(!pStorage) doesn't really fit there ^^
00:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> are you programming with nano? :o
00:05 <+sctt_> Ryozuki: well to be honest when i started this i didn't think i would take it that seriously xD
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> why not vim?
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "I've been using vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can't figure out how to exit it."
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> funny :)
00:06 <@heinrich5991> :)
00:07 <+sctt_> hahahha
00:07 <+sctt_> well the reality is that i've always used nano and never found a reason to switch to vi, even if i've used it a couple of times
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well its all personal preference, my eyes wouldnt stand with that green :P
00:08 <+sctt_> i know vi is more powerful, but in a way i've never found indispensable
00:08 <+sctt_> Ryozuki: well the colors are configurable
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ik :P
00:08 <+sctt_> Ryozuki: i like retro green xD
00:28 <+sctt_> heinrich5991: i've pushed :P
00:32 <@heinrich5991> great :)
00:32 <@heinrich5991> couple of things:
00:32 <@heinrich5991> I still see some of the code indented with 8 spaces instead of tabs
00:32 <@heinrich5991> DataWriter and DataReader should get a g_ prefix
00:33 <@heinrich5991> it really doesn't hurt to declare the variables in the main function a bit later, at their use site
00:33 <@heinrich5991> i.e. in the loops
00:33 <@heinrich5991> but that's it, I think :)
00:33 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: ^
00:34 <+sctt_> i noticed the spaces, i'm fixing now
00:34 <+sctt_> xD
00:34 <+sctt_> ok for data
00:40 <+sctt_> heinrich5991: ok done^^
00:42 <@heinrich5991> ok, looks good now. you really like nonlocal variables, aha :)
00:42 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: the newest commits are made by root@term.station
00:42 <@heinrich5991> if that's ok, I'll go ahead and merge
00:42 <+sctt_> "you really like nonlocal variables" what do you mean? xD
00:42 <+sctt_> oooh
00:43 <+sctt_> sorry i've read non-canonical, i don't know why :/
00:43 <+sctt_> i hate globals, i never use them
00:43 <+sctt_> i've not for a piece of code that does only one thing and it's under 100 lines xD
00:43 <@heinrich5991> not what I mean, I ment that you declare all your variables at the start of the main function instead of in the loops where they're used
00:45 <+sctt_> i did that only because it was like this on the code i started and you didn't tell me to move them
00:45 <+sctt_> i'm trying to do things as you are used to :/
00:46 <+sctt_> there are people who likes to have data list in the top part xD
00:46 <@heinrich5991> anyway, [00:42:15] <@heinrich5991> sctt_: the newest commits are made by root@term.station
00:46 <@heinrich5991> is that ok or do you want to change that?
00:47 <+sctt_> i don't really care about the name, i would change only if you prefer that
00:47 <@heinrich5991> nah, d/c
00:47 <+sctt_> ok^^
00:48 <@heinrich5991> I'll wait for the travis ci build to finish before merging
00:48 <@heinrich5991> should hopefully be done in a couple of minutes ...
00:48 <+sctt_> ok :)
00:48 <+sctt_> to be honest i'm surprised you are interested in map_image_replace tool
00:49 <+sctt_> i hadn't think about a merge when i wrote it
01:02 <@heinrich5991> w/e build still not started, will go to sleep and merge tomorrow
01:02 <@heinrich5991> good night sctt_
01:02 <+sctt_> yeah no pressure
01:02 <+sctt_> goodnight and thanks!
01:02 <@heinrich5991> thanks for the pull request! :)

14:02 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #847: Rename `GetUncompressedDataSize` to `GetDataSize` (master...pr_ddnet_uncompressed_datasize) https://git.io/v5CgC
15:57 <+redix> Some days ago someone wrote that the precision on the ghost (and i guess the auto recorded demos) is dropped. 
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Learath2
15:57 <+redix> Thsi is probably due to this line: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/0a9f2913935feccd93c66d739b9b8a3279a7443d/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L3661
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 348533194355900416
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Learath2 - 19.08.2017 Can someone take a look at how we store ghosts? We seem to drop the precision, we shouldn't
16:00 <+redix> The servers use dots as decimal-point character but some languages use commas (at least german)
16:01 <+redix> the scanf call which extracts the time drops the precision because of this
16:02 <+redix> Solution would be to remove the line (at least in the latest sdl version it seems to be fixed) or do the time parsing ourselves
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so maybe try to remove that line and pull request with information about fix ? https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/2f18ea79bc03
16:05 <+redix> Question is whether the systems where the bug occured have to fixed version now
16:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think ddnet provides dlls with a client? Is he not?
16:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or libs, don't know what is used on linux
16:09 <+redix> The bug occured on linux. I don't know whether the bundled or system libs are used for releases 
16:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then i don't know
16:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> On windows, there are bundled dlls
16:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> deen: are you here?
16:11 <+redix> ddnet-libs does not contain a bundled version for sdl...
16:12 <+redix> only for windows... not for linux
16:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/ only for windows, I see
16:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sorry, I'm not familiar with C/C++. I'm web dev ðŸ˜›
16:13 <+redix> In this case doing the parsing ourselves might be the better solution
16:13 <+redix> okay :D
16:13 <+redix> will look at this later again

17:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't know Python, trying to rewrite to PHP
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Nevermind ðŸ˜ƒ Python automatically split string to array of characters
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Great, I've done collecting data from MasterServers by PHP, yey. :D https://packagist.org/packages/savander/twservers
20:23 <@deen> Learath2: I have trouble with the fetcher
20:23 <@deen> It fetches the first 16 KB, and writes them and then I get [2017-08-30 20:21:47][fetcher]: task failed. libcurl error: Failed writing body (0 != 16200)
20:36 <@deen> wtf, failes with Debug, but works with Release
20:36 <@deen> (in cmake)
20:37 <@deen> ok, same in bam at least
20:37 <@deen> why are our map downloads broken in debug?
20:45 <@heinrich5991> redix: I think the precision is dropped on the server side
20:46 <@heinrich5991> there's a tw vanilla issue about this I think
20:55 <+redix> heinrich5991: what exactly do you mean? The issue I encountered is that a message like "xxx finished in: 0 minute(s) 21.50 second(s)" is recognized as 0:21.00 if your system language expects 21,50
20:56 <@heinrich5991> ok, no, that's something different
20:57 <@deen> redix: we already set LC_ALL
20:57 <+redix> not sure if this is what Learath2 meant though
20:57 <@deen> maybe we need to set some other thingy
20:57 <+eeeee> changing https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/5a437b110f8efdb1c27e38f26b7681ff7d1c33cb/src/engine/client/fetcher.cpp#L170 to "return io_write(..." might fix the downloads. https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION.html
20:57 <@deen> but not using scanf is probably a better idea
20:59 <+redix> LC_ALL is the problem... without LC_NUMERIC all should be fine. But without sscanf might be a better solution
21:00 <@deen> eeeee: thanks, that works!
21:00 <@deen> redix: make a PR please
21:00 <+redix> okay

21:32 <@Learath2> deen: sry totally missed that 
21:32 <@deen> np :)
21:32 <@deen> I have a cool new feature
21:32 <@deen> That was written by timakro 2 years ago
21:32 <@Learath2> hype?
21:32 <@deen> and then abandoned, just made it work
21:32 <@deen> yeah, best feature ever, +1000% player growth tomorrow
21:33 <+eeeee> Learath2: not your fault curl api has no type safety
21:33 <@deen> (but i'd like to get the crashes fixed before releasing)
21:33 <@Learath2> what be the feature?
21:33 <@deen> eeeee: can you even have type safety in a c api like that?
21:34 <+eeeee> not with a generic "setopt" function which does everything. but if they had a specialized function for setting each callback then it could be safe i think.
21:34 <@deen> Learath2: This:
21:34 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v5WwM
21:34 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 16f3ddc def: Show if user has rank on map in browser (+filter)...
21:35 <@heinrich5991> how? :)
21:35 <@heinrich5991> *clicks link*
21:35 <@Learath2> that doesnt sound too safe :D
21:35 <@deen> compile it yourself and see!
21:35 <@deen> works already with default servers
21:35 <@deen> client-only change
21:36 <+eeeee> kek
21:37 <@Learath2> eh that sounds safe :)
21:37 <@Learath2> nice idea
21:37 <@deen> maybe need to make sure it only includes the real "ddnet type" servers
21:37 <@deen> not block, ictf etc
21:38 <@deen> and we have the /players/ web thingy already
21:38 <@deen> So https://ddnet.tw/players/?json=deen is super fast
21:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sounds good ðŸ˜®
21:39 <@deen> I wanted to add ranks to that too, but I feel like the server browser looks overloaded if we display another number
21:39 <@Learath2> i really should have made fetchtasks just jobs :/
21:39 <@deen> and then people would all change their name to milk just to have a nice looking server browser
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hahahah
21:40 <@deen> Oh, and we expose the player name to the web server every time you press refresh, not sure what to think about that
21:41 <+eeeee> but it's our webserver so it's safe, no?
21:41 <@deen> yeah
21:41 <@deen> and it's only on ddnet tab
21:41 <@deen> so these people will go on our servers anyway
21:42 <@Learath2> deen: could the traffic be an issue?
21:42 <@deen> nope
21:42 <@heinrich5991> not even mysql-webserver traffic?
21:42 <@Learath2> well we could always throttle client side if it does
21:42 <@deen> I ran time.gif
21:42 <@deen> heinrich5991: no mysql required
21:42 <@heinrich5991> kk
21:42 <@heinrich5991> cached?
21:42 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: the player pages are prebuilt iirc
21:42 <@deen> heinrich5991: we have all that info in ram for /players/
21:42 <@heinrich5991> generated?
21:42 <@deen> at all times
21:42 <@heinrich5991> cool
21:42 <@deen> including all ranks, times etc
21:42 <@heinrich5991> sounds safe
21:42 <@deen> would be way too slow to request that dynamically
21:42 <@heinrich5991> ok
21:42 <@heinrich5991> didn't know that
21:43 <@deen> that's the main memory user on our server actually :D
21:43 <@Learath2> deen: how do we have it on ram?
21:43 <@deen> [pid: 11463|app: 0|req: 544/544] 84.191.82.137 () {38 vars in 453 bytes} [Wed Aug 30 21:42:10 2017] GET /players/?json=milk => generated 20415 bytes in 0 msecs (HTTP/1.1 200) 1 headers in 51 bytes (0 switches on core 0)
21:43 <@deen> Learath2: it's a uwsgi python thingy, scripts/players.py
21:44 <@deen> so should we show the flag or the rank of player instead?
21:45 <@heinrich5991> flag
21:45 <@heinrich5991> (my vote)
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> flag
21:46 <@Learath2> just a checkered finish flag rite?
21:46 <@deen> yes
21:46 <@Learath2> +1
21:46 <@deen> and empty flag when unfinished
21:46 <@Learath2> maybe nothing when unfinished to keep it cleaner?
21:46 <@deen> and no flag at all for other tabs (and non-ddnet server kinds)
21:47 <@deen> hm
21:47 <@deen> then it doesn't look aligned
21:47 <@deen> or you mean just leaving it empty?
21:47 <@Learath2> i mean empty yeah
21:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, could be cleaner
21:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like with password servers
21:47 <@deen> yeah, doesn't look bad
21:47 <@deen> and I have to write less code
21:47 <@deen> great
21:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you know Immediately if you finished
21:49 <@deen> anyone want to figure out the fixes for the new issues I made? have to fix the crashes before release

21:58 <@Learath2> it would be quite antisocial of me to code on a boat :P
21:58 <@Learath2> can try to sneak it in after everyone else goes to sleep if you really need me to :)

22:03 <@heinrich5991> does someone have ubuntu here?
22:04 <@deen> gtest?
22:04 <@heinrich5991> google test
22:04 <@heinrich5991> used by llvm, chromium
22:04 <@deen> I know gtest
22:04 <@deen> just wondering, you're adding that
22:05 <@heinrich5991> I have no experience with testing frameworks, so I just picked the seemingly most popular one
22:05 <@heinrich5991> if you know something better, I can change that
22:05 <@deen> nono, i have lots of experience with gtest from work
22:05 <@heinrich5991> cool
22:05 <@heinrich5991> so did I do it correctly? ^^
22:06 <@deen> dunno, there are no tests yet :D
22:06 <@heinrich5991> there are five
22:06 <@deen> you forgot to add them?

22:06 <@heinrich5991> no
22:06 <@deen> ah
22:07 <@deen> not used to tests not starting with Unit* :D
22:07 <@heinrich5991> :)
22:07 <@deen> you could use parameterized teests
22:08 <@heinrich5991> that sounds like something reasonable
22:08 <@deen> but in this case just use a fixture class with a helper method and call that
22:08 <@heinrich5991> a what?
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> new age of ddnet? unit tests ?
22:08 <@heinrich5991> what is a fixture class?
22:08 <@deen> and each test uses the fixture class and calls the method
22:08 <@deen> I'll just merge it and show you?
22:08 <@heinrich5991> sure
22:09 <@heinrich5991> make run_tests to run the tests
22:09 <@deen> make: *** No rule to make target 'run_tests'.  Stop.
22:10 <@heinrich5991> in the build folder
22:10 <@deen> ah, have to install gtest

22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> I want to learn how to create webhooks for ddnet :C
22:11 <@deen> webhooks for discord?
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> webhooks?
22:12 <@heinrich5991> .
22:12 <@heinrich5991> duh, irc window broken :(
22:12 <@heinrich5991> better
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> yes
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> like
22:12 <@deen> it's just a POST to https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/SECRETCODEHERE
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> imagine i finish a map on ddnet
22:12 <@deen> with a json {'content': msg}
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> i wanted it to send a message on my dioscord
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> saying that i did it
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> discord webooks, if you are interested
22:13 <@deen> Well, you can't do that because you don't have ssh on the ddnet server
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> lemme see savander
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> whats ssh
22:13 <@deen> i mean, it's a script we run on our sever every few minutes
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> RockuS. DDnet send post data to discord, to the specific url
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> oh
22:13 <@deen> and it just checks for new ranks and puts them on discord
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's why, you can see notifications :P.
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> i see
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> aw rip then
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> what is that irclink thing
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> its a webhook
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> for you to send messages
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You still can parse ddnet site
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> but i don't know anything related to programming and shit
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to gather information by your script
22:17 <@heinrich5991> or get the records from the ddnet discord bot
22:17 <@Learath2> i give permission to the bot to post here
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or you can do that, right ðŸ˜›
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> but idk how
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Actually, its something more
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> webhook's are a bit different to pure bots
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> and i don't understand either of them
22:18 <@Learath2> webhooks get to send messages
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> bots do actions
22:18 <@Learath2> bot's can parse and act on messages on discord
22:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: like this:
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> i see
22:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v5WPK
22:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 58c5303 def: Change unit test layout
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Omg, DDNET WILL HAVE UNIT TEST S ðŸ˜®
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> NO MORE CRASHES ðŸ˜®
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> what's that XD
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ehm, in PHP it test specific function
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if it still works :v
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or whole feature
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> it's too complicated
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i'm not C programmer, unfortunately :?
22:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: this doesn't look like much of an improvement
22:21 <@heinrich5991> tbh
22:21 <@deen> not using macros is the improvement
22:21 <@heinrich5991> ok
22:21 <@deen> otherwise it does the same, yes
22:21 <@heinrich5991> why do you need a whole class though?
22:21 <@heinrich5991> function would work too, right?
22:22 <@heinrich5991> what does TEST_F do different from TEST?
22:22 <@deen> oh, probably yes. we always use classes so that we can use constructor/destructor for additional setup/cleanup for each test
22:22 <@deen> and some magic stuff
22:22 <@deen> not sure if we'll need that in ddnet
22:22 <@heinrich5991> not in that case, probably
22:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Redix opened pull request #853: Ghost and Race demo time extraction fix (master...pr_ghost_time) https://git.io/v5WXB
22:26 <@Learath2> redix: could you fix the actual timing while at it?
22:26 <@Learath2> we should store more then t
22:27 <@Learath2> the seconds
22:27 <+redix> the code extracts up to 3 decimal places
22:28 <@Learath2> redix: unless you changed sth it doesn't
22:28 <@heinrich5991> I guess you could also replace decimal commas with dots or so?
22:28 <@heinrich5991> before trying to parse
22:28 <@Learath2> it looked to me as it did aswell, after trying apparently it doesn't
22:30 <+redix> Learath2 what exactly happens? for me everything is fine now :O
22:35 <@Learath2> get the time 7.25, then get the time 7.20 you get new record but your old ghost is what exists
22:35 <@Learath2> Tezcan can show it to you if you find him ingame
22:36 <+redix> this should be fixed now... the client used 7.00 for both. So the second wasn't better
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Oh so you did fix it up
22:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v5W15
22:37 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 040fc9c def: Implement right click and middle click on country and type filters...
22:38 <+redix> i think so... at least if Tezcans system uses , for decimal-points
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Tezcans server is just a normal ddnet server modified to store 1 more digit. It s record messages are same
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it has more features tho
22:45 <+redix> sure... but the system he ran the client on when he noticed the bug
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> We could send a NETMSG_RACE_STATE aswell to indicate finishes and stuff
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> So might not need that weird parsing
22:55 <@heinrich5991> what is NETMSG_RACE_STATE?
22:56 <+redix> advantage of this parsing is that it works with any version of ddnet or whatever race mod you are running
22:56 <@heinrich5991> yep
22:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it will be only for ddnet tab i guess ?
22:57 <+redix> some even leave the minute part out if your time is below 60 seconds. works with this pr :D
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Wait a second, I am dev?  o.O
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> btw, how reliably is the race time counter?
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> thousands ?
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> usually speedrun games have a high precision timer
22:59 <@heinrich5991> 0.02
22:59 <@heinrich5991> seconds
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :/
22:59 <@heinrich5991> IIRC
22:59 <@heinrich5991> unless we applied the race patch
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for example, teesites race severs
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> has thousandths
22:59 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It would be too late, to change that thing ?
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i saw 0.0001 on some games
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, to make bigger precision
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or maybe not(?) i dont remember
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 0.0001 seems too high
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but who knows.
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yeah xD
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> If i remember, in Trackmania
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i saw precision like that
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hmm
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> trackmania, every ms counts
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even half of a ms ðŸ˜„
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes
23:01 <@heinrich5991> nah, trackmania was 0.001 I think
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, more like 0.002
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i never saw 0.003/5/7
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was always even number
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://dedimania.net/tm2stats/?do=stat&Envir=Stadium&UId=7yN2DsBnbG8swVNQ81oAcS4pGe5&Show=RECORDS
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 0.001?
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nevermind
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://dedimania.net/tm2stats/?do=stat&Envir=Stadium&RecOrder3=REC-ASC&UId=oFCBcoNpAKYW7fSu9w5DmdtzKAg&Show=RECORDS
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ah right
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xD
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but what with performance? Could it cause more usage?
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Btw, i had idea to add "Exclude Gamemode" in filter's
23:05 <@heinrich5991> no
23:06 <@heinrich5991> re performance
23:06 <+redix> well 0.001 precision is mostly useful for fastcap and short runs
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no, to exlucde gamemode? or to performance?
23:06 <@heinrich5991> [23:06:06] <@heinrich5991> re performance
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/ranks/solo/#map-Gorou e.e
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what does it mean ðŸ˜„
23:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i think he means it doesnt affect perfomence ?
23:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I meant "re" word. But i guess i understand, it's like  "it was about that topic"
23:07 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:08 <@heinrich5991> why exclude gamemodes?
23:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sometimes i got brain lags. I am apologize
23:08 <@heinrich5991> doesn't exclude suffice?
23:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Not really
23:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because, i see o lot of ddrace servers
23:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and if I want to see everything else, but not ddrace
23:09 <@heinrich5991> you type ddrace into exclude?
23:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not really possible. Or maybe i don't know how to use exclude in filter at bottom properly
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like that /
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/P8nY9yVC80230
23:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It looks like it doesn't work
23:12 <@heinrich5991> maybe it doesn't capture game mode, like quick search
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But, actually its weird
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it exclude every ddnet server
23:12 <@heinrich5991> because of ddracenetwork in the title
23:12 <@heinrich5991> probably
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Ah right, because ddnet has "DDrace" word
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in server name
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it doesn't work for gamemodes

23:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe i could try to add that thing ?
23:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I would learn something  ðŸ˜„ In C

23:20 <@heinrich5991> ?
23:20 <@deen> What's the status with #853? redix? Should I wait before releasing new client?
23:21  * heinrich5991 is currently reviewing #853
23:23 <+redix> The code fixes at least the bug i encountered. Looks a bit weird maybe but it works and is quite flaxible :D
23:23 <+redix> flexible*
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> NETMSG_SNAPSINGLE, // ?
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> best comment ever
23:33 <@heinrich5991> a snapshot diff contained in only a single message
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you know the whole tw protocol?
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nice :o
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (well most the enums there are obvius)
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what about
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> NETMSG_SNAPSMALL, //
23:34 <@heinrich5991> not used
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> why its there then?
23:35 <@deen> @Ryozuki You know that heinrich5991 reimplemented the tw protocol in Rust?
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> no, can see source?
23:35 <@heinrich5991> yes, thanks to deen
23:35 <@heinrich5991> heinrich5991/libtw2
23:35 <@deen> thanks to me?
23:36 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:36 <@deen> how so?
23:36 <@heinrich5991> you bugged me long enough to put it on github ^^
23:36 <@deen> ah, that's what you mean
23:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> static const unsigned char SECURITY_TOKEN_MAGIC[] = {'T', 'K', 'E', 'N'};
23:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> idk why i find lot of the tw code to be funny
23:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What do you think, about add to exclude gametypes ? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L248-L266
23:52 <@heinrich5991> Savander: better add gamemode support to exclude filter
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, i mentioned that code
23:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: you broke the build
