06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for me it was overloading cpu, like when im rapidly clicking on the window, it happens to me

11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jxsl13 I had to stop the zcatch+ server btw, it was empty and still requiring more CPU than all DDNet servers with 150 players combined
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> since this one, im trying to install the game on another computer. the game is working well on my own pc
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Hurrakana linux, windows?

20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what the fck is going on when im trying to map with the automapper funcion?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> after a few minutes my whole project is gone cuz it was automaticly shut down
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> without saving it
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk what did you guys do with the automapper feature, but i hate it now
