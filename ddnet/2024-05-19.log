02:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > though imo it would be nice to have
02:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga we had that. but heinrich asked me to remove it :c 
05:48 <+bridge> <remakepower> Do we have some great ways to custom weapons image in mod?
05:48 <+bridge> <remakepower> :thonk:
05:50 <+bridge> <remakepower> I had tried to use skin, but as we know, Tee can't rotate
05:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> wdym
05:56 <+bridge> <jackneck21> devs: should we disable voting in playground so players can't do fun votes and ban people for no reason 
05:56 <+bridge> <jackneck21> devs: nah leave it like this
05:56 <+bridge> <jackneck21> also devs: do you want a spaghetti ?
05:56 <+bridge> <jackneck21> lmao :V
05:58 <+bridge> <jackneck21> people: in 2024 - 2025 should we increase player count from 64 to 128 for popular game servers so all players can join and enjoy together ?
05:58 <+bridge> <jackneck21> devs: nah leave them on the waitlist and server full retries ... the stack is full
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> people: what do we do with lagging issues ?
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> normal support: 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> 1- restart your router 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> 2- check your cable and settings 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> 3- we send someone to fix it 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> 
06:01 <+bridge> <jackneck21> devs: add anti-ping option which literally make it more laggy by glitching the player positions every 000.3 seconds
06:01 <+bridge> <remakepower> Why does we still need to limit the max clients num on the network now?
06:02 <+bridge> <remakepower> Why do we still need to limit the max clients num on the network now?
06:02 <+bridge> <jackneck21> are you talking to me ?
06:03 <+bridge> <remakepower> Maybe
06:03 <+bridge> <remakepower> But that a question for community
06:03 <+bridge> <jackneck21> who said about limiting ? i'm talking about increasing / expanding the max players number
06:03 <+bridge> <jackneck21> at peak hours popular game servers are full 64 players is from 2019
06:03 <+bridge> <remakepower> That's still limit
06:04 <+bridge> <jackneck21> i mean just expand it to 90 or 128 if it will be a double up
06:04 <+bridge> <jackneck21> the limit thing is just because the servers can't handle a lot of players at the same time
06:04 <+bridge> <jackneck21> if that's your question
06:06 <+bridge> <remakepower> The limit on server is right
06:06 <+bridge> <remakepower> But
06:06 <+bridge> <remakepower> the client is limit the player num too
06:07 <+bridge> <remakepower> the client limits the player num too
06:07 <+bridge> <totar> The collision code between entities is O(n^2)
06:07 <+bridge> <remakepower> We can see the mod developer use ID Map , like DDNet do for Vanilla 16 players clients
06:08 <+bridge> <jackneck21> tbh i really hate ddnet devs i hope ai one day will solve this issues and we can request some features and it make it for us with no bugs or issues
06:08 <+bridge> <jackneck21> but we have to wait like for late 2025
06:12 <+bridge> <remakepower> I think if we want to add some features that DDNet doesn't need, it's better to try to join them to Teeworlds.
06:12 <+bridge> <remakepower> Though Teeworlds is dead now
06:14 <+bridge> <jackneck21> yep
06:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i agree jack! turning off votes and increasing slots would be poggies.
06:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo can someone send some brain. Could there possibly be anything wrong with this code? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/sw
06:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i get some compile errors only in the macos pipeline when trying to inherit a constructor. I assume its the namespaces who mess it up. I have my classes in two translation units not sure if that is the issue.
07:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I never used anti ping but from what i was told it is really good @jackneck21 One does not simply fix lags. Btw also one of the concerns when increasing slots is potential increase in lags.
07:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `error: using declaration cannot refer to a constructor`
07:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ` using CA::CA;`

07:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how about you become a dev yourself?
07:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
07:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah wait then you have no reason to complain anymore, and that's the whole sense in your life, understandable
07:42 <+bridge> <zhn> only if you modify client too
07:54 <+bridge> <remakepower> But you know, not everyone will use your client to play mode.
07:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is an issue for that:
08:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7296
08:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dd-pg will have server side asset support
08:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it will release this year üò¨
08:17 <+bridge> <zhn> yeah, but you can't change weapon assets other way
08:26 <+bridge> <remakepower> hm
08:32 <+bridge> <remakepower> Why don't we download two files, a resource file from server, a map file from server, then merge 2 file
08:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what does the one have to do with the other?
08:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah heinrich said something about adding them to the map
08:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i didn't do that

09:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> ChillerDragon:
09:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> which c++ standard
09:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> u dont specify in your cmakelists
09:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> this actually gave me flashbacks when I was working at my previous company
09:39 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> > > company wants a ddnet rip-off mobile game
09:39 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> > > company also want user-generated-content
09:39 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> > > being a tile-based game natually we need a lot of tiles
09:39 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> > > managers and artists don't understand why we need more than 9 different tiles

11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 5. why does cl_dummy_copy_moves work strangely? sometimes it happens that we are out of sync

11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 6. why in the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù tab there is only the ‚Äúflight with dummy‚Äù panel? a strange question, there is already a topic about possible flights with dummy, for example shield fly, hook fly, but why weren‚Äôt they added if there are already commands for this, then it would be better not to add it, sorry, but it looks quite strange
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 7. How does a dummy find out the player‚Äôs angle using the cl_dummy_copy_moves command? this way you can make new commands (see advice 2)

11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> > ||8. Do the dummy and the player still have information about the viewing angle?*
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> For example:
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> Dummy and I look at the angle 0.00
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> I turn 180.00
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> I turn on the copy -> the two of us look at 180.00
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> and then turn it off
11:12 <+bridge> <1234503178> I switch to dummy -> it looks at 0.00

12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice finally
12:11 < bridge> <1234503178> these questions relate to programming, I think you relate to it
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki do you know about
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://crates.io/crates/rustls-rustcrypto
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> finally pure rust impl
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its pog
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never coded anything dummy related, sry üòÑ
12:11 < bridge> <1234503178> and who wrote? I'm interested üôÇ
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have 0 idea
12:12 < bridge> <devinci24> Hello, could somoene tell me how is the kill feed (thing on top right corner) called in code? I'm trying to find the code that renders it / calls it / whatever but I don't know what to look for.
12:12 < bridge> <1234503178> just because of the 4th point, 30-40% of flys with dummy are blocked
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> killmessages.cpp
12:14 < bridge> <devinci24> ask those questions on #questions . Most of your points and advices are not needed as you can combine things like dummy copy with deepfly bind
12:14 < bridge> <devinci24> Thanks!
12:16 < bridge> <robyt3> was renamed to `infomessages.cpp` at some point, because it also renders finishes
12:16 < bridge> <1234503178> can you move and hit through the cl_dummy_hammer? 
12:16 < bridge> <1234503178> if you think about it, there are many uses for such things
12:16 < bridge> <devinci24> thanks x)
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should be renamed to action feed
12:17 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that would make sense
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i call it like that, but i asked gpt-4 for suggestions xdd
12:17 < bridge> <devinci24> No one uses that
12:18 < bridge> <1234503178> because it's not possible
12:18 < bridge> <devinci24> And no, there are no uses for it once you get used to using deepfly bind
12:18 < bridge> <1234503178> rest assured, I know exactly how to use it
12:19 < bridge> <1234503178> deepfly bind
12:20 < bridge> <1234503178> on RU most of what I said in a big message is very necessary, especially for experienced players
12:20 < bridge> <1234503178> 
12:20 < bridge> <1234503178> I don't know how you looked, but I know most people who would benefit from this
12:21 < bridge> <zhn> dummies itself as a concept is very strange for coop play and its powerful as it is rn
12:22 < bridge> <devinci24> Look, you should try talking to some really good dummy player (I am not), as I'm pretty sure most of those issues can already be solved.
12:22 < bridge> <devinci24> And imo dummy is already too op as it stands right now. this was supposed to be a coop game.
12:22 < bridge> <zhn> anything more than that is too op to add
12:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> Discussions about new Dummy controls are Kind of unneccessary, Heinrich stated already He wont give Dummy even more Power since its already way to strong as is
12:24 < bridge> <1234503178> dummy is not that strong compared to the players' skill, it is even weaker, given the fact that it cannot be moved in different ways, this is the most important advantage of the players
12:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8275#issuecomment-2082901196
12:25 < bridge> <devinci24> Dummy is already stronger than 2 players in some scenarios.
12:25 < bridge> <devinci24> And thanks god it's hard to master, I wouldn't want the 63 players server become 31+their dummys.
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dummy is already an aimbot
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isnt that unfair enough xd
12:28 < bridge> <1234503178> big advantage over what? there's no point in it if he can't move himself, plus dummy doesn't have an aimbot for a hook, so it's all good
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but we speak about a script here
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a dummy is basically a script
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we make it more powerful we increase the cheat script
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the game is about human skill, we should not make the dummy too OP
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's not about raw skill anymore at some point
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 360¬∞ cursor is basically the hardest to master
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> But isn‚Äôt dummy improvement about human skill? you have to move for two at the same time, it won‚Äôt do any harm, but on the contrary, if there are creative people, they will start doing... triple quinta fly with dummy and with a player in the deep
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> 
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> if you don't overdo it, you can achieve the perfect balance so that the dummy isn't too strong
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> 
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> 
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> 
12:38 < bridge> <1234503178> here the boundaries are soapy, but here it is better to consider an experienced dummy player and 2 experienced players, currently two players have an advantage, the capabilities of the dummy player are too weak to do complex tricks.
12:42 < bridge> <1234503178> you can do the same thing through the program so that 2 players go through the map
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @1234503178 i can also say it differntly:
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you'd create a new game and add all your dummy ideas, that game could be really cool and enjoyable. but it's a completely different game then
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since it has other requirements
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~you can do anything with code~~
12:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what's the last time anything was added to dummy?
12:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when's the last time anything was added to dummy?
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no idea
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but there was some bigger change 1-2 years ago
12:45 < bridge> <1234503178> why do you constantly rely on the fact that dummy is already too strong? Isn‚Äôt it possible to make a balance between players and dummies, I don‚Äôt require that dummys can go through some map for me, I want dummy players to be able to play equally with players
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can u find a balance in that? can u predict the future
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ppl will find ways to use new inputs in a overpowered way
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also as said, i am not the best dummy player. discuss that with other ppl pls, or create an issue on github
12:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly even if we think touching dummies' code is a good idea. you can't 100% sure we won't break anything that already exists
12:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> but personally i would fight against any dummy changes
12:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz i still think it shouldn't exist to begin with
12:48 < bridge> <1234503178> how can u find a balance in that? can u predict the future
12:48 < bridge> <1234503178> ppl will find ways to use new inputs in a overpowered way
12:48 < bridge> <1234503178> also as said, i am not the best dummy player. discuss that with other ppl pls, or create an issue on github
12:48 < bridge> <1234503178> Before adding an update to the game, you can create a beta test between testers
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i often see overpowered dummy flys.. so i feel like dummies are already overpowered xD
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @cyberfighter how to know that u reacted without knowing it
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
12:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i was confused about what that reaction means
12:49 < bridge> <1234503178> yeah, that's so powerful!! it's time to remove dummy from the game
12:49 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i dont agree with it
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
12:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh cool
12:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'd rather f3 that than give dummy more power
12:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> LOL
12:50 < bridge> <1234503178> so why haven't you done this before?
12:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> why should i - i dont mind dummy beeing here, but i do care about it beeing so strong a co-op game looses its co-op aspect
12:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> you cant join a stronghold server without beeing bombarded with people ego'ing with dummy showing off how cool it is to pseudo triplefly safe someone with ease
12:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> now do that with a normal player
12:52 < bridge> <cyberFighter> dummy shood exist and shoodnt be changed
12:52 < bridge> <1234503178> the game will remain cooperative if it has balance
12:53 < bridge> <1234503178> pseudo triple flying is ALREADY easy enough
12:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i believe anything done to the game needs discussion and in the end the conversation will lead to nowhere and no change was made. this is basically how most thing goes here
12:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i do think discussion is helpful and needed. the thing is there isn't enough of us to reach any meaningful conclusion most of the time
12:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah no - you have people tripleflying with dummy with ease because of .cfg's, pseudo tripfleflying with an actual human requires perfect execution of both, the person down has to hammer perfectly while constantly aiming 180¬∞, its even harder aiming in an angle
12:55 < bridge> <1234503178> if you sit in one place and do nothing, then of course the game will die, you need to at least give chances, make discussions between ORDINARY PLAYERS, not between moderators, not between noobs who don‚Äôt even know what dummy is
12:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also admins already expressed that they do not want more dummy-related functionalities. so i can't see where this conversation would go any differently than it was destined.
12:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah no - you have people tripleflying with dummy with ease because of .cfg's, pseudo tripfleflying with an actual human requires perfect execution of both. the person down has to hammer perfectly while constantly aiming 180¬∞, its even harder aiming in an angle
12:57 < bridge> <1234503178> that‚Äôs just enough, we need less empty talk like ‚Äúthe dummies are already strong‚Äù, we need to discuss this
12:57 < bridge> <1234503178> 
12:57 < bridge> <1234503178> this conversation no longer becomes serious when 6 gigacids are attached to 1 message
12:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye but the discussion is already ended with #8275
12:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8275
12:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> there is no reason to discuss this since it was already declined by our maintainer's - we're just showing you why
12:57 < bridge> <1234503178> no, everything is much simpler, I hope you at least tried to do this
12:58 < bridge> <remakepower> Many issues on github is suddenly end because no one found a useful way to solve the problem
12:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> i indeed am capable of doing both - but pseudo tripleflying with other people took me hours, pseudo tripfleflying with dummy took me like 30 minutes
12:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no. many issues on github ends because they are bad issues
12:59 < bridge> <remakepower> For example?
12:59 < bridge> <1234503178> it depends on each player differently
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there is no point talking to me really
13:00 < bridge> <1234503178> ok, can I talk to the admin, find out why, what and how, otherwise empty messages like ‚Äúdummy is already too strong‚Äù do not give anything
13:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> admins said no that that's it
13:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> almost 2 years ago - thats why what and how
13:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241707144370458644/image.png?ex=664b2d65&is=6649dbe5&hm=3040696e7362bf327bb37d66d3aa7be4312dfc320111bf83072c79e46a9bd6fa&
13:01 < bridge> <ar1gin> dummies should be restircted to dummy maps only :owo:
13:01 < bridge> <remakepower> As we can see, there's still some great futures in some issues, but they're always have problems with demos
13:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> heinrich asking how would one thing interact with demos does not mean it couldn't be done. everyone just see that and leave.
13:02 < bridge> <remakepower> And they're end because of the problem
13:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what people want is a proposed idea and steps to do it
13:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you can not at least manage that, there is no point moving forward with a fantasy idea with no plans and considerations
13:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> imo ddnet should change their github issue thingie like other FOSS projects - if an issue or PR doesnt follow the general rules they get declined
13:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> imo ddnet should change their github issue thingie like other FOSS projects - if an issue doesnt follow the general rules they get declined
13:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then people would start complaining about gatekeeping
13:04 < bridge> <1234503178> @blaiszephyr
13:05 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm
13:06 < bridge> <remakepower> Just like they send, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7296
13:07 < bridge> <remakepower> This issue is end because of it's difficult to solve problems
13:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is it?
13:08 < bridge> <remakepower> We need both backward compatibility and some new features
13:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> all I see is a standard request to finish the proposal and the issue author failed to do so. you don't just go on github and demand things and expect other people to do it for you.
13:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz the conversation really is just "do we have a solution for this, can we make this happen without major issues"
13:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> doing that with dummy is 10 times easier
13:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241709425073459231/toprooveapoint.mp4.mp4?ex=664b2f84&is=6649de04&hm=83c827c6fad1425ae360cf91d8c6c4eee91b776b554f3a92780a83ec060db383&
13:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> okay end of discussion LOL
13:11 < bridge> <remakepower> I think it's achievable, it's just a matter of backwards compatibility.
13:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cool then finish the proposal
13:11 < bridge> <1234503178> can you complete Holidays 2 with dummy?
13:11 < bridge> <remakepower> But that's the mod need to do
13:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly it is not your issue i don't see why you would be so focus on that one conversation if the end goal isn't for you to take advantage of said feature where you are just getting from other people's work.
13:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i don't think you take part in that conversation whatsoever
13:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> there is literally a youtube video of someone doing that :D
13:12 < bridge> <remakepower> I'm not take part in that, but take part in similar one
13:12 < bridge> <remakepower> I did not take part in that, but take part in similar one
13:12 < bridge> <1234503178> link?
13:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then why are you posting other people's issue
13:13 < bridge> <remakepower> That's just a example
13:23 < bridge> <devinci24> And making these things easier would be extremely detrimental for the game.
13:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @cyberfighter care to explain why horse?
13:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz in chinese a horse as a reaction is really funny
13:25 < bridge> <Ewan> üê¥
13:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i gotta sleep
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> gn
13:38 < bridge> <cyberFighter> idk
13:38 < bridge> <cyberFighter> horse
13:39 < bridge> <AssassinTee> xD the worst case is 2^9 = 512 tiles, more then a tileset can hold
13:39 < bridge> <AssassinTee> not that I've ever seen a tileset needing all combinations
13:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we settled for some system that wouldn't require too many tiles but I forgot what it is
13:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> found it
13:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241717305499586580/image.png?ex=664b36db&is=6649e55b&hm=b38f60eaca3e84873d365546fc0baf70710abaecc40cd2ef1b7717fc75e9d913&
13:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we used two layers and just make corners cover the tiles when needed lol.
13:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I already can think of cases that you are missing üôà
13:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ```
13:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> #

13:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that seems to be covered?

13:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> don't let me boot up my project at previous company just to find out
13:44 < bridge> <AssassinTee> don't, I will find more
13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241718165940207706/image.png?ex=664b37a8&is=6649e628&hm=b4d8c9abb16885c402d7419df05bda2d1201a34204f78a2c12a49fde0eb8fe65&
13:44 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ah you cut a tile into 4 for this
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i see what you mean
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is not two layers then
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is as much layers as needed
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 5 at most then
13:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> here other cases:

13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes. i digged out our old editor to check
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thanks

13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye i did check. also our editor is automapper only
13:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't remember where the design document is, but i know it is an aseprite project
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> really couldn't find it
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i might have deleted it
15:14 < bridge> <Pepsicola_o0> there is bag i think (NaN on https://ddnet.org/funding/)
15:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> thanks, fixing
15:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wait, am I really the 4th person to donate
15:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it says in chronological order right

15:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does irc getting editing messages
15:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it double send edited messages
15:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> with my crappy bridge u can edit msgs from irc üòè

15:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> u can post anything
15:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i think
15:49 < bridge> <reitw> would be amazing if u could play with parallax
15:49 < bridge> <reitw> instead of static tiles
15:50 < bridge> <reitw> ig harder
16:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but there is a C ABI defined by the platform. @ryozuki did not claim that the C standard defined the C ABI

17:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like declining issues because they don't follow a certain pattern. what do ddnet issues miss that you'd like to have?
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> for example nix has these options if you start opening an issue:

17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> and these as their steps to create an issue:

17:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what part of that issue template is interesting to you?
17:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> a simple one that helps with readability i'd say
17:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure I understand what you mean
17:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let's take the newest issue:
17:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8381
17:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I just had to remove files from build
17:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> i dont have any additional "good reasons" - i just proposed it with my own opinion in mind - if you dont want that that's totally fine ^^
17:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, then I'd prefer not to do that, due to the above reasons

18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Discord Mod  üöî
18:11 < bridge> <reitw> Well depends, if the issue is not well self explained, that's also more work for people, waiting the OP to detail more
18:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, true
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but we're the ones interested in bug reports, I'd say, we'd like to find out that our software has a bug
20:12 < bridge> <brezzel_123> I have a question are those dragging laser deterministic, will they always works the same, give the same position?
20:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how can i get the background as image?

21:43 < bridge> <patiga> could you send me the map?
21:44 < bridge> <patiga> I don't really get the question, are the tiles layers missing, is the black thingy wrong?
21:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the black void on the left
21:44 < bridge> <patiga> and try out the branch `new-approach`
21:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241839109262151731/heavens_day.map?ex=664ba84b&is=664a56cb&hm=bf8d697758c0c3a14f8450fda72ca3e8588ac3ab1c49e6b249d3830c2799034f&
21:46 < bridge> <patiga> thanks for the report, I'll check it out :)
21:48 < bridge> <patiga> please try out this branch though
21:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im doing this rn üòÑ
21:53 < bridge> <patiga> looks super weird, I have no idea so far what could cause this
21:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe my skill issues
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @milkeeycat how did you obtain the map?
21:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> from ddnet github :p
21:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> link?
21:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i pulled just this evening
21:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to use? xd
21:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241842444895780924/image.png?ex=664bab67&is=664a59e7&hm=660fbb82cd2f921e20c70897044b27e0383e63587766f9ab6ba3e250e851d1be&
22:01 < bridge> <patiga> darn I dislike that rust prints debug instead of display on panics
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah some map uses ddnet mapres as external
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also noticed that when i wrote my converter
22:02 < bridge> <patiga> in the previous version you specified the mapres path, now it tries to find the path on its own. either install ddnet with a packet manager or via steam, or create a data directory in your current working directory or next to the binary
22:02 < bridge> <patiga> hm sure? twmap errors in such cases, all official ddnet maps *should* be clean
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's a theme map
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not a playable map
22:03 < bridge> <patiga> ah, that error is from not finding the mapres directory though
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant this
22:03  * bridge <Jupstar ‚ú™> could be related
22:03 < bridge> <patiga> ah good point
22:04 < bridge> <patiga> there are only normal external mapres though, `sun` and our beloved clouds
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mnh maybe it was autumn day then
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then nvm
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> new approach works :DD
22:07 < bridge> <patiga> solved I guess üòÖ
22:09 < bridge> <mazty> how much rare is my random rcon password is "LGARMA"
