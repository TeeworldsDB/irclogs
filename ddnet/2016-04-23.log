00:37 < o_be_one> hey deen whatsup about ddnet.tw hosting ?
01:20 <@deen> o_be_one: HH threw me out entirely without warning (and only told me about it a day later)
01:20 <@deen> not sure if I can get the money back for the remaining 8 months I paid already, they still ignore all my emails
01:21 <@deen> so I bought a new server at nfoservers
03:31 <@deen> I played around with rrdtool today: https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
12:15 < joio> hallo
12:23 <@deen> anyone know an easy way to parse a TW packet to find out what kind it is?
12:23 <@deen> I'm trying to figure out how some DoS attacks work
12:28 <@EastByte> deen: fstd made a wirshark dissector for the teeworlds protocol
12:28 <@deen> in this case it seems to be pretty simple, the attacking packet
12:28 <@EastByte> and I also have a tw packet analyzer in nim lying around
12:28 <@deen> i'm wondering why it even has such a big effect
12:29 <@deen> the packet just seems to contain 57 57 57 in hex and that's all
12:29 <@EastByte> what is the effect?
12:29 <@deen> 3 bytes and causes a response of 400 bytes
12:29 <@deen> by the server
12:29 <@EastByte> oh might be the dummy map being sent from the server
12:29 <@deen> ouch
12:30 <@deen> oh yeah, it comes from different ports all the time
12:30 <@deen> didn't notice that before
14:39 < Savander> Hi :)
14:39 <@deen> hi Savander 
14:40 < Savander> What's up? I saw that, ddnet was accepted on greenlight. Do you want to continue it?
14:41 <@deen> Savander: i wanted to, but everyone else was against it
14:41 < Savander> who else :o
14:41 < Savander> Players? From russia?>
14:41 <@deen> the DDNet administration
14:41 < Savander> :o. What reasons?
14:41 < Savander> Ego or?
14:42 <@deen> DDNet is not noob-friendly at all, so new players would just be confused
14:42 <@deen> and that we can't handle that many new players
14:42 < Savander> They don't want to invest the time, yeah?
14:42 <@deen> so the idea is to make a tutorial map with special client support so people can easily learn how to play DDNet
14:42 <@deen> but that's a lot of work and I don't think anyone has time
14:43 < Savander> I think, it's not a big problem
14:43 <@deen> also, would invite more ddos attacks and we have more than enough problems with those already
14:43 < Savander> handle is, but not "noob-friendly"
14:44 <@deen> even right now, without steam, we could have many more players. but most just join a DDNet server once, don't understand what to do, and leave again forever
14:45 < Savander> okay, that's right. DDrace is for experienced players
14:45 <@deen> yeah, it's easier to start with Teeworlds and later move to DDrace
14:46 < Savander> To be honest, it'll be great, if DDNet will be in teewords workshop
14:46 < Savander> as a "modded client"
14:46 < Savander> not as a standalone game
14:46 <@deen> iirc the TW devs did not want that
14:46 < Savander> but it's not possible, i guess?
14:46 <@deen> otherwise it would be possible
14:46 < Savander> oh
14:46 < Savander> weird...
14:46 <@deen> but i wasn't involved, you'd have to ask heinrich5991 
14:47 < Savander> you know, now if you want to play on ddnet with ddnet, you need to replace files. ugh, a lot of work (haha).
14:47 < Savander> ddnet with steam 
14:48 < Savander> of course, sorry :D
14:48 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/SZ1qOpiy8242
14:48 < Savander> DDraceNetwork in my library!
14:48 < Savander> ^^
14:56 <@deen> Savander: have you seen DDNet's new server stats? https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
14:57 < Savander> :o Noo
14:57 < Savander> looks crazy :o
14:57 < Savander> Python backend?
14:59 <@deen> I use a Nim tool to collect the ServerStatus data from https://ddnet.tw/status/ , then use rrdtool for database and graphing
14:59 <@deen> code is here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/tree/master/rrd
15:01 < Savander> nice, i saw this tool before
15:01 < Savander> for graphing. on OVH if i remember
15:02 <@deen> yeah, last time i used it 6 years ago on my router^^
