00:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ddnet has their own closed source antibot module with some other checks
00:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey how are your servers called?
00:00 < bridge> <_qey> Does it work against KRX? The antibot.
00:01 < bridge> <_qey> I prefer not to tell. Sorry for being so secretive, lol.
00:01 < bridge> <_qey> Is there any community-wide rules that would prohibit me from selling VIP-statuses on my server or anything else that is being paid for?
00:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not that i know of
00:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it has been done before without issues
00:02 < bridge> <0xdeen> @orbilo Thanks for the donation! ^
00:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> dont forget to pay taxes :p @_qey 
00:02 < bridge> <_qey> I don‚Äôt want to spend time implementing it just to find out I‚Äôm master-banned.
00:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> should be safe
00:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i am not a lawyer
00:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> this is not legal advice
00:03 < bridge> <_qey> Haha. Thanks anyways.
00:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> what gametype/map type are your servers? @_qey 
00:05 < bridge> <_qey> It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Um‚Ä¶ Custom‚Ä¶ Why? Ahaha, it‚Äôs nothing special, just a side project.
00:05 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i help you because i am interested in the game and what you do
00:06 < bridge> <fiku.miku.> siusiak
00:06 < bridge> <_qey> I truly appreciate the help, but I still prefer not to tell. There are‚Ä¶ Reasons‚Ä¶ Maybe not adequate ones, but there are reasons not to.
00:08 < bridge> <_qey> Some time ago people tried stealing my idea. They copied my maps and tried reproducing the success while DDoSing my servers to steal traffic, but they failed to do so.
00:08 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> that sounds extremly fishy. I can not think of any legitmate reason not to connect your discord name to the server you are publicly running.
00:09 < bridge> <_qey> They swore they‚Äôre not DDoSing me, but once they closed their servers, the DDoS stopped.
00:09 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> your idea is more likely to be stolen when you have successful servers running with it than when you mention it on discord where nobody reads it
00:09 < bridge> <fiku.miku.> jebac kurwy i mlode policjantki
00:09 < bridge> <fiku.miku.> po co mam placic podatki
00:10 < bridge> <_qey> I can assure you, there‚Äôs nothing illegal YET. I just don‚Äôt like publicity.
00:10 < bridge> <fiku.miku.> @vznyxq HAS KRX CLIENT BAN HIM
00:10 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> is it slow gores?
00:10 < bridge> <_qey> Nah.
00:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they said it!!!!!!
00:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they said the thing!!
00:10 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> voldemort client
00:11 < bridge> <_qey> I don‚Äôt actually get why people here are so obsessed with not saying the name of the client, lol.
00:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz you get instamuted if youre unlucky
00:11 < bridge> <_qey> It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm advertising it, I‚Äôm just trying to get to the point.
00:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fiku said it not u
00:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unless you did
00:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> extremely fishy
00:12 < bridge> <_qey> I did. Twice.
00:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i see
00:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Hi
00:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Bye
00:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Hi
00:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Bye
00:12 < bridge> <_qey> Hahaha. You guys are fun to talk to.
00:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> üêü
00:14 < bridge> <_qey> Fishy people can run DDNet servers too, stop the discrimination, lol.
00:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> üëÄ
00:14 < bridge> <_qey> Doesn‚Äôt mean their servers are fishy.
00:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fishy people do fishy things, thats why theyre called fishy
00:15 < bridge> <_qey> Fishy people are still people and people like playing games. Hence the server network.
00:15 < bridge> <_qey> I just don‚Äôt like DDNet servers, they lack moderation.
00:15 < bridge> <_qey> So I decided to create my own, then another, and another.
00:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddrace servers?
00:16 < bridge> <_qey> Not mine.
00:16 < bridge> <_qey> Although I have a DDRace server, yeah.
00:18 < bridge> <_qey> Okay, I actually have three of them, they‚Äôre not really popular, slightly modified.
00:18 < bridge> <_qey> Custom ones are popular. Definition of popularity may vary.
00:21 < bridge> <_qey> Do I need to restart the server for the fifo command to take effect? Or can I add it to config for future use and enable it on the fly via RCON right away?
00:24 < bridge> <_qey> One more thing‚Ä¶ Adding bans to a DB of some sort would be nice. And make it centralized for several servers by default.
00:24 < bridge> <_qey> Again, it‚Äôs something I could implement myself, but I‚Äôm too lazy and I won‚Äôt be able to share my shitty code with the world to use.
00:30 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey i disagree with most rules ddnet has but i agree on not naming bot clients by their name to avoid normalizing it and advertising it
00:30 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you can as quickly get to the point by saying "cheat client" instead but i personally know what you were trying to do already based on you saying you need rcon moderation and whisper messages xd
00:31 < bridge> <_qey> There are many cheat clients.
00:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconVPNDetection
00:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> might fit the distributed banserver use case if run in offline mode.
00:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> tho, there is not on the fly banning, just a config file with white/blacklist ranges
00:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> no*
00:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey i think fifo needs restart
00:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> we should probably make the fifo thing read only to make it obvious
00:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 already sent that
00:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> üëç a
00:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> -a
00:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> xd
00:34 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey you can use a bans.cfg as db and let all servers load it
00:35 < bridge> <learath2> This is how we do it
00:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> bad ddnet
00:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i should revive bbnet
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> Anarchy Anarchy Net when?
00:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thats basically bbnet
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> I want my god given right to use slurs
00:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> BanBansNet banned bans so u cant be banned
00:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 YES!
00:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/BanBansNet
00:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it has great logo already
00:37 < bridge> <_qey> I only see the bans_save command, how do I load it?
00:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``exec bans.cfg``
00:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> or put it in your autoexec
00:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> a ban hammer banning another ban hammer, but who bans the first hammer?
00:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 pst we dont talk about the first ban hammer
00:38 < bridge> <_qey> Ah‚Ä¶ That means I‚Äôll have to exec it every second or every ban, doesn‚Äôt work.
00:38 < bridge> <fushi_gg> who came first, the ban or the ban?
00:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> he is still rouge 
00:39 < bridge> <_qey> I meant the system that is centralized and allows you to ban one player on all servers.
00:39 < bridge> <_qey> Without the need to manually save, exec and update.
00:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ah you want it to instantly apply hmm ye then you need to watch for changes to the file and load it indeed
00:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> should be 2 lines of shell script xd
00:40 < bridge> <_qey> That‚Äôs a workaround I will implement, yeah.
00:40 < bridge> <_qey> But I said it as a broader scale change.
00:41 < bridge> <_qey> For the entire DDNet.
00:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> make sure to only load the file if it got changed you can listen to file changes with some simple watch commands
00:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if you load in a loop it will spam your logs
00:41 < bridge> <_qey> Well, that‚Äôs the issue with workarounds.
00:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey you want a bigger scale? as in you want to ban ppl on your server as soon as i ban them on my server automatically?
00:42 < bridge> <_qey> No-no. I meant bigger scale as in pull request.
00:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> pull request what where
00:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> share all bans?
00:42 < bridge> <_qey> Although, a master ban list would be nice.
00:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey well who gets to write to it?
00:43 < bridge> <_qey> But only for cheating offenders.
00:43 < bridge> <_qey> That‚Äôs not the point. Let me try again.
00:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably pointless
00:44 < bridge> <_qey> I have a network of servers, right? I want to instantly share bans throughout the network. (My network).
00:44 < bridge> <_qey> I want this to be in DDNet-Server code base.
00:44 < bridge> <_qey> A centralized DB for bans.
00:44 < bridge> <_qey> Not just mine, everyone‚Äôs.
00:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> ips are not static enough for that to make sense long term and on such a big scale
00:45 < bridge> <_qey> That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt perma-ban.
00:45 < bridge> <_qey> Most if not all of my player base have dynamic IPs.
00:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> a centralized banlist would be more or less a permanban
00:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> also ips are considered personal data
00:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 i think he doesnt want to share the ban list centralized just the code that shares bans across servers 
00:46 < bridge> <_qey> Max I do is a week for hackers.
00:46 < bridge> <_qey> Centralized for local network of my choice. Not the DDNet in its entirety.
00:46 < bridge> <_qey> ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù
00:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> inter server communication isnt something that has been done before
00:47 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôm not a native speaker, I don‚Äôt know how to further explain what I mean.
00:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i proposed something for map changes but it has been ignored since last year
00:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i think i got it @_qey 
00:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the only current connection between two game servers is the db
00:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there is no other server to server communication and these servers are also not aware of any networks
00:48 < bridge> <_qey> Not really a communication per ce, just:
00:48 < bridge> <_qey> Server A bans player, adds to DB.
00:48 < bridge> <_qey> Banned player tries entering Server B, Server B reads the DB, sees that the player is already banned on server A, doesn‚Äôt let the player in.
00:49 < bridge> <_qey> And I‚Äôm deciding which server is connected to centralized DB, and which is not.
00:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you could just ban with a script instead of ban with rcon
00:49 < bridge> <_qey> Nah-nah, I know I can.
00:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``./fifo_all_servers.sh "ban 127.0.0.1"``
00:49 < bridge> <_qey> I can do a workaround. I can implement it in C++. I just don‚Äôt want to. And even if I do, the code will not be public.
00:50 < bridge> <_qey> Even though it‚Äôs a useful feature.
00:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so what do you want to happen then?
00:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> because nobody else will pick this up and add it to ddnet
00:50 < bridge> <_qey> For somebody to make it for everyone.
00:50 < bridge> <_qey> Well, that‚Äôs sad.
00:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> unlikely
00:50 < bridge> <_qey> Most I can do is suggest to help the community.
00:51 < bridge> <_qey> As for myself, I‚Äôll go with the workaround.
00:51 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôll fifo the shit out of it.
01:19 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat didnt u have transparent nameplates? i had a bug in my client which overwrote nameplate color now that i fixed that i got the transparent ones too xd what was the fix for that=
02:54 < bridge> <Nouaa> Looks good to me
03:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ok. godot 4.4's new game window is kinda pog
03:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> although the embed illusion is hilarious

07:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: hmm, I don't remember having anything like that
07:40 < bridge> <zhn> ask @cellegenrih
08:01 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> how to convert sqlite to mysql
08:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Export data from sqlite and import to mysql

08:45 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon: when is chillerdragores16 done
09:45 < bridge> <remakepower> Oops
09:45 < bridge> <remakepower> There're so many noisy ad bots.
09:48 < bridge> <remakepower> And they always change ips in a while.
09:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> ip range is usually limited and bannable, if one wanted to ban them, it would be possible.
09:49 < bridge> <remakepower> nk
09:50 < bridge> <remakepower> no
09:51 < bridge> <remakepower> Their ips are really changeable.
09:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/
09:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> throw their ip in there
09:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> get an asn, lookup the ip ranges of the asn, ban them
09:52 < bridge> <remakepower> The first bot ip could be 112.xxx.xxx.xxx. And the second bot ip could be 124.xxx.xxx.xxx
09:52 < bridge> <remakepower> Oops
09:53 < bridge> <remakepower> This is a example
09:53 < bridge> <remakepower> which from players in my servers
09:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> one asn can have different ip ranges assigned to it.
09:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> alternatively, ban individual ips by chat messages.
09:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> depending on message content
09:54 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm.
09:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Yeah, but not every modes could do that.
09:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Also these bots seemed to be from Russia
09:56 < bridge> <remakepower> Wait
09:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> well, it would be possible with econ, which I sometimes use for like banning vpns, so you would not need to modify c++ source code.
09:56 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah, yeah
09:57 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm
09:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> if you want to analyze your server logs to see who said what, specifically chatvots advertising some client, then you can try this here: https://github.com/jxsl13/twlog
09:58 < bridge> <remakepower> Wow
09:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> sadly, I got nothing for banning players on the fly.
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be another small project some day.
09:59 < bridge> <remakepower> Fly mod?
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> I mean
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> banning players when they say a sopcific chat message
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> specific
10:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> this is just for analyzing logs afterwards, not for automatically banning players in the exact moment when they advertise cheat clients
10:01 < bridge> <remakepower> I found that maybe name bans could also help a lot. (The bots are enough silly now)
10:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> A few months ago we hat bots that generated their nicknames
10:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> in the ent the message that they want to write in the chat is probably easier to ban with regex matching.
10:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> in the end the message that they want to write in the chat is probably easier to ban with regex matching.
10:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> than a nickname
10:04 < bridge> <remakepower> :thonk:
10:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> can't generate a chat message when you want to advertise some client with a specific name and a specific location in the internet, like url or some telegram group, etc.
10:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> you will always have parts that cannot be generated and that are static which you can match.
10:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> if you want to analyze your server logs to see who said what, specifically chatbots advertising some client, then you can try this here: https://github.com/jxsl13/twlog
10:07 < bridge> <remakepower> Like a domain?
10:07 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh
10:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> yes, url
10:07 < bridge> <remakepower> yeah
10:11 < bridge> <remakepower> Some persons like to copy bots' messages, and changed the url to a normal client url(teeworlds.com or ddnet.org). Will them be considered as bots?
10:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> it depends on your regular expression.
10:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> if you use those for matching bot client urls
10:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> something like that, I would guess: https://regex101.com/r/5UvjLg/1
10:43 < bridge> <cellegenpayments> The guy has some problems with textures on the Settings, probably related to VRAM, help him out ye?
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> its "please"
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> $configdir
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> remove all skins and assets there
11:21 < bridge> <cellegenpayments> No
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> then no help
11:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @canarda_04 no eyes on your skin ):
11:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and uneven outlines
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I don't know if there's already a tool for this but the easiest way to make this work is to use https://github.com/tengla/sqlite3-to-mysql/blob/master/sqlite3-to-mysql script on `ddnet-server.sql` and remove all `CREATE TABLE` queries from `ddnet-server.sql` file
12:05 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> im did already but ty
12:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I wasn't the one needing help anyway
12:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I just redirected someone else's problem here, cuz I know you guys know the underlying problem
12:26 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks just to be clear, you want me to also add a comment like `// https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9670/files#r1997558182` ?
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no

12:58 < bridge> <zhn> stop using tas on official ddnet servers pls
12:59 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> Im not the one doing this
12:59 < bridge> <zhn> you are helping them with their servers development, so ur guilty too :troll:
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why did I even expect that anyone ever asking for dev related help in this chat is not a cheater :lol:
13:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :pepeW:
13:01 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> No, the person supplies me with content, I post it on TikTok. I am the only one who runs the server, the person who makes TAS has nothing to do with Soup
13:01 < bridge> <zhn> ur the one who encouraged them to do so, ur fully guilty now lol
13:02 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> Where does it say that what I'm doing is prohibited?
13:02 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> what questions do you have for me?

13:04 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> so what did I violate from this?
13:04 < bridge> <zhn> you are person that sponsors cheating on our servers, what exact reason you want to hear?
13:05 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> where does it say here that i can't sponsor this
13:05 < furo> Are you retarded
13:05 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> where does it say here that i can't "sponsor" this
13:05 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> oh shit
13:05 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> okay
13:05 < bridge> <zhn> where does masterservers rules say we can't ban soup servers network from it
13:06 < bridge> <zhn> im sure we can
13:06 < furo> They have already been banned in the past, but have changed IP.
13:06 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> is this game server ddnet rules?
13:06 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> not masterserver
13:06 < bridge> <zhn> https://ddnet.org/rules/master/
13:06 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> im not adversting cheats

13:07 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> can you show me where i am adversting cheats or smth
13:07 < bridge> <zhn> why have you been banned in past then?
13:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You guys ok?
13:08 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> because I created the KRX role in the discord server Soup
13:08 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> its been gone for 15 days already
13:08 < bridge> <zhn> ok, why you sponsor tas runs on ddnet servers
13:08 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> soo where i am sponsoring tas runs
13:08 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> in tiktok?
13:08 < bridge> <zhn> i wonder
13:09 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> I don't force anyone to use cheats
13:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @gerdoe I don't see any advertisement from his posts, idk where you get that accusation from
13:09 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> everyone knows the cheats is exists
13:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @ka3drofficial Do you post TAS related runs on TikTok or what kind of content is he accuse you of advertising with?
13:10 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> you only see me because soup in leaderboards, and TeeFusion, who still violates masterserver rules, is invisible to you
13:11 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> yes im posting TAS videos in tiktok
13:11 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> is this prohibited ?
13:11 < bridge> <zhn> they're sponsoring guy who TASes his runs under nickname souppvp or whatever on ddnet servers
13:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Then it's fine to do so. It's only violating rules if those ranks are officially marked on DDNet leaderboards.
13:12 < bridge> <zhn> murpi deleted them on daily basis weeks ago
13:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> how do I modify input :nouis:
13:12 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> where is prohibited that im cant sponsoring a GUY
13:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think any Teeworlds Youtubers or Twitch streamers should be allowed to use tools for experiental / entertainment purposes, but not for competitive ones.
13:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Those purposes need to be punished accordingly, and respectfully.
13:12 < bridge> <zhn> ur using cheats to advertise
13:13 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> im not using cheats
13:13 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> a guy give me context then i posting
13:13 < bridge> <zhn> and how does teefusion break masterserver rules
13:13 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> it
13:13 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> bro
13:13 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> a guy give me content then i posting
13:13 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> im can send you messages from admin mail
13:13 < bridge> <zhn> copy love box 2s was reported like thousands time from my side, admins don't care xd
13:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @ka3drofficial Mind writing your TikTok page to me in **private message**? I would like to verify his claims
13:13 < bridge> <zhn> if you are about these two servers
13:14 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350804312414224455/image.png?ex=67d8120c&is=67d6c08c&hm=5cd5de0782cfd465e64580b1d6cde711c02d42716e9df6228b459b0cbb34c324&
13:14 < bridge> <zhn> thanks, does it allow you advertise yourself using cheat software?
13:14 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> im not adversting me by cheat software its do man who has nothing to do with soup
13:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @ka3drofficial Mind writing your TikTok page to me in **private message**? I would like to verify his claims
13:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (Send me a friend request, cuz that's the only way to message me)
13:15 < bridge> <zhn> ok i see no sense to talk further
13:15 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> im adversting me by videos
13:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Can you send the page where you post those videos?
13:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So I can verify
13:15 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> about me
13:15 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> discord
13:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Alright, @gerdoe let me verify

13:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Nice workspace name
13:16 < bridge> <zhn> cellegen it was verified hundred times, don't waste your free time
13:16 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> xD
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ka3drofficial If you truely understand the ending of code geass you'd be on the good side
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
13:17 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> do you want me to stop posting videos about TAS or what
13:17 < bridge> <zhn> stop sponsoring tas runs on ddnet server
13:17 < bridge> <zhn> servers*
13:17 < furo> The problem isn't the TAS runs, it's that they are done on official servers.
13:18 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> how can i influence this if i am not the one doing it. i already said that it is not necessary
13:18 < bridge> <zhn> you said there is a guy who does this for you, ask them to stop
13:18 < furo> Then don't post them.
13:18 < bridge> <zhn> it's that simple
13:19 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> It's the same as if a person steals something in a store and I'm guilty because I didn't say anything.
13:19 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> sure
13:20 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> I told him to stop. If this is his hobby why should he listen to me.
13:20 < bridge> <zhn> yeah why would he use souppvp nickname
13:21 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> one day he told me "I'll launch TAS on your domain now", and that's how it started. I didn't ask him to do it
13:22 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> it's just unfair that my servers are punished for something that one guy does and doesn't stop
13:23 < furo> I checked the TeeFusion server you were talking about as well and it is says cheats are prohibited in /rules.
13:23 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> and
13:24 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> will some1 ban they?
13:24 < furo> You claimed that they were allowed there, which isn't the case.
13:24 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> hm, im dont say that
13:25 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> wait

13:33 < bridge> <zhn> yeah it's not that useful in game anyway
13:33 < bridge> <kebscs> then waiting for teero'

13:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean it is trivial, check if theres any overlap, if there never is, its obvious that its being used
13:34 < bridge> <kebscs> but 99% of maps dont require you to have perfect direction swap
13:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no modification to inputs are allowed
13:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not to do with the advantage there is or isnt
13:34 < bridge> <kebscs> in osu if you hold 1 button and spam other for fast clicks then sure all inputs in a row have no overlap

13:35 < bridge> <kebscs> in ddnet you would need to take all inputs that are below few ticks between dir change and compare with legit player how many are instant
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a person with null binds will never have any overlap
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a person with snap inputs will never have any overlap
13:36 < bridge> <zhn> what kind of overlap
13:36 < bridge> <kebscs> but then snap tap wont make you do all of them perfect anyway
13:36 < bridge> <zhn> snap tap is undetectable
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> left down, right down, left up, right up
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> instead of
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> left down, left up, right down, right up
13:36 < bridge> <zhn> since client doesn't send direction for situation u press both keys
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh thats true
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then you can detect for a gap between them
13:37 < bridge> <zhn> another magic number in codebase yappie xd
13:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if theres never a gap between them then its snap inputs
13:37 < bridge> <zhn> since you have 24 ms between your presses you really have time to "instant" switch
13:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 20ms?
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 50tps
13:38 < bridge> <zhn> oh ye 20 ms
13:38 < bridge> <kebscs> but no map has a setup where you need no gap
13:38 < bridge> <zhn> race maps
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> still not about the advantage
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sure its humanly possible, but if theres nenver a gap, then snap inputs are being used
13:38 < bridge> <canarda_04> Idk how to make eyes on this skin
13:38 < bridge> <canarda_04> Maybe I can reupload
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> see the svg files for any of the normal skins
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pngs of any skins
13:39 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> i have one question about master bans: why fng server doesnt banning
13:39 < bridge> <kebscs> how do you put eyes on üóø
13:39 < bridge> <kebscs> gigachad also no eyes
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> upto whoever wants a :moaiaiaiai: skin
13:39 < bridge> <canarda_04> No but I mean, having eyes on this skin would be weird
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but all skins hsould have eyes, or things which move around
13:40 < bridge> <kebscs> theres plenty of skins that dont
13:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont particularly like them either x-x
13:40 < bridge> <zhn> ?
13:40 < bridge> <kebscs> and thats the point of moyai that hes standing still
13:40 < bridge> <canarda_04> @sollybunny show me the bugs via screenshot and I will fix them
13:40 < bridge> <canarda_04> Pls

13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @canarda_04
13:42 < bridge> <zhn> who knows
13:42 < bridge> <remakepower> Does ddnet-insta provide official vote config files?
13:42 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> If I research their code, will I be able to bypass the bans?
13:42 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> :)))
13:42 < furo> Ban is based on IP
13:42 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> so fng is not banned
13:43 < bridge> <zhn> masterban? probably not
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @canarda_04 its not up to me if your skin gets added, its not that hard of a fix to make the outlines the same
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can probably get away with no eyes, but it will make me sad
13:43 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> fng have the same ip but not banned why?
13:43 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> yes
13:43 < bridge> <canarda_04> If you show me a way to make the skin look good with eyes I can add
13:43 < bridge> <canarda_04> I need to delete my message and send it back?
13:44 < bridge> <canarda_04> (For fixed version)
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if deleting your msg works
13:44 < bridge> <canarda_04> Well it did work, ig I will do that
13:59 < bridge> <canarda_04> @soulyvevo idk where to type this message but I was mentioned here
13:59 < bridge> <canarda_04> 
13:59 < bridge> <canarda_04> So Solly showed me a bug about my skin, what should I do? Delete my old message and send back, just send a new version, or wait

14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So there is this guy with a cat hitler skin:
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - is he a cheater?
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - is he a racist?
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think I should ignore him
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This chat evolves into bot spam
14:03 < bridge> <liber_0> It't for aad dummy position in hud
14:03 < bridge> <liber_0> I'm not rasist
14:04 < furo> @kebscs Here you go, I made a trivial detection: 217.208.236.167:8303 While a normal player would still trigger it sometimes, one using it would trigger it all the time.
14:04 < bridge> <liber_0> It't for add dummy position in hud
14:04 < bridge> <liber_0> this not cheat
14:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> null movement detection?
14:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait let me fetch my software and see
14:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @ka3drofficial Upon the further investigation of the accusation, the results have only lead to a definitive advertisement of the "Soup Client", it's latest being version 1.3. So we have any info on what that client includes?
14:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Because if it doesn't, then the staff team will have to verify themselves.
14:09 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> i can send you source
14:09 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> its just renamed tclient
14:09 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> xD
14:09 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> fr
14:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Please do
14:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> honestly i think preserving human input is just better overall for AB
14:14 < furo> @liber_0 If you say so, `GameClient()->m_aLocalIds[!g_Config.m_ClDummy]`
14:15 < bridge> <ka3drofficial> accept friend req
14:20 < bridge> <kebscs> can confirm it works
14:20 < bridge> <teero777> `m_pGameClient->m_aLocalIds[!g_Config.m_ClDummy]` @liber_0
14:20 < bridge> <kebscs> didnt know its being used so much
14:20 < bridge> <teero777> ah fuck
14:20 < bridge> <teero777> furo got me
14:20 < bridge> <teero777> i was scrolled up
14:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :gdclap:
14:21 < bridge> <kebscs> can still trigger it without snap tap but i guess there can be a limit
14:21 < bridge> <teero777> just get more samples :x
14:21 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
14:21 < bridge> <teero777> how does the detection work? just statistics?
14:23 < bridge> <kebscs> rn its every time
14:23 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess could be % of direction changes
14:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> All configs I use for my servers are public. I guess they could be considered official. Search for cfg here https://github.com/ddnet-insta
14:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
14:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I recommend reading the readme for configs in the main repo
14:23 < bridge> <liber_0> this anyway dont work
14:23 < bridge> <liber_0> idk
14:23 < bridge> <liber_0> And this depends not on the server, but specifically on the map.
14:24 < bridge> <liber_0> I am confused.
14:25 < furo> No, it doesn't. Your code most likely broken in that case.
14:32 < bridge> <zhn> fast switch is common technic, im not sure that snap tap detection will get less false positives than it has rn
14:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ChillerDragores16 released 8 years ago on kog according to /mapinfo. It was planned as a winter event map. I think it actually might have been one not sure.
14:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why do you ask? Xd
14:39 < bridge> <canarda_04> @sollybunny what do you think now?

14:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if hte outlines are consistent
14:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> better
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> üóø
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> sry but it looks ugly af
14:41 < bridge> <canarda_04> just a hater
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> yea
14:41 < bridge> <canarda_04> it looks good
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> disagree
14:41 < bridge> <canarda_04> im not even saying this because it's mine
14:41 < bridge> <Assa> why the ears on the side?
14:41 < bridge> <canarda_04> I genuinly think it looks good
14:42 < bridge> <canarda_04> wym
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> üóø
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> huh
14:43 < bridge> <teero777> the feet look ass
14:44 < bridge> <teero777> those are not default feet recolored
14:44 < bridge> <Assa> also I think they are too round
14:44 < bridge> <Assa> skin as well
14:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also what is the liscencing if its just stolen from twemoji
14:45 < bridge> <Assa> it's not a twemoji, it's a general emoji üíÄ
14:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not
14:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> all mojis look the same
14:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
14:45 < bridge> <fushi_gg> what's the point tbh, null-movement hardly does anything for gameplay in teeworlds
14:46 < bridge> <canarda_04> they are
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> why are you lying?

14:46 < bridge> <canarda_04> im not
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> THERE IS LITERALLY LESS ANTIALIASING ON THOSE FEET
14:46 < bridge> <Assa> it's the default maoji emoji from discord themself, what are you talking about?
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> THATS WHY THEY LOOK UGLY
14:47 < bridge> <canarda_04> that's because the photopea outline changed it
14:47 < bridge> <canarda_04> it's the same feet
14:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> discord uses twemoji?
14:47 < bridge> <Assa> I read that as tw-emoji, like the ddnet self made emojis
14:47 < bridge> <Assa> tw for Teeworlds, context matters
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> @canarda_04 if the outline changed then its bad xdd
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> @soulyvevo help me
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350827955588169830/image.png?ex=67d82811&is=67d6d691&hm=643ef6695ac2c0ab2de30f19f341cd6c93d53dabb0a10203a58ca6ab73f18348&
14:48 < bridge> <chairn> you know the name is spelled moai and not moyai ?
14:48 < bridge> <canarda_04> if I fix feet it's good?
14:48 < bridge> <canarda_04> üóø
14:48 < bridge> <canarda_04> look at the emoi name
14:48 < bridge> <canarda_04> look at the emoji name
14:48 < bridge> <chairn> discord is wrong
14:49 < bridge> <canarda_04> In 2010, moai was included as a "moyai" emoji (üóø) in Unicode version 6.0 under the code point U+1F5FF as "Japanese stone statue like Moai on Easter Island". The official Unicode name for the emoji is spelt "moyai" as the emoji actually depicts the [[Moyai statue|‚ÄπSee RfD‚Ä∫ moyai statue]] near Shibuya Station in Tokyo.
14:49 < bridge> <Assa> easter island statue faces
14:49 < bridge> <chairn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai
14:49 < bridge> <canarda_04> the emoji is moyai and the irl statue is moai
14:50 < bridge> <Assa> omg the moyai statue is a totally different one from japan
14:50 < bridge> <fushi_gg> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moyai_statue
14:51 < bridge> <canarda_04> I didn't know
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thre are 0 0.5 servers damn
14:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> road to 0 0.6 servers
14:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 ChillerDragores16 looks ugly? -.- or were you talking about something else xd
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nor 0.4
15:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ah the skin
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 0.4 5 and 6 are all the same thing but the ui gets better
15:00 < bridge> <teero777> i mean the long unfinished map? was it chillerdragores6?
15:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ah yes thats 6
15:00 < bridge> <teero777> ah yea please upload to kog soon
15:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> mapping slowed down a lot since i got more and more annoyed by kog testing team 
15:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i can not even publish maps anymore without discord
15:01 < bridge> <teero777> just send it over to avo to skip testing
15:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yea might do
15:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i am scared it will be declined was so much work
15:01 < bridge> <teero777> we will have it accepted on awb servers atleast xd
15:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=501057
15:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> huh?
15:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thats actually motivating @teero777 
15:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> wait can u release ChillerDragores17 there too? xd
15:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> omg where 17 i think i deleted it watfak because it got rejected
15:03 < bridge> <teero777> no way xDD
15:03 < bridge> <teero777> maybe its on heinrichs server
15:03 < bridge> <canarda_04> why are u typing on a bot?
15:03 < bridge> <teero777> he is AI
15:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it should be in the git log
15:04 < bridge> <canarda_04> oh
15:04 < bridge> <canarda_04> he doesn't look AI
15:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 this map is banger ngl it also got rejected https://github.com/ChillerTW/GitMaps/blob/master/NudelDragores.map
15:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is such a funny backstory for the emoji
15:06 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> found the map i was talking about initially @teero777 my first kog decline i was upset about but the map is a bit weird ngl https://github.com/ChillerTW/GitMaps/blob/master/gores/ChillerDragores9.map
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> no way why is it full black xD

15:11 < bridge> <teero777> chiller btw do you know how to install common video codecs on arch?
15:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ffmpeg and a browser?
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> apparently discord can't find some
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> so i can't play the videos within discord
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> downloading-> using mpv works fine
15:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> discord doesnt support alot of codecs
15:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by not support is that it doesnt stick it in a video element
15:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the browser can probably play it
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350835324926033960/image.png?ex=67d82eee&is=67d6dd6e&hm=a5c8c2bac31d8fba2c7311f523b6af7a2b88d79eb2bfe608cfed7c76a473017e&
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whats the video
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> from phone
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> idk what codec
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as in can i have the file if its like
15:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Discord is dookie dung
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not private
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> its like as private as it gets
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> xdd
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> so no
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fair enuf
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> reencode it with ffmpeg?
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> like it would destroy teeworlds and ddnet would need a new rulebook kind of video
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how a video could do that
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unless it was an exploit
15:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Good issue ChillerDragon, agreed
15:19 < bridge> <teero777> chiller is farming virtual github points again
15:19 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> open issues are minus points tho @teero777 
15:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> kinda an issue with all configs
15:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 install vlc lmao xd
15:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> also just dont use discord
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> yea i noticed dc is trash
15:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i ffmpeg all videos i upload to discord first to .mp4
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> but irc is more annoying xd
15:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> irc is best for codecs
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> not so good for voicechats and threads and all the other discord specific stuff
15:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 yes racist kog testers rejected the map because it is black
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> makes sense
15:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> is awb racist too?
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> i would reject it too
15:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yikes
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> because there is literally no design xD
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> its worse than default bg with no tiles
15:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you just dont get the artwork
15:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> yes i can confirm, AwB are huge ddracists
15:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its cozy af
15:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> but withou dd because they're gores based
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> cozy like a dark cold cave with occasional screams
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> put aipgores tileset on and a happy sun and good bg and its releasable
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> put aipgores tileset on and a happy sun and good bg and its releaseable
15:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Palatkaamme irkkiin!
15:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Threads are bloat
15:24 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no no @teero777 its all about the dark mode design
15:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> VC is nice I agree
15:24 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> using freeze tiles as main tile texture is revolutionary
15:25 < bridge> <fushi_gg> > maps being rejected because of the design
15:25 < bridge> <fushi_gg> > me who plays with entity overlay on all the time :justatest:
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> doesn't matter xd
15:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i am ahead of my time
15:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> already have been 8 years ago
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> i only play in entities but when i switch to non entities i dont want it to look like my entities
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> i only play in entities but when i switch to non entities i dont want it to look like entities again
15:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> then add happy sun to your entities @teero777 
15:25 < bridge> <fushi_gg> just never switch it off
15:26 < bridge> <fushi_gg> :bluekitty:
15:26 < bridge> <teero777> no
15:26 < bridge> <fushi_gg> maybe he prefers a sad sun
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> chiller i am missing a grenade on nudelgores

16:11 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> Teeworlds' base library (baselib) is a Python-based library that provides the core functionality of the game. It includes classes and functions for managing game objects, rendering, physics, and more. The  lib is written in C++ but uses Python as its interface language.

16:14 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> isnt the server just 0.6? xd
16:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Solly is now teehistorian, pun intended
16:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no 0.1 not 1.0
16:15 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ayuayuayuayuayuayu this worked like a charm for me ``name_ban "tg:@" 0 1 ad`` only works if your mod is ddnet based
16:15 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy hihi
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Why
16:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oh shit 0.1

16:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> wot
16:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> You tagged me
16:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i was giggling about your teehistorian joke
16:17 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> like a real man
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Fair
16:18 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> Ohhh the server belongs to "unique", my bad, but thanks a lot :happy:
16:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> there ain't a bot spam cuz no one plays 0.7 anymore
16:42 < bridge> <soulyvevo> thats up to you honestly, if you want to keep the current ratio of likes then you can send me the fixed version in dms
16:43 < bridge> <soulyvevo> nvm i just saw you sent the new version

17:42 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Good evening, it is possible to restore records (even only Name + Timestamp + Time + Map[optional]) from teehistorian?
17:42 < bridge> <0xfaulty> I want to restore some wrongly deleted records if possible
17:42 < bridge> <0xfaulty> If exist, is there any existed tool for that or need to write some new parser?
17:43 < bridge> <teero777> there is a tool to convert teehistorian files to demos but none to directly get ranks from them

17:57 < bridge> <teero777> @imilchshake @patiga or @kdaniel can prob help when they are online. I've personally never used it
18:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> have fun: https://github.com/jxsl13/banserver
18:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> if you find any bugs, tell me.
18:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> no persistence layer, the game servers are your persistence
18:45 < bridge> <kdaniel> @fo4tok or @zwelf2  but more zwelf
18:50 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, just loop thru and gather `Chunk::PlayerNew`, `Chunk::PlayerName` and `Chunk::PlayerFinish`
18:50 < bridge> <zhn> with help of rust crate teehistorian
18:53 < bridge> <imilchshake> I'm not at home rn but the documentation of the tools is very good just use --help
19:00 < bridge> <imilchshake> ooh nice! Maybe I could Auto ban cheat ads :poggers2:
19:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> yes that's what it also does
19:01 < bridge> <imilchshake> Very cool :f3: :brownbear:
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Yes, of course, it say:
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Usage: tee-hee <COMMAND>
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Commands:
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty>   replay                 Replays Teehistorian file, generates DDNet demo file
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ...
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
19:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> So that exactly what I used (command output listed in my previous message)
19:18 < bridge> <learath2> There might be a flag somewhere to set the output file
19:32 < bridge> <zwelf2> try `--help`
19:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> the cli name is hilarious, Michael Jackson would definitly agree.
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> hee-hee in the streets
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> tee-hee in the sheets
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ask cory feldman
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ask corey feldman
19:44 < bridge> <0xfaulty> oh, I got my mistake (thanks Anime.pdf for explanation), I used `tee-hee --help` instead `tee-hee replay --help`
19:44 < bridge> <0xfaulty> so yes, there is --demo flag for output file and some other flags
19:55 < bridge> <_qey> I appreciate the work, but I need a script of my own, tailored to my needs. I‚Äôll take a look at your approach and take a note. Thanks anyways.
19:56 < bridge> <_qey> As previously mentioned, that would be a great addition to the main DDNet repository written in C++.
19:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> is ok, it's open source and anyone can use it.
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> do you want it to store bans in the ranks database?
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't sound like it should be that hard
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> M$ PLEASE
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350909247109726330/image.png?ex=67d873c7&is=67d72247&hm=8a6f8f621a9b41799ff2c20ee170ae8492b4c51f8b588a7f2a159e1772b8abe2&
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> "It's current state"
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> also it'd be nice if their language server client worked
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> also it'd be nice if their language server manager worked
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> oh wait this is in rust-analyzer extension code
20:31 < furo> Honestly storing them in the database doesn't sound too bad, but if you are also running vanilla based mods. You would be having two different ban systems.
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> well yeah and there's not a great reason to try and maintain it yourself when the database exists
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i think you're not expecting to remember player bans if you're not also valuing ranks, in most scenarios
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> so you'd have a database for it anyway
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> There is a caveat. These need to be aggressively cached and held in memory. We can't just let people in because the db connection is out. Nor can we afford to run a full query for each packet
20:52 < bridge> <learath2> At which point what value does a database add over just rsyncing a bans.cfg to all your servers?
21:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> good point.
21:15 < furo> Ah, right. The idea didn't seem that bad when everything is ran on the same machine. How does DDNet sync the bans?
22:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @robyt3 are there any rules when it's ok to leave a small method implementation in header file vs when it has to be implemented in cpp file? In my pr I implemented it in `.h` file https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9878/files#diff-920a6cd03077cdb536a9d58ed10dcd0b94c024a07ca2710f016d184f6313424aR23 and you didn't ask to move it in cpp file but in ur pr you moved `CDataFileReader::IsOpen` implementation from `.h` file to `.cpp` file https://githu
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> moving implementation from header to a seperate file is often faster since any implementation will probably rely on other header files
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that means your header will have more interdependance which increases compile time
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it also means any changes to implementation do not mean recompilation of any files depending on the header
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it also makes header files more readable if implementations are big
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its probably okay to leave really small things in headers like getters but anything between that and something big is upto whoever writes it probably
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (^ this answer sacrifices quality for response time from robey)
23:04 < bridge> <learath2> We sync it the same way we sync everything else, just a master git repo that every leaf server pulls from
23:06 < furo> So, the bans aren't done with the rcon commands?
23:08 < bridge> <learath2> Oh yeah, most of them are done through discord. I'm not a huge fan tbh, but I want the next iteration of this to be good
23:08 < bridge> <learath2> don't want to half ass it anymore
23:10 < furo> I see, which in turn does a `git pull` on all servers and then a `exec` on the list with bans?
23:11 < bridge> <learath2> I was doing that early on but all the servers re reading all the bans seemed wasteful to me, so nowadays I broadcast an rcon ban for each ban done on discord, the file is just there to persist the bans over restarts
23:12 < furo> Ah yeah, I guess that's smarter.
23:15 < furo> Maybe for a future version, you could use the antibot module to implement a custom command that you can use for bans instead of a command on Discord.
23:20 < bridge> <learath2> I want a proper communication backbone that connects all the servers together implemented with something like grpc
23:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you can just use "status Lear" to filter. I've never ever needed the ids in scoreboard after I've implemented id mapping
23:41 < bridge> <robyt3> There aren't defined rules right now I think. Anything longer than 1 line shouldn't be in a header probably. For consistency I prefer almost everything in the source file, also because it should lead to fast compilation because the header is recompiled in every inclusion. Simple getters are mostly the exception to this I guess.
23:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> How do you handle the case of Russian names?
23:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> copy from chat, shift+tab
23:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or from f1
23:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> oldschool issue :troll:
23:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Or copy the name or perform the mod action from a popup in the scoreboard or ingame player list like https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1346615147145461800/1346615147145461800

23:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> Me and @sollybunny talked about that once - we may want to build on that idea and make it functional, if that is something DDNet would like to see.
