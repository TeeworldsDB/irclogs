00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Huday well it's possible in some cases, but if there are multiple outs then its random which one is chosen
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @lola send me the avatar i will find a solution
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Huday> could you plz make it so in the editor, you can click a checkmark that makes it so when a tile is placed, it is automatically mapped?

10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Admin help @GitHub is spamming
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby you should use /modhelp
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> /modhelp
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> HMM
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it was a joke
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> /modhelp deen

10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao i didnt read the spam
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i get it now
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do we have a way of getting data out of the server? Like fifo for the other way 😛
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> inotail -f $LOG
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> guess that might work
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/tron.sh
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can't get much hackier than that 😄
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Want to do /modhelp properly
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, then better find a less hacky way
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > /home/deen/git/osxcross/target/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin15-ld: error while loading shared libraries: libLTO.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Looks like I have to rebuild the cross-compiler for mac 😦
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> New version \o/
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> has this version tele weapon?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ☹  when
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ryozuki still wanted to work on that I think
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1075
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If this is done, remind me and I'll release a new version immediately
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 does cmake on windows always fetch gtest?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> Pulsar: jao, say someone in dev that chat message color is fucked with opengl renderer being off
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ ^^
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I still can't use any ddnet version above 10.9.6 😦
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I still can't use any ddnet version above 10.8.6 😦
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah without opengl the chat is fucked up
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no gl no visual
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ fixable?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont even understand what happens
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are they under linux?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably windows
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am under windows and have no problems
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> different gpu
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> unlukily
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt its anything gpu related
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more freetype related
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we should have same freetype version for all, right?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i dunno what version i have
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i downloaded newest sdl and freetpye some day
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no problems with the official built from ddnet.tw either
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lemme check 32 bit
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still ok
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe a clean install solves it?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah the problem from pulsar... that is strange
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> might be opengl related, would be nice if he gives a bit more information
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> amd driver magic, i swear
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen dafuq is 11.1 :((((
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the font is big and symbols are different (bigger, uglier)
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what happened
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i liked the 11.0.3
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fokkunaut u always cry about anything
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just want to know what happened because the old was better
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where is it uglier? XD
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> icons are bigger, blurrier, its different and idk my feeling is that this is ugly
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> icons ok, but not the text?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that should be better or atleast around the same
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no the text is kind of bigger
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i find the old version nicer
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i still dont get why the text was touched at all
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> me too
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was really good
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> *was*
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> really good?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because now the ingame chat is insanly much faster
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is it the l I problem?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the chinese/japanese font finally works
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats great
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> excuse me but when have you last coded anything more then a calculator to be able to judge the state of the text rendering?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xDDDDD
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who are you talking to @Learath2 ?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut obviously
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> aliens told him it was perfect
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> YES
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure u can feel it
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for me all was right
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for me too
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i didnt test the chines and japaense
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if it wasnt working that sux
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he keeps coming here talking shit about everything we do, yet he has no idea about the state of anything
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe tell us in curious too
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 im sorry but thats wrong. i just told that i dont like it because i find it ugly and i liked the old version more and i dont understand why u made it. thats all
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just switch to japanese and you'll see how great the old code was, we've been talking about it for weeks here
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well you're right that the text might looks a bit different, but the font sizes are much more accurate now, that should make the text more sharp in many cases
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the alignment might be broken sometimes, i can't test everything for every resolution, just post screens if something is totally out of place and then i can fix them
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you like the old version of everything more is my issue here
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it literally took seconds to render the scoreboard with japanese
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how many japanese players are there
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah the populist argument again
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats not even the point
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it saves alot of CPU and GPU time
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even for the EU font
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it was shitty text rendering, it was a performance hog, and it didn't work for all fonts
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 cant we just have the old one with an option...
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe not even an option in the settings, only via f1
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no we can't maintain two versions of textrendering
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 😦
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe @Jupstar ✪ knows a way but I doubt he'll want to pollute the codebase either
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tell us what feels wrong and we might find you a way to make it look better
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't go off feelings
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem is, for all streamed text there is no difference than the text alignment
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so basically i just don't see your problem xD
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> console / server list
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the text itself should look 90% same
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except the position in some cases as i said
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will show screenshots, sec
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just need to downlaod the old version again
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao maybe we finally get more players if chinese and japanese start teeworlds because the text finally works for them
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> i think its impressive what teeworlds became and thats only because of the admins/devs/mods here, so we should just be happy that teeworlds did not died yet because of them and not whine about text fonts :lirikTHINK: :lirikS: :lirikH:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dont come with the icons
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are different obviously xD
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Kallemy true but teeworlds was very stable and had no bugs what so ever but latley ddnet client updates cause a lot of trouble
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> atleast for me
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon i doubt there are so few asian players because of the text rendering
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i hope you are false @jao
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> still hoping for a new player wave
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and these troubles can be fixed, but changing something to look slightly different is not a trouble
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or what troubles do you have?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the screens i saw in #general looked bad
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i didnt update for a long time
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because my troubles with the newer versions are client crashes
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i cant risk these

15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> these are the new i dont like
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (look at icons especially)
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or the text in the ingame ESC menu
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> am i blind or does it looks almost the same? :lirikLUL:
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> xD
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I'm pretty sure if I mixed those up he'dnt be able to pick out the bad ones if not for the icons
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will be^^
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do some screens on ur own i will tell whats the new and whats the old
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but srsly fokkonaut, the font size is just correct now, that makes the text a bit more fat
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt look worse or blurry
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but thats the point
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i really liked the old one
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because all other clients have this
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and ddnet had the "skinny" text
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the effect is so small
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no other client I know of has fixed text
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe ATH has it fixed
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just for japanese support, right?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or "its saving lot of gpu and cpu". ok. then create 2 ddnet versions. one with the NEW variant and one with the old
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> people with really bad pc or japaneses can use the new variant
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and all others just can decide what they like more
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because i would definitely choose the old version
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> as @Learath2 said they cant do a 2 font client
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2 clients
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> play 5 days, and you forgot the old version
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ._.
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a performance fix, it's here to stay, we can tweak it sure but we'll be rendering text like this from now on
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doenst improve my fps
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> text does look a little more squished if that's what you mean but that's the way it's supposed to be rendered
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It improves a lot of peoples performance and makes text rendering delays nearly non existent
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut spam chat on local server
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and test with old client new
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you should see an insane performance improvement
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we can tweak the font weight
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with opengl3 it even buffers things, so there is basically no performance loose
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> opengl3 is cool for the zooz
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but too HD for you i know
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> turns your PC into 4k
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xDDDDDDDD
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i got used to it AND THATS NO ARGUMENT FOR THE NEW TEXT!!
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> fokknaut, you can stay with the old version?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I can write you a client that renders everything in asciiart
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Kero, sure. but there will be new features
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> and?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i want em
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it is a new feature xD
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> copy graphic?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or @Jupstar ✪ can just apply a gaussian blur over everything for you
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> @fokkonaut are you really bitching about a font right now?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> :lirikS:
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah fokkonaut, i bet there are some screen tools for windows
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that make your full screen blury
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good idea
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why are we making everything "good and perfect" if it was better looking the old way
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> render everything at half resolution, upscale it back to original, bicubic interpolation is really good at making things inaccurate
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> strive for perfection
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kallemy> :lirikSMART:
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it wasn't looking better the old way, you were just used to the old way
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why it looked better
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i like the new text rendering more, i see a huge difference for big font sizes with 2k screen
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like the "Connection Problems" looks like 8k now xD
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4D 8k
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so we should render text in a way that's less performant so you don't have to get used to something new that you'll forget about after a couple hours of gameplay?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> exactly
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the "performance improvement" isnt noticeable
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it is for people using CJK
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if someone will every update the GUI some day, he most likely will like to have every text be rendered from a specific coordinate
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that is what the new renderer does "a bit" already
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and people with worse computers, and no we don't have the time to maintain 50 different versions of the client because someone doesn't like a feature we add
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's deterministic and doesn't rely on the bitmap metrics
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which font is the one we have in the client?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> DejaVuSansCJKName?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont tell me your os renderes it cleaner
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> MS uses ClearType
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc that looks even better
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> theoretically we can even aply such things in the shader
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not for the old renderer
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and no we don't have the engineering team  to r&d a complete text renderer that competes with ClearType 😛
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and no we don't have the engineering team to r&d a complete text renderer that competes with ClearType 😛
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> freetype even has cleartype support, but i bet you don't use a LED screen, but some old 1920 black and white monitors
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then it wont help xD
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no but srsly fokkonaut, if you see text is rendered too high or too deep, yes that needs to be fixed, the current GUI was sometimes just fixed to work
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not to be mathematically precise or something
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but why are the symbols differewnt
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but why are the symbols different
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because i wanted to try something new
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the search in adress bar
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks much better imo
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i still dont know what exclude is for
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but nvm
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> basically search everything except that
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ahh
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like if you dont want ddnet servers type in DDNet
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that is cool
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what if i use another font file?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> will it then be normal
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nope, the icon font overwrites letters basically, so a "A" gets some icon instead XD
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but for the default font
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i change that
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the normal font is still the same
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i change that
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i already tried out another font
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it worked, but ofc its still not the same as before.
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do i really need to get used to this now
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> stay with an older client
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 🤷
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes thats what happens but updates can be usefull
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> time isnt centered
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430721076838793217/ddnet.exe_Screenshot_2018.04.03_-_15.30.47.77_2.png
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> since vanilla and older clients wont work with new computers and high dpi screens
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then just get used to the new style xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and the crashbugs?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :what:
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it sucks if you loose hours of mapping
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> new clients come with crashbugs for me
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one said something about bugs xd
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i did
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im talking about broken updates in general
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon CTRL+S every minute like me
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo we should test the stuff on every operating system and setup or add a testy realse and a stable one
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even wores @fokkonaut
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i once lost a whole map
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah fokkonaut just collect what you find, then i can fix such things in one go
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do our best to weed out any bugs but we cant try it on everything
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 1 year of work
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because it crashed during saving
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon CTRL+S every minute like me
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sory
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there was a beta thing for the opengl stuff and no one tested it
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i did the same
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so yeah lol
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tested it @jao
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't even have everything, we have to release at some point
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao you are not everyone
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 it is defnelty know that there is some buggy stuff going one since some versions we should exclude it to a testy build
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well it came with a lot bugs despite the testing  phase
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon ddnet 10 was a horrible start but now i think its good. but 11 introduces new bugs^^
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know of any bugs that cause a crash except for one mac bug that crashes on startup and one that crashes on shutdown on linux
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well system isnt threadsafe
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mac isnt working at all
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since ever
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have only 1 compuzter that can run teeworlds
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and it uses windows
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so every client is a potential risk
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> XDDDDD
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and there i have crashbugs
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> teeworlds doesnt work on my 2 win laptop or my ubuntu laptor nor on y 2 macbooks
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We didn't have a mac until a couple weeks ago
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sorry I couldn't test it on a setup I don't have with a bug report that consists of "It crashes"
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=6382
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ u say japanese etc work?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> モカツ why they are not working
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <モカツ〜〜〜> What are not?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the symbols arent working
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ingame
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> swtich language to japanese
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it should
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <モカツ〜〜〜> 'Cause someone can't code good
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't have cjk loaded when a non cjk language is used?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that should probably be fixed if that's the case
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well that is the sense of the other font right?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because not all kanji/japanese letters are supported
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks i just tested font and got banned from infclass
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430723153161879553/ddnet.exe_Screenshot_2018.04.03_-_15.39.47.05.png
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can i even debug on windows?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cant
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> TOTALLY MY FAULT XD
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah totally our fault that infclass was stupid enough to ban clients based on heuristics
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as i said switch to japanese
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they sohuld work there
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> heuristics? whats that
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is no way to detect cheat clients perfectly, so they are using some signs, e.g. sending an impossible character or a non used flag
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so swithc to japanese now fokkonaut then it even works in f1
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there was an modertaor online
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it wasnt a detection
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> try it before u say it doesnt work all the time now
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs the moderator cant see the ltters either
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then the moderator is also stupid...
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because these letters arent in the font file
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ i see its working but if only japaneses can see its stupid, isnt it?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> depends
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why do you need to write japanese in europe
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why not
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can look for fonts that support both character sets
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but often they render some letters different and thats something u totally dislike
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ couldn't we have both fonts loaded at the same time? Shouldn't matter that much
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but do you want to determine what font should be used at what point?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have no problems with new version (tested on linux for now only) ♥
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the letter isn't in one font use the other?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that would require splitting text
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like latin letters than some chinese, latin again
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh yeah that would be meh
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is there no dejavu sens with better asian letter support
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we could use the merged font
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah that would be the best
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the debian guy actually wanted us to use system fonts
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> absolutly no reason
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> guess it's okay this way
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since when does a game rely on a system font especially if its cross plattform
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> y, I don't understand what he was thinking either
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> When not using OpenGL 3.3 Standard chat messages become mono-font since updating.
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430726199333879819/unknown.png
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> *mono color
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, you the second one having trouble with colors
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 you know what is the gameuuid?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i'm making the changelog
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki in the db?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/bc11fc2a3540146568c8cff622097733e871a23e
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i indeed changed the vertex upload for the old render, but i never thought that there are GPU drivers that are so broken
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because opengl1.x is like 2000 years old
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it associates ranks to teehistorian files
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its not relevant?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for changelog
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @CptDalv does it also break every color else
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just the chat
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ you think the color issue is because of drivers?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Just took a look at the chat for now
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this one guy sounded like his color is totally broken
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430726818555756564/screenshot_2018-04-03_15-53-20.png
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki guess not, you could write "Better integration of teehistorian files" if you have to write sth for it
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok, thanks
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @CptDalv you mean that its grey instead of white?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Yep
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it's not your settings?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Settings are default
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Only the chat so far
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> But name mentionings are gray too
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah probably because i update all color
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> aslong its only this its not hard to fix
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how did that even?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @jao "Pulsar: jao, say someone in dev that chat message color is fucked with opengl renderer being off"
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does he mean this issue, can you ask him?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> press ctrl+z then its fixed
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 i buffer everything even for the old render, so no CPU time is wastet tehre too and i dont need to manage so much code
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ yeah but I don't see how the color gets lost along the way
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well maybe i forgot to change it completly
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the new renderer takes the color as parameter
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the old just sets "global" color
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see that are bugs i just oversee, and nobody tested it before it was merged
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, yeah true
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It worked just fine when I tested tho
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not with gl3 off
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its indeed grey for normal text
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since its not resettet to white again
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> keep forgetting to test stuff with gl3 off,
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ????????????????????
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430730930953519114/ddnet.exe_Screenshot_2018.04.03_-_16.10.48.83.png

16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i upgraded to 11.1 then i grabbed the exe from 11.0.3 again and now this
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you broke it
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shit
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because the shaders arent the same
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok where can i replace them
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u need to copy them from /data/shaders
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still feel the shaders belong somewhere else 😛
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> people keep forgetting them
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> better use a sandbox to test ddnet11 maleware @fokkonaut
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks btw @Jupstar ✪
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> worked
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> np i like to share malware but psht
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you are the malware
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nohate btw i love that you do soemntinh
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> especially no hate to you @Jupstar ✪
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh my github interface completely broke when I clicked merge on that
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because I was fasteR?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah 😄
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😋
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that wasnt a short changelog :o
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what are the new dummy things?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/ ^^
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cant seem to get them to work
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1086
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read there
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its a bot
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can make the dummy jump without controling it i guess
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coradax will be even more pro with dummy now
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet has cheats in the client, ban
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> erm
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is something wrong
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cl_dummy_fire makes him hook
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and the cl_dummy_hook isnt even in the game
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its a bot f3
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430734547114524683/Screen_Shot_2018-04-03_at_12.21.18_AM.png
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he named them wrong
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sec i make a lil pr fixing it
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why you want to make dummies more powerful?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because depression is a serious issue
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for play offline😉
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wat
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think the new dummy stuff is not very useful but nvm
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye im depressed. i will kill mysefl if jao doesnt test me maps. its in your hand. you dont want to kioll a person rioght
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> dummy hookflybot when?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noby right niw
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noby right now
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rly?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is a cl_dummy_hook
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :O
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> win-win, i don't have to test your maps and you die
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can soemone come test that on my server
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it lets the dummy hook on a key press
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby ok
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i used to always ask people to use ddnet persian for this
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but if ddnet has it then no need xd
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao people dying is a joke until it happens

16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then it becomes really unfunny, really quick
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye someone will kill himself because he can't play a co-op game alone 😭
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as said, it's funny until it happens 🙂
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its funny after it happened

16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the shit wont work
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk, ask QingGo
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he made that feature
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cl_dummy_fire is bugged due to 2 macros with that
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and cl_dummy_hook doesnt exist
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he made a typo
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i fixed it in the pr
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if that fixes all tho
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u cant hookfly better because u cant make him walk, still need to use hammer toggle
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki for me the hwole thing is useless
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Suicide is definitely off-topic in #developer 😛
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt say anything about it being useful or not
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you started it xd
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i tried to get him to test the hookflybot and it was just hooking straight up into the air
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki what do u want to use the hook and jump things for
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont care
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just wanted to point out that one can't always foresee the consequences of their words
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut the guy who made it seems to be able to pull off some nice stuff with it, ask him
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why does the test look so different in the new version

16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woot
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we have ultra dummys now?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats awesome
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> men i want this new client
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen did you ever get osxcross working?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought such things would be to over powered
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt Cellegen suggest it sometime and deen rejected it?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what ever i love this feature f3 for op dummys
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> op? you can hook, fire and jump without switching, not that much better
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is great
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u can play 2 player on one mnachine
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like old browser games
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can learn to use wasd and arrow keys at the same time to betetr crontrol ur dummy
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is super usefull to combine the hook with the hamemrfly aimbot
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 || @deen https://hastebin.com/itumexehok.go have either of you encountered this?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wtf is hastebin
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pastebin for heros?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's one of the random pastebin sites I rotate through daily
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u choose the filename
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> itumexehok.go
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hastebin is cleaner
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/mY
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is very clean
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually I prefer this one
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and has sexy syntax highlight
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but raw pastebin is cleaner than hastebin
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it has no html what so ever
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats great
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo as we started to make dummys op af
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can add ?c for C syntax hiliting
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> could we implemented the hammerfly mode which aims at the closest tee
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i missed it alot while hammerflying inbig teams and someone took my dummy and i had a different partner
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the noermal hammerfly mode can be used to hammerfly with to helicopters seperatly if you are above your dummy
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but thats not always the case
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr it would be a full bot then with aim at closest and then you could pause ayour dummy and run around with hammerfly closest and hook and shot all
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but maybe there is some protection possible
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ just tried the new client
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it feels like the menue got a lot sharper
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this possible?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> possibly
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> added some sort of 4k support?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i love the new fonts ❤
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it also has some sounds agian
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ill give this client a new try until it crashes
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm how can i update my fork?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or wait i have no running prs i can delete it and refork
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty to deens cleanup c:
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> refork? 😄
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just `git fetch ddnet` and `git checkout master && git reset --hard ddnet/master && git push origin master`

17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 ah great so this kills my master and gets a new master but all my branches stay alive
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we pin this ? @jao
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you should always keep your master up to date with ours anyways
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes i do that by deleting my fork
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in settings
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just `git fetch ddnet && git checkout master && git reset --hard ddnet/master && git push origin master`
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and sometimes i accidentally delete other repos of mine
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a brutal way of doing that 😄
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> great huh?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but since im using branches and try to get git god
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it would be cool to keep these branches alive
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw i didnt understand how the new op dummy stuff works yet
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is this hook bug i fixed in my pr but still i cant get it running
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gosh git is tricky i cant delet my failed branch
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i create a branch while i checkedout another one i create a branch in a branch am i right?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it gets messy then in pullrequest i guess
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its ez
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon cl_dummy_control 1
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u can use the otherts
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i did
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and its control_dummy
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ill fix that xd

17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tested
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure it works
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but its not usefull imo
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not that*
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There we agree, bors is stupid

17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why closed .-.
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u remind me while we still use it?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon read xD
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i fixed firing
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .-.
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just make a new pr
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah u already stole it
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its gg
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did it long before
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess u didnt see the pr xD
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woot
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im blind i guess
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 likes it, and it's a good idea, just badly executed
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon but i didnt fix the description
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can do it
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> "whether can you control" is that correct english?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i updated it in the closed pr branch
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no it's not
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i wont touch the spacy english
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i even faiul fireing
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fire doesnt work
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fire is hook and hook is gone
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think there will be a new hotfix soon, when all this is fixed
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye thats what we are fixing atm
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/zVqYR/3512081172.png
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this featch command seems to be broken
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen could you give the docker build a go?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you need to replace ddnet with the name of the ddnet remote
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You mean I should implement it?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is a ddnet remote?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or try the one you made?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon `git remote add ddnet https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet.git`
17:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Jupeyy opened pull request #1098: Some text related fixes (color, positining) (master...master) https://git.io/vxXZC
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen try the one I made I mean, just added osx aswell
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, great
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ can we remove the font without Chinese now so that we can read CJK even when not using CJK languages?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See also https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1093
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sry i have no plan what his idea is
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But the Chinese font looks worse tbh
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah and some characters aren't rendered really good
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> He wants a configurable system font I think
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but why should we
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> couldn't we merge the CJK glyphs into the main font?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For Debian/Ubuntu
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what gain does that give anyone
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yes, that would be great, but my understanding is that that's whatWenQuanYi actually is
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ comic sans in ddnet client obv
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and smaller releases
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since font is largest part of client
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, so how does the chinese font look different?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> more squished together
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some kerning issue?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe they just use a different kind of dejavusans as base
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we can do the merge ourselves
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm wondering what the best practices are btw
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shouldn't we try DejaVuSans if available, otherwise some other fonts to get CJK?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well ofc the chinese font file is the biggest
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that won't change alot if we merge them
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But we can use the system font
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you want to remove the font files for debian packages completly?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> games do nearly always include their own fonts tho, no?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah lol the bors exploit doesnt work .-.
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, just like we remove shared libs
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i don't know!
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen oop i killed the bors xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never encountered a game that had different font on different OS
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon gj
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well @Learath2 is true, many software not only games do that, but text editors of things like that obviously not
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> WenQuanYi looks so old, no updates for years
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr @Learath2 atleast we know bors is save now
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well @Learath2 is true, many software not only games do that, but text editors or things like that obviously not
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_fonts#Typefaces
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could try using Droid instead
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> talking about fonts, did you see the steam survey?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > 50% of players on steam use Chinese as language
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's what I was thinking, wanna try and see what it looks like?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woot?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where can i see it
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah its general
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> non teewoods releated
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye chinease is a big player base
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> love the steam surveys, always gives you a nice median
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is a lot potential for teeworlds
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I don't like shipping 5-10 MB fonts
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh if i remember correctly i saw a reddit post that some company is the fault for the insane chinese boom suddenly
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, some chinese farms
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for selling items/accounts
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Suggestion:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We have the RESET button for everything where you can change color (laser, chatmessgaes..) why dont we have it for the UI color in Graphics too? would be nice to add that
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Modern Android seems to use Roboto for non-CJK plus Noto for CJK
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen hmm, we should check other games but there aren't many games on linux that are installed through a package manager
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> openarena maybe but I'm sure that uses font-config
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So we should also use font-config, having a customizable font
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the version we release on ddnet.tw includes one font
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as the default
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how would we let people who get it through the package manager get the font?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we'd use a standard font ideally
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so they can apt-get install roboto
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh yeah, that should work
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> alternatively make a separate ddnet-font package
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ i don't notice any lags with chinese, good job 😃
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll see on your 10000 years old AMD gpu XD
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with mesa drivers, that software render 50% of unsupported things
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Doesn't matter 😄
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hey mesa ppl are doing their very best, no h8
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah mesa is awesome

18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> could u pls bors+ it agian ? c: @deen should work now
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ "we'll see on your 10000 years old AMD gpu XD" why? :o
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is in the debian curl transition :o https://release.debian.org/transitions/html/curl.html
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how would you feel about some kind of management interface for ddnet servers? I don't see any other nice way of getting data out in an organised way, would also help with #1074
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki its an inside
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki its an insider
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 like econ?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but with econ we need to parse output meant for humans
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon sorry, I remade your change 😄
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 json-econ
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fok u deen .-.
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki because my old computer has a 13 year old amd gpu that used to cost 15 € and I found in the garbage somewhere
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd prolly generalise all the console output actually, add a way of requesting everything machine readable
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which had problems with opengl3 because of bad linux drivers
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ahh
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also econ output is intertwined :/
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 doesn't sound bad to have a json interface to server, on what protocol?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet it didnt had bad drivers
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's why i want to know if its better now
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it has bad drivers, even terminals render slowly 😄
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean whatever console output is generated `CCommandOutput` and use `CCommandOutput:::ToHuman()` and `CCommandOutput:::ToJSON()`
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, I thought radeon was pretty good with old GPU's
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then write it to logfile?
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got no probs with amd, but my gpu is from 2015
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got no probs with amd, but my gpu is from 2015
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then output human or json to the logfile, and let the ?con user decide which output format he/she/it wants
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i feel like amd makes a bad driver right before they stop developping driver for a GPU, modern AMD gpus are pretty good, but older are extremly buggy always
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 want to have a websockets interface to get data too?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `output json; status` to get the player list out of econ maybe
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki huh, why are we using curl 3 and not 4?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what for?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 as another econ interface, so people can write funny javascript webservices to access data from ddnet servers
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> deem ♥
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o i don't know
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets update it? xD
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> deen ♥
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki that sounds like a problem with the Debian package, locally I run DDNet with curl 7 without problems
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can't expose econ to the public, it's not set-up for it
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> too bad
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make a ddnet api
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like apis
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's what I was thinking of
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hi @SkyHDTV
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A ddnet API connected to all the servers via econ or some other protocol yet to be invented
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> hi
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's good @Learath2
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so people can easily spy on who's online where
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you could use the api on the client too
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or get notified of new ranks
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sounds cool
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm failing to imagine the protocol tho 😃 econ has sync issues and it's output would be to hacky to parse, would be very tiresome to rework the console output (would entail some serialization work), tailing the logs is just nope
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is where modern languages excel, reflection really makes serialisation a breeze
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just wait for c++2ß
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 20
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does it have reflection now? 😄
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think it was planned
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or 22, not sure
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would also implement a per-server http api, so you can easy know server info without implementing the ddnet protocol
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of games do that i think
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nothxnohttpinourcodepls
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whynothxkokpls
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we already are linking against a thousand libraries, we are going to become the emacs of games soon
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no problem!
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what would we link against for the http server?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a http parser
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we can just copy nginx in and statically link nginx into ddnet-server
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> would be the best case
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> source code of nginx is not that big
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah @heinrich5991 would statically link nginx
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt there a header-only http parser
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> server
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we can make nginx header only
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boost.asio?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cat src/**/*.{c,h} > new.h
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah lets link in boost too...
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont we already?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we just got rid of it
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets use nginx then
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even celebrated with champagne
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the ddnet news file public?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the one that appears in client
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a json file we publically host
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser this doesn't look too cancerous
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/j0cahq half life 3 confirmed
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks good to me
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure if I want to expose a per server  API tho
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes info gathering lot easier
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> don't think only as ddnet, maybe other ppl also want it
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in their own sv
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll just expose a "management interface" and have a central API that routes/caches
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, or a central API that just forwards requests to the per server api
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://info.ddnet.tw/info @Ryozuki
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> deen
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and with finished maps: https://info.ddnet.tw/info?name=deen
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wanted just wanted to add the changelog ^^
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, nope
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only in private repo, sorry
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah np
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> @deen  
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> Why ddnet does not sponsor qshar kog?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would it?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most of ddnet ppl know kog
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> qshar already posts his events in the forum too
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=3194
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> and that has many servers of countries that do not have kog to ddnet already has several in all countries
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh you mean sponsoring servers?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i woudl better first have our servers payed
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/funding/
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, we could. But then we'd kind of have to merge and trust, and that seemed like a lot of work
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> I do not know the type of a server because Brazilians do not have ddnet kog we have the mount ja
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and might even reduce innovation, for example KoG is playing around with new features like moving tiles
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> it was on April 1st
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aprils fool?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> sim trollagem 1 April
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> yes
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fonts look cleaner now :o
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> better get ddgores ready to replace kog 😣
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the updated didnt work on windows
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had all white screen
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the updater didnt work on windows
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its steam fault not teeworlds
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> something changed >:(
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Steam seems to lock files and prevent updating them
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah, but even after a clean install
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we aren't allowed to have an updater with steam
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> running  the game from steam shows white screen
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i replaced teeworlds steam binaries with ddnet
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it worked till this update :o
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> helps me keep record of this http://prntscr.com/j0civr
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mmm even disabling steam overlay doesnt fix it
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> have the full ddnet client log?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to get logs
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> logfile
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> Why do not you join the qshar or do you speak ddgores?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/430772674667479050/client.log
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks like a relative file path problem?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's what i expected
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet is stricter about paths since a few versions
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> D:
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Error! Shader program wasn't linked! The linker returned
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you have the data/shader?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made a clean install
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt find audio also
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hastebin.com/udopamamur.md (same log)
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Edit storage.cfg
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> add_path for data
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, there was a change about this
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1042
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `add_path C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Teeworlds\tw\data`
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this did the trick
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works now
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/j0cnaa
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate this :(
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some languages use more words than english
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, change the code to respect the length of the rendered text
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> instead of a fixed value
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill make a issue
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> better make a fix 😄
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will look at it then xD
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by respectting the length of text you mean making the slider smaller?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or putting it more down
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess last
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> ♥
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love this new font engine
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks lot better
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel it
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it defenetly looks different but what exactly changed? the sans?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its lot faster now
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and has more quality
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> faster... text? xD
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rendering it
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> please sponsor or create a ddgores? Brazilian noos so bad without the maps are ddnet ddrace maps that are few
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But lots of text is too high now, right?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> misplaced?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Looking at text next to tee
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should be moved down a few pixels
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think jupeyy fixed it
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but no hotgix released
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hotfix*
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/j0cq1u
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ is this fixed?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, fixed
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just bors didn't merge again...
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> please sponsor or create a ddgores? Brazilian noos so bad without the maps are ddnet ddrace maps that are few
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove bors :toptri:
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki so what about steam? It works without steam?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe steam starts DDNet from another location
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i fixed it editing storage.cfg
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works without steam yes
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (without steam worked also without editing storage)
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could retake the dicussion about releasing on steam :toptri:
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just 100€ from donations
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So it's because we no longer have hardcoded DATA_DIR
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks for files from cwd?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe it should look from executable
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> Can we talk later? @Ryozuki  @deen
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> bb
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe it should look from binary
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure how we should fix this
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @SkyHDTV not sure what for
19:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vxXuX
19:18 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master a9a7109 def: Revert "Allow specifying DATA_DIR by compiler option"...
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anything more for hotfix release?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not that i know of
19:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vxXzU
19:20 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 910b507 def: Version 11.1.1
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ f3 and f4 texts when voting are still too high I think
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and text next to tee in killmessages
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the text "Score board" as well as your own finish time in scoreboard
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> server doesnt save rcon password after update
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> autoexec_server.cfg was changed :/
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> ♥
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think unless you typed something by youself it creates a new password everytine you open it.  now it does it always
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not for me
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> aaaah
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that might be fixed in 11.1.1
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because of path thingy
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum please try
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> do
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it still changes the password.  but i also still get the update announcement even after updating it and i am not sure if i type the right thing in Autoexec_server.log
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> eh
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> lol i am retarded...
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that means the update is broken?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or that
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i typed in .log    not cfg
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes. it was only my level 5 autism kicking in again 😄
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki works again in steam?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> server is full now .-.
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks to everyone working on DDNet
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a pleasure
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love this game to much
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> update seems broken. that has happened some times before on other updates. no matter how much ich redownload the new version it always shows "new version out"
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> update seems broken. that has happened some times before on other updates. no matter how much i redownload the new version it always shows "new version out"
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum that's probably a bug in 11.1 :/
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you'll have to download new version manually, sorry
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> a shit
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> Hello, how do you think it would be good to sponsor the qshar kog gores? or create a ddgores many countries does not have server of gores and only has little maps to play in dddrace of ddnet who agrees of a force thank you for the attention
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As said, there are many implications for a merger, we'd slow them down and they'd slow us down, we need to start sharing servers which means they'll need to either use our infrastructure or we'd need to revise it together. Also might need to upgrade some of the servers to accommodate the extra people.
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> but how? I think it would work qshar with ddnet
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i am for releasing more gores maps on ddnet
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and eventually they can be seperated into their own ddgores server category
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but how what?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> he is just trolling qshar
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :thonkery:
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> am i supposed to feel like im being trolled because ddnet hosts fng? lol
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes we are totally trolling you
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :O
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> ddnet has a lot of ddrace servers in each country could replace some by ddgores or qshar kog
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ineffective troll, more fng servers is always good :happy:

20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> Hello, how do you think it would be good to sponsor the qshar kog gores? or create a ddgores many countries does not have server of gores and only has little maps to play in dddrace of ddnet who agrees of a force thank you for the attention
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do you keep posting that

20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> ok thx
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> come to teeland.net to test telegun :3
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ actually, the new release does lag a lot more
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can feel it while playing
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on modern intel gpu
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, or something wrong with my system
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can't reproduce reliably
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well the new release crashed already a few times, while I had never problems before and I was up to date with updating
21:32 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vxXD9
21:32 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master c8c4fd5 def: Fix reconnect timer display...
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b not good, can you reproduce and/or debug?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I can reproduce it, not now tho
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I have no knowledge about debugging
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Tried to compile it once and it felt impossible xd
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> ♥
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Hi, I got a bug using the editor after updating my client. I pressed the windows key and when I returned to the client my mouse was invisible, I saw it moving thanks to the x,y position and both right and left clicks were “disabled”. Couldn’t access to the menu (save...) by random clicks but could still ctrl shift e and play without problems.
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do we put braces on 1 line ifs?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think we do
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>

22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this isnt my function
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses no braces for 1 line ifs
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw this a lot
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I prefer braces for further Extensions
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And sometimes readbility
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it kills readability
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hate it too, take it up with @heinrich5991
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the code you found weird, i copied it, it detects if laser hit a tee
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hits*
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it checks also if laser can hit tees etc
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> resizing window on linux breaks the text temporarily @Jupstar ✪
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I guess that's not so bad, just for the kill messages
