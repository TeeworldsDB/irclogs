10:55 <+bridge> <deen> Hi again ðŸ˜„
10:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im home now xD
11:02 <+bridge> <Control> @eujax steam kullandÄ±ÄŸÄ±m halde ban attÄ±n
11:03 <+bridge> <Control> @eujax ekran veya baÅŸka bir kanÄ±t sunabilirim
11:11 <+bridge> <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 help, my RUS server keeps losing network every few minutes
11:11 <+bridge> <deen> after I upgraded it
11:11 <+bridge> <deen> nothing in dmesg, but "ip addr" just shows no ip address anymore
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> how can you run the command "ip addr" if it has no ip or network?
11:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, do we get a kvm or sth?
11:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nothing in dmesg is bizarre. You sure logging didn't break with the upgrade?
11:24 <+bridge> <ReiTW> because ip addr shows all available devices and isnt related if your interface is up or not
11:26 <+bridge> <ReiTW> I think ip addr actually just show info available at /sys/class/net, not sure
11:26 <+bridge> <deen> I switched from dhcp to static ip now and seems stable since then
11:26 <+bridge> <deen> I guess some misconfiguration on their dhcp setup
11:30 <+bridge> <ReiTW> did u check dhcp logs
11:42 <+bridge> <deen> I don't even know where to check them ðŸ˜„
11:43 <+bridge> <deen> Ok, found something: https://gist.github.com/def-/2adcfeb4e07a64685e76756716484db2
11:44 <+bridge> <deen> Looks like this: "Another app is currently holding the xtables lock" caused the problem
11:44 <+bridge> <deen> Not getting it anymore though, so weird
11:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> Maybe upgrade caused 2 dhcp clients to be installed?
12:12 <+bridge> <ReiTW> funny looks like you have a script running somewhere
12:12 <+bridge> <ReiTW> which probably attempts to dhclient
12:19 <+bridge> <ReiTW> is sh another daemon?
12:19 <+bridge> <ReiTW> is sh another daemon/service?
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> what are the chances that building llvm on a raspberry pi with 4gb disk space will be fun?
12:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> 0
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> fak
12:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> Will take you hours
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> ok i guess ill not do it then :(
12:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> If you can maybe try to crossbuild it
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> seems somehow im missing the compiler-rt for arm
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> bit weird maybe i understood it wrong
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ReservedField/arm-compiler-rt
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> hm "easy cross compiler"
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> 6y no activity no way that builds xd
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> shouldnt clang sanitizier work out of the box on raspbian?
12:30 <+bridge> <deen> I think so, did you install compiler-rt?
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> no
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> i only installed clang i assumed it would shit compiler-rt
12:32 <+bridge> <deen> you should, maybe llvm-dev
12:32 <+bridge> <deen> contains it
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> ah oke thanks ima try
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> i deactivated ubsan for now that works with only asan
12:33 <+bridge> <deen> If you want to build something, always install the *-dev packages, otherwise it's just for running. I hope that's all
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> clang-dev is not found i went with llvm and llvm-runtime instead
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> bra why does it remove "version = 3" from Cargo.lock during build and thus makes the working tree dirty :)
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> seems like thats a issue with debian 11 rust so i guess ima get latest w rustup
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> meh sad i still get ``error: undefined reference to '__mulodi4'`` w llvm-runtime
12:45 <+ChillerDragon> guess ill have to run asan on x86 then
12:47 <+bridge> <deen> Add `-rtlib=compiler-rt` to the flags
12:47 <+bridge> <deen> Should be this issue: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16404
12:48 <+bridge> <deen> Found some occurences with workarounds, for example https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21294 https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/184
12:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: have you tried rustc-mozilla?
12:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's more up-to-date rust
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> yea i went with the defaults of this installer script https://rustup.rs/ it didnt modify cargo.lock anymore
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> is rustc-mozilla a debian package? if so maybe that should be put into the ddnet readme instead of cargo
12:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > On older distributions `rustc` version might be too old, to get an up-to-date Rust compiler you can use rustup with stable channel instead or try the `rustc-mozilla` package.
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> yea ok fair
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> Yo deen thanks btw good find but comes with new problems the runtime file is not found i spend way too much time on this alr i will just find a x86 machine for debugging
20:17 <+bridge> <GumbaTW> [Suggestion] Tag servers with difficulties & stars so u can filter a difficulty range via a double slider, instead of plain text filtering via name
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe could be done with the new http master
21:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet servers could report map stars and diff via the json payload right
21:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this requires some changes to make the server know the map metadata tho
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> well
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> i found this in sash client disassebled code
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> ```cpp
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> Game.Chat:Say(0, "I suck and I dont want to live anymore, I would want to suck \"..owner..\"'s cock because it's so big and hard")
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> ```
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> :troll:
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> i found this in sash client disassembled code
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> ```cpp
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> Game.Chat:Say(0, "I suck and I dont want to live anymore, I would want to suck \"..owner..\"'s cock because it's so big and hard")
22:03 <+bridge> <scar17off> ```
22:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @scar17off no mentioning cheat clients
22:19 <+bridge> <scar17off> ok
23:54 <+bridge> <n0b0> what is 3.86.106.128 why it connect to every server
