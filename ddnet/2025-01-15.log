15:17 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> where is console commands file is located?
15:17 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> in game source
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all over the place
15:18 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> where i can add new commands
15:18 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i mean
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply search for `->Register(` in the global source
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything beyond you gotta find out yourself ig xd
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doubt there is a tutorial
15:19 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i think i found
15:20 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> no i didn't
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u think ppl use tclient just to be cool or they actually like it
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel thee is so psycological thing
15:26 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> hekl
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> you feel special by not using the norm
15:26 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> hell
15:26 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> help
15:27 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> please
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> no

15:27 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> bruh
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> you ping me when im talking to someone else
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats annoying
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and so im not helping now
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, it has some cool features.
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i could imagine lot of ppl use other clients simply because their friend do so xd
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was playing wiht a friend
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> he uses tclient and it crashed xD
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use latest main commit and no crashes
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> gigachad
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> robyte the fixing machine
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> hey i fixed a segfault too
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> :deen_star:
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> im making the blacklist word feature
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 💫
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> with a local and downloaded word list
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> (optional client side censoring)
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder how many kids play
15:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :brownbear:  and i did nothing today

15:37 < bridge> <learath2> Cmoon, are you really not going to help skibidisigma?
15:39 < bridge> <louis> @skibidisigma8261451 what are u trying to add
15:40 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> commands in F1
15:40 < bridge> <louis> what command
15:40 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> which i can run in local console
15:41 < bridge> <louis> i mean what does the command do
15:41 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it will do what i say in the code
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:stepfunnsus:1031597907742310480>

15:47 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what
15:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's very easy to learn how to write some, there are plenty of examples in the client code that you can mimic
16:01 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> bro
16:01 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i waited 30 mins wsl to install
16:01 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> and i didn't press run install
16:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> skill issue
16:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> @jupeyy_keks gawd dayum :kek: - where was the local file again?

16:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah wait i think i cna just rebind it to mouse_middle
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i renamed it 😄
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you self compile better use the above commits too 😄
16:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> will do :kek:
16:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> i might need to pr some windows fixes
16:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> lets see
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you compile with mingw?
16:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye
16:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> msvc is a bully
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good, the CI also uses mingw
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i couldn't get some stuff to work with msvc yet
16:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> is the save_path (e.g %appdata%/DDNet-Rs-Alpha/config) supposed to have /map/maps or is that just the wrong path to look in for ?

16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think it simply gets created once u save a map xd
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but we need a list
16:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> :cat_woah:  :kek:
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for all things
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why cant we create a thread in mapping xd
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use ur premium powers
16:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> can't :c
16:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> issue tracker on github it is
16:58 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> guess so
16:59 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> I don't have options to build client/server
17:00 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it said i have to install the rust
17:01 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> why should i download games
17:01 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> if i need ddnet
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> read dis if you're on windows:
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#building-on-windows-with-the-visual-studio-ide
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> and dis for linux:
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies-on-linux--macos
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> also if you're on windows - make sure to clone with --recursive
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you already did that, do `git submodule update --init --recursive`
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> also if you're on windows - make sure to clone with --recursive
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you already cloned without, do `git submodule update --init --recursive`
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didnt u know ddnet is based on the game rust
17:05 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> oh
17:05 < bridge> <learath2> This is not very skibidi of you
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no but just read the resources melon gave
17:05 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i cloned with visual studio
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nothing else u can do
17:06 < bridge> <learath2> Reading is not very sigma either grandpa. Give the compile command rn boomer
17:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> i reworked the entire building on windows section of the readme it better be working :cat_sad:
17:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> nah man your rizz is so 2022, -20 aura
17:08 < bridge> <louis> isn't he using wsl?
17:08 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> bro
17:08 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> wtf
17:08 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i need 200gb of storage
17:08 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> to download components from visual studio installer
17:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's actually only ~10gb
17:08 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> nah
17:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i pressed individual components section
17:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> :pepeW:  dont.
17:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> an selected all
17:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> DONT.
17:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> and
17:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what?
17:09 < bridge> <louis> are u using wsl or visual studio
17:09 < bridge> <louis> i don't think u need both
17:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> vs
17:10 < bridge> <louis> oh ok
17:10 < bridge> <louis> well read the github readme for detailed instructions 🤓
17:10 < bridge> <louis> i think u just need python c++ and cmake
17:10 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329120624559390761/IMG_20250115_181035_203.jpg?ex=67892f8a&is=6787de0a&hm=7b025b6967744caf05dc1273398ca958ead25cfd345c93809bd435ce8cb7015d&

17:11 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> bro why do i need python for c++ app
17:11 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it said i need python to compile ddnet
17:12 < bridge> <louis> please refer to the language percentage composition of the source code on github, it clearly has python 🤓
17:12 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> remove python
17:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> i took so much time reworking that readme too <a:NOOOO:1105477785797013514>
17:13 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> 2.8% of python
17:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Rewrite in Zig!
17:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rewrite in lisp 😬
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is what i expect from @learath2 tbh
17:14 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i think brainfuck is the best programming language
17:14 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> tbg
17:14 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> tbh
17:15 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329121701711183893/IMG_20250115_181458_806.jpg?ex=6789308b&is=6787df0b&hm=56f01eaa62827b64f7bcfa7f0b225dca3d9ce656689d2822ddd32bc385bb3c7f&
17:15 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> do i need generate this
17:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's not so bad but the annoying part is that to compile it you still need to detect common algorithms like addition and multiplication (and less common algorithms like division) and translate those into the relevant machine instructions
17:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so you might as well have multiplication and addition in the language itself and suddenly you've totally lost the spirit of bf
17:16 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> OHH
17:16 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> I CAN COMPILE DDNET NOW
17:16 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i installed python
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is something to uninstall
17:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> what kind of goober doesn't have like at least a few versions of Python on their system?
17:17 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i had python before
17:17 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> but i deleted windows by mistake
17:17 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> and the half of system
17:18 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> that's why I haven't had time to download python for the new windows yet
17:20 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329123105150341172/IMG_20250115_182023_584.jpg?ex=678931da&is=6787e05a&hm=61754f4904c2e37bfe0d232b19d97059ec2734b157a97a5cec1e136161f9c7e5&
17:20 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it said build failed before
17:20 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what should i do

17:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> absolute Windows moment...
17:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> using Visual Studio even, absolutely deranged
17:23 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> nvm it was error in my code
17:24 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> no
17:24 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it not my error
17:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Your first mistake was trying to use VS
17:25 < bridge> <louis> just follow the instructions on github, it should work fine
17:25 < bridge> <louis> if the build failed then look at the console to see the errors
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i gotta finish my msys2 guide
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i was writing the whole thing in stackedit and one day my cache for that site was cleared and i lost it lmfao
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> I'm only a medium zig fan. Not sold yet
17:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i always thought zig was cool but you intrinsically give up potential for many optimizations by transpiling to c as weird as it sounds
17:28 < bridge> <Ewan> thoughts on vlang
17:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i love vs
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> That's nim, zig emits llvm ir directly
17:37 < bridge> <Ewan> is this new? or was i just misinformes
17:37 < bridge> <Ewan> is this new? or was i just misinformed
17:37 < bridge> <learath2> Hm I can't think of a time when zig wasn't emiting llvm ir in some way
17:38 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i guess that’s me
17:38 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
17:46 < bridge> <kebscs> Vs isnt the problem
17:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but it is *a* problem
17:46 < bridge> <kebscs> U just press 1 button on cloned ddnet and it works straight away
17:46 < bridge> <Ewan> not inherently but they do change shit a lot and it is a lot more button clicking and waiting on shit to install
17:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for all humankind
17:47 < bridge> <kebscs> If that causes trouble idk what these people gonna do with code
17:47 < bridge> <Ewan> actually true as well
17:47 < bridge> <Ewan> but if that’s the topic we may as well start with the fact that their name is skibidisigma
17:50 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks what do I have to write in the ddnet rendering code (players.cpp) to get the current tick (or interpolated tick) of the demo that is playing
17:53 < bridge> <patiga> I'm trying to debug my muzzle flash rendering, but its so difficult without that
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> I always wonder what the people that have trouble following the most basic instructions will do with the code. But I don't ask it because I'm not allowed to judge with a green name
17:54 < bridge> <kebscs> The visual studio noobfilter
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> Idk if this is available there directly. You might need to reach into the demo code
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i kinda don’t want to help people in this chat anymore
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s obviously mostly botters coming in here for questions
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i wanna be a good samaritan or whatever but
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think it gets that from the client
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ive had ppl follow up in dm being like can u help with my bot?
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But believe it or not, I never touched that code either xD
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> no dude
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> xdd
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> We should record an unregistered hypercam video building ddnet
18:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> hi gy [backspace] uys today i will sj [backspace] how you how to compile ddnet. step one is to go to go to nixos.org and
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> download rust
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> then rewrite ddnet in rust
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> to compile it with just cargo
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> :deen_star:
18:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> then dedicate your life to vulkan shaders
18:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> congrats you are now jupstar
18:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> joke doesnt hit the same anymore
18:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> thanks ryozuki
18:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kekw:
18:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> i'm live testing out jupsti's dual mapping editor with catseye right now btw!
18:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> works like a charm and is really sick
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust powered
18:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> wait wdym dual mapping editor
18:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you can edit 2 maps at once?
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> im glad u overcame it
18:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 2 people in client changing the map at the same time!
18:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's awesome!
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> Is it actually useful though would be my question.
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> absolutely
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> it not only speeds up the process but is a lot of fun
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> I would be very curious to see if you'd use it long term ever
18:45 < bridge> <hectavoxel> omfg
18:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> me and cats are currently making an actual playable map with it :3
18:45 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i get home in an hour
18:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://www.twitch.tv/blaizephyr FyI (no promotion)
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how many mappers even map on one map 😄
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> collaborative map editor?
19:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> duude i so wanna try this with someone
19:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> waiting for my bus home rn
19:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> YES
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i love that idea
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i did a lot of stuff for a collaborative music editor
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> that kind of workflow really is unmatched
19:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I would like to make a game :feelsbadman:
19:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But I don't know how to make games :feelsbadman:
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
19:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/cessen/ropey
19:23 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
19:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> rewrite ddnet in rust
19:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> totally worth it
19:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet/ddnet-rs 😃
19:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
19:30 < bridge> <Ewan> seems to be a semi official endeavor now
19:30 < bridge> <Ewan> it exists
19:30 < bridge> <Ewan> is what i mean
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i couldn’t get it building on my machine last i tried but i only gave it about an hour lol
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> @blaiszephyr have you had any luck building it on nixos? have u tried?
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet-rs
19:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> it doesnt work
19:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> because we're bound to use a msvc patch right now which breaks linking when sandboxxed
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> this one: ffmpeg-sys-next = { git = "https://github.com/Jupeyy/rust-ffmpeg-sys.git", branch = "pr_mingw_workaround" }
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you change this to just use `https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg-sys` it should work i guess
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> lol wtf
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> that makes a lot of sense
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> this one:   `ffmpeg-sys-next = { git = "https://github.com/Jupeyy/rust-ffmpeg-sys.git", branch = "pr_mingw_workaround" }`
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you change this to just use `https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg-sys` it should work i guess
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> because we're bound to use a mingw patch right now which breaks linking when sandboxxed
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> tho i did not specify videorecorder flag or w/e and it still wasnt working
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you not simply build without ffmpeg for now?
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is the error
19:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> IIRC it's just a shared lib error
19:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> something with pkg-config being an arse on the nix/store really - lots of issues with it
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i couldn’t get it to find the libraries probably bcs a lot of c libs from nixpkgs don’t come with .pc files, ig
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> c problem
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:48 < bridge> <hectavoxel> aw did you stop mapping
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> shh not so loud my wife thinks i'm doing laundry rn.
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i gotta fix my twitch account… it’s been broken for like 3 years at this point, since i got my new phone and lost my 2fa
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> “New”
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> 3 generations old at this point
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Found a solution for your problem?
19:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> o shit theres a weapons datapack server now?
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat?
19:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329161574039949402/image.png?ex=678955ad&is=6788042d&hm=9b496c7f61c19874ed29ae1dbea98917d3b9dfd3ba36c0e9c8b68c168d692c99&
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> AH
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's simply the assets server, it hosts all assets (+skins)
19:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ah
20:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I wanna write something in C :p
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> write ddnet physics in rust, please
20:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> or contribute to twgame
20:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> same thing
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @kollpotato c'mon u like it
20:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea i forked it and i have no idea what to do xD
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add switch layer
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or deep freeze
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or /spec
20:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> i currently recover from the coding depression
20:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> because i dont think i can make anything harder than a todo app
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> r u 50 years old?
20:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> divide by 3
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then you can still learn
20:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm bad at mafs :lol:
20:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> you look at the source -> you understand it -> you port it to rust
20:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> understanding is the hardest part
20:30 < bridge> <oxyzo.> so you are 16.6666666666666
20:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
20:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> actually its pretty accurate
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
20:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> im gonna be 17 in like half a year
20:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no
20:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> so old
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> shit’s hard
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> but literally all u need is perseverance
20:31 < bridge> <oxyzo.> grandpa
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> there is no secret to being smart
20:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea thats what i try to do now
20:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> fighting the borrow checker every day
20:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> I tried to do some things from the to do I set up today, saw I had to familiarize myself with egui and just quit, now I'm watching anime
20:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> :greenthing:
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> immediate mode GUIs for non-game use-cases :feelsbadman:
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> try cxx-qt, KDAB is putting a shitton of work into it
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s getting good
20:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> maybe he was doing something with ddnet-rs
20:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> afaik it uses egui
20:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yes :kek:
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> and u might think this is nothing but think about laptop batteries and shit
20:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> noice
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just overkill
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> or underkill
20:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/issues/67#issue-2790295628
20:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> how is this an issue
20:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329173160100233266/image.png?ex=67896078&is=67880ef8&hm=4a8fd86750dd114b41311a9bb5164d9e5830eb90baf0a130720f42ff47c0ed75&
20:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> empty maps are not supported?
20:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Not yet :kek:
20:40 < bridge> <oxyzo.> too much weight, cant support them:nouis: \
20:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh because it loads an existing map right
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yeah, ctf1 is hardcoded atm
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe it's enough to just add an empty map and ship that really
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> The .twmap format is only 3kb after all. @jupeyy_keks
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
20:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> .twmap is a custom format?
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> the format is a fixed size?
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought ddnet maps didn’t really have boundaries like that except as imposed by the server’s out of bounds stuff
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> size was arbitrary
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> why still no index
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329174025955577930/image.png?ex=67896146&is=67880fc6&hm=cdeebadb5d6cdadd88cba9c8295c642dc6aa1322596e320b0f15f1fe21b9073f&
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> github lazy
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> whenever i open ddnet-rs rust analyzer just goes kaputt
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> and takes 5gb of ram
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well as said the twmap format is really just the map data
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> waiting for some pod to free most likely so it can index the repo
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without any assets
20:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> New format, questions towards Jupsti for that
20:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> :owo:
20:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> nice
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i already fixed that
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so pls don't fix xd
20:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> are you working on implementing connections to ddnet servers?
20:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> or is it not in the plans rn
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is not planned at all tbh
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the database, the map format and the physics are compatible
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nothing else is needed
20:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> i initially thought that was supposed to be a replacement for the ddnet client xD
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imo that would be a waste of effort, even if it might sound counter intuitive
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i make a client in rust that works with the current system, then it's really just a 1:1 rewrite, and the benefit is not that huge.
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If i design a completely new client & server, I can add features not possible before and thus give it at least a _potential_ future
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> much of the benefit comes from the client and server being one codebase
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of duplicate shit if u were to make a ddnet-compatible client that also has its own schemes for stuff
20:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> that makes more sense now
20:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> thanks for the explanation
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i also think ddnet rs should try its best to not give into backwards compatibility obligations
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i think that’s where lots of the convolution started
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> break shit
21:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> im back to implementing snapshots from scratch in rust
21:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> i hate it ngl
21:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> easier to write another protocol
21:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> without them
21:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> hmm now i wonder how ddnet-rs protocol works
21:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh right twsnap exists
21:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> i forgor
21:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> nvm it doesnt support teeworlds
21:25 < bridge> <learath2> I also think ddnet-rs shouldn't just break shit because it's fun to break shit. Don't break shit that works
21:25 < bridge> <learath2> It's all fun and games until we end up with 8 forks that are not intercompatible
21:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> Actually that might be fun too, back in my day we used to have to download 5 different patches of age of empires 2 to play with everyone
21:33 < bridge> <learath2> I had this weird patch switcher thing with cool dubstep music in the back
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> if it’s linear and version-based API changes then it’s fine
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you just insist that the user use the newest client. the cost of innovation
21:46 < bridge> <learath2> Costs are only worth paying if the return is worth it
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> well nobody is expecting stability from this codebase yet
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> this is more of a fun project than something aiming to replace proper DDNet atm, so i think we should change things (only as much as necessary obv)
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> I'm just saying don't go breaking stuff that doesn't need breaking because you are annoyed at us keeping the old codebase very stable
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> oh it’s not a spite thing
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> if it ain’t broke don’t fix it
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> on the other hand. If it’s broke. Fucking fix it
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> on the other hand. If it’s broken. Fucking fix it
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> if it ain’t broken don’t fix it
