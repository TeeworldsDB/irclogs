01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> colors now looks better on 4k skins too
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ooh, an updated tee renderer?
05:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> is it possible to make tune for a non automatic shotgun and with no bounce?
07:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Could you investigate why some skin can render white feet, while other not?
07:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Some skin can only have grey feet
08:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Y. Tell me
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ah but its normal, its the feet arent white without applied color, its not possible to make them white
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Apply white color feet and look at previews in browser skin.
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Some skins will have grey foot
08:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its because, to get the white color, the skin color by default has to be very light
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> otherwise it will be grey ))
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> White color should be settable in each skin
08:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> maybe :blobcatmaybe:

14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> relevant i guess
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > A new reflection/amplification distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) vector with a record-breaking potential amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1 has been abused by attackers in the wild to launch multiple high-impact DDoS attacks.
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from UDP port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> the color of the texture gets multiplied by the set color, after each color is normalized into the range 0..1
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> thats why it can't get brighter than the texture color, its can't be multiplied by a color/value greater than 1
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> *it
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Rockus> this
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> if there was a quick chat i imagine there would be a cooldown
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y üòÑ
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> teeworlds colors are actually cool
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks did u start the os-dev rust tutorial
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its actually p good
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL that x86 has a 4 level memory page tables, and the TBL caching etc, the last thing i did was implement various allocators, a bump allocator, a linked list one and a fixed size block one
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it actually fits so well with rust
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can encapsulate the unsafe stuff rly ez
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have dynamic memory in ryo-os now
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> next is threading
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> god-sent resources
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <APFFF> Why is there only one "small fng" server?
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ask @noby its his server
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> that vps has very low resources and running more on it causes trouble
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> at some point in the future we have plans to upgrade it
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <APFFF> üò¶
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <APFFF> I really prefer it over fng2+ but its always blocked with people doing 1v1
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i can ask my friend who hosts for me about it later
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <APFFF> thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe i start in my holidays
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> noby#5436\: I got an empty vps I gotta pay for anyways. So if you need some servers tell me \:)
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Feels like mobile pings are broken
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> noby has root access to Bombay dedicated srv, but never hosts anything on it :v)
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> @noby ure shy üëâ üëà
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> @Voxel working on the color feature ^^
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951247398141849701/blue-yellow.png
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> YAY
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> wtf is up with the image quality
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldren> just put blur filter
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Coldren cendren cellegen idk you guys sound the Same for me üòÇ
