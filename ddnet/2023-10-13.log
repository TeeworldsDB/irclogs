01:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @deen have not tried it, would this be useful for not needing the mac to codesign the mac build? https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/stable/
02:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (found here: https://ruoyusun.com/2023/10/12/one-game-six-platforms.html)
04:39 < bridge> <murpi> Invite the bot to your server and use the `$records register` command to enable the bot to send the messages from #records to your server's channel.
04:40 < bridge> <murpi> (`$records unregister` to unsubscribe)
04:46 < bridge> <_gwendal> Messages in #records aren't "published", so you can't receive them in another server by following the channel
06:42 < bridge> <Ewan> you could just use the built in discord feature...
08:13 < bridge> <murpi> What built in discord feature?
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels-
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> >https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels->
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels->
08:15 < bridge> <murpi> Is there a built in feature to automatically publish messages?
08:20 < bridge> <murpi> 😬
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> did you read the link
08:23 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, I did, did you?
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> you select a channel and then people can choose to ‘subscribe’ to that channel. every message in that channel will be mirrored to any subscriber channels
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> records is actually already an announcement channel
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> so the bot feature is unnecessary
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162277545031516180/IMG_3707.png?ex=653b5a50&is=6528e550&hm=5e40b3afdfc211378c180554d8f19fddb62067ff904b349ecdc5141d33abaa3f&
08:36 < bridge> <murpi> So you didn't read the article
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> how does it work any differently
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it just doesn’t require the bot this way
08:36 < bridge> <murpi> You haven't read Gwendals message and you linked to an article you haven't read yourself
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> then tell me what i fucking missed
08:37 < bridge> <murpi> The article even has a quick TLDR
08:38 < bridge> <murpi> keywords are literally in quotes too
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah, the messages are published are they not
08:41 < bridge> <murpi> Read the article you've linked yourself. :pepeW:
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> derp
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> the article isn’t the issue i just never saw gwendal’s message in the first place lol
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i just saw the bot feature and thought it was silly since an exact feature already exists on discord
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> still don’t know why they aren’t published messages though
09:23 < bridge> <learath2> They come through a webhook, just no api to do it through there
09:24 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if we can have the bot watch that channel and publish everything
10:31 < bridge> <deen> it's not the only blocker, the dmg generation also uses Apple's proprietary tools
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> if only the world used linux
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know about https://skarnet.org/software/s6/index.html
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://skarnet.org/software/s6/overview.html
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, I never used it tho
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> The only supervisor I tried under openrc was runit
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
10:41 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> good 3 in the morning
10:42 < bridge> <learath2> Sleep when?
10:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i think it is better than runit, the only problem is its not as famous
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i have to be up at 7
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> to get car from the shop
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> after paying $700 for them to fix
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> feelsbadman
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> It might be, I never really looked too deep into it. Honestly, start-stop-daemon has never let me down 😄
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should have a car mechanic friend
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have one, but i have no car kek
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> That's how I know pidfile races are raaare, a decade of messing around with servers and running linux desktops, only once did I have to deal with a pidfile issue and it was permissions
10:44 < bridge> <learath2> I can see it being less rare at the scales of thousands of machines though
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> Sell car, move to europ
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> problem is they can’t find the time to do it
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> No more maintainance cost for car, no more gas expense
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and i’d wanna pay them anyway
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> would still like to have car tho
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> car is cool
10:46 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
10:49 < bridge> <learath2> And precision scheduled railroading is insanity too. Trains longer than the passing tracks....
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> amtrak is  crazy expensive and just shoddily ran since nobody really uses it
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> people really only do it to sightsee. i only know one person who’s used it to get from point a to point b, and that’s cuz they’re scared to fly
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> idk about it
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> There is that one cool route on that old seaside track on the west coast. I want to do that for sightseeing sometime
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> im sure the route is cool but being on the west coast at all would ruin it for me
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> To cut costs on personnel the freight companies started scheduling all freight at specific times so they can have monster trains that are so long that amtrak trains, even if they have priority, physically don't have the space to pass them
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
10:52 < bridge> <learath2> Amazing for shareholder 📈 📈
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> typically
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> Are you an east coast enjoyer or a midwest enjoyer?
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> neither
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> Perfect
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> im in the mountains
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> Alaskan?
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> naw
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> alaska cool tho
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> im in Colorado
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> considered west but not the same as west coast
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> and technically im east of the continental divide
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i drive over it every few weeks
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> Only people avoiding the law and crab catchers live in alaska
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> Crab catchers sounds wrong. What does one call a person that catches crabs?
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> fisherman
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> Fisher? Surely not
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> crabberman
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> Are crab even fish? 😄
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> nah
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> overly sexually active
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, apparently you still do fish for crab TIL
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i like crab
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> never had fresh crab only lobster
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s very hard when you’re this landlocked
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> okay time to sleep for 4 hours
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, i used wayland lately.. still way too unfinished
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in maplayers.cpp there often is a calculation * 6 * sizeof(unsigned int)
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can change all occurances to remove the *6 * sizeof(...)
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then apply it in the TileLayerVisual instead
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's still legacy code when i used a different approach first. but it it's useless and makes the total number of tiles smaller
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think we generated the DMG on linux before the change to also build the arm binaries

13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i didnt use it myself
13:44 < bridge> <learath2> Preventing our null partten

13:46 < bridge> <patiga> also "data craces" :bluekitty:
13:46 < bridge> <learath2> That's also important to prevent
13:47 < bridge> <patiga> but to be fair, it managed to write the language name correctly nearly every time
13:47 < bridge> <learath2> It is surprisingly good at generating actual letters. In my experience with stable diffusion, it only created things that vaguely look like letters if you look from afar

13:51 < bridge> <_gwendal> ig the 2nd one is the easiest
13:52 < bridge> <_gwendal> btw, do anyone manually publish the messages in #announcements ? because they are, so maybe the bot already does it, just not in records
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> Could be, I dont really remember
14:56 < bridge> <deen> Yes, but it doesn't support the nice DMG features with fancy images
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think firefox generates DMGs on linux. is it using a DMGs without fancy images?
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that scoreboard lmao

15:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I tried to localize 0.5 with 0 c++ knowledge at the time
15:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> failed so hard that I quit until 0.6 came out
15:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i must have joined shortly after 0.6 released
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so barely missed 0.5
15:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there weren't any servers for us to play anyway
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki today is FFR
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> r u tokio pro?
15:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Fixed Foveated Rendering
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> O.O
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what neurons did i trigger here xd
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> autocompletion
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> VR
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what else xd
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> seen too much
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i have ADHD
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i c
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> r u nvidia ceo now?
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> after your 18h days for 1 year
15:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think our new hire is super confused about how I communitate
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ask
15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also what is FFR actually
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont wanna sound rude, but somehow lately it feels everyone on internet has adhd
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's how I feel as well
15:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i don't actually have ADHD, not diagnosed at least
15:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think im normal
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
15:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: I would love to know if I'm actually tho
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i kinda want to have control over when a current_thread runtime makes "one tick"
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smth like "advance all async jobs"
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can use `block_on`. but that actually blocks the current thread until completion
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think ADHD people love to tell everyone they might have ADHD as well
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> and "depression"
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but talking about this is a bit taboo
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just feel like people use their own bads to preach stuff or make it seem they got the reason just because they got x bad stuff
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> haha i got cancer now i got the reason!
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean polling?
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can poll manually a future iirc
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a bit more  advanced
15:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> me: hate people talking about that myers–briggs personality stuff. also me: haha adhd
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-do-i-get-a-context-to-manually-call-poll/79898
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i basically want to give all async tasks "thread time". but if they decide to yield, they should
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should not result in a waiting state
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm maybe thats not possible
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean i think u cant forcefully make a task yield
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but somehow e.g. io tasks do it
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> tokio is a cooperative scheduler
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Tasks are scheduled cooperatively. Most operating systems implement preemptive multitasking. This is a scheduling technique where the operating system allows each thread to run for a period of time, and then preempts it, temporarily pausing that thread and switching to another. Tasks, on the other hand, implement cooperative multitasking. In cooperative multitasking, a task is allowed to run until it yields, indicating to the Tokio runtime’s sc
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant do preemptive scheduling in tokio
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah i have no multithreading at all
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is what golang is good at
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's one problem xd
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😭
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its the advantage of having a gc
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> u would need rust compiler support to do this this in rust iirc
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think i mentioned this to @heinrich5991 once
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> or i asked him xd
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks u can check execution time between tasks yields
15:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:  also a fun fact, ADHD medications is illegal here and have the same classification along with all the hard drugs.
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks what u working on btw
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i kinda would like to have some file system API.. but it should work as if u are not targeting WASM
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i kinda dont want to introduce multi threading
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean  this https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/index.html ?
15:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> iirc there was a high schooler got arrested for taking ritalin to improve focus. and they found him because his score got higher and a teacher got suspicious lmao.
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well wasm doesnt know about file systems
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i made a custom API
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2: fun
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it work so well? xd
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i always felt like shit after eating sugar to improve my performance xD
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not the whole story, but the premise is pretty funny
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sugar crush is a thing i think?
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I do feel like I never could work on a thing for more than a hour tho
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably another reason i was doing 18 hour works just cuz I'm too slow
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest in peace
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 18h xd that's such anti life
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it must be teeworlds 3.0 to convince me to waste so much time
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, i haven't done that in two months which is a improvement i guess
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I basically throw out my work to interns and just teach him to do them instead of doing works myself
16:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:  probably not a ideal way of working
16:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> but at least I could just fire like 10 ideas at him per day and do the implementation later instead of doing the boring stuff for an hour and cry
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s very effective
16:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you experienced
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in adhd medications
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> not really
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> I’ve taken them
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you neurotypical
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> probably
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s hard to make yourself put in the effort to do something when you know there’s a pill that will let you do it without hesitation
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it just work on anyone that's probably why it is illegal here, cuz it is kinda weird for a drug to control mental processing
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i honestly thought it wasn't really useful for normal people
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it just work on anyone that's probably why it is illegal here, cuz it is kinda weird for a drug to control people's mental processing ability
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> some would say the tech industry in the western world is run by adderall
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> probably other industries too
16:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's doesn't sound healthy
16:08 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not
16:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that doesn't sound healthy
16:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is also kinda wild that there are so many type of drugs that are FDA approved and you can just buy them OTC in the US tho, but ethanol is just a huge no-no there.
16:08 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
16:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ethanol is sold ‘ootc’ to anyone 21+
16:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean that (
16:09 < bridge> <Ewan> u thinking the age limit is ridiculous?
16:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> kinda
16:09 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it is kinda
16:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well drinking alchohols maybe it's fair
16:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> our rubbing alchohols are all ethanol based and available on shelves. i've never seen isopropyl alchohol here in china
16:10 < bridge> <Ewan> why else would you buy it? it’s already in most gasoline as an additive for efficiency’s sake & rubbing alcohol is usually isopropanol
16:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> can you make vodka just out of pure alchohol
16:11 < bridge> <Ewan> im no expert but you could probably water it down for a spirit that won’t kill you
16:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> interesting
16:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also some store clerk are a jerk
16:12 < bridge> <Ewan> people even drink mouthwash. nothing to stop them if it’s just pure off the shelf
16:12 < bridge> <Ewan> mostly homeless people
16:12 < bridge> <Ewan> alcoholism is one of the saddest conditions around here
16:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i was 23 while i was in the US but I don't just bring my passport everywhere, a 7-11 clerk refused to sell my friend a drink just because we talked and made me feel bad
16:13 < bridge> <Ewan> he would be on the line if he didn’t id you
16:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i can feel like he felt like he was doing justice
16:13 < bridge> <Ewan> don’t feel bad
16:13 < bridge> <Ewan> he would be in trouble if he didn’t i.d. you
16:13 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe not 30 years ago but that’s how it is now
16:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i payed for my own stuff
16:13 < bridge> <Ewan> they i.d. old people
16:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i paid for my own stuff
16:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> he wasn't in the same line
16:13 < bridge> <Ewan> even if they’re sure the customer is 21+ they still do it
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was kinda weird someone would just notice us talking even tho we are not even heading to the same place.
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just happened to run into the guy
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and they refused to sell him a drink
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :wtf:
16:14 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
16:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just happen to run into the guy
16:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> man i still hate that guy lol
16:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't like the way he talked to my friend either
16:15 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i misread this
16:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> overall very weird experience
16:15 < bridge> <Ewan> you have to i.d. everyone involved always
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> as to avoid selling the alcohol to a minor indirectly
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> same deal
16:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> like that would actually work but i guess it is fair
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> It used to
16:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still didn't like the way he talks tho
16:16 < bridge> <Ewan> most 7-11 clerks are assholes
16:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a sorry we can't sell that to you is probably fine.
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> he was like nice try dude, don't think we wouldn't know
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> one of my neighbors works at a 7-11 and he wears full face protection as to conceal his identity (???) and wears a bodycam at all time
16:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and chewed out my then 9 year old brother over playing with a sign near the parking lot that happened to say that he had exclusive parking in that spot
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> despite the fact that the sign was not hurt and he did actually not own the sign
16:19 < bridge> <Ewan> they’re insane people
16:19 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of ppl in this tax bracket are insane 😀
16:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848>
16:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: oh speaking of age limit
16:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i’m like 95 percent sure the lady above us abuses her 2 or 3 kids
16:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> china lowered legal age of consent
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> my little brother befriended one of these kids and now he knocks at the door every few days without fail asking if he can come out and play. sometimes he does it during school hours (why isn’t he at school?) and he typically looks like he hasn’t bathed or been bathed in weeks
16:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but still no sexual material allowed for anyone and no video games until 18
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> considering calling CPS but we don’t have any evidence
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
16:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was lowered to 14
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> no video games
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> no fun zone
16:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> i think the game industry here are trying so hard to change that, but it only got more strict
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> are you seen as equal to someone who produces porn or smth
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> as a game dev
16:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> multi companies are trying to form an age rating system for video games, but at this point the ratings are really stupid now.
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you mean a fixed time slice with optional yielding? no, that's not possible
16:26 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no video games until 18? oO
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds impossible to enforce, even in china
16:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well on paper
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> don't children have smartphones?
16:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
16:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> don't you worry
16:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> with the power of the great firewall, only registered games are playable to most people i think
16:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and all video games published here are required to ID check
16:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do people <18 actually not play games?
16:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what about the apple app store? does apple allow control there?
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have never taken these drugs
16:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apple store are censored
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry my American brain defaults to western world = usa
16:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apple as a legal business in china have to comply with local law so not really surprising?
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> because you are not in the western hemisphere
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> america kek
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no games in the apple app store unless you prove to be 18+?
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can download some
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can download games
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i actually don't care how long the task runs. it should just not block
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> here most 24h stores or places that sell till late are run by pakistanies or turks, and they just have shitload of cameras and well they are always in group
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also interested in the answer to this, I would have thought this to be actually impossible @tsfreddie
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but you can't login
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> none of the games are offline
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> block in a sense of io blocking
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not bcs of runtime
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not allowed to publish offline video games unless the platform itself has age verification but the platform has to be registered as a publisher
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's no enforcement of this AFAIK
16:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in rust
16:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> note that even `println!` is IO ^^
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> println is slow iirc
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it also doesnt exist on WASM by default
16:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> legally you can play games as under age, but it was like 3 hours per week and only on friday saturday and sunday between 8 and 9 pm
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> getting the io lock and writing is faster i think
16:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and the illegal way is just steam
16:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think mobile game are basically no way around
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but kind of unrelated to the question at hand
16:32 < bridge> <Dreamless> the symptoms of adhd are pretty relatable..and just reading about it makes u think u may have it
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well my point was not that anyway
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i personally didn't find these stuff difficult, but I constantly see people asking how to register other games, which involves proxies and stuff
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ok, so in a typical school class of 14 year old people. how many would play video games? @tsfreddie
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for pc, steam is available with no age restriction
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just people using their possible neuropathies (or idk the word) as a sense of look i have this, and its a valid point in my argument kind of thing
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly, no idea
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just people using their possible neuropathies (or idk the word) as a sense of look i have this, and trying to make it as if its a valid point in my argument kind of thing
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just people using their possible neuropathies (or idk the word) as a sense of look i have this, and trying to make it as if its a valid point in their  argument kind of thing
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the restriction is emposed two years ago
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm already an adult
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you want my personal experience at age 14. then ye, i don't think anyone played any video games
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie do families follow the restriction at homes
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> or just let the kid play
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> sad life
16:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz phones aren't allowed at all at school and school hours were like 6am to 11pm
16:34 < bridge> <Dreamless> I think this thing existed 10 years ago aswell..I used to play on chinese gameservers that doesn't allow u to play more than 3hours/day if you don't have verified age identity
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> no phones in school
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> another stupid rule
16:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's per day. it is changed to per week on specific hours
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think a crack down on education hours, put a lot of student back at home off school, so they just restricted more on video games
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think a crack down on education hours put a lot of student back at home off school, so they just restricted more on video games
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's probably illegal to hold school hours after 6pm now
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @thekid36 are u from china?
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I watched the change happen while we were working on a moblie game
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was so stupid
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> most mobile game changed their targeted audience overnight
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> well limiting in this way what peopel can do is stupid
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean somehow tokio does this internally. all i want is control over it xd
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try_run_tasks
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i guess it doesn't exists, rip
16:37 < bridge> <Dreamless> Nope, but I'm chinese xd
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> lol?
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie do u feel chinese anime will ever be something good
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you do `std::io`/`std::fs` in a tokio task, tokio can't interrupt you
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i hope so?
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't watch them tho
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but ofc i use the tokio variants
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> now I understand the question
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie i know i wont watch chinese anime, because idk why but i cant stand chinese in anime, japanese sounds way better and fluid for me idk
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let me think
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe im just too used to it
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also dislike korean
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> racist
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese people feels the same way actually
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> korean manhwa is good af tho
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @jupeyy_keks you could probably "just" call the poll function of all the futures you're interested in
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually stratch that, i can't speak for all chinese people anyway
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie chinese manga is usually a bit boring too, and i think they cant put too much fanservice if u get what i mean
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> or blood
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> personally i think chinese voice acting is too new and still adjusting to the influence from japanese culture
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean japanese Seiyū are on another level
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what makes anime so epic
16:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the old chinese cartoon voice acting are decent with that era of animation styles. but the traditional animation studio are disappearing.
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually I'm probably not entirely sure whether I understand what you want yet
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsnxhALA-x4
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i love the english-japanese accent
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not in that new stuff sucks, i just think they probably need to re-establish they acting principles from scratch cuz they are just trying to sound japanese while speaking chinese at this moment
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> have you watched any english dub
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u think im a sinner?
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> english dub is probably how i feel about chinese voice acting at this stage
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i cannot stand dubs
16:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i kinda wish the traditional chinese animation could make a modern return tho
16:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> don't know how
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> normal tokio will run tasks in the background. when a task yields, it puts the task at the end of the queue again (and handles it later) or smth like that
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i basically want to run the queue too, and if a task yields. want to ignore it for now (until the next time my wasm module is called)
16:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I wish
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i can’t stand voice acting in general
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, so you want to be the executor yourself, somehow?
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could patch tokio to do that?
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe xd
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i guess for now i'll change my strategy and not directly support async code
16:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/1597
16:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> closed in favor of https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/4827
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well generally tokio works on WASM, but i can only `block_on` tasks
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and that's smth i don't want
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and over WASI i am not sure if they allow threads to run
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which i do not want
16:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> holy moly, how is it 11pm already. i feel like i just got home
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> moment
16:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> gn everyone
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> gn fred
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good night
16:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> gn
17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft u wont sleep right
17:09 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur awake
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> I’m getting my car
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> It’s 9am
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u sleep
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> Yea
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> time flies
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> Not much
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> indeed
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> I’m never paying to fix a starter again
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> My wallet hurts
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> `yield_now()` ?
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i was hoping the mechanic would do a bit more thorough of an inspection. looks like he didn't catch the rotor damage i have on the right driver's side
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> says brake pads have 80% left but i know that right one's squeaking already
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> highway robbery
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 my point is that u cant make a task yield between its await points
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz its cooperative
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i was hoping the mechanic would do a bit more thorough of an inspection. looks like he didn't catch the rotor damage i have on the front passenger's side
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i meant outside of the task
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk how to say it
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:41 < bridge> <learath2> Well yeah this one is impossible
17:41 < bridge> <learath2> That sort of interrupt you'll have to be on a lower level
18:07 < bridge> <teero777> But that wouldn't fix or explain my issue. It seems like while loading a 10x10k map ddner takes about 11GBs of ram. When finished it takes about 800mb which is expected
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> But that wouldn't fix or explain my issue. It seems like while loading a 10x10k map ddnet takes about 11GBs of ram. When finished it takes about 800mb which is expected
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it takes 11GB vram
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is the 10kx10k map full of tiles?
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like no air
18:10 < bridge> <teero777> There is air
18:11 < bridge> <teero777> It's a matze generation including hook unhook freeze and air
18:11 < bridge> <teero777> It's a maze generation including hook unhook freeze and air
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 10kx10k is quite a lot xd
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100 million tiles
18:12 < bridge> <teero777> But it should still not take 11 gigs
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> storing 100 million tiles on the GPU
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with 11 gigs
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds ok xd
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's also per layer ofc
18:14 < bridge> <teero777> huh? When the map is loaded my GPU memory isn't even half full and those 11gigs disintegrate in to nothing
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think in a worst case the driver doubles the memory
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i dunno where u get that 11gigs from
18:15 < bridge> <teero777> It's the same across backends.
18:15 < bridge> <teero777> Usually it should only take 10000*10000*32 bits right?
18:15 < bridge> <teero777> It's the same across backends.
18:15 < bridge> <teero777> Usually it should only take 10000*10000* 32 bits right?
18:16 < bridge> <teero777> F
18:16 < bridge> <teero777> Markdown is fking with me
18:16 < bridge> <teero777> It's the same across backends.
18:16 < bridge> <teero777> Usually it should only take `10000*10000*32` bits right?
18:17 < bridge> <ar1gin> this is for gpu, in gpu world everything is compact, but in ram space it may get multiplied many times
18:17 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162423818493632563/image.png?ex=653be28b&is=65296d8b&hm=2a3572b3443a8ec728da916204466b8218bc7ce5ccc560e7be94568636d9ead2&
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> I'll get on my PC and send the map. brb
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well one quad has 4 vertices
18:19 < bridge> <ar1gin> this is not even close for reasons stated above ^
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 vertex can contain a coordinate, and a 3d texture coordinate
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and actually even a color
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the color is normalized to u8
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 4bytes for color, 12 bytes for tex coords and 8 bytes for the position
18:20 < bridge> <teero777> Then why does it only take so much space when initialising and why can I render it in the editor fine?
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the editor uploads stuff on fly
18:20 < bridge> <teero777> I'm only using the game layer
18:20 < bridge> <ar1gin> when that one padding u8 is taking up extra 500mb space xd
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno why it fills to 11 gigs. but i'd be surprised if your VRAM is not at around at least 5 gigs
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah it won't do that i think
18:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> ik, im just joking
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 can u send a screenshot of one of these maps in the editor?
18:23 < bridge> <teero777> this is gameplay

18:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> according to the calculator each tile would take up ~120 bytes

18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok, can u just share the map?
18:24 < bridge> <teero777> ??
18:24 < bridge> <teero777> use your eyes xd

18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd that indeed takes like 5 gigs, but still ok
18:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :)
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 all except staging is VRAM
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so 7.6 GB VRAM
18:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I still have to contact Chiller because idk if he's intersted
18:28 < bridge> <patiga> > >>> 10000 * 10000 * 24 * 4 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024
18:28 < bridge> <patiga> > 8.940696716308594
18:28 < bridge> <patiga> maybe that 24 factor is wrong
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162426614030811257/2023-10-13_18-26-54.mp4?ex=653be525&is=65297025&hm=3ae70cdfabcc21d22141f3b2e0806d3dc8dcc358ba08dd0bb663cd4f87f14308&
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> here
18:28 < bridge> <patiga> width * height * floats * bytes_per_float
18:29 < bridge> <Ewan> for a sec i thought you said 'well done' i was like damn
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep, but you have to understand one thing
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet, having both opengl and vulkan, does not write into driver memory directly
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it can happen that some of the upload buffers exist twice
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> once by the driver, once by us
18:29 < bridge> <teero777> that is shit
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean even without that, it would still use like 8GB RAM
18:30 < bridge> <totar> Why do you need 10k x 10k
18:30 < bridge> <teero777> need for speed
18:30 < bridge> <totar> lol
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kek
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's a square. 5kx5k would already be 4 times smaller
18:30 < bridge> <teero777> my goal is 100x100k but ig its a little bit far fetched
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2.5kx2.5k would be 16 times smaller
18:31 < bridge> <ar1gin> probably for some kind of machine learning :justatest:
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> is there a reason not to render tiles like in the editor?
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 if u don't share it in public. simply use opengl 1.x
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> whats the diff?
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> opengl 1 uses the same method as editor
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it will be slower, if that matters for u
18:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yea isn't even springlobe like 3k x 3k xd
18:32 < bridge> <totar> I think it would be easier to rewrite the game and server to procedurally render and physics the map if you want 100k x 100k
18:32 < bridge> <Ewan> still 10k is within the realm of possibility
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> omgg
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> opengl 1.4 is soooo fast
18:33 < bridge> <totar> ?
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks i love you
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> thx
18:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Let's hope for @learath2 and @gotroyb to do it for us ;)
18:33 < bridge> <Ewan> what gpu do you have that the 1.4 driver is rly better than vulkan
18:33 < bridge> <Ewan> sad
18:33 < bridge> <totar> Vulkan is not faster??
18:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it definitely can be
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> the 10x10k gets loadded in 1 second
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is faster in rendering
18:33 < bridge> <totar> ah
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it does buffering
18:33 < bridge> <ar1gin> vulkan is more memory consuming i think, cuz pipelines and stuff
18:33 < bridge> <Ewan> vulkan is why i can have 2k skins
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> system memory backing for textures and such
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> buy rtx 4090
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> no thanks
18:34 < bridge> <teero777> 20x20k works wooooh
18:34 < bridge> <totar> People using 2k skins when the entire skin takes up 100x100 pixels on their screen
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
18:34 < bridge> <teero777> i love it
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it's more sentimental
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw besides the RAM limit, the physics will not work correctly anyway
18:36 < bridge> <ar1gin> but for some reason hd textures still look better
18:36 < bridge> <teero777> yea sure floating point rambazamba will be ther
18:37 < bridge> <teero777> but client crashes it seems when i make a 100000x100000 map in the editor
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when it can write directly into vulkan driver memory it takes around 6 seconds for me
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162428830607228938/image.png?ex=653be736&is=65297236&hm=550d6dd0797e84978ea5abc81e40ffa3714b429684ff87e8c49a0f07725bca85&
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without open = excluding opening the file
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbh it probably is so slow for a different reason
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> our current map format saves air tiles
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it iterates over all air tiles too
18:39 < bridge> <teero777> hmmm
18:39 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162429401447813270/image.png?ex=653be7be&is=652972be&hm=69b831b9d918a4a2f384936629516b847ea75a8d98ae4876aecb7a3ee8210282&
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga how did u solve that issue with your tw-gpu
18:39 < bridge> <patiga> air tiles?
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> iterating over them
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when openinig the file
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it kinda sucks xd
18:40 < bridge> <patiga> don't actually think that this is an issue, it should be quick
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how big was that? 😄
18:40 < bridge> <patiga> I mean I upload the 2d-array to the gpu anyways ^^
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga well apparently it takes 6.3 seconds to create the buffer
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i kinda doubt it's the allocation or mem_copy
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> soon i'll try out a better file map format
18:41 < bridge> <teero777> `>>> 4 * 32 * 100000 * 100000
18:41 < bridge> <teero777> 1280000000000`
18:41 < bridge> <teero777> uhh
18:41 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162430028705959936/image.png?ex=653be853&is=65297353&hm=9dfa2e1b2cd55e4dcb0d77e303ec00fc3a1aee241fbf9e168ea84a123c2afe22&
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dislike the current for some obvious reasons anyway
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> it seems i need to upgrade my swapfile
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds sane. just buy better hardware xd
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why Bits to GBytes?
18:42 < bridge> <patiga> well tbf its an unreasonable map, can't test it straight away coz I don't render the game layer
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> this
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1162430281052070028/image.png?ex=653be88f&is=6529738f&hm=5a0ebec11a72ab1b461b8dcfc5c2206e6ae33fa010435ef0862a3b80722bfbf6&
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or why 4*32 ?
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why *4?
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> it does `CTile *pNewData = new CTile[NewW * NewH];`
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah right
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> 100000x100000
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah all fine
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> 100000*100000
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but unsigned char is 8 bits
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 byte
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> oh lol
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> i read int
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> mb
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> cant read

18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw the challenge here for linux or what u use, is allocating it in one block xD

18:44 < bridge> <teero777> 1280000000000`

18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also don't have enough RAM :c
18:45 < bridge> <teero777> okay it is still 40 gigs though
18:45 < bridge> <teero777> i only have 32 + 4gb swap
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have enough with swap on my debian install
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not on my arch 😂
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i'm not sure if the allocation works tho
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean linux is good, maybe it works there xdd
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but this is really a weird allocation
18:46 < bridge> <teero777> i could do a 50x50k map though
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i really wonder why such map sizes help for training
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as said the physics are broken at these coordinates
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> they dont im just having fun
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> 😂
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> you really thought i was doing smth useful
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> ill do a AStar timelapse maybe
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes i totally expected that XD
19:05 < bridge> <patiga> I would suggest a max size of like 8k (8192), as it is the first power of two after the biggest map size in ddnet
19:05 < bridge> <teero777> seems like 50x50k gives me a bad alloc in the editor ;(
19:05 < bridge> <teero777> 50x42k works fine ig
19:05 < bridge> <patiga> (and map size matters for the raycast tilemap rendering approach)
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i suggest that RAM prices drop so hard that everyone has 512GB
19:06 < bridge> <teero777> 👍
19:06 < bridge> <teero777> i live on ddr2
19:12 < bridge> <totar> 512 gb of ddr2 is probably pretty cheap but it's impossible to make a system with that much ddr2
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah

19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 64gb ddr4 for 122€
19:13 < bridge> <teero777> i have 8 times 4 gigs in my system
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 256GB RAM total if ur mobo supports it
19:14 < bridge> <murpi> We can, but we'll probably get ratelimited fairly quick. There's a 10 message per hour limit.
19:15 < bridge> <teero777> bruhh i made the 50x42k map and the client crashed while saving it ;((
19:15 < bridge> <totar> Wait do they rate limit web hooks to 10 messages and hour?
19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> crashed or hanged
19:15 < bridge> <murpi> No, but publishing messages.

19:20 < bridge> <teero777> xd
19:25 < bridge> <teero777> aaa
19:25 < bridge> <teero777> the server crashed while loading the 40x40 map

19:34 < bridge> <teero777> ~probably another accident where i apparently dont have enugh memory~
19:34 < bridge> <robyt3> We assume `w * h` does not cause an integer overflow in various places
19:35 < bridge> <robyt3> For square maps, `w * h` overflows at around `w = h = 46340`
19:35 < bridge> <teero777> hmm. width and height are 40k
19:35 < bridge> <teero777> or rather 40001
19:36 < bridge> <ar1gin> are all types `int`?
19:36 < bridge> <ar1gin> like `m_Width`
19:37 < bridge> <ar1gin> like `m_Width`?
19:37 < bridge> <teero777> yep
19:37 < bridge> <robyt3> In the map format yes, in other functions we try to switch to `size_t`
19:37 < bridge> <teero777> ig they should atleast be unsigned
19:37 < bridge> <teero777> ig they should atleast be unsigned ints
19:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> this is C++, people don't know that number types other than `int` exist xd
19:38 < bridge> <teero777> what does that function even do? i mean `void CLayers::InitTilemapSkip()`
19:40 < bridge> <robyt3> It initializes `m_Skip` for tiles. This is used to skip tiles which are empty during rendering (at least before the fancy buffering)
19:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> it actually segfaults because it converts index into a pointer i think, cuz u gotta multiply index by size of one tile and add array base pointer\
19:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> it actually segfaults because it converts index into a pointer i think, cuz u gotta multiply index by size of one tile and add array base pointer

19:42 < bridge> <ar1gin> +1 reason to rewrite ddnet in rust :brownbear:
19:44 < bridge> <teero777> pTiles is just not constructed correctly
19:45 < bridge> <teero777> or rather whatever is behind pTiles
19:46 < bridge> <ar1gin> but it segfaults when trying to access it, not because of what's inside?
19:47 < bridge> <ar1gin> im sure u wont be able to open a map this huge without rewriting a lot of ints into long longs :)
19:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> #define int long long int :santatrollet:
20:29 < bridge> <teero777> there might be a major bug.
20:31 < bridge> <teero777> since i should even be able to load the map if its only ints. 40000*40000 i only 1,600,000,000
20:31 < bridge> <teero777> which is way under the limit.
20:31 < bridge> <teero777> it also seems like the pTiles array is exactly as big as the file size which should not be the case
