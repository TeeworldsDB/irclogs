00:04 <+jxsl13_webchat> I think the lagg is caused by the joins
00:44 <+eeeee> what a mess.. can't wait for c++ coroutines
01:27 <+bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> mh
01:27 <+bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> could you use a worker thread and a queue?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> can u do something about bot finishes?
17:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3zi> where is this bridge to?!
17:03 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3zi> !info
18:19 <@deen> b3zi: freenode #ddnet, quakenet #ddnet and DDNet Discord server
19:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3zi> Ah :D
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Aaaah, I just remembered why we don't have "first rank" on ddnet ranks page: Testers would have an advantage in getting the first finish.
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum I think it was you who requested that feature? ^
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remembered by seeing jao as first finish on newly released map today ðŸ˜„
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hm yeah i didnt think about that
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ban jao from that list then
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, but our test servers are not secured
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So anyone could go there and practice
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that might fill up the open test servers for practice purposes.  not testing
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just too easy to cheat
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> on the other hand, just maybe, it would encourage people to become testers
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> or not to reveal cheat to make sure they get the first finish
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dIeD> maybe just enable it for really hard maps (30points+)? i dont see a reason to have this feature for easy maps tbh
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Also, I'm thinking about upgrading DDNet RUS to a stronger server. Seems to be the one running closest to capacity
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I even noticed it lagging with ~120 players recently
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bra seems to be running close to capacity as well
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compilation sometimes failing due to out-of-memory erros
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compilation sometimes failing due to out-of-memory errors
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, I meant CPU
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I asked RafaelFF to upgrade Brazil, but I think it was too expensive or something
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So we could switch to another hoster
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or stop compiling on each server
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the last thing is how I temporarily solved it
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But we might want to do that everywhere
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> game servers don'T like being swapped out
