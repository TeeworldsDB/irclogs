00:31 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: have heard s3 buckets are expensive
01:44 <+eeeee> if you store terabytes there, sure
01:46 <+eeeee> forum backups shouldn't cost anything. teehistorian is probably a bit bigger, but could still be viable if you store it in s3 "glacier" which is kind of like tape storage and is only $4 per tb/month
08:30 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @Ryozuki You should have said us something before. I would have hosted it on ddnet.tw server
08:31 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> eeeee: I remember restoring the forum from backup once, so it seems to work. It's just a mysqldump before a full rsyncsystem backup
08:32 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> but yeah, for space reasons I just keep 3-4 backups around right now
12:06 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: if you'd store teehistorian into glacier, that would be nice, I guess
12:06 <@heinrich5991> in what chunks should I split teehistorian stuff?
12:06 <@heinrich5991> have heard that they don't like too little files

15:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they are still alive due to old people being caught by them still, or just people who don't know much about internet
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if u see the pageu can see that they say 12billion dollar is lost globally to scam mails xD

15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> CEO of OVH
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> 4 Hours Downtime..
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> atleast for me didnt know that the outage is still ongoing
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "The cause of the problem was, ironically, a power failure. There was a break in the power supply in the main server room."
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> DDNet CAN is also @ OVH, no problems noticed
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, because it was in france
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it is actaully
15:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ovh client support right now: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOMtEJ0WAAA3-7s.jpg
15:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 16M websites affected xD
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> The curious thing is that, the technical support
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> was disabled as well
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> D:
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i never expected much about ovh support, its known its pretty bad
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but the price is cheap
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> #homehosting xd never trust any suspicous OVH organisations xd
16:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> homehosting is more expensive aswell, if you dont have a machine running 24/7 anyways
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> atleast in germany wirh 0,26â‚¬ per kWh
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> you germans haha
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> pff here in india we dont pay too much
