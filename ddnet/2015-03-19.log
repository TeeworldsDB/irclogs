18:19 < WolfAlex> deen: is there something to disable the effects of hearts/shields? (for super old maps)
18:46 <@deen> WolfAlex: haven'T seen anything like that
19:14 < WolfAlex> ok :/
20:21 < Spyker> hi all!
20:22  * Spyker slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
20:22 < Learath2> \o/
20:22 < Spyker> deen, you on?
20:22 < Learath2> what do you need Spyker
20:23 < Spyker> im mapping an hard dummy drag map, but all parts are really interesting and original
20:23 < Spyker> mb this map can be used for a tournament 
20:24 < Learath2> yeah you need deen for that :D 
20:24 < Spyker> yea 
20:25 < Spyker> i think 4brutal
20:38 <@deen> nope
20:38 <@deen> actually you need testers for that, not me
20:38 <@deen> i don't decide that
20:47 < Spyker> so? where i have to ask?
20:47 < Spyker> the map isnt finished yet, but it is 60% or more now
20:48 < Spyker> and all 1st try 7-8 min, but hard map, no one will be there before 30min
20:48 < Spyker> and faily parts too
20:48 < Spyker> nice map i think, where i have to ask for tournament?
20:49 <@deen> ask testers directly
20:51 <@deen> but after the drama you made with your last map, I'd prefer not to release your map in a tournament
20:51 < Spyker> ahahha man
20:52 < Spyker> i just did this because some players who arent on forum want it, now you can see many finished like 200 mins! :D
20:52 < Spyker> it is an hard map, wich tester i have to call?
20:52 <@deen> your favorite one
20:53 < Spyker> i dont have one! :|
21:00 < Spyker> i asked to saavik because i usually see she online! see ya!
