00:00 < EastByte> deen: windows servers are cool :D
00:00 <@deen> EastByte: why?
00:00 < EastByte> if you want to run a server, you just doubleclick the icon :D
00:00 <@deen> EastByte: huh?
00:01 <@deen> EastByte: is that sarcasm, are you serious?
00:01 < EastByte> und then you have to care about the window formation on the desktop
00:01 < Savander> yup
00:01 < Savander> nope
00:01 < Savander> double client the icon
00:01 < Savander> autoexec.cfg
00:01 < Savander> and all works xD
00:01 < EastByte> it's sarcasm
00:01 < EastByte> but it feels awesomoe
00:01 <@deen> yeah, but you can also install ubuntu with a gui on your server
00:01 <@deen> and double click
00:01 < Savander> hah! :p
00:01 < EastByte> that's not the real thing^^
00:02 < EastByte> u need a classical win2000 theme
00:02 < Savander> btw. i fix it and it works, ( i was afk :P)
00:02 <@deen> When I was on saeids Persian server
00:02 <@deen> (Windows server)
00:02 <@deen> I was wondering why all his RAM was used
00:02 <@deen> and he had Firefox running on it with many tabs
00:02 < EastByte> :D
00:04 < Savander> Hard test
00:05 < Savander> so what with my kill protection? All works :o
00:08 < EastByte> okay and when does the kill protection acticate?
00:08 < EastByte> activate*
00:08 < Savander> when 
00:08 < Savander> currtime > 30
00:08 < Savander> or what you want
00:08 < Savander> you can set it
00:08 < EastByte> then set it down so I can test it
00:09 <@deen> looks good
00:09 < Savander> then if you time is bigger than 30 (for example), then you need to write /kill
00:09 < Savander> when you want to kill, on chat you'll see message what you must to do :p
00:10 <@deen> You killed yourself in: %s%d:%s%d
00:10 <@deen> what's that for?
00:11 <@deen> I don't think we need a text message that you killed
00:11 <@deen> you see it top right corner already
00:11 < Savander> if you want, you can delete ( i did it for fun sry)
00:11 <@deen> np

00:13 <@deen> (int) ((float) (Server()->Tick() - pPlayer->GetCharacter()->m_StartTime) / ((float) Server()->TickSpeed()));
00:13 <@deen> why do you do float division just to convert back to int?
00:13 < Savander> when i trying to add
00:13 < Savander> spectator time 
00:13 < Savander> (you know)
00:14 <@deen> i don't understand
00:15 < Savander> i reading the code, and it was so
00:16 < Savander> because i didn't know how to get start (im new in teeworlds code)
00:16 < Savander> now i know, so TickSpeed and Tick it's a int?
00:16 <@deen> or int64
00:16 <@deen> not sure
00:17 < EastByte> int I guess
00:17 <@deen> recently i got a funny question
00:18 <@deen> "Server counts ticks. What happens when tick overflows?"
00:18 <@deen> Was fun doing the calculation
00:18 <@deen> Takes a few years for int32 to overflow and longer than the universe is old with int64
00:18 < EastByte> sure
00:19 <@deen> ok, seems to work. Thanks Savander

00:19 < Savander> look
00:19 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/m24adAKS7715
00:19 < Savander> in same time
00:19 < Savander> 6 (with float)
00:19 < Savander> and below
00:19 < Savander> without
00:19 < Savander> different :c
00:20 <@deen> i don't understand
00:20 < Savander>  (int) ((float) (Server()->Tick() - pPlayer->GetCharacter()->m_StartTime) / ((float) Server()->TickSpeed()));
00:20 < EastByte> how is it being printed?
00:20 < Savander> dbg_msg
00:20 <@deen> Good question EastByte 
00:20 <@deen> I just tested it with just ints and it seemed to work
00:21 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/9eCMWU7C7803
00:21 < Savander> when i press kill, it make two dbg_msg
00:21 < EastByte> yes you can't use float as parameter on %d
00:21 < Savander> ahm
00:21 < Savander> ok, i forgot
00:21 < Savander> xd
00:21 < Savander> hah
00:22 < EastByte> glad I have nimrod now <3
00:22 <@deen> EastByte: because of echo or in general?
00:22 <@deen> or type checking?
00:23 < EastByte> echo, type checking, everything
00:23 < Savander> still weird
00:25 < Savander> wow still not works
00:25 < Savander> (int) ((float) (Server()->Tick() - pPlayer->GetCharacter()->m_StartTime) / ((float) Server()->TickSpeed()));    != Server()->Tick() - pPlayer->GetCharacter()->m_StartTime / Server()->TickSpeed();
00:26 < Savander> is not the same
00:26 < EastByte> aht are u doing
00:26 < Savander> im testing, and it's not same
00:26 < Savander> xD
00:26 < EastByte> maybe the float has decimal places
00:27 < EastByte> or do I say 'fractional digits' in english?
00:27 <@deen> I never used dbg_msg
00:27 <@deen> but using std::cout i get this:
00:27 <@deen> 65 65.38
00:27 <@deen> first is with ints, second with floats
00:27 <@deen> looks fine
00:27 < Savander> wow, weird
00:27 <@deen> std::cout << (pSelf->Server()->Tick() - pChr->m_StartTime) / pSelf->Server()->TickSpeed() << " " << (int) ((float) pSelf->Server()->Tick() - pChr->m_StartTime) / (float) pSelf->Server()->TickSpeed() << std::endl;
00:28 < Savander> maybe dbg_msg is broken
00:28 < EastByte> .....

00:28 < Savander> hah
00:28 < EastByte> I guess when comparing float and integers the integer is casted to float
00:29 <@deen> yes
00:29 < EastByte> well obv.
00:29 <@deen> and 65 != 64.38
00:29 <@deen> 65*
00:30 < EastByte> http://qz.tw-clan.net/online/
00:30 < EastByte> our clan is really active today
00:30 < EastByte> oh wait, there are dummys
00:31 < Savander> sorry guys, but i don't know a lot of things.. i started learning, no long ago ;P. And here,  i can learn something from you ^^
00:31 < EastByte> no problem
00:32 <@deen> Savander: no problem, I just ask because I try to understand what you do
00:32 <@deen> EastByte: nice, you wrote that?
00:32 < Savander> no problem, i just read the code ;p.
00:32 < EastByte> yep, nodejs backend
00:32 < EastByte> refreshes server list every minute
00:33 <@deen> does it work with 64 player packets?
00:33 < EastByte> yaha :D
00:33 <@deen> or wait
00:33 < EastByte> and it took me a lot of time to support that
00:33 <@deen> do you request from the servers?
00:33 <@deen> aaah
00:33 <@deen> I hacked around in some python script
00:34 < EastByte> huh?
00:34 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/teeworlds.py#L337
00:34 <@deen> to get http://ddnet.tw/status to work
00:34 < EastByte> oh
00:34 <@deen> I should probably ping the servers more intelligently
00:35 <@deen> right now i just ping each server 3 times and take result if any of those pings worked
00:35 <@deen> still network is often bad to china and chile
00:35 <@deen> so they show as offline even though they're running
00:35 < EastByte> :/
00:35 <@deen> and botox's serverstatus script always dies^^
00:35 <@deen> when theconnection gets bad
00:36 < EastByte> it dies?
00:36 <@deen> the client just hangs and doesn't send any packages anymore
00:36 < EastByte> interesting
00:36 <@deen> I guess noone tested it with as bad connections as ddnet has
00:36 < EastByte> but why does a bad connection matter
00:37 < EastByte> it's just a req+response
00:37 < EastByte> (multiple responses on full servers)
00:37 <@deen> EastByte: nono, I'm talking about the serverstatus script
00:37 <@deen> the thing at the top of the page
00:37 < EastByte> ah
00:38 <@deen> it keeps a tcp connection on
00:38 <@deen> and the tcp connection can die
00:38 < EastByte> okay
00:38 <@deen> and i guess it doesn't recover from that
00:39 < EastByte> ah that script from botox
00:39 < EastByte> why did he even use tcp
00:39 <@deen> to prevent ip spoofing?^^
00:39 < EastByte> oh right
00:40 < EastByte> hm a small random token isn't that hard :D
00:41 < EastByte> it's really cool to see all that in realtime
00:41 <@deen> you can click the server
00:41 <@deen> and get more information even!
00:41 < EastByte> WOOOOOW
00:41 <@deen> it's useful during ddos attacks
00:42 <@deen> and i always see when something weird is going on with my servers
00:42 < EastByte> and it runs on the main server which is being attacked at first^^
00:42 <@deen> haha
00:42 <@deen> well, most attacks don't bring us down
00:43 < EastByte> well you got a 10gibt port right?
00:43 <@deen> yes!
00:43 < EastByte> hard to bring down
00:43 <@deen> it only gets shut down so it doesn't impair the traffic of other customers
00:44 < EastByte> hm
00:44 < EastByte> right
00:44 <@deen> That was funny when you wrote in github
00:44 <@deen> I'm glad that someone finally brings that up, self killing often happens by mistake
00:44 < EastByte> you are often so lonely in issue discussions^^
00:44 < EastByte> needed to write something
00:44 <@deen> I'm a bit worried because the hoster doesn't give me a date for when we will get ddos protection
00:45 < Savander> tomorrow!
00:45 <@deen> He just said he will let me know when it works =/
00:45 <@deen> the alternative is going with a server in Strasbourg at OVH
00:46 <@deen> But higher ping, new IP, favorites are gone =/
00:46 <@deen> and I don't know how the lags and performance are
00:46 < Savander> you still have  attacks?
00:46 < EastByte> ye :/
00:47 < Savander> deen: laxa have server in OVH?
00:47 <@deen> Savander: when we have a tournament we will 100% get attacks
00:47 < Savander> ddracepro.net
00:47 < Savander> i guess
00:47 <@deen> Savander: he has server at online.net, but it's high ping and laggy
00:47 < Savander> ahm
00:47 <@deen> and 2 days ago I asked around to find out who's ddosing
00:47 <@deen> and 30 minutes later got a little warning DDoS with 2 gbit/s
00:48 <@deen> anyway, it's multiple people ddosing
00:48 < EastByte> you laos mentioned that you got threats?
00:48 < EastByte> also*
00:48 <@deen> mentioned where?
00:48 < EastByte> in irc I think
00:48 <@deen> what threats?
00:48 < EastByte> about when you run a tournament they will ddos you
00:48 < EastByte> or something
00:48 <@deen> Ah, yeah
00:49 <@deen> I know there's the xploited clan doing DDoS attacks
00:49 <@deen> and Gambol's brother is getting paid by some people to do it too
00:49 <@deen> but they only paid 10 $ instead of 20, so I don't know if he'll keep doing it^^
00:50 < EastByte> hmm
00:51 <@deen> EastByte: one of your clan members is ddnet mod!
00:51 < EastByte> I know :D
00:51 < EastByte> the funny thing is
00:51 < EastByte> he refuses to place the plain 'qZ into his clantag
00:52 < EastByte> so I have todo a extra query for the online list
00:52 <@deen> I think most mods don't know that they're mods yet
00:52 < EastByte> xd
00:52 < Savander> meh
00:52 < Savander> Deen
00:52 <@deen> didn't ask anyone, just chose people who don't want to be mods
00:52 < EastByte> haha
00:52 < EastByte> that was quite a random decision
00:53 <@deen> no
00:53 < Savander> you ever played on TeeWorlds server from ovh?
00:53 <@deen> had it plannedfor a long time
00:53 < EastByte> hm
00:53 <@deen> Savander: i only ever played on 3 servers in all my years in teeworlds
00:53 < Savander> no
00:53 < Savander> follow me
00:53 <@deen> shini instagib, ddmax, ddnet^^
00:53 < Savander> you'll see
00:53 < EastByte> Savander: ovh has many locations
00:53 < Savander> ping from ovh
00:53 < Savander> it
00:53 <@deen> that is not strasbourg
00:53 <@deen> that's more west
00:53 < Savander> it from roubaix
00:54 <@deen> yeah
00:54 < Savander> france
00:54 <@deen> strasbourg has better ping
00:54 < Savander> you thing?
00:54 < Savander> think*/
00:54 <@deen> I know
00:54 <@deen> I get 28 to Roubaix, 24 to Strasbourg, 20 to Frankfurt
00:54 < EastByte> deen: still, the poll didn't event have a clear result
00:54 < EastByte> even*
00:55 <@deen> EastByte: I had it planned long before the poll
00:55 < EastByte> okay okay
00:55 < EastByte> so the poll was just to start a discussion?
00:55 <@deen> The poll was so laxa stops spamming me about it :P
00:55 < EastByte> xd
00:57 <@deen> Let's see how it works with mods
00:57 <@deen> if it's bad we can still remove them
00:57 < EastByte> I'm trying to insult them, let's see what happens
00:57 < EastByte> oh wait I wanted to sleep
00:58 < EastByte> deen: still learning for your exam? :D
00:58 <@deen> EastByte: not right now, but have to start again soon
00:58 <@deen> Hmmmm
00:59 <@deen> Avo said he found a trick to pay half the price @ OVH
00:59 < EastByte> wut?
00:59 <@deen> Kind of want to try it
00:59 < EastByte> wanna tell me?
01:00 < Savander> http://www.kimsufi.com/de/
01:00 < Savander> try it
01:00 < Savander> xd
01:00 < Savander> from ovh
01:00 < Savander> xd
01:00 < Savander> dedicated servers
01:00 <@deen> Savander: i know but you can't choose whether it's in Roubaix or Strasbourg
01:00 < EastByte> Savander: I have the cheapest one of them
01:00 <@deen> otherwise I would have gotten one in Strasbourg already
01:01 <@deen> i only have the description in German
01:01 <@deen> Avo: man bestell den server 1 dann kannst du im pannel sagen upgrade dann ist der 2â‚¬ billiger die erste bestellung ignorierst du und dann bestellst du nomma dann kostet der nurnoch 5,10â‚¬ :D
01:01 < EastByte> man man man
01:01 <@deen> so he pays 5,10 instead of 9,51 now
01:01 < EastByte> hm okay
01:01 < EastByte> I think it's worth a try
01:02 <@deen> maybe he's just misunderstanding and has to pay more next month^^
01:02 < EastByte> ^^
01:05 <@deen> I really don't want 4 ms more though
01:06 < EastByte> for me it's only 10ms more :)
01:06 < EastByte> (kimsufi)
01:06 <@deen> When choosing this server @ datafabrik I just went by lowest ping
01:07 < Savander> wow
01:07 < Savander> i got tw server from ovh strasbourg
01:07 <@deen> must have compared 30 servers
01:07 <@deen> with pings from all european countries
01:07 <@deen> to create a ranking
01:07 < Savander> Russian players ~~ 100-120 ping
01:07 < Savander> i guess xD
01:07 < Savander> i have 42 ping now
01:08 < EastByte> I think a low ping is not necessary
01:08 < EastByte> since it's not low for everyone anyway
01:08 <@deen> Savander: 100-120 where?
01:08 < Savander> to france from russia
01:09 <@deen> to Frankfurt it's kind of nice
01:09 <@deen> milk has 40
01:09 < Savander> ye
01:09 < EastByte> that's interesting
01:09 <@deen> but funcat has 200^^
01:09 <@deen> funcat lives in Sachalin, found that really interesting
01:09 <@deen> 200 on GER, 80 on China
01:09 < Savander> ;o
01:10 <@deen> right next to Japan
01:10 < EastByte> hm
01:10 < Savander> i have 40 ping on russian server
01:10 < Savander> so.. xD
01:10 < EastByte> my ping to russia always changed
01:10 < Savander> my not
01:10 < Savander> always 40
01:10 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, same here, depends on the time of day
01:10 <@deen> to China it's even worse though^^
01:10 <@deen> 200 -> 500
01:11 < Savander> wow
01:11 < EastByte> I once hosted a german city mod on a russian vps
01:11 < EastByte> the ping was between 60 and 100
01:11 < Savander> what with hetzner?
01:11 < Savander> hetzner offer anty ddos?
01:11 <@deen> Savander: high ping, no ddos protection?
01:11 < Savander> Haha
01:11 < Savander> okay
01:11 < Savander> xD
01:12 <@deen> is there any low ping german server with ddos protection?
01:12 <@deen> i only find french ones
01:12 < EastByte> xd
01:12 <@deen> ovh, online.net
01:12 < Savander> xd
01:12 < Savander> ask google.
01:12 < Savander> xD
01:13 < EastByte> finding the right hoster isn't easy, yep
01:13 <@deen> i only find this kind of stuff: https://www.staminus.net/ddos-protection-cloud
01:14 <@deen> protection against 10 gbit/s (less than what we get already) 350 $ / month
01:14 <@deen> yay
01:14 < EastByte> ...
01:14 < EastByte> looks more like plans for companies
01:15 <@deen> exactly
01:16 < EastByte> and we still don't know how big the impact of a ddos protection is (for teeworlds servers)
01:16 < Savander> http://www.soyoustart.com/
01:16 < EastByte> it might be not even worth it
01:16 <@deen> Yeah, DDoS protecting game servers is horror
01:16 < EastByte> ^
01:16 <@deen> ususally they just block all UDP as "ddos protection"
01:16 < EastByte> haha :D
01:17 < EastByte> glad we are not using udp </troll>
01:17 <@deen> Savander: soyoustart has game ddos protection
01:17 <@deen> Savander: it's also OVH
01:17 < Savander> i know
01:17 <@deen> but they only have betas
01:17 <@deen> and you can NOT prolong it
01:17 <@deen> server is for 14 days and you're out
01:17 < Savander> Wow
01:17 <@deen> and afterwards they double the price
01:18 <@deen> so you pay 50 â‚¬ / month for the cheapest
01:18 < Savander> but, newly, ovh offer test server for 14 days,
01:18 < Savander> not for free. but much less
01:19 < Savander> and if you want still have server, you can prolong it with normal cost
01:19 < Savander> but. Now i have to go
01:19 < Savander> bye
01:19 <@deen> bye Savander 
01:19 < EastByte> cya
01:20 < EastByte> and I go to sleep, until tomorrow^^
01:20 <@deen> bye
01:20 <@deen> thanks for talking, guys =)
01:20 < EastByte> np^^
01:21 < EastByte> also deen: you have to explain me once more your ddnet database design / rank syncing stuff whatever
01:21 < EastByte> cya :)
01:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/AxZO8g
01:49 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 4311df0 def: Switch /pause and /spec
08:00 < laxa> deen: wtf is that last commit ? oO
08:04 < laxa> I am really curious about why you changed that...
08:04 < laxa> I don't understand why to be honest, doesn't make any sense to me.
09:43 < laxa_work> Hello from work !
09:46 < laxa_work> Isn't it possible to use @ in nicknames ?
09:53 < laxa_work> Well, apparently not !
10:13 < EastByte> hm?
10:38 <@deen> ^^
10:38 <@deen> the @ has special meaning in IRC
10:39 <@deen> laxa: really? for me /pause is what i always used, and many others too
10:39 <@deen> but when sv_pauseable is 1, then /pause makes you disappear
10:39 <@deen> which is annoying when you don't really need it
10:40 <@deen> And I think others see it similarly, because I got this suggestion to swap them a few times
10:56 < EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/neverwhereluck.webm
10:56 < EastByte> I had quite luck there
10:57 <@deen> haha
10:57 <@deen> Oh, the hook really seems to be going up for you
10:57 <@deen> when you go far away
10:57 < EastByte> yes, dunno why
10:57 <@deen> Because the player is too far away from you
10:57 <@deen> Do you use Windows?
10:57 < EastByte> nope
10:58 < EastByte> but /showall was disabled so
10:58 <@deen> Strange, I'm on Linux and have never seen this
10:58 <@deen> for me the hook disappears entirely when the player is too far away
10:58 < EastByte> hmmmm
10:59 < EastByte> deen: ingame & demos?
11:00 <@deen> ingame definitely
11:00 <@deen> never watched a demo where that happens
11:00 < EastByte> ingame it disappears for me too
11:00 < EastByte> well shouldn't be hard to fix that
11:01 < EastByte> the demo player has been a buggy thing all the time
11:02 <@deen> Yeah, fixing should be easy, but I can't reproduce it
11:06 < EastByte> I'll try it
11:06 <@deen> Thanks!
11:08 < laxa_work> deen: I have 2 binds, one for spec and one for /pause
11:09 < laxa_work> when you are on a server with sv_pauseable 1, I use spec when needed and pause otherwise
11:09 < EastByte> ^ I always changed my pause bind
11:09 <@deen> see, now you canalways use /pause
11:09 < laxa_work> You are making this to avoid people changing your bind if I understand it correctly xD
11:10 < laxa_work> well that doesn't change anythin
11:10 < laxa_work> if I need to use /spec I'll need a bind for it
11:10 < laxa_work> to give strong to my mate
11:10 <@deen> no, you only need that very rarely
11:10 <@deen> maybe 1-2 times in a map
11:10 <@deen> then you can just write it in chat
11:11 < laxa_work> well, I can say the same about your change !
11:11 < laxa_work> it will only be usefull a handful of times
11:11 < laxa_work> anyway, I'll just have to swap my binds for /spec and /pause...
11:11 < laxa_work> but still, I don't really understand the logic about it.
11:12 < laxa_work> ./spec is pretty meaningful of it's own and /pause too for m
11:19 <@deen> the logic is that people expected pause and spec to be swapped
11:19 <@deen> because everyone uses pause and disappearing is annoying

11:24 < EastByte> oh wait
11:34 <@deen> grr

11:36 < EastByte> okay I got it
11:36 <@deen> when you hit kill but don't have a character =/
11:38 < EastByte> that's a well known teeworlds coding failure :D
11:38 <@deen> yes, and one time it was checked for
11:38 <@deen> i even made sure
11:38 <@deen> but here I missed it =/
11:38 < EastByte> haha
11:39  * EastByte is afk for a mid long time
11:44 <@deen> Why does noone report such crashes =/

14:02 < EastByte> "Bullets don't explode when a player stands in their way"
14:02 < EastByte> how does he mean it?
14:02 <@deen> fixes this: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/11
14:02 <@deen> the bullet flies through you and no explosion occurs
14:02 <@deen> even though it bounces off the wall
14:02 < EastByte> ahh
14:09 <@deen> Savander: kill protection had a crash =/
14:10 < Savander> rly? why
14:10 < Savander> what you did ?XD
14:10 < EastByte> you forgot one check :P
14:10 <@deen> you didn't check if character is not 0
14:10 <@deen> and i missed it too^^
14:10 < Savander> ah
14:10 < Savander> meh :x
14:11 < Savander> i know which i guess
14:11 < Savander> because i checking if character ddrace_state is DDRACE_STARTED
14:11 < Savander> and maybe on spectator
14:11 < Savander> you can't did it?
14:12 <@deen> well, a few servers crashed
14:12 <@deen> this morning
14:12 <@deen> and i managed to reproduce it locally
14:12 <@deen> but i don't know how, was spamming all keys for 3 minutes^^
14:13 < Savander> but, now works?
14:14 <@deen> Yeah, I fixed it
14:14 < Savander> Okay, sorry again ;c
14:14 <@deen> np, i should have noticed myself
14:15 <@deen> afk
14:33 < laxa_work> deen: I have the greatest idea of all time !
14:36 < laxa_work> Well technically it's not my own idea, but most people would love it.
14:36 < laxa_work> Submit teeworlds as ddnet to steam !
14:37 < laxa_work> Teeworld's dev are against it, don't really know why though.
14:37 < laxa_work> But you could do it with under a different name and bring teeworlds a new breath !
14:39 <@deen> laxa_work: someone said they are working on doing that for ddnet
14:39 <@deen> a few months ago
14:39 <@deen> guess nothing happened
14:39 < laxa_work> wtf
14:40 < laxa_work> why someone different than you should do it.
14:40 <@deen> I've never even seen steam
14:40 <@deen> no idea what i would have to do
14:40 < EastByte> eh, wouldn't do that
14:40 < laxa_work> contact the greenlit shit to submit the game
14:40 < EastByte> better consider for hookrace
14:41 <@deen> Can't work on hookrace, have to work on laxa's ideas every day :P
14:41 < laxa_work> the only downside is that it'll cost 100 dollars
14:41 < EastByte> :D
14:41 < laxa_work> btw, steam is compatible on linux
14:41 < laxa_work> it's about 6M users a day
14:41 < EastByte> ya I'm using it
14:42 < laxa_work> I am telling that to deen who doesnt know about steam
14:42 < EastByte> but it's something a developer don't want to use
14:43 <@deen> last i remember everyone hated steam
14:43 <@deen> did that change?
14:44 < EastByte> when was that?
14:44 <@deen> back when i was playing games
14:44 <@deen> 10 years ago?
14:44 < EastByte> in steam you get any game nearly for free, no reason to hate
14:44 < laxa_work> deen: here we go : http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/FAQ.php
14:44 < EastByte> and the linux games work even better then on windows
14:45 < EastByte> 10years is quite a lot :D
14:45 < EastByte> didn't even have internet back then'
14:45 < laxa_work> and if you want some lecture, you could read teeworlds's official forum about having it on steam
14:45 <@deen> so the game would cost money or what?
14:46 < laxa_work> no
14:46 < laxa_work> but you have to pay 100 dollars to submit the game to the greenlit community
14:46 < laxa_work> I'll donate if you need
14:46 <@deen> and you think anyone would play it then?
14:46 < laxa_work> then you can decide with them if the game is free or not
14:47 < laxa_work> well it cannot really hurt the game itself
14:47 < laxa_work> doing this could brings loads of players into trying the game
14:47 <@deen> EastByte: why do you disagree?
14:47 < laxa_work> you should read the official forum's thread about having teeworlds into steam, I think it would give you a reasonnable idea
14:48 <@deen> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130194014
14:48 <@deen> so it's in already?
14:48 <@deen> i could also bring ddnet client to android play
14:48 <@deen> but that also costs money
14:49 <@deen> and i don't like these software stores at all
14:49 < EastByte> I disagree because of the license stuff and in favor of vanilla teeworlds
14:49 < laxa_work> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10269
14:49 < laxa_work> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11027
14:49 < EastByte> dunno really how this works
14:49 <@deen> why would I help some shop by letting them host my game for free as advertisement for their games thatcost money?
14:49 <@deen> and even pay money for it...
14:50 < EastByte> that's how it works
14:50 < laxa_work> the 100 dollars are going to charity apparently
14:50 < EastByte> also your game is advertised then
14:51 < laxa_work> you should read the threads I posted before thinking more imo.
14:51 <@deen> i read them back when they were written
14:52 <@deen> oh, one of them at least
14:53 < laxa_work> Well then make proes and cons
14:53 < laxa_work> Ask the ddnet comminity about it
14:55 <@deen> I like matricks' opinion on this: "Teeworlds shouldn't be anywhere near money, DRM and closed-source."
14:56 < laxa_work> Well, I don't know how this really workds, but afaik, people have given examples of open-source games on steam
14:57 < laxa_work> and the only money you'll be near is just the 100 dollars free
14:57 < laxa_work> fee
14:57 <@deen> make another forum topic if you want to discuss it, i guess
14:57 < laxa_work> on ddnet ?
14:58 <@deen> yeah
14:58 < laxa_work> Ok !
14:58 < laxa_work> Which forum ?
14:58 <@deen> client?
14:58 < laxa_work> I would have choosed Official Sevrer
14:59 <@deen> well, it's only for the client
14:59 <@deen> has nothing to do with the servers
14:59 < laxa_work> hum ok
15:02 < laxa_work> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=353
15:02 <@deen> Teeworlds?
15:02 <@deen> You mean DDNet client?
15:02 < laxa_work> ?
15:02 < laxa_work> y
15:02 <@deen> or did I misunderstand something?
15:02 <@deen> then you should call it DDNet client, not teeworlds^^
15:03 < laxa_work> I dont really know what's possible / could be done
15:03 < laxa_work> since you are just developping for ddnet, it should be called ddnet sure
15:03 <@deen> me neither and i would rather program something instead of finding out
15:04 < laxa_work> deen: edited
15:04 < laxa_work> you voted no already xD
15:04 <@deen> no
15:04 <@deen> i didn't vote
15:04 < laxa_work> who did oO ?
15:04 <@deen> i never vote in polls
15:04 <@deen> Users browsing this forum: Deathman, deen, Index
15:05 <@deen> maybe someone of those
15:05 < laxa_work> Well, I expect 1 answer per no vote...
15:13 < laxa_work> Well
15:13 < laxa_work> 3 "no" votes and still no arguments grrrr
15:14 < EastByte> also there is no email activiation, so people can easily multiple times :P
15:14 < EastByte> vote*
15:15 <@deen> EastByte: i had to disable email activation
15:15 < EastByte> I know
15:15 <@deen> because google thinks ddnet.tw is a spam mail address
15:17 < EastByte> var plInfo = findPlayers([{clan: "'qZ"}, {name: "'qZ |BlaGK|â€º", clan: "enjoy!"}]);
15:17 < EastByte> now blagk is happy
15:18 < EastByte> event driven development is really cool sometimes
15:24 < laxa_work> deen: dont forget to update /rules from server :).
15:25 <@deen> laxa_work: ?
15:27 < laxa_work> well
15:27 < laxa_work> actually
15:27 < laxa_work> when you do /rule
15:27 < laxa_work> you have written by the server : Be nice !
15:27 < laxa_work> If "we" have moderators, I expect to have somes rules no ?
15:28 < laxa_work> You could list the moderators into the /rules too.
15:29 <@deen> No rules
15:29 <@deen> "Be nice." is a good rule
15:31 < laxa_work> lol
15:31 < laxa_work> Hum ok
15:31 < laxa_work> Hehe, just received a mail from blizzard, I'll be a tester of Heroes of the storm

15:36 < Savander> cant
15:36 < Savander> ;(
15:36 < laxa_work> I'll try it tomorrow I guess, I'll need to download it this night
15:36 < Savander> i joined to beta a long ago :P 
15:36 < Savander> and still don't have access to HotS
15:36 < Savander> ;(
15:37 < laxa_work> wtf
15:37 < laxa_work> hots has been released already
15:37 < laxa_work> there is no more beta
15:37 < EastByte> ^ dat moment
15:37 < Savander> no
15:37 < Savander> heart of the storm
15:37 < Savander> still in beta
15:37 < Savander> closed beta
15:37 < Savander> ...
15:37 < laxa_work> no
15:37 < Savander> yes
15:37 < laxa_work> it's not closed bet
15:37 < laxa_work> a
15:38 < laxa_work> it's alpha
15:38 < Savander> http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/
15:38 < laxa_work> beta hasn't begin yet.
15:38 < laxa_work> Yeah, you can sign up for the beta
15:39 < laxa_work> but don't know if you can sign for the alpha
15:39 < laxa_work> currently it's in alpha
15:39 < Savander> didn't see anything about alpha
15:41 < laxa_work> well, the email I just received say that is currently in technic alpha phase
15:45 < Savander> okay
15:54 <@deen> lol laxa_work 
15:54 <@deen> the result was not to your liking so you add a third option^^
15:55 <@deen> now the people who voted won't know to revote
16:00 < laxa_work> Well, I should have addded a third option from the start :D
16:01 <@deen> so it went from 2-5 to 3-1 now, good job :P
16:02 < laxa_work> people will revote
16:02 < laxa_work> have you seen the results of the poll from teeworlds official forum ?
16:02 < laxa_work> 55% voted yes
16:02 < laxa_work> 24% : whatever
16:02 < laxa_work> 20% of no
16:02 < laxa_work> we should have around this
16:03 <@deen> yeah, just restart the vote until we get the right result
16:03 < laxa_work> I won't restart it again, I promise xD
16:32 < laxa_work> Anyone good in javascript ?
16:32 < Savander> east
16:32 < Savander> xD
16:32 <@deen> EastByte probably
16:32 < EastByte> oh there is a bird outside
16:32 < laxa_work> What ?
16:33 < EastByte> I'm busy, can't read xd
16:33 < laxa_work> $('#add-step-div #StepModelID').change(function ()
16:33 < EastByte> that's jquery
16:33 < EastByte> I don't use it
16:33 < laxa_work> beh...
16:34 < laxa_work> No one has a clue on what this call would apply to ? :x
16:34 < EastByte> look up the change event of jquery
16:36 < EastByte> deen: I think the character cores in demos aren't removed properly on wide distance
16:36 < EastByte> but m_Active still tells the truth
16:36 <@deen> EastByte: ah, interesting
16:38 < EastByte> the hook shouldn't be rendered to a not active character core
16:38 < EastByte> that also can happen ingame
16:40 <@deen> EastByte: ok, can you fix it?
16:41 < EastByte> I think so
16:52 < EastByte> deen: https://eastbit.net/public/videos/neverwherehook.webm
16:52 <@deen> nice!
16:53 <@deen> looks good
16:55 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #16: don't render hooks to non-active character cores (DDRace64...ddnet) http://git.io/cWDJsg
16:55 < EastByte> also the fix doesn't look dangerous :)
16:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #16: don't render hooks to non-active character cores (DDRace64...ddnet) http://git.io/cWDJsg
16:58 < EastByte> if suddenly hooks are disapearing, inform me :D
16:58 <@deen> Well, you're using pPlayerChar without checking whether it exists!
16:58 <@deen> but there it always exists
16:58 < EastByte> yes
16:58 < EastByte> well it's not dangerous in context of this method
16:58 < EastByte> Hookedplayer can also be above >64
17:00 <@deen> Thanks again EastByte 
17:00 < EastByte> I noticed that a hook to x 0 y 0 is rendered for a very short time when a charactercore disappears (ingame)
17:00 < EastByte> that also is fixed now
17:01 < EastByte> np :)
17:04 < laxa_work> Ok folks, going back home, see you in 1 hour !
17:05 <@deen> bye laxa_work 
17:14 < CookieMichal> Nailed it
17:14 <@deen> Welcome CookieMichal 
17:14 < CookieMichal> Hey :D
17:15 <@deen> CookieMichal: know the problem when you see hook to top left corner?
17:15 <@deen> when someone is too far away
17:15 < CookieMichal> nope :I
17:15 <@deen> ok, but EastByte fixed it^^
17:15 < CookieMichal> xD
17:15 <@deen> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/neverwhereluck.webm
17:16 < CookieMichal> 404 Not Found
17:16 <@deen> oh, he deletes videos faster than i expected
17:16 < CookieMichal> What was it? :D
17:16 <@deen> you saw the hook going top left corner
17:17 < CookieMichal> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/neverwherehook.webm found working video :D
17:17 <@deen> yeah, that's after the fix
17:19 < CookieMichal> https://eastbit.net/ best site ever
17:19 < CookieMichal> xd
17:19 <@deen> Reminds me of mine: http://felsin9.de/
17:20 < CookieMichal> Black :D
17:20 < CookieMichal> How much do u pay for domain?
17:20 <@deen> nothing
17:21 < CookieMichal> How, you hax0r
17:21 <@deen> it's included in my DSL 
17:21 < CookieMichal> D:
17:21 <@deen> but .de domains are cheap anyway
17:21 < CookieMichal> I want .net or .eu or .com domain :D
17:22 <@deen> hookrace.net!
17:22 < CookieMichal> :o
17:22 < CookieMichal> also free? :))
17:22 <@deen> no, i bought that somewhere
17:22 <@deen> no idea where
17:23 < EastByte> haha
17:23 < CookieMichal> Hehe. I will check ;)
17:23 <@deen> godaddy even?
17:23 < CookieMichal> domaincontrol.com ? :D
17:25 <@deen> not everyone is happy with kill protection =/
17:25 < CookieMichal> How does it actually work?
17:26 <@deen> after 20 minutes kill doesn't work anymore
17:26 <@deen> so you have to type /kill instead
17:26 < CookieMichal> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH <3
17:26 <@deen> but eryx is really mad about it
17:26 < EastByte> xd
17:26 < Savander> reason?
17:26 < EastByte> just ignore him
17:26 < CookieMichal> Add a way to turn it off on server side
17:26 < Savander> but..
17:27 < Savander> just
17:27 < Savander> set to 0
17:27 < CookieMichal> set what to 0
17:27 < Savander> variable
17:27 < Savander> sv_kill_protection
17:27 < EastByte> hmm that's not self-evident
17:27 < CookieMichal> Yeah :I
17:27 < Savander> is it
17:28 < EastByte> would use -1
17:28 < EastByte> and give a description
17:28 <@deen> use -42
17:28 < EastByte> ^
17:28 <@deen> it has a description
17:28 < CookieMichal> -360
17:28 < Savander> MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvKillProtection, sv_kill_protection, 0, 0, 9999, CFGFLAG_SERVER, "0 - Disable, 1-9999 minutes")
17:28 < EastByte> okay
17:28 < Savander> "0 - Disable, 1-9999 minutes"
17:28 < CookieMichal> 9999 minutes? Really? D:
17:28 < Savander> xD
17:29 < CookieMichal> 166 hours
17:29 < EastByte> yesterday I raced >3 hours, close enough
17:29 < CookieMichal> xD
17:30 < CookieMichal> I am sad because I was racing with Coca Cola and I had to go :/ We couldn't save due to team 0 :c
17:30 <@deen> use EastByte's bouncer
17:30 <@deen> and timeout protection
17:30 <@deen> to stay online forever
17:30 < Savander> xD
17:30 < CookieMichal> : I
17:31 < CookieMichal> nah
17:31 < EastByte> it works
17:31 < CookieMichal> I like timeout protection :D
17:31 < CookieMichal> Technically it is possible to fill server :>
17:31 <@deen> CookieMichal: with 16 ips yes
17:31 < CookieMichal> oh
17:32 <@deen> but you can just use 64 clients anyway
17:32 < CookieMichal> So it has IP check :c
17:32 < CookieMichal> I like git bash on windows :D
17:33 < EastByte> is that cygwin oder something?
17:34 <@deen> "oder"
17:34 < EastByte> haha
17:34 < CookieMichal> It's kinda linux shell
17:34 < CookieMichal> some commands work :>
17:35 < CookieMichal> like grep
17:35 < CookieMichal> hehe
17:37 < CookieMichal> Looks like cmd with colors https://cdn.mediacru.sh/wn02zTGz2o9f.png ^^
17:37 < EastByte> I think that's cygwin
17:37 < CookieMichal> I have no idea
17:37 <@deen> at least it's the default cygwin colors
17:37 < CookieMichal> but I like it
17:38 <@deen> unix tools are always nice
17:38 < CookieMichal> there's ssh command :o woah
17:38 <@deen> tried rewriting a few of them in nimrod for fun: https://github.com/def-/nimutils
17:38 < CookieMichal> hehe :D
17:39 < CookieMichal> Woah, I don't need putty. ssh command is better in it :o
17:39 < EastByte> because deen has time for that
17:39 <@deen> EastByte: haha
17:39 < EastByte> CookieMichal: you can install everything to cygwin
17:40 <@deen> i could even run official ddnet servers on windows using cygwin!
17:40 <@deen> (maybe)
17:40 < EastByte> yep
17:40 < CookieMichal> if there would be apt-get or yum I woudl be so happy xD
17:40 <@deen> CookieMichal: i think there is something like that
17:40 < EastByte> there is a package manager in cygwin
17:40 <@deen> apt-cyg
17:41 < CookieMichal> command not found
17:41 <@deen> need to install it i guess
17:41 < CookieMichal> :p
17:41 < CookieMichal> I have to fix my %PATH% ;c
17:42 < CookieMichal> I have Python 3 for teeworlds and yesterday installed Python 2 for some tests with node.js :c
17:42 < EastByte> python2 nodejs what?
17:43 < CookieMichal> Python 2 - Python version 2.7.8
17:43 < CookieMichal> Node.js - http://nodejs.org/
17:43 < EastByte> but nodejs has nothing to do with python
17:43 < CookieMichal> and one of modules needed python to compile it self
17:43 < CookieMichal> npm install lame
17:44 < CookieMichal> ^^
17:44 < EastByte> ah
17:44 < CookieMichal> What's the fastest way to see and edit %PATH%
17:45 < CookieMichal> found it :)
17:48 < Savander> :((O
17:49 < CookieMichal> it seems that bam still uses wrong python :c
17:50 <@deen> remove some temporary bam files?
17:50 < CookieMichal> bam -c
17:50 < CookieMichal> ?
17:51 <@deen> or maybe restart the terminal
17:51 < CookieMichal> Done and still wrong :/
17:51 <@deen> weird

17:51 < Savander> i guess

18:25 < CookieMichal> help me :<
18:26 < CookieMichal> [146/169] [1] c++ src/game/client/components/menus_ingame.cpp
18:26 < CookieMichal> 'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
18:26 < CookieMichal> operable program or batch file.
18:26 < CookieMichal> bam.exe: 'c++ src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp' error 1
18:26 < CookieMichal> It shows 155 times :c
18:26 < EastByte> you need to start the dev console of visual studio
18:27 < CookieMichal> Thank you XD
18:27 < CookieMichal> I am dumb XD
18:27 < CookieMichal> GOD DAMN IT XD
18:27 < laxa> deen: you wanna get rid of moderators and problem of kicks ?
18:27 < laxa> I have the solution
18:27 < laxa> sv_vote_majority 1
18:28 <@deen> NO
18:29 < laxa> Why not ? xD
18:29 < CookieMichal> what does it do? :>
18:30 < laxa> it takes the majority to end the vote
18:30 < laxa> 5 yes against 2 no will make the vote pass if server is full with 64 players.
18:31 < laxa> deen: btw, I feel like voting when in team is "bugged"
18:31 <@deen> afk
18:31 < laxa> the display bars doesn't work properly at least, or voters are not counted well enough
18:33 < CookieMichal> deen osaur :>
18:35 < EastByte> make the deenosaur!
18:56 <@deen> laxa: hmm, debug it!
18:56 < laxa> lol
18:56 < laxa> I thought you changed the behavior of votes on team already.
18:56 <@deen> i did
18:56 <@deen> but maybe it#s buggy?
18:56 < laxa> Well, let me try it
19:00 < laxa> ok
19:01 < laxa> few bugs
19:01 < laxa> first test : me + dummy on same team without starting
19:01 < laxa> I try to spec vote him
19:01 < laxa> everyone could vote on it, then I changed the player to team 0 before the end of the vote
19:01 < laxa> vote passed
19:01 < laxa> but I wasn't in spec
19:01 < laxa> second test with me + dummy in team with timer started
19:01 < laxa> everyone could vote too...
19:02 < laxa> deen: btw, why no sv_vote_majority 1 ?
19:03 < laxa> with that, you would not need any moderator
19:03 <@deen> laxa: because then every funvote would go through
19:03 < laxa> Well, if people aren't dumb, it should not
19:03 <@deen> if people want f4, they will not vote f4
19:03 <@deen> they vote nothing instead
19:04 < laxa> if people know that sv_vote_majority is active, then they should v ote accordingly
19:04 <@deen> on ddmax it was active
19:04 <@deen> and funvotes always went through
19:04 < laxa> well then, you need moderators :D
19:07 < laxa> deen: ok new bug !
19:08 < laxa> when you are listing favorites (I dunno for internet tab) and double click a friend in your friend tab, it doesn't always scroll to the server they are in.
19:08 < laxa> it works half the time
19:16 <@deen> mods are no good, people still spam me
19:18 < laxa> you need 1 moderator per server
19:18 < laxa> so you need more of them
19:18 <@deen> ah
19:18 <@deen> so 120 mods
19:18 < laxa> Yeah xD.
19:18 <@deen> and they need to be online 24/7
19:18 < laxa> Yeah
19:20 < laxa> Or you can choose to have sv_vote_majority, your choice :)
19:20 <@deen> or i can mute you, 3rd alternative :P
19:20 < laxa> xD
19:20 < CookieMichal> ____________
19:21 < laxa> So, what about those 2 issues I sent you, should I post them on github ?
19:22 < Savander> delete moderators
19:22 < Savander> add me as Administrator
19:22 < Savander> yes.
19:22 < Savander> good solution

20:23 < _KinG> and now i'm in vps chatting with you xD
20:23 < CookieMichal> linux is better for VPS in my opinion :I
20:24 < EastByte> My irc session also runs on my server :)
20:25 < CookieMichal> Woah
20:29 < CookieMichal> deen left :O
20:29 < EastByte> oh
20:29 < CookieMichal> hehe
20:29 < CookieMichal> Q: set my mode +o :D
20:30 < _KinG> deen:  is it possiable for u to give me another link?cause i'm downloading 10kbps from github and don't know why
20:32 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/master.zip
20:32 < CookieMichal> 10kbps D:
20:32 < CookieMichal> woah
20:33 < _KinG> thanks deen :X
20:35 < _KinG> there is a minecraft server running on this vps and it's using 90% and somtimes 100% of cpu :|
20:36 < Savander> lol
20:36 < Savander> Windows VPS
20:36 < Savander> WOW
20:36 < Savander> xD
20:36 < Savander> windows vps only for microsoft products
20:36 < Savander> that's all
20:36 < Savander> :O
20:36 < _KinG> i hate to type in terminal so i like windows xD
20:37 < Savander> oh man...
20:37 < CookieMichal> Do u know that you can install GUI for Linux?
20:37 < CookieMichal> Something called gnome
20:38 < _KinG> i knew but takes ram so i prefer not to do it my friend works on linux for me his name is bor
20:38 < Savander> or KDE
20:38 < Savander> or a lot of much lighter
20:38 < Savander> gui
20:38 < Savander> lol
20:38 < Savander> "takes ram"
20:38 < Savander> windows takes more
20:38 < Savander> xd
20:41 < _KinG> that's the point the linux vps we want to buy got 512mb ram but this one have 8gb ram xD
20:43 < Savander> still linux better
20:44 < _KinG> in iran 98% of people have windows vps and they don't even know how to connect to a linux vps
20:45 <@deen> which i fund really funny
20:45 < _KinG> i guess deen knew it
20:45 < _KinG> right deen ?:D
20:45 <@deen> weren't there sanctions against Iran from the US until last year?
20:45 <@deen> so you couldn't even buy Windows in Iran?
20:46 < _KinG> we have cracked windows
20:46 <@deen> ^^
20:46 <@deen> Guessed so
20:46 < _KinG> that's not iran's problem we don't want this government it was ahmadinejad's fault
20:47 < _KinG> 99% of iranian people hate him and government 
20:48 < _KinG> i don't know why but internet of iran got some serious problems with servers out side of iran
20:48 <@deen> Government is better now, _KinG ?
20:48 < _KinG> liek this one i download 200MB per second from iranian servers but 20kb from your server 
20:49 < _KinG> deen: so much better than ahmadinejad
20:49 <@deen> =)
20:49 < _KinG> this new president want to make everything better like 40 years ago
20:50 <@deen> yeah, copying stuff on iranian servers always takes forever
20:50 <@deen> same as chile
20:50 < _KinG> but still the leader of iran (khamenei) is a dictator 
20:50 < _KinG> deen: if our relationship with us becomes good again then i gues we can have real internets :|
20:51 < _KinG> deen: i bought 2mb internet and i downlaod 250KBps but if i buy 2mb in german maybe i can download 1MB or more
20:52 < _KinG> i knew a guy that download 700~800MB in romania
20:52 < CookieMichal> 700MB/S ?
20:53 < _KinG> yep
20:53 < CookieMichal> WTF
20:53 < _KinG> let me give u the link to see
20:53 < CookieMichal> I have UP TO (read again UP TO) 1 Gbit/s
20:54 < _KinG> http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3462007179
20:54 < _KinG> actually 800mb not MB lol sry
20:54 < _KinG> but still it's so much for home use
20:54 < CookieMichal> but router has only 100 Mbit/s out
20:55 < CookieMichal> and my Ethernet card in PC doesn't want to work on 100 Mbit/s and it works on 10Mbit/s
20:55 < _KinG> the point is he don't use router
20:55 < _KinG> i don't know how but this is the speedtest
20:55 < _KinG> look at it
20:55 < CookieMichal> I saw
20:56 < _KinG> maybe light fiber 
20:56 < CookieMichal> Mb on speedtest stands for Mega BYTES or BITS ?
20:57 < Savander> bits
20:57 < _KinG> i guess bits cause Mega Byte is MB and Mb is Megabit
20:57 < CookieMichal> Some ppl don't understand difference
20:57 < Savander> 1byte - 8 bits
20:58 < CookieMichal> 96,32 MB = 770.56 Mb
20:58 < CookieMichal> woah
20:58 < _KinG> this guy pings 10 in mw3 NO ONE in the world ping under 20 in mw3
20:58 < _KinG> when i'm the host i ping 25 in mw3 i don't the hell know how this guy pings like this
20:59 < CookieMichal> If my ethernet card would be better and I wouldn't use router it would be: up to 128 MB :>
20:59 < CookieMichal> but I'll never achieve such score with this PC :)
20:59 < _KinG> my pc is worse
21:00 < _KinG> 3GB ram 3core cpu 250GB hard(too low) 
21:00 < _KinG> and my steam folder is 100GB by itself just takes 1 drive
21:02 < CookieMichal> Me: CPU: Intel Pentium D 3.20 GHz 3.20GHz (Dual core), RAM: 2.00 GB DDR2 @ 866 MHz, GPU: 512MB nVidia GeForce 9500GT
21:02 < CookieMichal> I don't think u have worse PC then mine
21:02 < CookieMichal> than *
21:11 < laxa> CookieMichal: wtf are you serious ?
21:11 < CookieMichal> ye
