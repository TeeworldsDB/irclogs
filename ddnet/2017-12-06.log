00:16 <+ddnet-discord> <|UbS| Rockus> oh
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> RUS down, GER ddos in full swing
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we can't do much
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> no doubt
15:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> We are doomed to ddoses
15:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
16:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes
16:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ger under ddos
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> @deen our of interest, how far did you get with your hookrace idea back then?
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what idea?
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Shishigami> @ChillerDragon https://hookrace.net/blog/what-is-hookrace/
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @cineara not far at all, just brainstorming, some random code, learning a new programming language, reporting dozens of bugs, writing blog articles about the language, forgetting that I wanted to write a game initially
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> I see :D
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> thanks
16:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lol
16:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but sounds kewl
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yo mates
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i ripped the randomness ._.
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/387992448938541066/Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-06_um_16.33.00.png
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ``rand() % 3 - 1`` dropped 0 20 times in a row
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ``rand() % 3 - 1`` dropped ``0`` 20 times in a row
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> are you seeding it?
16:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> srand (time(NULL));
16:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/srand/
16:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> hm
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but in other test program it works without srand
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sec ill try
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> its weird. ._. i have to call srand everytime before i call rand to change the value
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> where can i buy teeworlds tee-shirt?
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ddnet.tw
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> https://shop.spreadshirt.de/ddnet/
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> DDNet doesn't get any money from them, but you can buy DDNet T-Shirts.
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> wtf
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> not good
17:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @ChillerDragon no you dont
17:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you seed the randomness with srand one time
17:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> all following calls to rand() will get you a new random number
17:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if the seed is the same the sequence of numbers returned by rand() will be the same
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon you should only call `srand` once per program, early in your `main` function
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> teeworlds on linux feels so off
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> What's off about it 🤔
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it doesn't feel smooth :/
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @gdin didnt u say u play tw on windows too?
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> No, I hate windows xd
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> @Learath2 If you're running it through X11, I find that fullscreen actually makes a big difference
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but then I have to endure the blackscreen while switching windows 😛
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> I just made a bind to unfullscreen whenever I want to change windows xD
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> worth the trouble
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and my resolution getting messed up everytime I switch screens :/
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i havent got a single distro supporting 144hz nicely
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> so i play on windows
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> My monitor is 60Hz rip
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it feels lot lot more smooth at144
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it feels lot lot more smooth at 144
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Ye i'd imagine
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and since i can get perfectly more than 144fps it is even more smooth on teeworlds :D
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (i got 2000fps on average hehe)
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (i get 2000fps on average hehe)
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Aha I got 6000 before on my desktop, but current machine gets like 200
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well fps depends, playing with entities or not
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Haven't played with graphics in years
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> 😂
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :twinbop:
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I consistently get 1000fps, doesnt stop it from stuttering both on windows and on linux
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> windows is masterrace for gaming
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> pls gdin
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> I don't disagree
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> but I hate windows more than I would reap benefits
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> not worth
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it is, cause the strong push from microsoft to the gpu manufacturers and their drivers
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I only restart to windows to play games nowadays
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> same
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it's called wintendo
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> I had a win7 partition for a while but only booted it like 3 times a year xd
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> so eventually nuked it for more storage
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wintendo
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki liez, you program in C#
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> visual studio is such a good tool
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> butu  can use mono
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and program in linux too
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> mono is 😦
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> with monodevelop
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> VS Code is p nice when configured right
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> vs code != visual studio
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> visual studio knows basically everything of c#
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its like the perfect ide for it
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xD
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it sucks on other languages tho
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> aha for c# makes sense I guess
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> I use vscode for cpp mostly
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yeah
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why mono is sad face?
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i find it a nice thing
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also .NET core is crossplatform now
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> although I'm tempted to learn emacs 🤔 🤔
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it brings the windows ecosystem that i hate to linux
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> quite the rabbit hole tho
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> emacs is like an entire OS 😄
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> yep 😂
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i recommend http://spacemacs.org/
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!"
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I'm really stuck between biting the bullet and buying sublime text or configuring vim and learning a thousand keybinds
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Vim!
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> it's so worth it :thinking_smirk:
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and by the time i'm done with vim it'll be so slow because of all the "unnecessary" plugins I want 😛
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if u know lot of keybindings u will be more profitable on vim
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> it just becomes muscle memory after using it for a while
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I know all the basics but to be an efficient user you need a lot more
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> dont really need to make much concious effort imo
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> also my hjkl-fu is off since I stopped playing nethack
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @gdin do you use vim?
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i do when im on linux and editing scripts
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> neovim
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://neovim.io/
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i still love that vim has a joke on its main page
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://www.vim.org/
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I need a more regular user to ask plugin performance
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and its this http://www.vim.org/images/vim_drill_small.JPG
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> @Learath2 I use vscode with vim keybinds for heavier projects, and vim for small edits usually
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Tempted to go to vim fully at some point
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> really don't want to get into vscode
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Yeah its kinda fucky
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> scared I'll get too connected and micro$$$oft will pull a 180
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> I just like it for the gdb frontend xD
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> yeah also worried about m $
18:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> got so used to gdb the frontends disturb me now 😛
18:31 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Once I get used to it normally, thats when I can switch to just vim xD
18:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> did you try gdb -tui?
18:31 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> oo no
18:32 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Didn't know that was a thing
18:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 😃
18:32 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> will have to check that out :feelsgoodman:
18:35 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> who heard about the timeless debugger
18:36 <+nemo2> https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1
18:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> atom was such a let down for me 😦
18:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I really wanted to love it, I start it up it takes 30 seconds :(((
18:37 <+nemo2> composability is a big deal. even though I probably only use a tiny fraction of vim's power
18:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> file gets too big it starts lagging :/
18:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> with sublime I can lazy load huge files
18:41 <+nemo2> Learath2: I don't really use hjkl much.  too used to arrow keys.  Use their visual mode tons
18:42 <+nemo2> Learath2: I like ctrl-v block select/replace in code
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I need to get used to it b/c my next keyboard doesnt have arrow keys 😛
18:43 <+nemo2> Also use their regex a lot. love the fact you can call formulas on the matches. more convenient to do it in-editor than to fire up a code tool
18:43 <+nemo2> O_o
18:43 <+nemo2> whaaat? kbd w/o arrow keys? heresy.
18:43 <+nemo2> even my tiny compact kbd I use to make coding on my phone less painful has arrow keys
18:44 <+nemo2> I did use vim with vs last time I actually had to use visual studio - but, that was like 12 years ago.
18:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats a nice article nemo2
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Just rebind all arrow key functions to hjkl :toptri:
18:45 <+nemo2> https://vim-adventures.com/
18:45 <+nemo2> heh
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :o
18:46 <+nemo2> I really don't see the advantage of hjkl frankly.  vim is everywhere. arrow keys are everywhere.  if I was going to use non-←↑↓→  I'd use wasd I think
18:46 <+nemo2> more intuitive arrangement
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hjkl much better positioned on the keyboard tho
18:46 <+nemo2> ehhh
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I have to bend my wrist to get to arrow keys and I end up away from all other keys at the end
18:47 <+nemo2> so wasd then 😉
18:47 <+nemo2> familiar w/ it from games
18:47 <+nemo2> nothing to relearn
18:47 <+nemo2> fingers are even in same position as arrows
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> It's nearly as efficient for me as arrow keys, and your hand already rests there
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> feels just as natural after getting used to ir
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> feels just as natural after getting used to it
18:47  * nemo2 shrugs.
18:48 <+nemo2> like a ton of vim stuff, the only reason I haven't gotten to using it is there's no reason to do so
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wasd could actually be nice
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I might try that out
18:48 <+nemo2> like. I don't use marks and copy buffers nearly enough
18:48 <+nemo2> I should, and I bet I'd get an extra like 5% in speed if I did so
18:48 <+nemo2> but just can't be bothered
18:49 <+nemo2>  /pattern and % work well enough
18:49 <+nemo2> hell. sometimes I undo/redo to get back to a prior action point just 'cause I can't be bothered to use the `.  history ☺
18:50 <+nemo2> or g,
18:50 <+nemo2> well g,/g;
18:50 <+nemo2> g, and g; are good if doing a lot of changes all over a file tho.  and that's also when I start doing mark points
18:50 <+nemo2> 'course by then I've probably said eff it and broken out global replace/regex ☺
18:51 <+nemo2> " why am I copying and pasting this change from 30 lines back, then fixing it for this context when I could just be doing :↑ s///
19:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Shishigami> oh this vim adventures thing looks awesome tyty
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 @Learath2   (sorry for answering ur super old statement about the call the srand() one time in main but here it is:)    ye i thought that too. But i tested it. If i call it once it doesnt help i have to call it every time before i want to use rand(). I tested it in a plain test.c with only a loop which prints random numbers it works great. But in this special code i send earlyer i ha <message clipped>
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> show code
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon see also: http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/random/srand
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> >Each time rand() is seeded with the same seed, it must produce the same sequence of values.
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> >srand() is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
20:33 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: you guys only seed once?
20:33 <@heinrich5991> yes, we don't actually (want to) use randomness
20:33 <+nemo2> why?
20:34 <@heinrich5991> why would you want to use randomness? ^^
20:34 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: so people using same seed don't get same game... 
20:34 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: before we added more randomness we had players doing play prediction and seed abuse
20:34 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: much like why nethack changed to adding randomness during play
20:35 <@heinrich5991> well, teeworlds is pretty much deterministic, except for a few things that we (I) want to change
20:35 <+nemo2> sure. hedgewars is deterministic too...
20:35 <+nemo2> deterministic lockstep even
20:36 <+nemo2> nethack is pretty deterministic as well
20:36 <@heinrich5991> not really, is it?
20:36 <@heinrich5991> you even have random damage
20:36 <+nemo2> hm?
20:36 <@heinrich5991> miss chance, etc.
20:36 <+nemo2> ah
20:36 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: guess mean different things
20:37 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: skill vs chance
20:37 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: I personally prefer playing modes w/ less chance
20:37 <+nemo2> but oddly our most popular one is a mix.  I think 'cause it lets sucky players win from time to time
20:37 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: in case of nethack the RNG used to be *very* abusable
20:37 <@heinrich5991> yes, I remember the blog posts :)
20:37 <+nemo2> it was exploited on the online servers to generate arbitrary items and guarantee an easy speedrun
20:38 <+nemo2> so they mixed in human input. which is 'sact same thing we did. 
20:38 <+nemo2> still predictable in theory, just a lot harder
20:38 <+nemo2> most people can't be bothered ☺
20:38 <+nemo2> I had my home server attacked shortly after ruining some item predictor/selector's fun on our server
20:39 <+nemo2> all he had to do was run the simulation ahead and he could have done same thing, but I don't think he even knew how to build the game
21:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #962: Use a longer bors timeout (master...pr_ddnet_bors_longer_timeout) https://git.io/vbcxJ
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> > Idk it is a sub process fork or something i dont really understand
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> @ChillerDragon Well rand() is pseudorandom, with the same seed for each process it also will produce the same output, therefore having the same number on each fork is expected.
22:28 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye i guess that makes sense i thought of the same but i didnt know i was forking at all in the beginning
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> where do you fork? 😃
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> forking?
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Can you explain that word to me :D?
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's how you create new processes on non-windows
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it creates an exact* duplicate of your current process
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> now i understand
23:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> partially
