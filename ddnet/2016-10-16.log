17:01 <+pixel_> Hello
17:01 <+pixel_> I now know, how can i compile ddnet server ..., it works :D
17:02 <+pixel_> but how can i compile normal teeworlds server?
17:02 <+pixel_> ._.
17:08 <@heinrich5991> download the source code, execute bam in the source code directory
17:09 <@heinrich5991> pixel_: where do you hit the problem?
17:10 <+pixel_> ähm
17:10 <+pixel_> with the teeworlds-master i do the same like with the ddnet-master?
17:11 <+pixel_> because the ddnet-visual-studio-project.zip makes it easy to compile it, do i have something like this in the normal teeworlds too? ,::,
17:11 <@heinrich5991> probably not. where did you get that?
17:11 <+pixel_> at the tutorial from milk in the forum
17:11 <+pixel_> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3061
17:13 <+pixel_> but the things i did with the ddnet-master, i have to do the same with teeworlds-master!? xD
17:13 <+pixel_> the tutorials from youtube didn't work .....
17:15 <@heinrich5991> that's a nice tutorial for ddnet, have to bookmark this
17:15 <+pixel_> :D yeah, thanks to milk!!
17:16 <@heinrich5991> so, which version of teeworlds do you want to compile?
17:17 <+pixel_> the 0.6.3
17:18 <@heinrich5991> then download the source code from here: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads
17:19 <+pixel_> oke.. i had the teeworldsmaster from github xd
17:22  * pixel_ slaps pixel_ around a bit with a large fishbot
17:23 <@heinrich5991> well, what do you want to compile. the teeworlds master from github is the 0.7 development version
17:23 <@heinrich5991> if you want to compile that, then download that
17:24 <+pixel_> nahnah the 0.6.3 is the right xd
17:24 <+pixel_> but 
17:25 <+pixel_> i do everything with it like with the ddnet version, and then how to edit it??  when i open as example the character.cpp i can just save it, idk how to compile it then, and save is not enough
17:27 <@heinrich5991> so you have downloaded and extracted the source code
17:27 <@heinrich5991> can you open the *visual studio* console?
17:28 <+pixel_> yes i can
17:28 <+pixel_> i have installed VS
17:28 <+pixel_> i extracted the source in C:\teeworlds
17:33 <@heinrich5991> where do you have bam.exe?
17:33 <@heinrich5991> for faster replies, you can ping me (include my name in your message. that way I'll get notified)
17:33 <+pixel_> i have bam.exe in the same folder
17:34 <+pixel_> in C:\teeworlds\ba.exe <@heinrich5991>
17:34 <+pixel_> ._:
17:35 <+pixel_> @heinrich5991
17:35 <+Learath2> even if you ping him irc is a slow medium
17:35 <+pixel_> ^^
17:35 <+fstd> IRC is a fast medium
17:35 <+Learath2> on the console cd to C:\teeworlds
17:35 <+pixel_> do i ping right?
17:36 <+Learath2> fstd: you know wat i mean
17:36 <+fstd> pixel_: most people ping like this
17:36 <+pixel_> xD
17:36 <+pixel_> funny sound
17:37 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: so
17:37 <+Learath2> pixel_: cd to the directory and do bam.exe release_all I guess
17:37 <+pixel_> i try
17:37 <@heinrich5991> ah
17:37 <@heinrich5991> cd C:\teeworlds
17:37 <+Learath2> nice ping
17:37 <@heinrich5991> bam.exe
17:37 <+pixel_> bam.exe release_all??
17:37 <+pixel_> or bam.exe server_release
17:37 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: only the last one hit my client
17:37 <@heinrich5991> just "bam" should suffice
17:38 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: because i just want to edit the server ... do i write bam server_release
17:38 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: you have some kind of exact matching ?
17:38 <@heinrich5991> I don't know
17:38 <@heinrich5991> pixel_: yes
17:38 <@heinrich5991> you can do that
17:38 <@heinrich5991> doesn't matter
17:38 <@heinrich5991> just "bam" also gives you the server [and the client]
17:38 <+pixel_> error
17:39 <+pixel_> but wait
17:39 <+Learath2> well thats not very descriptive
17:39 <@heinrich5991> my crystal ball is out of order right now, can you tell us a more precise error?
17:40 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: wait i am trying something
17:41 <+pixel_> yeah ...
17:41 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: 631/632 work but the last says: bam: error: a build step failed
17:42 <@heinrich5991> execute bam again
17:42 <@heinrich5991> and check what it says now
17:42 <@heinrich5991> (also, you're not compiling 0.6.3, you're compiling some 0.7 version I think)
17:43 <+pixel_> o.O i cant copy from this consol -.-
17:43 <+pixel_> C:\teeworlds>bam [1/6] [1] c++ src/engine/client/sound.cpp [2/6] [3] c++ src/engine/client/input.cpp [3/6] [4] c++ src/engine/client/client.cpp [4/6] [2] c++ src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp src/engine/client/input.cpp(3): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'SDL.h': No such file or directory src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp(2): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'SDL.h': No such file or directory bam: 'c++ src/en
17:43 <+pixel_> ok ... this is the 2nd bam output
17:43 <@heinrich5991> ah okay, then just do "bam server_debug"
17:43 <@heinrich5991> then it should be fine
17:45 <+pixel_> bam: target 'server_debug' not found
17:45 <+pixel_> heinrich5991 just errors .-_-
17:45 <@heinrich5991> ah right, you're compiling 0.7, there it's bam server maybe?
17:45 <@heinrich5991> "bam server"
17:46 <+pixel_> then it says: bam targets are up to date already c:
17:46 <+Learath2> then you compiled the server just fine
17:46 <+Learath2> the client doesnt compile b/c you presumably dont have SDL
17:46 <+pixel_> i dont need the client, just the server :D
17:47 <@heinrich5991> you have compiled the server :)
17:47 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: but how to run it now??ß :o
17:47 <@heinrich5991> "targets are up to date already" -> "you have already successfully compiled the server"
17:47 <@heinrich5991> go to build/, next subdirectory, and then double-click teeworlds_srv.exe
17:47 <@heinrich5991> and you have your own 0.7 server
17:48 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: the new server is in build/x86 :o xD
17:48 <+pixel_> meh i need to write a config -_-
17:49 <@heinrich5991> you don't have to
17:49 <@heinrich5991> it should say something like "rcon password is ..."
17:49 <@heinrich5991> in the console
17:49 <+pixel_> nop
17:49 <@heinrich5991> mh
17:49 <+pixel_> the consol closes outomatically
17:49 <@heinrich5991> then you already have a teeworlds server running
17:49 <@heinrich5991> (likely)
17:49 <+pixel_> at the ddnet server it says the password
17:50 <+fstd> it probably looks for autoexec.cfg in the current working dir
17:50 <@heinrich5991> is the ddnet server running?
17:50 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: no teeworlds server running
17:50 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: i think i have to write one
17:50 <@heinrich5991> the config won't help with the immediately closing server
17:51 <@heinrich5991> maybe try executing it in the command line to check what it says before closing
17:51 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: last question: how can i edit now the serverthings? :o i have no project.sln of the teeworldsthing
17:51 <@heinrich5991> open a file in whatever editor, e.g. visual studio
17:51 <@heinrich5991> change something
17:51 <@heinrich5991> and re-execute "bam server"
17:52 <+pixel_> :o everytime run bam server .. xD ok thank you!!!
17:53 <+pixel_> server is still closing after opening
17:53 <@heinrich5991> [17:51:08] <@heinrich5991> maybe try executing it in the command line to check what it says before closing
17:53 <+pixel_> when running from consol, it dont say anything
17:54 <@heinrich5991> what happens if you run it from the console?
17:54 <+pixel_> ah now
17:54 <+pixel_> it says something
17:54 <+pixel_> C:\teeworlds\build\x86\debug>call teeworlds_srv.exe [5803a2bb][engine]: running on windows-win32-ia32 [5803a2bb][engine]: arch is little endian [5803a2bb][storage]: couldn't open storage.cfg [5803a2bb][storage]: using standard paths [5803a2bb][storage]: added path '$USERDIR' ('C:\Users\simon\AppData\Roaming/Teeworlds') [5803a2bb][storage]: added path '$DATADIR' ('data') [5803a2bb][storage]: added path '$CURRENTDIR' ('C:\teeworlds\buil
17:55 <+pixel_> hm
17:55 <@heinrich5991> just post the last messages please
17:55 <@heinrich5991> not all of it gets through
17:56 <+pixel_>  xd
17:57 <+pixel_> failed to load map
17:57 <+pixel_> mapname=dm1
17:58 <@heinrich5991> and above that something like "invalid standard map"?
17:59 <+pixel_> no, but i have an idea
18:00 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: now the server is not closing, but i cant connect
18:00 <@heinrich5991> what did you change?
18:00 <+pixel_> last line: [5803a3f6][server]: maps/dm1.map crc is f2159e6e
18:01 <+pixel_> i added the path to map dm1 ._.
18:01 <+pixel_> last line: [5803a436][register]: chose 'master1.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats
18:01 <+pixel_> but i can not connect
18:01 <@heinrich5991> what did you try to connect?
18:02 <+pixel_> to the server
18:06 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: what to do now?
18:06 <@heinrich5991> what IP address did you connect to? try 127.0.0.1:8303
18:06 <+pixel_> i wrote localhost
18:07 <+pixel_> heinrich5991 but it dont work, dont care what i write
18:08 <@heinrich5991> yea, could you please provide more detailed info of what you try
18:08 <@heinrich5991> then helping would be easier
18:08 <@heinrich5991> please describe what you do, and what you expect to happen, and what doesn't happen
18:08 <@heinrich5991> how are you connecting to the server
18:08 <+pixel_> i try to connect to the lan server
18:08 <+pixel_> i write in f1: connect localhost
18:08 <+pixel_> but i cant connect
18:09 <@heinrich5991> what does it mean "I can't connect"
18:09 <+pixel_> the server is not at the lanserverlist
18:09 <+pixel_> and at the serverconsol suddenly i get this error:
18:09 <+pixel_> the masterserver reports that clients can not connect to this server
18:09 <+pixel_> maybe because ddnet client? ._:
18:10 <@heinrich5991> no, that's completely unrelated
18:10 <@heinrich5991> pixel_: what port does it mention
18:10 <@heinrich5991> ah fuck
18:10 <@heinrich5991> I knwo why
18:10 <@heinrich5991> you compiled a 0.7 server
18:10 <@heinrich5991> and you try to connect to it with a 0.6 client
18:10 <@heinrich5991> that doesn't work
18:10 <+pixel_> oh shit
18:10 <+pixel_> xD
18:12 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: where can i find a source to the 0.6.3 server?
18:12 <@heinrich5991> I told you in the very beginning.
18:12 <@heinrich5991> [17:17:09] <+pixel_> the 0.6.3
18:12 <@heinrich5991> [17:18:40] <@heinrich5991> then download the source code from here: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads
18:12 <+pixel_> yes i know
18:13 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: oh wtf, i am so stupid XD i downloaded everytime the client win32 not the source XDd
18:16 <+pixel_> ähm
18:16 <+pixel_> funny thing ... [string "src/base.lua"]:38: this file for version 0.4.x of bam. you are running 0.5.x. bam: script error (-t for more detail)
18:16 <+pixel_> i use teeworlds-0.6.3-src#
18:17 <+pixel_> nothing 0.5
18:17 <@heinrich5991> you have bam 0.5. you need bam 0.4
18:17 <+pixel_> but, in a tutorial, they say, i need this bam master, cuz bam 0.4 is buggy
18:18 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: this is gay .... i need visual studio 8,9,10 installed ... omg why
18:19 <+fstd> just the usual pain in the ass that is developing software on windows
18:19 <+pixel_> argh
18:20 <+pixel_> grr installing visual c++ 2010
18:21 <@heinrich5991> mh. editing the build_... file should suffice
18:24 <+pixel_> installed \^-^/
18:25 <+fstd> but do you have the right CD-Key?
18:25 <+pixel_> no
18:25 <+pixel_> i dont need
18:25 <+pixel_> bam is compiled
18:25 <+pixel_> now
18:25 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: do i have to write bam server_release now?
18:25 <@heinrich5991> yes
18:28 <+pixel_> yes it is donw
18:28 <+pixel_> done
18:29 <+pixel_> heinrich5991: fstd: thank you guys, it is working<3
18:29 <+pixel_> i go off now :DDDDDD
18:30 <+pixel_> thank you sooo muuch!
