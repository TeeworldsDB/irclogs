08:05 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> Is there any public script I can use for BrIndicateFinished?
09:02 < bridge_> <j.0u> How can I convert this :

09:03 < bridge_> <j.0u> into this :
09:03 < bridge_> <j.0u> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147426568398966845/image.png
09:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/README.md
09:14 < bridge_> <j.0u> I have already built it, but I don't know how I can make it small and without many files like the normal form
09:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno how you built it but
09:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> `ninja package_zip` 
09:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> would create a zip
09:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> our MSVC CI does:
09:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
09:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> cmake --build . --config Release --target package_default
09:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
09:18 < bridge_> <j.0u> aright
09:51 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> ?
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bro 
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 1. stop pushing your questions all the time
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 2. in europe most ppl still sleep or do breakfast
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 3. your question is really bad. Try to make it more clear
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 4. BrIndicateFinished is controlled by ddnet-info, so you'd have to replace that
09:58 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Mad jopsti
10:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> BTW jopsti I got 1 second game freezes every idk hour or something like that. Maybe it’s also just half a second. But it’s enough to kill me in block/ddrace/gores. I wonder how to debug that since it’s becoming annoying. It might be my hax client but I did not really add new features in years. Or it might be my pc I can’t really tell.
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mhh, i guess a good start is monitoring all sensors / usages
10:05 < bridge_> <mysteryza> If I want to add a feature should I make a feature request somewhere before implementing it?
10:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> issue section is a good place
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> CPU usage, network, hard drive etc
10:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Those are sensors?
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> usages
10:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> What are sensors
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well temperature etc
10:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ah
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> watch -n 0.1 sensors
10:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Idk how to measure those so precise
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> depends, if you want to use that feature anyway (e.g. custom client) go ahead
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if you defs want it inside ddnet:
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
10:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Because the freeze is like so short I can not react and check anything
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then do
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> watch -n 0.1 sensors
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then do
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> watch -n 0.01 sensors
10:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I would have to let some graph with 0.1 second interval run at all times on my 2nd screen
10:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Is it that fast?
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well log it into a file or smth
10:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> For 1 hour?
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 0.01 is "every 0.01 seconds"
10:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Until it happens xd
10:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes why not
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yea but does that work?
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Idk
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Dunno if I even have a sensors command that works
10:08 < bridge_> <metamuffin> watch wont let you go faster than 0.1s :(
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> That’s what I thought
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I mean I can do it my self
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> With while in bash
10:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But still
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if some kernel addons can detect lags xd
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> probably depends of if it's hardware or software bug
10:09 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Maybe I should try vanilla ddnet client
10:09 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But it’s unplayable for a long time
10:09 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I need my hax
10:09 < bridge_> <metamuffin> you could check dmesg, maybe there is actually something logged because of the lag or maybe even that caused the lag.
10:10 < bridge_> <metamuffin> dont think this is the problem though
10:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> You think?
10:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I mean it’s worth a shot
10:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller
10:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you could try to have 2 clients open
10:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and see if it happens on both
10:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It feels more like the client spends time in a long iteration
10:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And then?
10:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> How would I see that?
10:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, how do you see it now
10:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> record it
10:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> The time it takes me to look from one client to the other
10:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I see it now because I play active on that client
10:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so ok let's do it differently then.
10:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lets do the science way
10:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ok xd
10:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I thought about a client edit
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Let's assume it's a hardware fail, e.g. overheating.
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What are ways to monitor it?
10:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> There is the dbg graph
10:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Maybe give it more history
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Either the kernel knows about it and logs "yo bro, got hot here"
10:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> So I can open those and check for a spike
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or watch temperatures
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or check if ALL software was hit by that
10:13 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I wonder if there is a smooth tool that can do the watching for me
10:13 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And alert on temperature spike
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Let's assume it's a software bug:
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> There must either be some insane usage (e.g. inside ddnet)
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or outside of ddnet
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The only way i could think of is taking an extrem amount of snapshots of current CPU cycle usage and hope the bug happens before your disk fills xdd
10:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Xd
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but what also works is following:
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Did it ever happen before?
10:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yes a few times on this pc
10:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But I barley play
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I mean like. did it not happen 2 weeks ago
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> when u still had Linux 1.0 and mesa 2.0 and DDNet 9
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u know
10:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ah it’s since a while i think
10:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> No
10:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Which was like idk.
10:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Linux 6
10:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ddnet 35
10:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> :D
10:19 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> 1. People dont usually scroll up and my question remains unanswered cuz no one sees it.
10:19 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> 2. My question is quite obvious :/ There is a script that merges your info to ddnet-info and I asked about that script.
10:19 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> 3. I have an idea about how it works, but I asked to check if there is such a thing open source.
10:19 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> And btw stop talking like its your personal discord. I asked a question, if u can't/don't want to answer it, just leave it be.
10:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah sure, you totally didn't intent to make it annoying by doing `?` all the time
10:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If nobody answers your question it might simply suck and the problem is you..
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Also you pushed it after like 1h early in the morning.
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Now back to your question. Most stuff ddnet does is here:
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts
10:23 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I think reading backlog is a thing in this channel
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if nothing is there, i guess you could directly tag deen and ask him
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> fluid simulation
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147454565290090617/image.png
10:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> 1. People often read the backlog of this channel.
10:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> 2. The question "Is there any public script I can use for BrIndicateFinished?" is definitely not obvious to me. Try to describe the outcome you are looking for instead of the steps you are trying to take to achieve that outcome (https://xyproblem.info/).
10:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> 3. It's not your personal Q&A discord either. Don't expect answers to your questions, especially not within a short period of time or if they are not understood by anyone (http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
10:55 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> why do they look so crisp (the assets)?
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, they are normal ddnet assets
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147454983919374386/image.png
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not even full resolution
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i currently try out split screen rendering a bit xd
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147455082170945577/image.png
10:57 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> just me then ^^
10:58 < ChillerDragon> jopsti
10:58 < ChillerDragon> wat are those epic screenshoits?
10:58 < ChillerDragon> ddnet2 infinite slot support?
10:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:58 < ChillerDragon> omagawd
10:58 < ChillerDragon> so good
10:58 < ChillerDragon> when deprecate ddnet
10:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
10:59 < ChillerDragon> is it blazingly fast physics?
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sadly realistically i am like 30% done with the new ddnet
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
10:59 < ChillerDragon> ._.
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not faster than normal ddnet
10:59 < ChillerDragon> idk if normal ddnet can handle soo many tees colliding
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well the server runs on desktop pc
10:59 < ChillerDragon> gaming
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not on VPS
11:00 < ChillerDragon> potato
11:00 < ChillerDragon> looks playable to me
11:00 < ChillerDragon> when first release?
11:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in this screenshot u even see the FPS
11:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 59
11:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno how many entities these are, but probably smth around 200
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 56* xd
11:01 < ChillerDragon> cool stuff
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, keep in mind in real world, what is huge CPU killer is network
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so quite possible it would run as bad as normal ddnet
11:01 < ChillerDragon> thats why you need the blazingly lightweight gaming protocol that goes by the name 0.7
11:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my network is threaded at least
11:02 < ChillerDragon> pog
11:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so it could make it a bit better
11:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it unpacks the msgs before sending it to the logic
11:02 < ChillerDragon> thats nice
11:02 < ChillerDragon> wdym by unpack?
11:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is nothing like pUnpacker->GetFloat()
11:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u get the package as normal struct object
11:03 < ChillerDragon> you get like a fully parsed struct?
11:03 < ChillerDragon> a
11:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
11:03 < ChillerDragon> cool
11:03 < ChillerDragon> only 1 network thread?
11:03 < ChillerDragon> or can that scale?
11:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well it can scale a bit maybe
11:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the network stuff itself is async multithreaded
11:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but as soon as the package is parsed it will go into a critical section
11:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the server itself is single threaded
11:04 < ChillerDragon> yea i see
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so what i can do is:
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> make sure a connection doesn't use x KB/s before the packet is pushed to the queue
11:05 < ChillerDragon> to avoid dos or what?
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well realistically it wont help
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but maybe it can make peaks less impactful
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> only time will tell
11:06 < ChillerDragon> sounds cool
11:06 < ChillerDragon> just ship it with built in reverse proxy support
11:06 < ChillerDragon> so the network thread can run on another vps
11:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i thought about it
11:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway, rn my TODO is not network
11:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i already wasted too much time for it xD
11:07 < ChillerDragon> xd
11:07 < ChillerDragon> net worth king
11:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean i worked on it like 5 months already and still so fucking far away from usable :c
11:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i really underestimated how much work it is
11:07 < ChillerDragon> sadge
11:08 < ChillerDragon> i copy paste 0.7 code to ddnet since 11 month lol
11:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
11:08 < ChillerDragon> ok enough procrastination
11:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what i like tho is, how instant everything is
11:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147458334459449364/test.mp4
11:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's how it should have been since ever
11:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i click a button top left in case u didnt see
11:11 < ChillerDragon> ye saw it very blazing
11:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is that multiple views in the same client? no globals? amazing 🙂
11:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes and yes xd
11:20 < ChillerDragon> no globals?
11:20 < ChillerDragon> whats that supposed to mean?
11:20 < ChillerDragon> no global variables for multi view?
11:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the fact that he can simply open more views
11:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like his classes are less global than teeworlds's
11:21 < ChillerDragon> ah i see
11:21 < ChillerDragon> or its accessing the same globals?
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes it generally has a relative clear hirachy
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a child component never calls parent functions.. if it wants to modify parent stuff it has to take it by mut ref
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes it generally has a relatively clear hirachy
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a child component never calls parent functions.. if it wants to modify parent stuff it has to take it by mut ref
11:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds cool. I always struggle to find such a clear design
11:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well tbf. this design isnt clear everywhere
11:22 < ChillerDragon> find in existing software or come up with it your self?
11:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and since i also have wasm support i tend to have an insane amount of libs xD
11:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
11:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147461713675960410/image.png
11:23 < ChillerDragon> bloat
11:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well some stuff is 100% poorely designed
11:23 < ChillerDragon> ARBEITSFLÄCHE
11:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> some stuff is bit tricky with WASM
11:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. base-fs is needed to split filesystem away from base
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs that shouldn't exists in WASM.. at least not without some wrapper
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, KDE 😬
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i always install debian in german
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i get german names for these xD
11:42 < ChillerDragon> cring
12:05 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> this is literally chillerdragon in blmapchill
12:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, chiller is a beater
12:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> metamuffin: who are you btw xdd
12:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or do you want to stay hidden
12:20 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Hi, is it possible to remove the changes brought for envelopes and quads (copy paste and points selection) ?
12:21 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Hi, is it possible to remove the changes brought for envelopes and quads (copy paste and points selection)?
12:21 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I hate to have to use an outdated client
12:21 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Hi, is it possible to remove the changes brought to envelopes and quads (copy paste and points selection)?
12:21 < bridge_> <metamuffin> just a random ddnet player. just recently joined this room.
12:22 < bridge_> <metamuffin> i am not developing on ddnet really; once did a bad pr but thats about it.
12:22 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Even if envelopes look nicer, they are not practical, it was much better as it was
12:23 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I already shared my opinion about quads a week ago or so
12:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok, but it looks like you have experience with development :D
12:25 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> It's noob friendly but the action in itself is something advanced a beginner won't use. It's only nerfing anyone trying to make an advanced design
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'd highly suggest to discuss this with mamare
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> either tag him or discuss it on github
12:26 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I think I already did here with him
12:26 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> @marmare_314
12:27 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> We should revert everything but the resizable envelope menu which is great
12:28 < bridge_> <mysteryza> Thoughts? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3024
12:28 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Also, if we are to add good changes to the editor, I'd ask to have a list of all the commands for the "Server settings" tab
12:28 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Like a drop down list
12:29 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> With clickable variables, or tooltips..
12:46 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I used the editor recently for the first time since the update and I found the new quads unusable, I struggled to do basic things like multi selection and copy pasting.
12:47 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> Envelope editor seems fine, it's nice to be able to stretch the timeline horizontally, but editing individual points is more annoying than it used to
12:55 < ChillerDragon> omg fuck this is ima rage quit marking bs
12:56 < ChillerDragon> this is what the vanilla client sends
12:56 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1693652166.png
12:56 < ChillerDragon> "cammo1" and it renders just fine
12:56 < ChillerDragon> this is what ddnet 7 client sends
12:56 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1693652198.png
12:56 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Thank you @ravie_ravie
12:57 < ChillerDragon> "cammo1" and a bunch of corrupted memory
12:57 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I knew you'd struggle as well
12:57 < ChillerDragon> but it doesnt render the shit
12:57 < ChillerDragon> oiuahwdh9ahwi0d
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur corrupted chiller
12:57 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147485367273009252/image.png
12:57 < ChillerDragon> :c
12:58 < ChillerDragon> how can a vanilla client not render a marking
12:58 < ChillerDragon> after receiving this network msg
12:58 < ChillerDragon> rigged
12:59 < ChillerDragon> @pipou_tw you can try proposing that here https://github.com/k2d222/twwe/issues
12:59 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I don't know if that's possible but you could make it automatic by using https://ddnet.org/settingscommands/
13:00 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I really don't understand how github works, what's twwe ?
13:01 < ChillerDragon> its a web editor
13:01 < ChillerDragon> building uis in web is easier than in tw code at least thats how i feel
13:01 < ChillerDragon> your design looks cool
13:01 < ChillerDragon> maybe k2 likes it and builds it into his web editor
13:01 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Ok ^^
13:02 < ChillerDragon> just click on new issue
13:02 < ChillerDragon> and upload your image
13:04 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> https://github.com/k2d222/twwe/issues/77
13:04 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> <https://github.com/k2d222/twwe/issues/77>
13:05 < ChillerDragon> cool
13:05 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> 👍
13:05 < ChillerDragon> but yea in the ddnet client it would also be cool ofc
13:05 < bridge_> <k2d222> sure I can do that, great idea 👍
13:05 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> How do I find DDNet's one for the editor?
13:06 < ChillerDragon> woah k2 woke
13:06 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> 😄
13:06 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
13:06 < bridge_> <k2d222> got github pinged that woke me up
13:06 < ChillerDragon> if you want to propose it for ddnet put it here
13:07 < ChillerDragon> k2 epic that you are still active
13:07 < ChillerDragon> codemirror lang support
13:07 < ChillerDragon> and new epic ui
13:07 < ChillerDragon> love the progress
13:07 < bridge_> <k2d222> yea I have some time to spend atm
13:08 < ChillerDragon> @pipou_tw yea i can highly recommend opening issues with feature requests if you spend time making such cool draft images. if you post em on discord they likley get lost
13:08 < ChillerDragon> the issue on gh will be looked at eventually
13:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Seems like a good idea, like #1406 but better, feel free to open an issue or add it to the existing one
13:09 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1406
13:09 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Alright thanks! I'm just not familiar with github but I'll think about it now
13:10 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> 👍
13:10 < ChillerDragon> github issues is not harder than reddit :D 
13:13 < ChillerDragon> look at pipou githubbing like a pro
13:13 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> 😂
13:15 < bridge_> <k2d222> careful once you start theres no going back
13:15 < ChillerDragon> cult
13:16 < bridge_> <k2d222> says the guru himself
13:16 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> :monkaStop:
13:16 < ChillerDragon> yo @pipou_tw there is also the pullrequest tab there you can see proposed code changes of other developers https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pulls
13:16 < ChillerDragon> most of it is technical
13:17 < ChillerDragon> but thats a good place to complain about editor features or give feedback before they get added to the client
13:18 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Ok, I'll try to keep up with the threads, it will have a be a new daily habit
13:20 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7102 Ok I see he's planning on doing it, great
13:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon:
13:21 < ChillerDragon> jospit
13:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i added a dummy counter now, wanted to see how many entities until i reach 50 FPS
13:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147491552843808878/test.mp4
13:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 50FPS = 50 ticks u know
13:22 < ChillerDragon> @pipou_tw if you like the revert you can react with a +1 :D 
13:22 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1693653727.png
13:23 < ChillerDragon> jopsti is that client bottle neck?
13:24 < ChillerDragon> i can render a big ass cow farm in java bloat minecraft on my laptop smoothly 
13:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> man this is so much fun NGL
13:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147492582247641188/image.png
13:26 < ChillerDragon> yes looks fun
13:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mhh quite possible a client limit
13:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it also always has to render everything 4 times xD
13:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs splitscreen
13:26 < ChillerDragon> bloatscreen
13:26 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I don't find where to upvote D:
13:26 < ChillerDragon> you did
13:27 < ChillerDragon> didnt u
13:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok i add dummies until my PC dies
13:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for you
13:27 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1693654062.png
13:28 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Ok I wasn't sure
13:28 < ChillerDragon> thats as upvote as it gets
13:28 < ChillerDragon> you are now ready to do all the githubbing my padawan
13:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> something like 800 is rip xD
13:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147493345959100446/image.png
13:29 < ChillerDragon> average t0 size
13:29 < bridge_> <k2d222> doesn't seem like a lot
13:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well it has to do the world physics
13:30 < ChillerDragon> go with one screen
13:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or is it just a tee
13:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw what is this project
13:30 < ChillerDragon> ddnet2
13:30 < ChillerDragon> written in rust
13:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as it should be
13:30 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg
13:31 < ChillerDragon> jopsti you dont push your commits quite often do u?
13:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes i dont want to push them
13:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yet
13:31 < ChillerDragon> i get shit scared of a drive fault if i dont push to gh every 5min
13:31 < ChillerDragon> woah Pipou__ 
13:31 < ChillerDragon> elo
13:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have backups on my VPS
13:31 < Pipou__> Hi :D
13:32 < ChillerDragon> pipou went full on developer mode
13:32 < Pipou__> What's IRC for?
13:32 < ChillerDragon> gaming
13:32 < ChillerDragon> its a chat ... duh
13:33 < ChillerDragon> to chat bruv
13:33 < Pipou__> Why would we chat here?
13:33 < ChillerDragon> where else would you chat
13:33 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Let me think
13:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> irc is the best
13:34 < ChillerDragon> discord is for the weak
13:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sadly cant put weeb pfp on irc tho
13:35 < ChillerDragon> uwu
13:35 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Become a irc dev, become leader, add weeb pfp
13:35 < ChillerDragon> pfp is bloat
13:35 < ChillerDragon> if you want bloat use matrix
13:36 < ChillerDragon> this is a chat not fakin pinterest
13:37 < ChillerDragon> ``git add -p`` is top50 most underrated git commands
13:37 < ChillerDragon> robi u use it?
13:37 < ChillerDragon> ur pro commit splitter
13:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> Until you can't add individual lines of the same hunk, then you need a Git GUI anyway
13:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: 765 is the max, more  = FPS go down, so simulation cant keep up
13:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147495559792435250/image.png
13:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> I use Git for Windows
13:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> To stage changes
13:37 < ChillerDragon> whats git for windows
13:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> And to look at the history
13:37 < ChillerDragon> isnt that just git
13:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> For everything else I use the command line
13:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> It includes a GUI
13:38 < ChillerDragon> make it faster jopsti
13:38 < ChillerDragon> ew gui
13:38 < ChillerDragon> wdym invididual lines?
13:38 < bridge_> <k2d222> lazygit is great
13:38 < ChillerDragon> lazygit bloat
13:38 < ChillerDragon> never peeked myy interest
13:39 < ChillerDragon> you can split hunks
13:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> If you changed two lines right next to each other you cannot stage only one when you use patch mode (`git add -p`)
13:39 < ChillerDragon> wot you cant split it?
13:39 < ChillerDragon> idk for me it always worked just fine
13:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can't split hunks if there is no unchanged line between
13:39 < ChillerDragon> i see
13:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> At least the last time I tried, maybe they made it smarter somehow
13:39 < ChillerDragon> AI powered
13:40 < bridge_> <k2d222> AI def bloat
13:40 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:40 < bridge_> <robyt3> Well, I have two shell scripts for Git usage that are mostly written by ChatGPT
13:40 < ChillerDragon> haha
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon: how should i make it faster lmao
13:41 < ChillerDragon> idk
13:41 < ChillerDragon> what makes it slow
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> even with some quadtree structure this would be a worst case tbh
13:41 < ChillerDragon> cant you have millions of particles in modern gaming?
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs all tees are touching each other
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then these particles dont hit each other
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> at the same time
13:41 < ChillerDragon> hmm
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or they accept inaccuracies
13:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. use the latest known position of the other particle
13:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but do it multi threaded
13:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but that's not possible with tw physics
13:42 < bridge_> <k2d222> gpu computed physics is a thing
13:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but these physics are often unreliable
13:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in a sense of tick based games
13:43 < bridge_> <k2d222> how so? ticks are great for parallelism on the contrary no?
13:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well how do you want to paralise smth that happens after each other
13:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tee1's position influcenes tee765's position
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> never used git gui in my life
13:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's how tw physics work
13:44 < ChillerDragon> didnt miss aynthing ryo
13:44 < ChillerDragon> its super confusing
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> git log shows history
13:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can format it nicely
13:45 < ChillerDragon> args for git log are same complexity than args for ffmpeg xd
13:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have  a alias
13:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you view git log and the diff at the same time?
13:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Feels more convenient to have a GUI for this
13:46 < bridge_> <k2d222> ok tbh I haven't looked at tw physics but do you mean there's an order in tees update? does that mean that physics depend on login order like weak or smth?
13:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> git log --full-diff
13:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's indeed the case
13:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can see it with weak fly
13:47 < ChillerDragon> @robyt3 yea thats where ui helps no g needed lazygit can do it too. But i do not mind coping the commit hash from the log command and then run a show command
13:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> weak down fly to be precise
13:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
13:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its git log -p
13:47 < ChillerDragon> ah tru
13:47 < ChillerDragon> thats also an option
13:47 < ChillerDragon> i do not use it 
13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```toml
13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> [alias]
13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lg1 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(auto)%d%C(reset)' --all

13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lg = lg1
13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> .gitconfig file
13:48 < ChillerDragon> dood xd
13:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> git lg
13:49 < ChillerDragon> told u 
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: sell me your CPU
13:49 < ChillerDragon> ffmpeg level
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i want to try 1000 tees xd
13:49 < ChillerDragon> how much?
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 6 fufzig
13:49 < ChillerDragon> scam
13:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 1 german coin
13:49 < ChillerDragon> good old germany coin
13:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how was the currency called
13:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in germany
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> here it was "pesetas"
13:50 < ChillerDragon> deutsches gold
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_peseta
13:50 < ChillerDragon> we use euro lol
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean before euro
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> omg
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u sometimes lower ur iq xd
13:50 < ChillerDragon> a
13:50 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:50 < ChillerDragon> mark
13:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> I still prefer GUI if I want to look at multiple commits. Let's you jump between files and commits much easier
13:50 < ChillerDragon> i too young
13:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147498858050490439/image.png
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> same
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> robyt u cant convince  us of gui
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://jonas.github.io/tig/
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Deutsche Mark
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use tig
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and before
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsmark
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> does it have nazi connotations
13:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think so
13:52 < ChillerDragon> brand safe moni
13:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> Well, Git for Windows also has its own console
13:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147499383944912967/image.png
13:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papiermark
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> try tig
13:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> man today i learn a lot
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:53 < ChillerDragon> time to switch to windows
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Name: GitLens — Git supercharged

13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Description: Supercharge Git within VS Code — Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and CodeLens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via rich visualizations and powerful comparison commands, and so much more
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Version: 14.0.1
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Publisher: eamodio
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> VS Marketplace Link: https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=eamodio.gitlens
13:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> To use a Git Bash that's running in MinGW 😄
13:54 < ChillerDragon> oh ye fakin vs git integration
13:54 < ChillerDragon> i see so many ppl irl using it
13:54 < ChillerDragon> gives me the chills
13:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> I just use Sublime Text
13:55 < ChillerDragon> imagine using electron to switch a branch
13:55 < ChillerDragon> did you pay for sublime?
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just want to code
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i do as few git as possible xd
13:55 < ChillerDragon> i just want to git
13:55 < ChillerDragon> so i code as few as possible xd
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://wavacity.com/
13:55 < ChillerDragon> woah
13:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> Does paying for Sublime get you benefits except getting rid of the popup?
13:56 < ChillerDragon> browser audacity
13:56 < ChillerDragon> no
13:56 < ChillerDragon> just popup gone
13:56 < bridge_> <k2d222> wasmified?
13:56 < bridge_> <k2d222> crazy
13:56 < ChillerDragon> but if you didnt pay the popup is annoying af
13:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Well, I just press right arrow and enter to close it
13:56 < ChillerDragon> why would you popup ur self if there is free non popup editors
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just use vscode
13:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Not sure if that's on purpose, but if you leave the popup open in the background it breaks text selection in Sublime
13:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> use vscodium
13:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no ms trash
13:57 < ChillerDragon> libre
13:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and in 2 years use lapce
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
13:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> when it's finally not finished
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 2 or maybe 5
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is there any reason u use it.
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> like any feature
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or just bcs u can
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not like i didnt used notepad++ for fng2
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
13:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> Notepad++ got too old for me, I like the multi-selection from Sublime Text a lot
13:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> And Visual Studio GUI is too confusing for me, I don't want to relearn it right now
14:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> I also prefer building over the command line instead of in Visual Studio
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what vscode?
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and*
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what is better about sublime xd
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is it fast & furious
14:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> I meant normal Visual Studio. I'll try vscode at some point
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i mean like
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how the fuck didnt u even found out about sublime at all xD
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i heard it the first time today
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and not even open source xd
14:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> Weird, I thought it was really common after Notepad++ slowly faded out
14:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but notepad++ is open source
14:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i doubt they recommended it xD
14:04 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'm on Windows anyway, I'm used to closed-source
14:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
14:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> I need Microsoft Word etc. for work, the open-source stuff just doesn't compared in terms of features TBH
14:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> I need Microsoft Word etc. for work, the open-source stuff just doesn't compare in terms of features TBH
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> change your workplace xddddd
14:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> The most important feature being: being perfectly compatible with word format xD
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well idc, do what u want
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just never heard of it, and was confused
14:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> since vscode is microsoft shit, i'd have thought it's normal to use under windows, if visual studio itself is no option
14:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'll try vscode and see if it's a bit smarter than Sublime Text, cause that's my main issue with Sublime right now
14:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> But I don't want a confusing interface and bloat like Visual Studio either
14:08 < bridge_> <unlucksmcgee> vscode has some good multi-select too <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor>
14:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Nice, that's the most important feature that Notepad++ was missing for me
14:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's always interesting to see what other ppl like
14:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> always when i accedentially trigger it, i hate it xD
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so much slower than pressing CTRL + SHIFT + F and just put your replace text
14:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> I also need to use Eclipse for Java development :pepeW:
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i used eclipse for c++ a while
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> damn, the dark ages
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> vscode wasnt a thing then xd
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what i always liked about VS is peaking definition code
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in eclipse it always sucked to having to open the file
14:26 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> use IDEA
14:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> It doesn't scale very well when you have hundreds of projects open at once
14:27 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> eclipse does?
14:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yes, no issues
14:28 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> I see
14:28 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> but its so chunky
14:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> That's true, I also prefer the IDEA GUI
14:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lol robyte secret pro dev
14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> hundreds of projects
14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you work for google or what
14:29 < bridge_> <h.kaan> 💀
14:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> NSA
14:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> https://aara.mil
14:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> https://aaro.mil
14:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> wrong
14:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> Nah, but the Eclipse plugin architecture just makes it happen automatically when you have a bunch of different modules/projects for things
14:30 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> https://www.aaro.mil/
14:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle
14:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's also all OSGi/Eclipse plugins so it would be a pain to get it to work in IDEA
14:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> They are not all open right now, but this is with all projects in the workspace selected :monkaS:

14:57 < bridge_> <coke1465> when i started
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i was 13-4 when i started
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i got my dota 2 beta
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in 2012
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> time flies
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now im a rust dev
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fighting a crusade
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> joking
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just have one suggestion to everyone here from germany
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u under 25 and get kindergeld (money for children)
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> use that instead of work xddd
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> work on something own in that time
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you'll never get a chance after that anymore
14:59 < ChillerDragon> jopsti xd
14:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:59 < ChillerDragon> ima run this shit on my 2nd screen now
14:59 < ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/sensors.mp4
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 leak, now my brain is in "insanely cursious"-mode
15:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> 28
15:03 < bridge_> <h.kaan> 4090?
15:03 < bridge_> <h.kaan> god
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> NO WAY XD
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u srsly older than me?
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wouldn't have thought tbh
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller is rich af
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he sold ddnet merch
15:04 < ChillerDragon> omagawd jopsti this bs sensor spam make my fans go brrr
15:04 < ChillerDragon> i cant
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well maybe it fills the console too much
15:05 < ChillerDragon> i can sop print and only log
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> write a script that automatically parses min max values
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for all stuff
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> BASH PRO
15:05 < ChillerDragon> thought about it
15:05 < ChillerDragon> but its gonna use even more cpu 
15:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> Use ChatGPT: lazy bash pro
15:05 < ChillerDragon> im faster w out chat gpt
15:05 < ChillerDragon> i know all bash 
15:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> ye, you are pro
15:06 < bridge_> <pilonpl> How can i check if a player is online? Is there some api?
15:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> it's faster for me though
15:06 < ChillerDragon> the delay chatgpt has is because it has to ask me
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> server list
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the only use i would give to chatgpt is to write me a commit message when im lazy
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
15:06 < ChillerDragon> https://ddstats.org/players
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://ddstats.org/players
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice chiller
15:07 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Thx
15:09 < ChillerDragon> ok ima print if its 70C or higher
15:10 < ChillerDragon> using blazingly fast bash that does it in a non sleeping loop at 1% cpu usage
15:11 < ChillerDragon> this is so gonna not work
15:11 < ChillerDragon> ima complain to gnome pro support!
15:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah
15:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did u try with openbox
15:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:12 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:12 < ChillerDragon> im so gonna not game seriously tryharding for 1h+ on openbox
15:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what other than a browser, ddnet and maybe vscode do you have open
15:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if nothing, u can also use openbox xd
15:13 < ChillerDragon> vlc with asmr
15:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> discord
15:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
15:14 < ChillerDragon> i have gnome terminal and github.com in firefox open at all times
15:14 < ChillerDragon> thats it
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so learath 13
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:14 < ChillerDragon> maybe 4 clients sometimes
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how old r u chiller?
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 25?
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u cant be 26 right
15:14 < ChillerDragon> confidental
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that would be strange
15:14 < ChillerDragon> why wouldnt 25 be strange?
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs that fits
15:15 < ChillerDragon> ok sherlock
15:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ez as that
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i know everything about u anyway, so that was unfair from the start
15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's also obvious that it's heinrich's birthday in 3 days
15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> else he wouldn't have named himself 5991
15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 5.9.91
15:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> >.<
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how old r u
15:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 21
15:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> but no kindergeld for me
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can also study with 26
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> start university
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then u get kindergeld
15:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i think i am good with my job right now tho 😄
15:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> also kindergeld is pretty low afaik
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's enough to survive
15:21 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> as long as you dont live alone, i can see that
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> imagine how cool ddnet 3 by melon would be
15:21 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> what happened to ddnet 2
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's finished in 20 years
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but u have more time, so ddnet 3 is finished in 4 years
15:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i will open a gofundme
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> windows directly jumped to win95, because that was their best version
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now it's win11 and sucks hard
15:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> agreed
15:29 < bridge_> <j.0u> hello
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yo, did your build work?
15:30 < bridge_> <j.0u> yee thx
15:30 < bridge_> <j.0u> What file is this in?
15:30 < bridge_> <j.0u> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147523985853136988/image.png
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> menu_controls maybe?
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just search for any text in the screenshot
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Localize("Movement") for example
15:34 < bridge_> <j.0u> no results
15:34 < bridge_> <j.0u> i wanna just know how to create hotkey xD
15:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147525120366235770/image.png
15:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> menus_settings.cpp
15:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> use global search ^^
15:35 < bridge_> <j.0u> Thanks
15:38 < bridge_> <j.0u> do you have any idea how to create a hotkey input?
15:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bind s "say hello"
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in F1
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or menu hotkey?
15:40 < bridge_> <j.0u> no menu hotkey
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Input()->KeyIsPressed(KEY_S)
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if(Input()->KeyIsPressed(KEY_ESCAPE))
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>         {
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>             UI()->DisableMouseLock();
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>             UI()->SetActiveItem(nullptr);
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>             s_TextMode = false;
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>         }
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> UI code is immediate, that means you don't create a hotkey
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u just check if the keys are pressed right now
15:42 < bridge_> <j.0u> ik but i wanna something like that
15:43 < bridge_> <j.0u> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147527091273871492/image.png
15:43 < bridge_> <j.0u> I want to put it on a page
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just copy paste the code u see
15:47 < ChillerDragon> bro making a client
15:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, tournament multiview is saved
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147537011641684009/test.mp4
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> next teeworlds lan party with only one monitor
16:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147537366509158531/image.png
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the tee's always stack up like magnets xD
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: i remember u even did a video about that once
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds secrets xDDD
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 121 tee's perspectives at once
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147538005242941550/image.png
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 10 fps xddd
16:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> better video, without so much magnetation of tees
16:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147541186723205191/test.mp4
16:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, tournament multiview is saved
16:44 < bridge_> <reitw> lmao
16:45 < bridge_> <reitw> now try to finish a hard ddnet map
16:45 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> why 131 though should be in a power of some number since it's in a grid?
16:45 < bridge_> <reitw> with all tees in the same team
16:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's 131 dummies + the real player
16:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so 132
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just so you understand why that makes sense:
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (12×12)−12 = 132
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so top row would be dark and "wasted"
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so this is indeed no bug
16:56 < ChillerDragon> jopsti tru chiler fan
16:56 < ChillerDragon> yes i did a video about the magnet
16:56 < ChillerDragon> its basic physics
16:56 < ChillerDragon> enough mass causes gravity
16:56 < ChillerDragon> tw engine one of the realest
17:29 < bridge_> <louis> lol wtf
17:29 < bridge_> <louis> how do i get that
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wait 20 years until the client is stable xd
17:35 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> 4 times more than the original release :O
18:43 < bridge_> <teero777> ahah soon well get ddnet for xbox XDD
18:44 < bridge_> <teero777> splitscreen is the best screen
18:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> rust question! async traits possible only with async-trait crate? :D
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and nightly
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> feature
19:29 < ChillerDragon> wot is auto/ folder int he editor?
19:29 < ChillerDragon> time to gitignore that i guess
20:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's for autosaves of maps
20:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Seems to be on by default then
20:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> My new cpu or new ddnet is blazingly fast. It did like 4 saves of the map. Which I did not notice. Saving that map used to freeze my client for 2 seconds
20:15 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i think i know what map you are talking about
20:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> who wanna play ddrace
20:15 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :troll:
20:54 < bridge_> <gerdoe> chillerdrabores gonna fire again
21:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's how you look if you angry, but also sad
21:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147612990833688667/image.png
21:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sad tee
21:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> whats this :0
21:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> new client?
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's my accidentially swapping left and right eye scale xd
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's angry eyes
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's me accidentially swapping left and right eye scale xd
21:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> i like it
21:34 < bridge_> <Voxel> better than the useless + eyes
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they no useless
21:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'll use them xd
21:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they are called "dead" eyes btw
21:39 < bridge_> <Voxel> X_X
21:40 < bridge_> <Voxel> +_+
21:41 < bridge_> <Voxel> i cant wait until split assets are ready so i can make my super graphics loaded client
21:41 < bridge_> <Voxel> i have so many useless ideas
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can also do that without zip trash xdd
21:44 < bridge_> <Voxel> wdym trash
21:45 < bridge_> <Voxel> zip feature might be the best idea
21:45 < bridge_> <Voxel> eaay way to package and exchange texture packs
21:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> distribution is the only pro i can think of
21:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rest is pure contra
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> zips itself are bad and not the correct format (so need an extra tool)
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> loading everything at once is probably not the best
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> anti virus
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> creation of the assets by the creators will be harder
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> zips are annoying to handle for the user
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @_voxeldoesart how do you usually test assets?
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are you not worried that u have 20 inkscape instances and have to zip everything every time?
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or do you want to have another method of loading additionally?
21:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> isnt minecraft the same exact way
21:50 < bridge_> <Voxel> minus the zipping
21:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and how often have u created minecraft assets?
21:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> this feels like chess
21:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> @jupeyy_keks tbh i just want to not rely on texture atlases
21:52 < bridge_> <Voxel> especially if we're adding in more things
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes i can understand it
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i generally dislike them too
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i have no solution for asset creation that doesnt suck
23:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> just combing through #developer or what :justatest:

23:38 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Damn, they are still merging it
23:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> i guess they need help
23:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wonder if it would be worth starting from scratch
23:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> how big is the mod
23:42 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> I've been asked same thing in February, guess it's hard to find someone cool and free from work :greenthing:
23:42 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Quite big, just join server in ddnet
23:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> doesn't show up in my browser
