01:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> @nuborn Yes, same vision
07:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a way to get the inputs a player is giving? Like can I do actions if the player clicks mouse3, or only if something like fire is bound to it?
07:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the server or on the client?
07:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Server
07:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I assume thats not working :D
07:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We dont send the raw input data
07:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, thanks
08:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Since I did an update in visual studio 2017 I cannot pick the build mode anymore, it is fixed to x64-release
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh nice now i remember that sdl warning on mac @Learath2 cool that you fixed that. Make sure to also fix it in upstream :p
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is no upstream to ddnet
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is no upstream on ddnet
12:05 <@deen> It's pretty obvious that ChillerDragon means teeworlds
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> yes
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I intentionally used the word upstream :p 
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bois we move to 0.7 soon tm
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> damn i've just learned something xd
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you can do
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```js
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> SomeObject.SomeClass = new (class UrClass() { ... } )
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> (in js)
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you can do
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```js
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> SomeObject.SomeClass = new (class UrClass() { ... } )();
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> i guess its like functions so it makes sense xd
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well js doesn't really have classes
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also, another mac keyboard bites the dust, these really don't last long, will get my 4th keyboard replacement when I get back to italy 😛
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol external one or in laptop?
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never broke a mac keyboard and i abused my hardware intensivley
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I use the big new bluetooth keyboard for wathcing movies. Its fully covered in beer and dorito dip and works fine.
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> On my mac book i spilled water in mass and all worked fine for years.
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> lmao
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh and i really like to smash the keys hard
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> "in mass" xd
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a big glass once a month
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😂
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for years
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but why
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> accidents
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dirnk a lot
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> once a month?
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😂
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am jiggeling with this glass in front of the screen while playing ddrace every 2 minutes
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> lol
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I switched to bottels now

12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Juggeling*
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> yikes
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon in laptop
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm probably one of the brand new ones
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with 1 mm keys
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt hear any good baut them
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a well known problem with the last generation of garbage butterfly keys
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why i bought an older mpodel
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also bcs i want a haptic esc key
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> older models suffer from planned obsolescence 😛
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not really
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did something clever for my esc key
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my 2015 macbook runs like a beast
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tilde-backtick does escape without any modifiers, with shift it's backtick and with alt it's tilde
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's nearly the same on my 60% mechanical keyboard so I'm very used to it already
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so u need 2 keys?
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> to make a backtick or a tilde yeah i need a modifier
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah but not for esc
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok hm
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> for esc it's just the key itself
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> helps while vim'ing
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> interesting
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> main concern is vim
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> very hard to vim without an esc key
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think esc is slowing down my vim anywys  because its so hard to reach
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon moving ctrl to capslock helps a lot with vim efficacy
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt we had this conversation already
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with external piano foot thingys
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol a foot pedal as a key
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds like an interesting idea
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good for vim
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imagine if u train that how fast u can get
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm trying to find a decent light theme for my vscode
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> psycho
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> really hard to read a dark theme outside in the sun
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol outside
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no light in my room :troll:
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why would u go outside
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> to see the sky
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no power at home
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> just 3rd world things
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have sky at home
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and netflix
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xdddd
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh that sounds like a struggle @Learath2
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so there is free electricity in ur local park? xd
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> a cafe has electricity
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> one problem is that if I want to go to the wc I need to leave my laptop unattended
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or unplug it and pack up, either option is undesirable
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy i remember that
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i let my cam recoring tho
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could ask the waiter to keep an eye on it, but still don't like being away from it
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> unlocked
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> especially since this country is full of poor people 😛
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but recording :troll:
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess stealing was less a problem for me bcs i was in a hotel in amsterdam less theft there
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you have this find my mac thing tho right?
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd still rather not chase down after it
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if the theft doesnt cover it in tinfoil ur save
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> turn on filevault
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> already encrypted
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> encrypted but not filevalut?
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 🤓
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's filevault
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah k
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> shittiest piece of software ever conceived
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ay
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its easy to use
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> even when the cpu is idle it doesn't use it's full potential
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> why shitty
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> took 48 damn hours to encrypt 250gbs
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ye lol
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ok that part is shitty
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ye its kinda slow
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> but once its done?
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works fine as expected, modern cpus are beasts at AES
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why i dont encrypt my whole machine
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only a few folders
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk about 99% iof my data being in the wrong hands
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> with cryptsetup on linux they were actually smart about it and don't bother encrypting the empty drive...
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> with a mac, even if you encrypt while installing it, it takes a decade because it actually installs first then encrypts...
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, lets see if it gets stolen in the 10 seconds i'm away
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are u in cafe rn?
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no worries we keep an eye on it
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks for keeping an eye on it chiller, they didn't nick it
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what programming laguage did u use for the new masters @Learath2 ?
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wrote the prototype in python
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok its u
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it'll prolly end up in rust
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we are save 😃
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> save from what
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> somneone stealing ur laptop and acting as u
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol 😄
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> most turkish people don't speak much english at all
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh ur not at home
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> makes sense u said that somehow
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how can I be at a cafe and at home?
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not a cat
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah true i also sometimes visist turkey to drink mi coffe
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13#5272  did some profiling for his mods latley he might have some xp now
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip he is not here
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobo
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also @deen, how do you get ddnet to run smoothly on your laptop, it's so choppy and cpu intensive on mine
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's choppy even though I get 100-110 fps
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it runs smooth even on my smallest laptop
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, I'll now work on adding a feature that I wanted for so long
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only on debian tho windows is eating too much ressources xd
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it never ran well on any of my laptops tbh
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh well no
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you have a 4k laptop?
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that is always eating ressources
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm are retina displays 4k?
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk why they put 4k screens in every tiny laptop nowerdays
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think near 4k
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like 4k displays at all, a lot of scaling and performance issues
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in a 2 inch laptop useless af anyways
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1440p has been a decent upgrade though
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> smartphones easily have 1080p
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think there are even 4k ones out there
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you scale it up, it kinda makes sense to get 4k laptop displays I guess 😄
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but no
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but smartphones run OSs that are optimized for displaying these things
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 4k only makes sense if u have hardware that can power is smooth
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> highdpi and high res displays are just a PITA to configure on windows and linux
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the future tho. fullhd looks so pixelated to me :c
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> one smart thing they did with macOS is that they use a hybrid approach to rendering windows, it's very much vectoral
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt the new mac stuff 8k ?
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mac "dm" is resolution and dpi agnostic
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there an empty side in the HUD?
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> health killfeed
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> chat       score
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the edges are empty though right?
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking of adding a feature that i've been thinking of for quite some time
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> a team overlay
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> right edge could have some space
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> chat takes up the whole left edge
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do we have small icons for the weapons btw?
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wdym?
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> different images?
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think there are only thoise from game.png
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but u can make em small^^
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I can render them small and single color I guess
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nuborn you should know, do we send the client the weapons the character has?
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, the available weapons are sent
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> in the extended object or part of vanilla?
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> in the extended object, I think its WEAPON_HAMMER, etc
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> in the flags
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> the current weapon isn't always sent though (when in freeze for example)
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are you thinking of something like this @Learath2 ? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1674
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not exactly, it'll show all tees on your team and their "status"
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo the scoreboard is waay to polluted already
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> whether they have weapons, whether they are frozen
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wanted to make a stealth scoreboard sicne ages
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah it won't be on the scoreboard
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also the whole hud
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> doesnt make it better xd
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i really like the scoreboard of minecraft 😃
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can disable most of the hud nowadays
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes but people dont do it
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 nothing special, but I've just always kept testing it on my shitty platforms and reporting the bugs
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and then i have to watch it in their alan faded yt videos
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they even turn on key presses to extra annoy me
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I'm interested in how you set up the throttling and the refresh rate stuff
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we just have way too many settings there
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel the main loop isn't sleeping at all, it literally burns up my poor laptop
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better to have many settings with good defaults where ppl can change them
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than magic numbers
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601385352116174868/Screenshot_2019-07-18_at_15.10.28.png
14:11 <@deen> cl_refresh_rate 480; cl_refresh_rate_inactive 120; gfx_refresh_rate 170; gfx_vsync 1 (50 Hz screen)
14:11 <@deen> maybe your laptop throttles with cl_refresh_rate 0?
14:12 <@deen> my laptop, while old, can stay at a consistent frequency all day
14:14 <@deen> also annoys me about my work laptop, the thinner they get the louder and more spontaneous the fan noise
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really would love a thicker laptop with longer battery life and better thermals
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I should renew my thinkpad
14:15 <@deen> on the other hand it's really nice not to carry around such a heavy laptop
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I think it depends on the situation. Take the small laptop for lill action in public transport. And take a bugge rone for long time actions in cafe.
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think my next laptop will def be a 13" not a 15
14:39 <@deen> X1 carbon has a 14" screen but fits into traditional 13" cases ;)
14:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen is nimda fixed?
14:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
14:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601393180365029386/unknown.png
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen have one?
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of it, but not sure whether to get that or a thinkpad anniversary edition
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also does it have a matte screen option, glossy screens drive me wild
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> Hey guys i have some issues with my raspberry 3 b someone wants to help?
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> It doesn´t boot any image i tried two different SD cards
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any err msg?
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> wym by it doesn't boot?
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> is it a panic?
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> It just does nothing, the red LED is on
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> nothing on screen?
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> and the green one does nothing
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> nothing on screen aswell
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> does green ever blink at all?
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> I tried flashing with Etcher and PiBaker on OSX and rufus on windows
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> The green one never blinked
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps you have too little power
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did it boot at all?
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> nothing happens
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had to purchase a new plug for the raspberry
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh yea i bought some battery thing for my raspberry and it also didnt boot because it needs too much power :c
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> 5V .3 ampere
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> i will try it on my secondary powerbrick
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> .3 sounds enough
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> well i bought it for the pi
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> i think there might be an issue with my image or the pi is broken
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> i´ve had multiple raspberry´s and some had the same issue i never fixed it
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> and i spend hours
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> it hurts
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it can't really be an issue with the image
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the green led blinks when the pi is reading from the sd card
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> maybe wrong file format?
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> somehow
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> cuz of macintosh
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it's never reading the card it can't ever know the file format is wrong
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> hm
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> so it´s probably a hardware issue
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> get the new one 😃
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or come to munich and i sell u mine for good price
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or the card is defect, but you said you tried two
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you try changing the plug?
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or a different image
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> yes i tried it on my mobile phones power brick
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> 5v 1.8A max
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> maybe switching the cable
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> one second
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> switching cables didn´t fix it
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> official recommendation is 2.5A+
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> rly?
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> oh wtf
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> but wait, my quickcharge brick has 3 ampere
15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but raspi might not support the quickcharge protocol, I think there needs to be a negotiation for the higher current draw
15:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> okay so it might be the powerbrick
15:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> thanks alot
15:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cruzomat> i will give you an update when i´ve tested another powersupply
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Apparently I sleep from 5-6 :D

15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how to apply this on multiple repos o.O
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you'd have to aggregate them together
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i find it weird that people always use perl to extend the shell stuff
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601411739539603487/Screenshot_2019-07-18_at_16.55.09.png
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably cuz i never tried perl
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (cd repo1 && git log ... && cd ../repo2 && git log ...) | perl ...
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> perl was started to replace shell scripts so this is the intended use
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh interesting
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I rebase too much for this to be accurate 😛
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> At work it's very useful to see what business hours everyone in the team has 😄
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> never really used perl, I should give it a try
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601412418979233824/unknown.png
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on ddnet
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> 
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601412767374901259/unknown.png
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes i code til 1 am
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i guess i dont commit
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better tho
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ui code is so convoluted in tw
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> needs a lot of cleanup
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good luck
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki how is your ui revamp going
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Ryozuki/ddnet/commits/feature_refactor_ui
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> abandoned since long
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what does MapScreen do btw?
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In `IGraphics`
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, it remaps the coordinate system I guess
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye screen to world
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> great, rendertee is rendering the entire skin 😛
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, this is more code then I'm willing to tinker with outside,
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh apparently I'm rendering the tee, it's just way too small 😄
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and now my tees are stretched 😦
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601421935879913497/screenshot_2019-07-18_17-34-42.png
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice map
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> zooz
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why can't life be easy?
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I literally have no idea why my tees are stretched like that
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> just copy paste from scoreboard code
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh ur name is not registered
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ima claim ur name hehe
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao apparently not too easy
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is exactly how everything else renders tees, but mine are stretched
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how are you going to fit 512 tees in there @Learath2 ?
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> o rip
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is a part of the code I'm very unfamiliar with 😦
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I forgot to scale with the aspect ratio
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> More like it
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601422673393877025/screenshot_2019-07-18_17-38-29.png
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why so much up
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure there is way less space for kill messagess and the space down there is hardly used
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> because I'm not a UX designer
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mimimi
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might put it below actually
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont wanan destroy ur dreams but wtf is this xd
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> teams can be up to the size of 64 and we are planning on more than 64 slots
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you really want to pollute the view 24/7 with something scoreboard similar
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 what information is going to be displayed for each team member?
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601424099838918665/screenshot_2019-07-18_17-44-23.png
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro I'm thinking their weapons and most importantly whether they are frozen
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon when is the last time you played with 64 players?
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the last time i played actually @Learath2
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe only show the closest 5 tees
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon this is why people don't code for ddnet, whenever someone wants to do sth different greybeards come up and cry useless
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont say its useless
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am concered that it might be harming
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll make it whether you like it or not, I'll PR it, if people like it we merge it, if people don't I'll keep it for myself
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the clean ui
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I atleast need it
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is usefull for sure
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do you think about only showing the closest 5 tees?
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can literally clear out the ui with cl_hud 0
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also the reason I never finished up accounts, a dozen of people who keep crying about anything new
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also we aren't really planning for more then 64 players, we just entertained the thought, it's already enough of a mess with 64 players
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes new stuff is tricky
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not supposed to be tricky, look at the guy who added the ingame timer, it was literally a 100x300 box that doesn't even show up 24/7
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you think he'll make a pr ever again?
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk baut him but i dont do much other things than getting rejected all day and that didnt stop me yet
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gz180
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woops
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wrong chat
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice pw
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> actually wrong blender usage
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> should be rz and no enter xd
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo @Learath2 no hate i love u and i appreacte that you do something. But saying everything is nice because it is usefull and was work is not the way to go imo
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now I don't feel like coding at all, thanks, I'll just order a drink and watch something
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 😦
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe I'll close some issues, I'm sure someone will have a problem with that one aswell
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ignore the negative vibes and only try to improve or rethink or even justify your stuff when you get critizied
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how dare you fix the votes that have been broken since ddrace
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ._.
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stap make me feel bad
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> jk ur ofc allowed to make me feel bad 😛
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sorri tho
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree with Learath2 here, we're too strict on merging PRs, on new ideas, etc.
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah no pls dont
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the client is polluted wy too much already
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we have bugs
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and we keep adding features instead
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure we all do this in our free time and it is supposed to be fun. But we destroy the fun of all players by this behavior.
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> worry not, I'm not making anything new until this improves
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since I'm probably the main problem for that, and I don't really have time for reviewing PRs and ideas quick and early, perhaps I should just stay away from reviewing PRs
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no ur good reviwer
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bois :c
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I'm not. see yesterday's chat
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxd
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u were perfect
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 no, you make sure we get well coded features
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the problem is: "and I don't really have time for reviewing PRs and ideas quick and early, perhaps I should just stay away from reviewing PRs"
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the problem is not with the review speed, it's with people being way too averse to anything new
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem is that I haven't really given you feedback at all on http masters
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g.
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's a decently sized pr, that has horrible quality
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and it's a major change, ofc it'll take time
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> not everything new is good tho
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao doesn't mean we shouldn't entertain new ideas
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea,. but due to missing feedback early on, you (rightfully) got demotivated due the expectation of my review
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> also doesn’t mean rejecting new stuff is bad generally
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so there's definitely a problem
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao it's not about that. we're talking about a very very useful feature like http masters here
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it'd have been much better if we'd work on the architecture of such a major change together, before I started implementing anything
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> I think he’s talking about new stuff in general
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> discussion didnt start due to the masters more the team feature
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao take a look at pull requests from new contributors, they usually always new things
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> except mine are always just typos xd
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and there is always a ridiculous amount of pushback, and then they just never pull request again
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> like, where is necropotame now?
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> lol there’s also people who did good prs that are gone now
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> I don’t think that’s an argument
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well give me an example
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> the guy who made automapper rework
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> don’t even remember the name
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but it was a good feature
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you mean bojidar-ng? he is still around
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> when did he make his last pr
17:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> he is like jupeyy, they have their things and they come through when needed
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides what he made was not a new feature, but a lot of improvements
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> live automapper is a new feature imo
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, don't need to worry about it anymore, I'm not adding anything new any time soon
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 when doing something new u need to push it till the end
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich rejected telegun without knowing how it works
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki very hard to do when people leech away at what little motivation you have
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u gotta be strong then
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😎
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast for me it's very hard to commit to something knowing people will chew you out for even thinking about it
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was literally making it for myself and was going to pr it if it turned out decent
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u shouldnt show early stage dev then
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u fear that
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> often ppl cant see the bigger picture
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was just about to ask a question about the graphics api, then I figured it out
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im talking like i know something
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😎
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u could take ideas from hmh
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pr
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> did anyone even say your thing is bad
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: Can vanilla clients attempt to connect to full servers?
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if the serverinfo says it's full that is
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean if it will try even if its full
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or if it doesnt try?
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, for reserved slots
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to know whether I need to fake Full-1
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk i dont see vanilla code since 2016
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u care for vanilla tho
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody uses vanilla on ddent anyway
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should just show a big warning to them to get ddnet
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> lol
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye we are saving them
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are masochists if they play with vanilla client
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> that’s not a helpful answer
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i guess
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do send a couple server messages if you have vanilla iirc
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> yea a broadcast
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I'll take a look at the old ddrace code, it was pretty anal about vanilla compatibility
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u here?
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 can you fix nimda
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant talk on irc
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 willl the client show 64/63?
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess ye
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I made it show 64/64 if full
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if its reserved
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could make it 64/63 but idk how it'll react at all
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should be 64/63
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, if someone takes the reserved slot, then someone leaves, what happens?
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if its full its full
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 63/63
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess our implementation of reserved slots is wrong
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> as in we don't actually reserve the slots
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but we allow people to join full servers with a password
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its rarely used anyway
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if someone takes a reserved slot, the server isn't technically full anymore
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well atleast it shouldn't be as the name implies
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u think it would be easy to add spectator slots? they wouldnt have a char entity
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shouldnt be a problem i think
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> server just should need to handle sending them info
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it could be good for speccing in tourns or when its full
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well we do have spec slots
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> they are also implemented the same way
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant join a full sv
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh you mean like that, yeah maybe we could
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make spec slots "external"
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's some work though, as a lot of arrays depend on MAX_CLIENTS
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also pause and spec should be handled in a special way
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its to much work
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and it's new, very dangerous territory
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> PUT allows multipart right
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well yes
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it might not always be the best practice
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. if the PUT generates more then one resource
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also it might be an edge case in some shitty http libraries, but I don't like supporting shitty libs
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the shortest run map?
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> one i can play with a trackpad preferably 😄
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> run_antibuguse
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> run_g6
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> run_blue
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> (dont play it)
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> (run_antibuguse hardest map)
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 I know...
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> made my own
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 i like your team feature
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 what about replacing statboard on ddrace gametypes with ur thing
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 here?
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> it’s not like u need to see it all the time
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao I'll think about it if I ever feel like taking a look at it again
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 `NETMSGTYPE_SV_RECORD` is definitely handled wrong, the whole race timer is a bit weird tbh
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, the format ddnet sends it's `NETMSGTYPE_SV_RECORD` is it's best times, not DDRaceTime and DDRaceTick
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Firewave> Where is the config.lua please guys
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DUq79/7e0e52bc79.jpg
