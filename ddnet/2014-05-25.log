02:18 <@deen> =)
02:36 <@deen> That's lucky of me
02:36 <@deen> I read a bit of source code and found something that might cause the problem and apparently that was it

18:35 < lordtheuns> How will this tournement be run? will you have someone on each server watching or what?
18:41 <@deen> Records work on all servers
18:41 <@deen> the one who finishes first, no matter on which server, wins
18:41 <@deen> But I will still personally be on all servers
20:07 < lordtheuns> Well I enjoyed watching that ^^ and your comments
