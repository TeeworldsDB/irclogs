09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ChillerDragon: emote wheel takes UI mousesense
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so now probs dekstop, yes
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a modifier for the sense tho?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no way my desktop or my ui sense is sooo low
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> this is unusable \:C
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah right there is no ui sense anymore is there ? \:D so it has to be desktop
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i swear my desktop sense is faster than what i have in the emote wheel
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> inp_oldmouse
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Or smth like that
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The emote wheel probably shouldn't even be using ui mouse imo. It'd work much better with relative input
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah inp\_mouseold helps
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> still a bit slower or am i trippin here?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> being fast in emotes is gameplay cruicial \:D
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i dont wanna mess with my aim by changing to inp\_oldmouse 1
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Learath2\: relative input being the input that is used to aim in game?
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chillerdragon: Yep
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that sounds nice
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg this is unplayable for now i go play minecraft \:D
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how every change is unplayable for you
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> My enemys kill me while i am stuck picking the right emote to communicate
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "This recent change in the editor killed my mother"
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ayyy
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i said editor is fine to me!
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i also give neutral feedback!
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Can we move GAME\_NAME back to a merge safer place?
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c9d5122a3c30e4f5b5ba10f05da29a5ea557d2ba/src/game/version.h#L10
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it used to be in gamemodes.h and forks could edit it without having a merge conflict on every new ddnet release
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just move it 3 lines lower or something, then it's probably ok too
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or higher
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hmm but then when the version line is changed git missed the game\_name line doesnt it?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh or wait you mean in ddnet?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea that could work
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i expect GAME\_VERSION to change very soon when we upgrade to 0.7 \:p
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and drop 0.6 axaxax
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i wonder if one can write a git merge driver for that
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> image.png
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901397448033984582/image.png
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that .gitattributes magic saved me a lot of conflicts
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it uses relative mouse, since emote wheel is a circle^^
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But i'm for a revert anyway, not for this reason, I still think random settings like ui\_mousesens suck(it defaulted to 200, so it just doubled the mouse speed)
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But bcs it doesn't just work on all OS/WM, and that's insanly annoying.
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I really dont understand whats so hard implemented a clipping rect for the mouse.. Especially since all OS we support, support to teleport the mouse
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok nice
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> mc sucks
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What os/wm doesnt it work on? I only noticed mac being a little weird
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i3, xmonad
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also on macos is just plainly doesnt work.
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also on macos it just plainly doesnt work.
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On macos it works, its just bad
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah it works bcs some SDL dev implemented it using mouse teleport
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not bcs the OS is designed for it
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont think there is another way to do it on macos actually
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah really sad
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> desktop os will slowly loose against the mobile shit
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in macos a simple example is\: safari groups tabs
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in win11\: taskbar groups apps, doesnt allow rightclick menu like win10 in taskbar anymore
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in vlc master branch\: i have to make an extra step to get to the context menu(instead of having a menu bar)
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can maybe use a core tap and steal all mouse input
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But you need to request permissions for that, rather annoying
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, thats why just revert. Luckely i am in the comfortable position to compile myself
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> For the rest its just the status quoe, so they are ok with it
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sucks to not be a dev
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> any plans when to revert?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lmao, mad af
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> let me look what commits i have to revert
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im not mad
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> just too lazy too downgrade ;D
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i really think using desktop ms was a cool idea
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> could potentially have solved bugs instead of introducing em
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> for example this boi would be fixed i assume https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2962
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not while playing but at least in editor
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bro
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if it aint work on WSL, its WSL fault
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think so too \:D
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if it wouldnt work on linux i wouldnt use that
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i hope WSLg will not cause linux users switching back to windows \:c
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it work as good under win10?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean there is a simple reason ms wants dx12
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think WSLg is win11 only
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and that is opengl on dreictx12
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lets wait and see how many ppl actually like win11
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> beside it looks good, it also removes alot of useful functionality
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and most ppl hate it, its like the win8 changes
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> more tablet, less desktop
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds like macOS \:D
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah xD
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i actually also dont like macos compared to KDE, which allows me to use basically any theme i want
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> use KDE on macOS then ðŸ§ 
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it work? \:D
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if u try really hard
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> maybe nobody ever tried because it sounds so wrong
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont even blame macos, the majority of apple users just accept everything apple does without critism
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> true fans
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> tbh i do the same for linux stuff
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in linux the main problem is that some mantainers live in weird paralell universes
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also wouldn't say KDE's default settings are sane, but since you can change basically everything i am fine
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Since i felt in love with kdenlive i felt the urge to try KDE
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but im such a gnomie i just cant
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gnom is too much mobile for me already
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everything feels like i have to touch it with my fingers
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> haha
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wtf
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> mobian
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so fast
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:sonic\:
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> *fast* i litterally struggled 20minutes to think of what was still important
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks \:)
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mousewheel still sucks, it litterally takes relative input converts it to ui mouse but doesnt scale against the window width
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> completly random xD
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the editor does the same for the value draggers and quad rotation etc.
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (so it fells different to ui mouse anyway)
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> was there ever a force push on ddnet master?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> image.png
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901455605582135296/image.png
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or am i beeing stupid here?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> going from 15.1.3 to 15.2
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> chillerdragon: yes, sometimes I did one, not sure if that's the fault here though
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how to merge that
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> are you sure that's the cause?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i am recloning
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't remember force-pushing recently, so it shouldn't cause problems now
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do u recall ever force pushing across release tags?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure what you mean
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> depends on if u call 15.1.3 recent
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did you force push changes that far in back in history that they span multiple releases
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i merge from tag to tag
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dunno
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> image.png
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901457294926180383/image.png
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im a bit confused now on how to proceed cleanly
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> git pull?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?xd
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or just merge
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> merg eunrelated histories i guess
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i am not sure what happens to the changes i merged in and u force pushed away
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if u run `git reset --hard 15.2` in ddnet u get diverged
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> what a pain
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> could you please not force push anymore \:c or at least only between tags
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think I did that recently
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 15.2 is nov 17 22020
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 15.2 is nov 17 2020
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i assume its related to clang format maybe
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> anyways it happend and now i gotta figure out how to not break things
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok merge works without complaint hmm
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i still feel like what ever u force changed is now unchanged in my branch
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why didnt u just take your changes and put them into ddnet master, instead of the opposite
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> That was my plan at some point then i was too lazy
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> The mod is like 5 years old and has changes all over the place idk where and what features it had and so on a rewrite just seemed like too much effort so i never really got the motivation to do it
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> So i took my crap of a repo and yoinked ddnets git history in and started to merge up from tag to tag since days
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> i cam a far way from 9.0.2 to 15.2
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> cmae*
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> omg tyoe
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> very simple
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Take the ddnet version of your last commit, then copy paste your repo into that ddnet version and you have your diff
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (<@749222324980416602_=5bquakenet=5d=20=43hiller=44ragon>)
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> yes but the diff is uslessly big
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> there is clang format
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now you waste 2 months of your life porting your few thousand code lines
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> and also plenty of usless changes in the mod
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> other way around its one evening
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> im really happy so far
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cant judge on how big the changes actually are, but sometimes rewritting stuff also makes the quality better
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> yes ofc the quality code be improved but as i said that pile of work seemed to big to ever start
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok^
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> also i do not like having two versions an old feature complete and a new work in progress
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> how?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can also say thats exactly how i ported fng to 0.7
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just see the diff and ez pz copy paste and clean up minor stuff
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> hm
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> instead of rebasing everything
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> merging*
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> no rebase
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> Also gave me an opportunity to instead work on code quality work on merable code
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> mergable*
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> I learned a few things about ddnets git history too :D
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> I know I already shamlessly selfplug promo this tool here but it helped me soo much during the merges https://github.com/lib-crash/lib-teeworlds/blob/master/bin/tw_cmake
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> If you have a terminal open to run or build tw_cmake is such a time safer it will automatically generate a CMakeLists.txt for you
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> so delete, rename or add files run tw_cmake . and all works
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I'll also leave a commit for ppl that want proper mouse handling and dont use any hipster wm or os
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commit/aa79096a1c45122f0d12276870ee3be28801cef6
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen\: already started with the change log? it must be insanly long, i'm really cursios xD
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¹¨tylerTime (i help on multeasy)> I have a question, is a vserver enough to run some on teeworlds (ddrace) server? or do i need a dedicated server?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¹¨tylerTime (i help on multeasy)> I have a question, is a vserver enough to run some teeworlds (ddrace) server? or do i need a dedicated server?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a toaster should be enough xd
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¹¨tylerTime (i help on multeasy)> xd
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Jupstar: Some how I can't find time
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah understandable \:D

20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> should that be "without" or am i reading it wrong?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah no
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> there is still history but not full
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> these instructions are so overkill \:D
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Yo, may I have a question about sound effects inside the client?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Can we have options on using Clicking sounds? Like whenever you click on a window / panel, etc.
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I want to create a pack, which would include those sounds (and music) inside the Main Menu.
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¹¨tylerTime (i help on multeasy)> I have question i had some help on hosting my own ddrace server on a vserver
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¹¨tylerTime (i help on multeasy)> so basically i open the DDnet-Server over my vserver
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¹¨tylerTime (i help on multeasy)>
