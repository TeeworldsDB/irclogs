19:59 <+ReiTW38> fstd, i'm glad to see how low is vali
19:59 <+ReiTW38> fstd, to have fun with ddosing my srv, by putting your name in packet data
20:02 <+fstd> ReiTW38: lol wat
20:02 <+fstd> oh never mind
20:02 <+ReiTW38> come private xd
20:02 <+fstd> ReiTW38: my name is in there by design
20:02 <+fstd> that has nothing to do with ddos or vali or whatever, everyone has it
20:03 <+ReiTW38> 1st time i see that
20:03 <+ReiTW38> flooding my srv
20:03 <+ReiTW38> :/
20:03 <+fstd> it's serverinfo requests
20:04 <+fstd> fstd and dtsf are the magic numbers of serverinfo request and reply, respectively
20:04 <+ReiTW38> hoo
20:04 <+ReiTW38> didn't know ^^
20:04 <+ReiTW38> whatever, I don't rly know how to filter that TKEN
20:05 <+fstd> that's a common problem with ddos... if it looks like legitimate traffic, there's little you can do about it on your end
20:05 <+fstd> and actually even if it's completely junk traffic, if it's enough of that you're still fucked
20:06 <+ReiTW38> 10000001544b454effffffff
20:06 <+ReiTW38> :/
20:08 <+fstd> how many packets per sec are you receiving?
20:08 <+ReiTW38> around 50mb/s
20:08 <+ReiTW38> 90 sometimes
20:08 <+ReiTW38> 90 was enough, this afternoon he overloaded my cpu
20:09 <+ReiTW38> but now he changed his method
20:09 <+ReiTW38>  rx:    72,87 Mbit/s 155407 p/s          tx:     5,25 Mbit/s 11406 p/s
20:10 <+fstd> from completely random source addresses?
20:10 <+ReiTW38> yes
20:10 <+ReiTW38> sometimes it is a specific range, that i've banned, but it is random
20:11 <+fstd> well apart from asking your upstream whether they have some sort of ddos protection (which may or may not work), you pretty much have to wait it out
20:12 <+fstd> maybe take down your tw server until its over to not reply to all those packets
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> or pusht ddnet to fix the TEKN thing
20:13 <+ReiTW38> ddnet-discord, the problem is, who's ready to navigate inside the network part of tw xD
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> nobody lul
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> guiis thats the second time my client crashed since im using the newest version. It happend both times on connect dummy. And @fokkonaut told me he had the same problem
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Cant fix the TKEN thing
23:05 <+fstd> what is the TKEN thing and what's wrong with it?
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Saki> @ChillerDragon !rank
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> As far as i understood it Is used for anti spoof and abused for ddos
