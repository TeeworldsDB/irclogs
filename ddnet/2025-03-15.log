00:35 < bridge> <corneum> Hey Guys
00:35 < bridge> <corneum> So i Heard that bots messed Up the leaderboards.
00:35 < bridge> <corneum> Might be a good time to reconsider the rankpoint calculation. 
00:35 < bridge> <corneum> Couple of years ago this was rejected because of conservative players.
00:35 < bridge> <corneum> 
00:35 < bridge> <corneum> Proposal is: instead of only top10 rank giving points, make it so rank% plays a role. Maybe top 10% of times get points
00:35 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
00:45 < bridge> <zhn> they don't do it to gather rank points, they advertise themselves on tiktok and #records
00:45 < bridge> <zhn> but yeah different point system would be a good update for 14 years old project xd
01:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sucks for them because there is no tiktok here :troll:
01:42 < bridge> <kebscs> why community skin download isnt enabled by default?
01:43 < bridge> <louis> theres hella jank community skins
01:46 < bridge> <kebscs> better than not knowing it exists
01:46 < bridge> <kebscs> talking about new players ofc
06:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can do the equivilant in c

08:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @ryozuki when start ddnet on master branch on m3 with moltenvk xd
08:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> I just called my windows windoof
08:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> morning :ddnet: enjoyers and others
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:22 < bridge> <hectavoxel> good morninf
08:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I mean if it doesnt take longer than few minutes, would be neat if you could quickly test if the clipping is fixed
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym by clipping
08:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The issue with the rendering
08:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That you even showed me
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> im ranching my slimes rn but ill do it soon
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350369557042434131/image.png?ex=67d67d27&is=67d52ba7&hm=f37d78973b9f532d4276f33047d243895f5da90b6ab31fef3556f96c042bed3b&
08:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok ty
08:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> slimes are translucent
08:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> glass is translucent
08:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> windows are glass
08:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 
08:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> your slimes are windows
08:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and windows is the best os
08:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so slimes are the best os
08:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> loophole
08:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you're gonna say that linux is the best os
08:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> and thats a contradictory because if linux was a slime it wouldnt be a very efficient computer now would it

13:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Grep this channel I think it was explained once
13:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe it used to be static
13:31 < bridge> <meloÆž> tried but i only found a single person mentioning it...

14:25 < bridge> <learath2> Should we ban all these chatbots I wonder
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> extinguish them
14:36 < bridge> <filoqcus> Is there a "list of banned words" in ddnet?
14:36 < bridge> <filoqcus> :nouis:
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is client side support and server side in china
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but dunno if there is a public official list
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah and while u test ddnet, you probably are also interested in quickly testing, arent' you:
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/actions/runs/13873274261

14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :deen_star:
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> @robyt3 yo can you please keep #9821 open for now until tater wakes up? He told me he found a way to do null-movement perfectly with binds so that could actually turn around the situation.
15:35 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9821
15:37 < bridge> <kebscs> @teero777 how would you detect it btw
15:37 < bridge> <kebscs> Dont think its trivial when not every direction change has to be perfect
15:39 < bridge> <kebscs> In osu theres a setup to just hold 1 key and tap the other
15:39 < bridge> <kebscs> That's why it can be detected there
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah and while u test ddnet, you probably are also interested in quickly testing, arent' you:
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/actions/runs/13873879772

15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :deen_star:
15:57 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think this turns around the situation of "PR rejected". If null movement is already possible with binds then there's even less motivation to add another feature for null movement to the client. That only adds more maintenance and potential for more bugs due to combinations of different features.
16:12 < bridge> <pippsza> guys. what has happened with ddsats API?
16:21 < bridge> <teero777> Having this binded spams the console with execs I assume xd
16:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> is that slime rancher 2?
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
16:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> is there any progress in the development?
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk i havent played since it released
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> used to play it like a year ago but reached the end pretty quickly
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> in gamepass
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> report your progress tomorrow \:D
18:39 < bridge> <learath2> I am very confused as to  where chiller finds all these 0.7 players
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> i have no idea. i suppose he just creates 30 fake identities so he can justify his commits
18:43 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> I know 5 people that use 0.7. None of them play ddrace
18:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not in ddrace
18:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> pvp modes have way higher 0.7 rates
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> I have to download 0.7 and check it now
18:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> why download 0.7
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> I have to know
18:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> know what
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> how many people are playing any 0.7 mod at this moment
18:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how does downloading 0.7 show you this?
18:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ddnet client already lists 0.7 servers and teeworlds clients see all the bridge servers
18:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so either client shows players from both versions 
18:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you need to use ``status`` on pvp servers to see it
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> ah no exclude filter in the glorious 0.7 client true
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its not a lot
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> on my fng server its 1 out of 22 right now
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> in ctf it sometimes is 2 out of 6
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> the vanilla scene seems dead
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350525866500821053/image.png?ex=67d70eba&is=67d5bd3a&hm=fa71a5746a83eb43f9e99ffadba4ab170c5dde054e186fcae7b9699b231b13f9&
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> public is dead
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> next person who lies to me about there being vanilla players who love 0.7 is getting deported
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but the scene is very much alive
18:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> a lot of vanilla players actually migrated to ddnet after a while 
18:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> especially since 0.7 support in ddnet and better rendering engine and anti ping and so on
18:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 that screenshot is so misleading you made me think players play ctf5 again xd
18:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but its all pro players
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> so there are secret pro players that play on non registered secret 0.7 vanilla servers?
18:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> anyways i do not like getting called a liar
18:52 < bridge> <learath2> I would never, I'm sure there are people that do love it
18:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there are players who play ctf that only use 0.7 its not a lot but they exist. And one of them happens to be my fng moderator. Nothing about that statement is a lie.
19:02 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it's fine to add the `username:password` thing, you do have to think about the case where the username or the password contains a : though, or both
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 are text containers cached, if not, would it be worthwhile to do
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you have your strong id shown, if a player leaves or joins, everyones text contaienrs have to update when they could just be shuffled around
19:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i didnt even mention it but my plan was if it finds at least one colon it splits on the first and tries it as username password combo ignoring any following colons
19:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so if ur username contains a colon you are fucked but if your password does its fine ``foo::`` logs into the account with user "foo" and password ":"
19:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and if your username password combo matches sv_rcon_password it logs you in to that or whatever
19:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> edge cases dont really have to supported here imo
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> btw on that ctf server there was a few noobs
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when i was playing
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it really felt like the old days it was great
19:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> that is amazing
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can you see town-hall?
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in any capacity
19:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> nope
19:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> anything juicy there? mind sharing a screenshot?
19:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> holdon
19:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350535880011681853/image.png?ex=67d7180d&is=67d5c68d&hm=47402a26eb65995eefde48767c1c856156625a52aedaa7929e344904495f77e9&
19:28 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oh that sounds complicated and controversial good luck with that proposal
19:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but yea of course i am happy that you care about vanilla and try to revive it
19:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think the 0.7 ui is better than the tabs
19:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but ik that a redesign like that is unlikely
19:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if you start advertising servers from the competition i will be sad tho haha
19:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anything which pushes vanilla servers i think will work
19:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> from the competition?
19:29 < bridge> <kebscs> why would ddnet advertise vanilla servers
19:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> anything thats not hosted by me is competition
19:29 < bridge> <kebscs> i go on steam and see its platformer why would i want play pvp ðŸ˜‚
19:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
19:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because ddnet is the face of teeworlds
19:30 < bridge> <kebscs> ive seen reviews on teeworlds' steam that they thought its pvp but its parkour instead
19:30 < bridge> <kebscs> same thing
19:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and if you dont want to play vanilla gamemodes
19:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can ignore it
19:30 < bridge> <learath2> Really? The collapsible things? I've never been a huge fan of it really
19:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but im sure theres a curious many out there who might give vanilla gamemodes a shot again
19:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its subjective Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i dont mind how they are added in ui
19:31 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i also dont like the collapsable stuff too much
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> Vanilla being popular again would be very cool, but it requires a dedicated community to make it happen
19:31 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i agree we do not utilize the huge amount of players nicely
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why not advertise it in ddnet client
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> advertise what in ddnet client?
19:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> browsing the servers filled with Linear servers is not the best ux either
19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> vanilla srvs
19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> read the screenshot :P
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> we barely have the time to run our own servers and maintain the client, we don't have time to maintain vanilla too
19:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i think solly and me are talking about public vanilla 
19:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the one that is not a communiy
19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the servers which are already online are fine
19:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> community pro vanilla already exists
19:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> just the casual one where new players goof around and find it in the master does not exist anymore
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> I'd suggest getting a community of servers together so that can be listed with the other communities
19:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no ones going to be clicking that though
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> Wtf how is that my problem? Why do people click on fng or kog? You need to market it better if you want it popular
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> I can't force people to play vanilla
19:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want to put it in a very noticeable place
19:35 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> same applies to many other mods too btw
19:35 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it is also hard to find zCatch games
19:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
19:35 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> used to be easy
19:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i think ctf is more importnat than zcatch
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> I do not think any mod is more important than the others
19:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> except ddrace
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or i would prerfer ctf getting the spotlight
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> after ddracd
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> after ddrace
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> the only thing ddrace has going for it is that it's in the name of the game
19:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and it takes up the majority of servers
19:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and it takes up the majority of players in servers
19:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which pushes it to the top
19:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i am not sure why exactly the current situation is so bad everything except ddrace seems mostly empty
19:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because i want to play ctf more often than once in a blue moon
19:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> maybe back in the days it was easier to sort by player amount and find other things than Linear and Multimap
19:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but somehow there was a time with way less players which somehow managed to have servers full enough to play ctf and zcatch and even ictf
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> It has always been like this, for a decade it has been like this, the grass wasn't greener 10 years ago
19:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i was playing zcatch on a daily basis in 2020
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> Everyone played ddrace, then sometimes there would come a mod with sudden popularity, which would be played for a while
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> then disappeared into the depths of the serverbrowser again
19:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the ictf save server was also always filled with players back in the days
19:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when i started, which wasnt all the long ago i only played ctf, i got scared by ddrace servers
19:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ctf5 was only empty a few hours during night 
19:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ctf on a map other than ctf5? henious
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> I have been playing since 0.5.1 and I have not once seen vanilla be prominent on the serverbrowser
19:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> that was rare since i started playing
19:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there were some rotating map servers but not too many
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe it was easier to find a server with people playing but it was never anywhere close to the top of the serverbrowser
19:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i play since 0.6 and i was playing ctf daily and until late in the night
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chiller make the best vanilla client ever
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> If you want people to play different mods, you'll need to find a way to market it, that's it
19:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> 14 players would get you on the first page tho no? @learath2 not sure
19:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ?? @Jupstar âœª 
19:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no
19:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> just use ddnet 
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u also need good server side bots, so servers are never empty
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> else servers dont fill up
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we can run some special events like, "mod of the month" or something to promote different mods but I guarantee you people will just leave after we artificially bump it up
19:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it worked somehow back in the days @Jupstar âœª 
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> You need organic growth, actual people wanting to play the mod and inviting people to play with them
19:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> well new players dont know what they want
19:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> they play 10 hours then they leave the game forever
19:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> they used to fill the ctf servers
19:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> they now fill the Linear servers
19:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but there is enough to fill both
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> in 0.5, yes, but since the advent of servers with more than 32 players max it hasn't been easy to be around the top with pvp mods
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> I can't tell them what to play, they see on tiktok that Linear is epic funtime, they play Linear
19:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (thats why i think pushing ctf to the top will help a ton)
19:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (if they just click whatevers at the top)
19:44 < bridge> <kebscs> @sollybunny you have to understand noones as excited to play ctf5 forever like you ðŸ˜‚
19:44 < bridge> <kebscs> thats why noones playing it
19:44 < bridge> <kebscs> thats why noones playing it right now
19:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by the reaction of people who played with me earlier
19:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> quite the opposite
19:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs well but the thing is there used to be players on these servers
19:45 < bridge> <kebscs> have never seen people play it other than chiller's server
19:45 < bridge> <kebscs> and zcatch sometimes
19:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want to play it, yet im never on ctf servers as theres no one else
19:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs my server is already new area imo
19:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but yes even that had a active player base at some point
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Whenever I talk to you I feel like I've hit my head on a rock and forgotten the past 6 years, or slipped into some parallel universe
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> The playerbase for vanilla has been like 40 people max for years now
19:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the pro players yes
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> I have never seen all 40 play at the same time either, there was no time when vanilla servers were very healthy
19:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but the casual player base back in the days was so active they would upload ctf5 footage to youtube on a daily basis. There where like 3 lets play teeworlds episode 1 every day
19:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> public ctf5 was really healthy
19:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and pro games were always organized

19:48 < bridge> <kebscs> :justatest: 12 years ago
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> It's like the mandela effect
19:49 < bridge> <oxyzo.> but teeworlds came out in 2019
19:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> back when default gametype would show up when you launch the client
19:49 < bridge> <kebscs> when i searched lets play teeworlds in yt
19:49 < bridge> <kebscs> top 20 results are 10-15 years old
19:49 < bridge> <kebscs> :justatest:
19:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs it wasnt 15 years ago but its been a few years for sure
19:49 < bridge> <learath2> When was this? The ddnet client almost certainly never had this, the ddrace client I don't quite remember but I think it didn't have anyt filters set
19:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont even feel comfortable guessing maybe around 0.7 release or a bit earlier
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> When was this? The ddnet client almost certainly never had this, the ddrace client I don't quite remember but I think it didn't have any filters set
19:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it was back when not everyone was using ddnet client i guess
19:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> this area is of course harder to remember if you never play ctf and you dont search it on yt
19:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i was searching "teeworlds" on yt with filter uploaded today for quite some time
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> I think before ddrace client with it's native 64p support, I used to play with dunes client
19:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i played with DDrace client
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think that one set a "default gamemodes" filter either, it was only vanilla that set that ever I think
19:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it even worked on mac was rly pog
19:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i switched to ddnet client after jetpack got added i think xd

19:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> 9 yrs ago
19:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1742064798.png
19:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont remember it every being that full
19:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like more work to cache the text containers and keep the cache consistent than laying out the container every so often
19:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> what i remember was one fullish server so like 10-16 players and maybe sometimes there were like 2 and then a bunch of servers with low amount of confused players that got lost xd
19:55 < bridge> <kebscs> 9 years ago is still ages
19:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes
19:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> sounds like you are making a point
19:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i am not sure which one :D
19:55 < bridge> <kebscs> yea idk either XD
19:55 < bridge> <kebscs> just saying vanilla is dead in 2025
19:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes we all agree on that
19:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but solly and me are saying it doesnt have to be because we have enough players that we could redirect there with default options
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> anyway, I'd suggest getting a community first, that's the easiest thing to do
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not randomly pushing one mod above the others on the serverlist
19:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6240
19:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> server browser in 2023
19:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 yea the proposal of solly is a bit hard to implement so many ways to disagree with it. So many ways to implement it. So many ways to upset people with. Tricky change
20:25 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki you maintain ddstas.tw right? player api doesn't work
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i own ddstats.org
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> the original
20:30 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
20:30 < bridge> <teero777> who does
20:40 < bridge> <louis> https://ddstats.tw/faq @teero777
20:42 < bridge> <_lysrgicc> how to fix "It looks like UPD is being filtered"? Help pls, rus servers
20:42 < bridge> <kebscs> try different server
20:43 < bridge> <_lysrgicc> oh(
20:49 < bridge> <_lysrgicc> maybe there is a way to get around this?
20:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> try a vpn 
20:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> are you in russia @_lysrgicc ?
20:53 < bridge> <_lysrgicc> Belarus
20:58 < bridge> <_lysrgicc> No changes:((
21:00 < bridge> <kebscs> rus servers are ddosed rn
21:00 < bridge> <kebscs> thats why udp filtered
21:00 < bridge> <kebscs> try ger servers
21:00 < bridge> <_lysrgicc> ping 80-100
21:01 < bridge> <patiga> iirc chillerdragon started this an actually managed to connect to a server ^^
21:02 < bridge> <kebscs> why moving to spectators on sv_pauseable lasts 10 seconds, but on sv_pauseable 0 its 3min
21:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @patiga yes my 0.7 client written in x86 nasm assembly can connect to servers and receive chat messages https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr
21:08 < furo> @kebscs It's these three settings, `sv_vote_spectate_rejoindelay` `sv_vote_pause` and `sv_vote_pause_time`
21:11 < bridge> <patiga> very damn impressive!
21:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thanks uwu
21:18 < bridge> <murpi> I donâ€™t think advertising vanilla will make much of a difference. People might play it for a few days, but then theyâ€™ll go back to racing/blocking. Reviving dead mods has never really been successful, and I doubt it will work for vanilla either. There's a reason it's not popular anymore, while ddrace continues to thrive xd
21:18 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @murpi there is enough fresh people to permantly fill the servers with players that only play it for a few days
21:20 < bridge> <murpi> Permanently fill servers.... only play it for a few days... yeah I don't think I understand
21:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and defaults rule the world they can be used to fill these servers which will make a difference. The difference it will make is that players that want to play ctf which can not be played alone now have the chance to do so
21:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @murpi that is how it has always been 
21:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> that is also what fills a lot of the Linear and Multeasymap servers
21:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> new players that dont stay can still be fun enemys until they get replaced by the next new player
21:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> Its not about making ctf the number one mode it is just restoring the ability to play at all. Because as of right now the public servers are basically empty at all times which is unplayble.
21:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddrace vs vanilla:
21:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - ddnet is constantly updated with new maps and quirks
21:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - vanilla has been the same for like a decade
21:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> imo vanilla had way too many updates in the last decade
21:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not even kidding
21:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> game was good when i started playing most of what got released after is a bit controversial to me
21:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> The quality of a game is not determined by the amount of updates
21:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I have similar opinions about ddrace too. Everything other than the freeze tile and maybe hook through is bloat.
21:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> Shotgun is ok too
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> man u still talk about vanilla
21:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im glad i have an ally to push vanilla lmao
21:52 < bridge> <louis> when is practice getting added back? :(
21:52 < bridge> <louis> agreed as a mapper
21:53 < bridge> <louis> it'd be nice to hav a vanilla mode with classes but otherwise its already fine
21:53 < bridge> <kebscs> fix is merged so maybe on server restart
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think it also depends on if all ranks were already deleted
21:53 < bridge> <louis> do servers run most recent?
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mostly
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> until then all we can do is cheer to murpi
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lez go murpi :deen_star:
21:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª how do you do networking in ddnet-rs? How did you come up with the protocol? How much does a library do for you? Did you have any ressources (blogs references) for prediction/networking and so on or did you just freestyle it?
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh i dunno. i think i just kinda had the idea already in mind
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
21:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i guess same question applys for keyboard inputs and rendering. Back when you started i assume you didnt know how to do it. How did you approach it?
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i just did it
21:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I am so impressed you built the entire thing from scratch
21:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> whats your main reference? rust docs?
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, be impressed, but to me it's only a matter of if you are willing to spent so much time
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am honestly more impressed i didnt stop half way through
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for learning rust it's mostly rust docs or see how libs did code.. and well i defs refactored from time to time, when i felt like getting used to some pattern
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but even before i started learning, i defs already liked derive macros xd
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is smth i always wanted in a compiler
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> allowing to patch the compiler
21:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if i would want to spawn a window with rust i would struggle to get started xd
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> honestly, i think winit is easier to use than SDL2
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's just so much more cleaned up and makes more sense
21:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> does it also do keyboard handling?
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sure
21:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how did you find out about it?
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i started with sdl (but already knew there is a rust version/rewrite of sdl
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and first i wanted to support both
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but then i decided to try to reduce c dependencies
22:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1742072399.png
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did you know, i first used the vulkan cpp backend
22:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ok it doesnt seem to be hidden xd
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
22:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> vulkan cpp for rust?
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes i used the original ddnet vulkan backend
22:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> woah
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> stripped everything out that doesnt compile and use it inside rust
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then i decided to port it
22:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> u are gangster
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and wasted like 1 week just rewriting it to rust
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> brain off, music on
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and just do it
22:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> sounds insanely fast to me
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well i wrote it in 2 weeks
22:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i am stuck since a month on adding /register and /login chat command omg
22:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> skill issues but even with skill as you said you had to stick with it for a long time
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you know why?
22:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> c++?
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs implemented bad solutions is always a downer
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what u actually want is some epyc client
22:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yea cool stuff keep it up
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but maybe u are one of those realists, that know that your own custom client will never hit
22:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if this was minecraft you would be a rockstar
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tru
22:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there just arent enough people to realize what you have actuall achieved
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> honestly, it's really not as impressive as you make it seem
22:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no 
22:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its more impressive
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the value/time ratio is simply not convincing me
22:05 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you convinced me
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thanks ws-client3
22:05 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> xd
22:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust rust rust
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust we trust
22:30 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> can someone pls add auto fix to clangd for the replace loop with ``std::any_of()`` or deactivate the warning for ddnet? -.- i get so annoyed every time it pops up
22:37 < bridge> <hectavoxel> bro is saying words
22:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust rust

22:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> :banhammer:
22:57 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @hectavoxel what happens if you type in rust
22:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> does it get turned into the nerdy ass programming language in real time or
23:01 < bridge> <meloÆž> if(true) {}; <a:Dance:799350877466787840>

23:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
23:04 < bridge> <_qey> Is there a way to remotely connect to RCON? Iâ€™ve tried connecting using UDP sockets, but to no avail.
23:05 < bridge> <_qey> The idea is to monitor log files using a standalone script that would allow me to ban/kick/mure people based on what theyâ€™re saying in the chat remotely.
23:06 < bridge> <_qey> For example, have a group chat in Telegram or a Discord channel purely for moderating purposes when Iâ€™m unable to physically connect to the server, to take action against violators.
23:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> run on join with tclient
23:08 < bridge> <_qey> Could you please elaborate? Iâ€™m not familiar with tclient.
23:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tclient has a way to run things on join
23:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which would allow you to do an f1 command
23:10 < bridge> <_qey> Is there a way to run a headless client or something? Iâ€™m interested in doing so programmatically.
23:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> probably, chillerdragon has a thing whcih can connect to a server i only x86
23:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/edg-l/teelib
23:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe try this
23:11 < bridge> <_qey> Will take a look, thanks.
23:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> teelib is not a full client
23:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if you want a python network lib that can actually connect have a look at twnet_parser https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/a0a9207e86502d90ebca32905d8867151e42c396/examples/07/download_map/download_map.py
23:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there is also one in js, ruby and rust see all of them here https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/
23:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if you just want a headless client you can also just compile the official ddnet client in headless mode @_qey just pass ``-DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON`` as a cmake flag
23:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey for remote rcon control there is econ and fifo
23:23 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there is also this project which is a full moderation bot for discord https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconDiscordModerationBot
23:24 < bridge> <_qey> Thanks. Hopefully that will help.
23:24 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i red the chat backwards starting from teelib ignore all my responses regarding network libs. For your use case you want to look at either fifo or econ @_qey 
23:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> may i ask why you want the tool to be external? i think editing the server code would be smoother.
23:26 < bridge> <_qey> Too much a headache going through the code and editing the server. I could possibly write a C++ implementation, but Iâ€™m too lazy and trying to stick with RCON external handling.
23:27 < bridge> <_qey> Itâ€™s like 5 minutes to write a log parser and some more minutes to learn why Iâ€™m failing to connect via RCON. C++ implementation would take me hours.
23:30 < bridge> <_qey> Ideally, yeah, write everything on C++ and even publish it on GitHub for others to use. Howeverâ€¦ (everything above)
23:31 < bridge> <oxyzo.> when ws-client4
23:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> doesnt change in the chatbox but it updates every message to match the case
23:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350600159767302166/Screenshot_20250315_183659.jpg?ex=67d753eb&is=67d6026b&hm=740ebfea7649ab5abdf37a04488e14573dc68c279f9b7b5fbbcf2bc539f0b76e&
23:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey what is your progamming language of choice for that external tool?
23:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i should really write a blog post about fifo one day xd
23:46 < bridge> <_qey> Iâ€™m going with Python for now. Iâ€™ve just read about fifo and actually found out about its existence in DDNet. Not that it fully covers the â€˜remotenessâ€™ of my needs, but it will work for now.
23:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there are two options for remote rcon as i said. One is fifo which is a file that you can just write to to send commands. And the other one is econ which is a tcp connection which needs username and password.
23:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> fifo is simpler to setup but you need to be on the same filesystem
23:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> econ is useful for remote connections
23:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> for fifo you can start your server like this ``./DDNet-Server "sv_input_fifo sample.fifo"`` or set ``sv_input_fifo`` in your config
23:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> then just write to the file sample.fifo with python
23:48 < bridge> <_qey> Is there a way to read the output via fifo?
23:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1742078919.png
23:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont think so
23:49 < bridge> <_qey> Not that I need it, but it would help extending the functionality in the future.
23:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you can check the logfile for that
23:50 < bridge> <_qey> Not everything is logged in the log file. Can I log the private massages with a flag of some kind or do I have to modify the server?
23:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you have to modify the server
23:50 < bridge> <_qey> Not everything is logged in the log file. Can I log the private messages people send with a flag of some kind or do I have to modify the server?
23:53 < bridge> <_qey> Not sure if there are checks in place in the original server for KRX to disallow or right away ban them, my server lacks several updates and is several versions behind due to being modified, but if there is none, one of my ideas were to check the spam message their client is sending and ban people based on that match.
23:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> add this ``log_info("whisper", "[%s -> %s] %s", Server()->ClientName(ClientId), Server()->ClientName(VictimId), aCensoredMessage);``
23:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L4742
23:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a12e0029cba5167561546bd5f28b2bd0acb8b44e/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L4742
23:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there is no krx check in latest ddnet
23:55 < bridge> <_qey> Thanks. I will have to someday update and rewrite the modifications to the new version. That might be a starting point for me.
23:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> is your code open source?
23:56 < bridge> <_qey> No. Not a fan, unfortunately.
23:56 < bridge> <_qey> It should probably be added as a safeguard, their free client basically sends the exact same message every time.
23:57 < bridge> <_qey> That gets you rid of like 95% of the hackers.
23:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> well if the client would not work on all ddnet servers anymore the maintainers would adapt it
