00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nice
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> this is ok?
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/798808831114477588/unknown.png
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> the brutal and solo rows continue there, but yeah looks buggy. Needs horizontal scrollbar
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the scroll bar is at the bottom, a bit awkward
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> Oh well
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: do you use yay with sudo or without? For me it was passwordless the first time i installed it that was nice
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yay w/o sudo
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://xkcd.com/1200/
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Doesn't yay use sudo to get root?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the build process shouldn't run as root
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you start it without sudo and let it escalate privileges itself
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yes, you should always use it without sudo like in the docs
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> I mean i think the last time i installed it it had a SUID set or something it never needed the admin password to do things
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> oh btw yay i managed it to run memtest its running since a few mins im not sure how to read the output but there is alot red stuff and it says 2501 errors so far
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have passwordless sudo?
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> does that mean my ram is broken?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2501 errors means something is broken
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> no i did not had passwordless sudo
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there should be 0 errors
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> `/usr/bin/yay` doesn't have suid at least on my machine
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> i run windows for like 2 hours and it run super smooth
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i do have passwordless sudo
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> so buying new ram should fix my problems?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> either a ram chip is broken, or it's not properly in the socket
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> i did not touch my pc
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, do oyu have a different ram stick to test whether that makes your problem go away?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you gotta figure out which ram stick is broken
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> can i simply unplug one?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can try, some sticks?/motherboards? require ram sticks to be in pairs, I think
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It might be that you gotta have it in the 1st and 3rd slot when you only have 2 or something like that
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> depends on the mainboard
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> oof
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> nah 3 is fine
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you just gotta figure out which you can remove
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and run memtest again to figure out which ramstick is bad
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> so there is no more value in running memtest anylonger with 11k errors i assume
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> nope, you need 0 errors
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> ok
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> i should have done that before trying to wipe my system :/ 
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> my dad had this problem on my parents home server and it only occurred after the system was running for days
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i just asked him and he said there's now way he knows of you can see which ram stick is broken from the test. so i'm afraid you need to take them out separately and rerun the test (or maybe binary search ^^ )
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i just asked him and he said there's no way he knows of you can see which ram stick is broken from the test. so i'm afraid you need to take them out separately and rerun the test (or maybe binary search ^^ )
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: If memtest shows that always the same part of memory is broken, you can disable parts of the RAM stick on Linux
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Cheaper than buying new RAM
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh wow, the things linux can do ðŸ˜®
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but kinda makes sense, if it can be fixed in software, no need to replace hardware
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `memmap=1$0x0007cec2d74` can be passed to the kernel to disable a single byte for example
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at address 0x0007cec2d74
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually I should have noticed a few days earlier that ChillerDragon's problems sounded familiar: https://hookrace.net/blog/broken-hardware-fixes-hacks-8-years/#random-access-memory
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> did you have similar symptoms?
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder why windows run so well tho
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> for my dad it just crashed linux after a few days
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> my hardware is like 8 years old i am fine with investing some money again tho im a bit scared to touch hardware
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps windows happens to map less stuff to the bad range
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> don't do it like a friend of mine and buy incompatible ram ticks 2 times ðŸ˜„
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> haha classic
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> don't do it like a friend of mine and buy incompatible ram sticks 2 times ðŸ˜„
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> happend to me 3 times to me with razer blades xd
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> oh shit
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> oh not the gaming brand razer blade
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> but like actual
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> u know
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> blades for a razer
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> razor?
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> haha
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh man 
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mostly nothing can go wrong with touching hardware
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just don't use excessive force
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and make sure to apply thermal paste!
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> i can cause segfaults by just looking at software trust me
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> i break all the things
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://images-cdn.9gag.com/images/thumbnail-facebook/24429526_1457788685.9921_QyDY6Y_n.jpg
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> oh boi ram is expensive af i did not know that
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwR3VALnycQ
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> thats the wrong place i assume ._.
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> dont show me such stuff i might follow the steps lul
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> don't ^^
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GsRWZcuM0M
15:20 <+ChillerDragon> on it :)
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> argh dont' follow it
15:29 <+ChillerDragon> xxd
15:29 <+ChillerDragon> i removed two slices yikes
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> the 4th one is unreachable :/
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> yikes 10 errors in 1 second
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> ok so the ram that is under the cpu thingy is broken i guess i wont touch that :/
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> u mean the fan? xd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> you can just take it off... more often than not theres no screws involved
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neiral> heyho, friends and me developed a register for a homepage. was wondering if that could be a thing for teeworlds as well?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> i guess  people here will appreciate the efforts, but i dont think that idea is too innovative
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> socket could be broken aswell btw
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> ye the fan is big fat
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> what is a "register"?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I've got the AlpenfÃ¶hn Brocken, love that name
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> i tried violence :)
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> 0 errors so far
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> fok
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> :(
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> can i see which ram is afftected in memtest? I mean u see the regions tested but are those from left to right the physical memory?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neiral> thought so too, im still thinking about the ip change problem. only came up with an unsatisfying reward system..idk. :/
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> wat?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> i have literally no idea what you are talking about... but now im curious to see the code
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> what code what are you all talking about?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neiral> @GutZuFusss lol i didnt even code anything besides for my homepage ðŸ˜„ its a casual register with username and password. nothing special. months ago i overheard deen saying a register would fix some problems. but a casual register will not fix the problem with blockers and trolls since they can just register themselves with  a new ip
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> oh that kind of register
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> ok fam gotcha
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neiral> alright, i will stop here and leave it how it is ðŸ˜„ i like "Zoozti" argument. never really thought about it consciously, but thats a huge reason why i love this game
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neiral> ty boys
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> since i cant reach the ram i guess i have to use memmap to turn it off
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> where do i provide this kernel arg never did something like this
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is your bootloader?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Grub cfg
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if grub is your boot loader
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> so in /boot/grub/grub.cfg i put GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="memmap=xyz"
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> ?
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> ye i use grub
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does the file say something about being automatically generated?
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> im in memtest but i think not that it is auto generated since i generated it manually
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for me, it says `# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE`
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> oh
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> then /etc/default/grub regarding to archwiki
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> does memtest also use this then?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Probs
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> nice
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> ok ima try
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Remember to generat the config again
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> ye :)
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> learned it the hard way during arch and memtest install xd
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure about memtest tbh
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these are linux command line options
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I doubt memtest runs linux
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on the ddmax map "NUT_hardcore_bestof" the (completely unused) envelopes are broken in a way that makes the editor crash when viewing the third envelope and hovering over the broken looking stuff
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the fix (removing all envelopes) can be replicated like usual with https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/master/src/bin/fix_map.rs

17:02 <+ChillerDragon> yikes htop says i have 3gb ram
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> hmm so ``memmap=5000M$00210e6e270`` shows 3gb in htop and ``memmap=4000M$00210e6e270`` shows 31gb i am confused
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> well ill try the 31 and see if my system is stable
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What are freenode/quakenet? Is the ddnet irc hosted on a ddnet vps or on one of those providers? are passwords on irc something specific to freenode/quakenet?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hosted on both of them, connected with bridge
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> usually we used quakenet, the most popular irc server for games
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> freenode is the most popular one for open source software
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only Zwelf is on freenode I think
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> each server has its own pw implementation
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> is it unusual to host your own irc?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> that's all i wanted to know, thanks :)
20:38 <+ChillerDragon> similar to mail isnt it
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> hmm weird since i reinstalled arch my 3rd screen does not work and if i install the package nvidia ONLY my third screen works lol
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> why is life so hard
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah somtimes linux feels like a constant fight agains entropy ^^
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah sometimes linux feels like a constant fight against entropy ^^
21:54 <+ChillerDragon> i cant remember any problem when i installed arch the first time on this machine tho its so weird
21:54 <+ChillerDragon> i should have listend to deen and backup my whole drive to then restore it :D
22:09 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon thats why u get amd gpu if u use linux
22:09 <+Ryozuki> i mean, u wont use the rtx shiny stuff on linux anyways
22:09 <+Ryozuki> i think amd drivers are better in 2021
22:09 <+Ryozuki> on linux
22:10 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon whats ur xrandr command?
22:10 <+Ryozuki> maybe it fixes it
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ryozuki: you know arch packaging, why is here pkgver defined and then a function called pkgver as well? which one is use? https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=passff-host-git
22:10 <+Ryozuki> i use xrandr --output DVI-D-0 --primary --left-of HDMI-A-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 144.0
22:11 <+Ryozuki> @timakro its cuz its a -git package
22:11 <+Ryozuki> they use dynamic version
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `arandr` is a nice GUI for xrandr
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it can't do everything xrandr can
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still use it for setting up projectors
22:11 <+Ryozuki> @timakro pkgver=1.0.1.r7.1feab77 is a version set when the pkgbuild was released but it doesnt mean anything for a git pkg
22:12 <+Ryozuki> so they implement a function to get the true version
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> thanks
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VCS_package_guidelines
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look this
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The pkgver autobump is now achieved via a dedicated pkgver() function. This allows for better control over the pkgver, and maintainers should favor a pkgver that makes sense. To use pkgver(), you still need to declare the pkgver variable with the most recent value. makepkg will invoke function pkgver(), and update variable pkgver accordingly.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki Is this sed some kind of standard?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> git describe --tags --long | sed 's/\([^-]*-\)g/r\1/;s/-/./g'
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its standard if u follow semver or something
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It changes `1.2.1.r1.2bceedd` > `1.2.1-1-g2bceedd`
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see what u mean
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It changes `1.2.1.r1.2bceedd` < `1.2.1-1-g2bceedd`
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> other way around xD
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1.2.1.r1.2bceedd
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is how it ulooks
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> usually
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my experience
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> why is this better
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> the thing is, this breaks the package haha
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the r means something
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u mean
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> breaks this ^^ https://github.com/passff/passff/blob/c3456219d204c7df4b9230ba267da4ece6e8810d/src/modules/util.js#L217-L222
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The revision number delimiter ("r" right before REVISION) is important. This delimiter allows to avoid problems in case if upstream decides to make its first release or uses versions with different number of components. E.g. if at revision "455" upstream decides to release version 0.1 then the revision delimiter preserves version monotonicity - 0.1.r456 > r454. Without the delimiter monotonicity fails - 0.1.456 < 454.
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this the reason
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah, it helps ascii sorting
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> thats nice
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Now where should I file the bug report xD
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess not on arch
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does that extension do
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's for the `pass` password manager https://www.passwordstore.org/
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the extension wants to read the pass pkg version?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> well actually the pkgbuild writes the version into a placeholder in the python script it then installs
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799024837334138890/unknown.png
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats wrong with this one?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt have r stuff
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> the browser extension then talks to the python script and checks the version and then just stops working without an error message -.-
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh this is the firefox extension for pass
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Comes in two parts, the firefox extension and a python script on the host which talks to firefox
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need this
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/passff/passff-host
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That's the aur package
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm making a pr, gotta understand js regex first though
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799025273759989840/unknown.png
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use the non git version
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh awesome
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do  u use a aur helper?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I use yay
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u should improve ur search or smth xd
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799025462026043432/unknown.png
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I looked on aur.archlinux.org xD
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can search using yay <regex>
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ok never used that
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Awesome, works ^^
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
