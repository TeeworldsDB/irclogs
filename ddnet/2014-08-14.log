17:49 < EastBite> deen: what actually is rcon 'crashmeplx' for?
17:54 < EastBite> that sounds even worse then the 64 server request f(i)st(e)d and vice versa
19:00 < laxa> deen: you there ?
19:52 <@deen> back
19:53 <@deen> EastBite: i had to keep that stupid name^
19:53 <@deen> it's from the old ddwar 64 player stuff and for compatibility with all 64 player servers
19:53 <@deen> it just tells the server that you want 64 player packets
19:53 <@deen> if a normal client does that it gets crashed
19:54 <@deen> that's why it's called "crashmeplx"
19:54 <@deen> and fisted is obviously from the player
20:41 < EastBite> deen: has NETMSG_TYPE_ISDDNET the same purpose?
20:43 < EastBite> a 128 pl request will be called 'd','e','e','n' I guess :P
20:44 <@deen> ^^
20:44 <@deen> ISDDNET only comes later unfortunately
20:44 <@deen> and it also tells you which client version
20:48 < EastBite> ah
20:49 < EastBite> how was your exam?
20:53 <@deen> overslept^^
20:55 < EastBite> whaaaaat
21:00 < EastBite> hmm, tell your professor you had a horrifying dream about ip spoofing^^
21:01 <@deen> I could have written it later today, but the prof's email wasn't working, so he couldn't tell me...
21:01 <@deen> Have to wait 3 weeks now, meh
21:01 < EastBite> :/
