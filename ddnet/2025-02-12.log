04:43 < bridge> <louis> what is this server: 134.122.64.174:8303 ?
04:43 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339079410313203744/image.png?ex=67ad6a62&is=67ac18e2&hm=ca4e74966b743f212797f63a304c6c82ebb69279c47b078d07da3a726c545c6f&
04:43 < bridge> <DDNet> 134.122.64.174:8303 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
04:43 < bridge> <louis> did i get my ip grabbed?
05:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I had a funny idea where, for automap making, you can assign each tile in the menu a little icon which helps elaborate further what the certain tile does
05:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339097287992803410/image.png?ex=67ad7b08&is=67ac2988&hm=83803302c97809f2ec62b30dd59c26e66abf7226b4f0f5ed039b2005a7b7f96e&
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Other icons include:
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Several icons for big structures
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Several icons for doodads / inside structures
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - An icon for like, resetting
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - A clean-up icon
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Some puzzle piece icons
06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Flag icon, sort of vauge but can be used for masks

06:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @louis.place @soulyvevo What do you think about this idea? It's in the "hypothetical" phase right now, but it would be cool as hell to see these icons to convey automappers better!
06:06 < bridge> <meloÆž> sthis looks so COOOOOOL
06:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ^^
08:21 < bridge> <remakepower> I have same question
08:23 < bridge> <remakepower> I have tried to join 2  servers which have over 64 players
08:23 < bridge> <remakepower> But they all dropped my client with "(versions is unsupported)"
08:24 < bridge> <remakepower> I want to know which version client they accept.
08:27 < bridge> <remakepower> And do they violating the 5th rule of master rules?
08:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats dope
08:29 < bridge> <remakepower> And do they violate the 5th rule of master rules?
09:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what the hell
09:30 < bridge> <meloÆž> destoros landing front page ddnet by just playing his map is a vibe
09:30 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
09:30 < bridge> <meloÆž> but i must say the song is a banger!
10:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> master rules?  whats that?
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/server_rules
11:46 < bridge> <remakepower> ChillerDragon: What I meant is https://ddnet.org/rules/master/
11:50 < bridge> <remakepower> ```5.The Server should be joinable via the latest version of the official DDNet client, not requiring a custom client.```
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wow didnâ€™t know hvh is an illegal server. Rule 7 is crazy
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Is that so?
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I'd say they are not _exclusively_ for it
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Maybe they mean these non-real time servers
11:59 < bridge> <meloÆž> oh these TASNet servers?
12:50 < bridge> <remakepower> So why those servers told my latest version DDNet client is *unsupported*?
12:50 < bridge> <remakepower> :thonk:
12:57 < bridge> <remakepower> Could you all join it?
12:58 < bridge> <remakepower> 134.122.64.174:8303
12:58 < bridge> <DDNet> 134.122.64.174:8303 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
13:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> looks really really weird https://status.tw/server/134.122.64.174/8303
13:11 < bridge> <soulyvevo> when you scroll down to player heatmap you can see that its pretty much the same amount of players all the time
13:11 < bridge> <remakepower> I think so.
13:11 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i wouldnt advise joining it
13:11 < bridge> <soulyvevo> couldnt find any info about any big gores tournament running right now either
13:12 < bridge> <remakepower> I guess that it may be a fake server, which only truly opened in some times
13:13 < bridge> <remakepower> But why its hoster did that?
13:14 < bridge> <soulyvevo> server having 66 players all the time from 20:00 to 13:00 doesnt look right to me
13:15 < bridge> <remakepower> :thonk:
13:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> :cat_uwu:
13:15 < bridge> <remakepower> Could anyone join it?
13:16 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i dont know and better not to try
13:17 < bridge> <remakepower> Hmm... should it be banned in master?
13:25 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @heinrich5991 any ideas?
13:28 < bridge> <matodor> this is not the first case, yesterday there was a similar server with a different name
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bbycroft.net/llm actually cool web to learn how a gpt model works
13:31 < bridge> <remakepower> I remembered there was a same player in that similar server.
13:32 < bridge> <totar> it's obviously for farming ips for ddos, do not click it
14:17 < bridge> <remakepower> oh no, I have clicked it.
15:11 < bridge> <Assa> just finished the new speedtiles, I had a lot of trouble understanding what is happening opposed to the original ones, because the original ones are just broken
15:11 < bridge> <Assa> turns out it's just a really hard problem if you have many things affecting speed like acceleration, friction, and even gravity
15:44 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs do you have any questions, since you are already testing?
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> no, seems fine
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> more intuitive to cap the overall players speed
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> compared to old tilke
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> compared to old tile
15:48 < bridge> <kebscs> with max speed 1 is basically like one way tilke
15:48 < bridge> <kebscs> with max speed 1 is basically like one way tile
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> yes, added this to the description as one of the Ceaveats
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> old implementation clipped max_speed 1-4 to 5
15:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im dedicating all my ddnet power into automapping now
15:49 < bridge> <Assa> can't wait to add the cruise control speed clipping feature tile :3
15:49 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Sorry! pr declined! dont  feel like maintaining it!
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> cool time to fork your open source game!
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> cool time to fork your open source game! /s
15:55 < bridge> <Assa> max_speed 1 is really interesting, even the overlay shows acceleration, but it doesn't because of other game settings
15:56 < bridge> <Assa> my guess is death by quantization
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> you can now make slides with the new speedtiles xD btw this is intentional, because they only affect the speed they're pointing to, not the speed perpendicular to them, slide is powered by gravity
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339260380072906884/new_speedtile_test_2025-02-12_16-40-15.mp4?ex=67ae12ec&is=67acc16c&hm=502d657f1b4266b095e422cd7bb05639f794375fc11c006c1857ef2c891da136&
16:48 < bridge> <Assa> if this would allow for max_speed 0, you could make slopes like this
16:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> we got slopes in teeworlds before gta 6
16:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339262496422236270/image.png?ex=67ae14e5&is=67acc365&hm=d251572dbd1792150fe51cfe199b1bafefbc3a349f1a07cc7ce048a551bce2a6&

16:53 < bridge> <Assa> I mean, I _could_ make slopes, but I already hear the "backwards compat" screams in the background
16:54 < bridge> <Assa> thinking about it, it would also basically be a very similar code and they would slow you down
17:04 < bridge> <alw5> why can you spoof ips
17:04 < bridge> <alw5> that should not be possible
17:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> YOOO thats so cooool
17:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> HELL YEA
17:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> lmfao these are awesome
17:25 < bridge> <louis> that's really cool even if it doesn't seem intuitive for speedups
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> agreed, it feels unintuitive, but it makes sense thinking about it
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> feels like they are "reflecting" too much force in a way
17:41 < bridge> <soulyvevo> it kinda looks like if stoppers could be placed diagonally
17:57 < bridge> <chairn> @essigautomat which line in the current tile code leads to division by 0 that leads to the same behavior as sg bug ?
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> take a look at <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9658> in game/server/character.cpp
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> there is just a missing `-` sign
18:23 < bridge> <louis> well physically force vectors just add
18:23 < bridge> <louis> so it feels unintuitive and it is unintuitive, but you can do cool things with it
18:24 < bridge> <Assa> this one doesn't if you're breaking the speedlimit
18:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think theres a bit of potential for fun maps using this quirk
18:26 < bridge> <Assa> I guess it even depends on your usecase, I look forward to adding one more speedtile variant
18:27 < bridge> <Assa> I guess it even depends on your usecase, I look forward to adding one more speedtile variants
18:27 < bridge> <Assa> I guess it even depends on your usecase, I look forward to adding more speedtile variants
18:29 < bridge> <Assa> this works with the old ones too ðŸ’€
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> this works with the old ones too ðŸ’€ only nobody noticed it because max speed is clipped to 5 and it pushes you a bit more
18:32 < bridge> <Assa> I found yet another bug in the old speedtiles ... can't believe it
18:32 < bridge> <chairn> but that just set the angle, not the speed ?
18:32 < bridge> <chairn> and atan(inf) is 1, so the division by 0 is hidden
18:34 < bridge> <Assa> are you sure about that? calculating anything with `NaN` ( = Not a Number) can be extremely gamebreaking
18:36 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place this is the OLD speedtile (not mine), as you can see you run into the same, and also yet another bug
18:36 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339289057435582484/new_speedtile_test_2025-02-12_18-34-28.mp4?ex=67ae2da2&is=67acdc22&hm=f598709d59eda6210d7e54fcf7d56fe1712c09dd6877fba2ff5398cdeddde56d&
18:37 < bridge> <louis> yeah i see it now
18:38 < bridge> <Assa> I can continue to ||shit|| on the old spaghetti code all day
18:49 < bridge> <chairn> division by 0 with float gives +/- inf, atan(+/- inf) is +/-1
18:50 < bridge> <chairn> division by 0 with float gives +/- inf, atan(+/- inf) is +/-pi/2
18:51 < bridge> <ÑµÑ‘Ð¿Ñ³Ñ«eloÆž> if(NaN) { return 0; };
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> just tested
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> ```c
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> printf("%f\n", atan(1./0.0f)); // prints 1.570796
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> ```
18:54 < bridge> <chairn> and atan(inf) is pi/2, so the division by 0 is hidden

19:23 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i wish i knew how to properly benchmark code in ddnet
19:23 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i wanna try making the import for automappers faster
19:25 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i feel like the code in the `Pos 0 0` bit could be turned into a vector of char bits instead of being a while(true) loop
19:26 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like, taking the line and making a vector out of them based off of how many words there are in the linr

19:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Build in release mode and measure the runtime of function calls using `time_get_nanoseconds` to get a basic idea. Run the code many times in a loop and take the average to get a better idea. Or use a profiler, e.g. integrated in MSVC. Optimizing automapper loading is probably not really worth it though, it only happens once when you load images so unless it's very slow it shouldn't really matter. Optimizing the automapper evaluation would be more us

20:08 < bridge> <learath2> woooo
20:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I guess that's fair, I just honestly feel like there's a lot that can be done with this feature.
