00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sounds good
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well dev discussion xd
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that would split it right?
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> from chat
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what a category means
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its this thingy
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757723161268715520/unknown.png
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hoped that discord allows subcategories or smth
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ did someone test 8?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even know what that mask means xD
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fokko
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its just that a mod can decide to show invalid tiles
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any idea how to trigger Reload skin menu when skin count changed
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it does auto
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the interesting case was when the size of skins doubled
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you could remove all skins, start client, open menu, connect to a server with many players and it would bug
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok ill try
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u have todo smth different than us xd
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> skins are saved on .teeworlds right?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> something we didnt have thought off
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not in the data folder
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> something we didnt have thought of
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> both are taken, same as for all
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> downloaded in .teeworlds
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like it works
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw before i deleted downloaded skins i had some interesting files there
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757725823309578264/unknown.png
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> br bro brow brownb brownbe
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny evolution
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the tmp files should also get deleted with the new update now
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i dont see any now
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should code a graphics driver, it would be buggy asf so we can test this stuff
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> feature request: if a player has dummy connected before a server restart, dummy autoconnects after the restart
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if the map is the smae
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> same*
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> doesnt server restart when the server is empty
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yooooo> is there such a thing as a moderator in game that can punish people  that see as fit
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @abcqwerty for mapping i do f2 restart to update the map
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @yooooo yes, you'll have to ping them in discord using @ moderator and give them the names of the people who are misbehaving (or the server region and map name)
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yooooo> Well is there a way i can be a moderator i wanna help people because i see trolling 24/7
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> there's some info here: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewforum.php?f=69
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if you're new you might want to get acquainted with the game+community a bit before you apply
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yooooo> ive been in the game for about a month maybe
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yooooo> Is there an age requirement? @louis
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i don't think so
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> There's a little bug on the players profile page: When i click on the difficulty rating of one of the last finished maps, it tries to redirect me to a none existing page. e.g. https://ddnet.tw/players/Wollwolke/novice/
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > @abcqwerty for mapping i do f2 restart to update the map
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis why u dont use the "reload" command
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O the RC found a big bug actually
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (unmasked stuff)
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki what is RC ?
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> search it urself
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Release candidates, pre-release for tests so there are less bugs at actual official release
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should I add a release candidate channel in steam as well or is it ok to test by raw download only?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The nightly usually contains all the stuff that will be released anyway
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think nightly is enough
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: :bluekitty:
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i think should be make (run server)auto ready like anyservers(ddrace)  have all maps old and new
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> As a result of this:1- more servers
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 2-Less stress on basic servers
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 3-searching for server less laggy become easier
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 we can't ship all maps because we have no licenses. it would take too much space. You can use https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps if you want to do that locally, but you don't get official ranks. Also, home connections are usually not good enough for hosting servers, you need to forward ports and you invite DoS attacks that your ISP will definitely not like.
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm this Harder than what it looks like
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :sorry:
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :brownbear:
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757922302200512553/unknown.png
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or maybe it will just pretend it's ok but then add some cyanide 10 years later to my coffee for that.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could someone please explain me what the Quad "Tex U", "Tex V" represent and why they are always multiples of 1024, but when stretching (holding shift and dragging a corner) it visually changes without changing the values, only when you drag far enough?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its something like texture coordinates
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g UV mapping
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The letters "U" and "V" denote the axes of the 2D texture because "X", "Y", and "Z" are already used to denote the axes of the 3D object in model space, while "W" (in addition to XYZ) is used in calculating quaternion rotations, a common operation in computer graphics.
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm i dont quite get it, why do we need a 3d texture mapping process in a 2d game? can we kinda simulate 3d spheres to give the impression of 3d or smth @Ryozuki ?
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has nothing to do with 3d
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> UV is just texture coordinates
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont use XY for texture coordinates cuz they are used in the model space
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah so that we can also only take a small part of the picture?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this has to do with the model view projection
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did a bit of opengl
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Texture coordinates specify the point in the texture image that will correspond to the vertex you are specifying them for.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5532595/how-do-opengl-texture-coordinates-work
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the values are still weird tho, ive taken 2 pictures with different resolutions and the values were always 1024, so i guess  1024 = 100%.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> however, why does it only go up/down in steps of size 1024
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Texture coordinates define how an image (or portion of an image) gets mapped to a geometry."
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Workbench/!FME_Geometry/Texture_Coordinates.htm
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why it goes in steps of 1024
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that must be tw specific
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jupstar should know
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he added that thing iirc
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga I think I explained it to you once here
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I never figured out what's wrong with the display values though
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's because we use fixed point numbers
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, the display value is completely off
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > Yeah, the display value is completely off
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, thats what i was mainly wondering about
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> matricks works at Microsoft now I guess: https://bethesda.net/en/article/1iLtcvwY6Nb1GeKADyDUEX/why-microsoft-is-the-perfect-fit
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fixed the UV thing
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> üëç
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> isnt sunny side up by ravie
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, I added the wrong map üòÑ
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean I'm also talking to Ravie, but still waiting for response
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sunny side up such a beautiful and welcoming map :)
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *is
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: I don't know how to build SDL2
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/letoram/SDL2/blob/704d68008135015dedf90409f2f7e07bd895ce63/src/video/windows/SDL_windowskeyboard.c#L888
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's rather easy with cmake
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> do i just build it and throw it into the others folder
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga that should do it
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie üåà which OS are you on?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> windows
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you can just replace the dll with yours
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëå
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll try that
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 uhm, check_style fails but fix_style doesn't fix anything
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> am I holding it wrong?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2906
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `python scripts/fix_style.py --base HEAD^`
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you do this?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, I didn't set a base
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you don't set a base, it only tries to fix uncommitted changes, sorry, need to document this script every dev has to use better
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we should do the entire repo
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> possible contras: - we might change formatting again, because we can't review all the changes - because clang-format might change again in the future - makes it incompatible with cherry-picking other commits
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pros: we don't need to have such an annoying script
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But right now we're not reviewing the foramtting either
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i just run it and add a commit and never look at it üòÑ
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. I do and I thought the reviewer also looks at the formatted code
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I use ?w=1
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, can we allow one line functions? We have many `T foo(K bar) { return sth; };`
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I thought the whole idea of using clang-format is that you don't have to look at formatting
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 that's something that quickly becomes impossible after using clang-format on the whole codebase
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, try to see if you can configure clang-format that way
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is why I hate formatters :/ Why does it have to be so opinionated?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the least opiniated formatter I've seen
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just needs to be configured/maybe even patched
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they probably accept your pull request
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just that they can't possible accomodate all styles from the get-go
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was actually thinking of patching clang-format to let us have lax formatting for bitwise operators
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it wasn't important enough for me, I realized I didn't really care whether  there are spaces there or not
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is it known thing?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757946207833292931/unknown.png
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 1,3 is a teleports
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, I'm waiting for @Jupstar ‚ú™ to fix it
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only care to minimize diffs, style I'm not so sure I mind
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 1,3 is a teleports (steam version)
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah @heinrich5991 if you have a minute, #2902, I think it's okay, but not sure
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2902
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, I realized that I enabled nightly builds
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, that's the fix already
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757946903064346874/unknown.png
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hmm
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie üåà nice, how'd you get that working?!
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what behavior does that change?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or is it looking wrong?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems identical in behavior
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, that is Teeworlds, not DDNet üò¶
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is sdl related. should be the same on DDnet
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i don
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Well it's not identical, it fixes the issue üòÑ
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i don't know how were they suppose to work before. i disabled the uiless mode in SDL. but this won't work in fullscreen.
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't know. this is weird
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if I can't see the difference, I can't merge it ^^
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie üåà I looked quite a bit into this, sadly it's a rather difficult problem to get the ime to work with actual fullscreen :/
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye...
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it looks like they were going to do it but give up
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean for fullscreen
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I looked into actually rendering the candidate window ourselves, but it's so hard on linux when there is no common protocol to get the candidates out
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> does linux have problem will fullscreen too?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a fullscreen issue on every OS I think. When the game has complete control over the monitor, the OS can't render the IME window on top
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok...
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With borderless "fullscreen" it works on every OS though
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> on windows at least, looks like they gathered all the candidates
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but never used them
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I was going to write a SDL patch to expose IME candidates on every OS
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there were `IME_ShowCandidateList` that looks like that it suppose to create a texture of some sort for the list. but the methods are empty.
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess they also came to the conclusion that the insane state of Linux IMEs is impossible for them to navigate
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can we do it on windows since it is kinda already there
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> expose the candidate list to us
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SDL would need to be an ibus and fcitx client at the very least to support a large portion of the users on linux
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie üåà Yeah, on windows it's doable
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's such a shame that the people who made XIM didn't think to have an API to get candidates
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> XIM is the only common ground between all input managers on linux
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is japanese imes mostly XIM?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fcitx seems to be the most popular
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think chinese ones are mostly ibus and fcitx
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think for chinese I've seen many people using fcitx-googlepinyin
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :saddog: rime was popular too
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> rime has both ibus and fcitx frontend
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > There is a fullscreen issue on every OS I think. When the game has complete control over the monitor, the OS can't render the IME window on top
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dont have any issue with fullscreen on my arch linux i3gaps setup
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki is it real fullscreen or borderless?
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my setup doesnt care
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i enable and disable all them its the same
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really? It can render an IME candidate window on top of a fullscreen game?
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah idk about ime
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thought those were 2 separate sentences
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then what did you answer? üòÑ
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :EeveeShy:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> on windows you can kinda render the ime in exclusive fullscreen
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> without rendering yourself i mean
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it just flashes a lot when you do it
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There are multiple input method styles which you can read about here. SDL supports "on-the-spot" mode. This has an important implication: the application is responsible for drawing the composition.
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, the usual hack
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials/TextInput
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we know about on-the-spot already.. the problem is the candidate list
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials/TextInput#CandidateList
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we should render that candidate list?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and we can't
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the conclusion we both came to üòÑ
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can't get the candidates
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not on all systems anyway
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> on windows you can, but it is not currently exposed to teeworlds
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can get it on windows, I thiiink I can get it using some arcane APIs forgotten by most on macOS
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and linux?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most important of the 3?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On linux I think I figured out how to do it for fcitx. No idea about ibus, it's really really hard to read all of the ibus code
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> fcitx is enough
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ibus is pretty buggy for me when I tried to use rime with it
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ibus-rime
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :wuhmm: i think most ppl use fcitx anyway
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We should mostly focus on Windows btw
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about uim
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> very low player numbers on Linux ond Mac
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well others can focus on that
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you don't need candidate list with uim (i'm guessing
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is a CJK problem after all
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill definitly put all my power to the linux master race
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > on windows you can, but it is not currently exposed to teeworlds
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie üåà and how do u expose it
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u mean by exposing it anyway
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SDL patch
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something like `SDL_GetCandidateList` I'd guess
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why make a patch
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> > what do u mean by exposing it anyway
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Ryozuki there isn't a SDL api to get the candidate list out of SDL.
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast that's what I was planning to implement
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not make the platform dependent code directly
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on ddnet
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if sdl doesnt have it
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can do that too, but if we go through all the trouble, why not let other people have it too? üòÑ
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah well yea, but u dont want to wait to get that patch on sdl
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will take forever i think
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not very open source of you @Ryozuki. Stallman would be disappointed
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also SDL consumed all the messages already. it'd be hard to get anything after SDL
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 D:
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well we can do it before SDL, but that's more trouble
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just wanted to get it first on ddnet
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ddnet is open source
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never really looked into how it is on windows, isn't the candidate list exposed only on demand there?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/imm/ns-imm-candidatelist
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/candidate-lists
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its win32 api its usedd in this things right
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think it was messages if you are telling windows to give it to you instead of the imm context
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757952494864302120/unknown.png
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/imm/nf-imm-immgetcandidatelista
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> something like this. but `IME_ShowCandidateList` does nothing lol
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, an event based api would be much more efficient anyway
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think they are planning to create a texture and rendering it in SDL.
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757952876285919232/unknown.png
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> on windows*
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hence the SetTextInputRect is a Rect instead of a Point. so they know the texture size. but again. they didn't do anything with it. (guess)
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 it looks like on windows 10 it doesnt work https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/ime-candidates-not-showing/25058/4
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on the IME, I think it's working on win10 for @TsFreddie üåà
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757953921716060401/unknown.png
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it isn't working for me
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> eki did a hack that just skip SDL's IME processing. don't know if you guys are still using that
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can still use the hack but less aggressive on windows
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> instead of skipping all IME handling in SDL. we can just let SDL tell windows not to use uiless mode for IME
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can position the IME window that way.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie üåà yes, we are
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> then the priority is fixing backspace
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can try to work on that again. i did it years before but it is broken and i don't know why
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also position the window would be nice
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757955479166255144/unknown.png
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It's rumored Microsoft will also buy SEGA and Atlus
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Tomorrow to be announced
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the entire sega?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm interested but why is this in #developer
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz i saw deen talk about microsoft buyin bethesda
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Where matricks works (?)
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok didnt know that
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @deen for windows' SDL2, can you find `SDL_windowskeyboard.c` and comment out line 373 and 881-883? (in ddnet-libs)
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757960061418078348/unknown.png
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757960133169905866/unknown.png
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also stop using `SDL_DISABLE_WINDOWS_IME`
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie üåà Note that we use SDL 2.0.8 on Win btw
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :wuhmm: let me find the code on 2.0.8 then
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can find it myself, just so you know
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, it was in the same spot, they didn't change anything in between
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with --enable-ime right?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie üåà There you go^
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> thx.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you need to test it or do you know it works already?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i need to write something in ddnet to work with it
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 merging https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2861 is fine, right? binary search doesn't really apply there, we search each word in question in the string
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757980614233423941/2020-09-22_16-02-42.mp4
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well doeditbox still doesn't work cuz it doesn't use clineinput directly
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh wait it doesn't need to be. my bad
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie üåà looks cool. Fullscreen will work too?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it will flash in fullscreen on windows 10
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> make windowed fullscreen the default? üòâ
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but at least it __might__ work. it was the same as the eki's hack in fullscreen.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> input lag city*
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, fullscreen is default because it has best performance
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2861 looks fine. I read it backwards I thought we were looking for each word of the msg in the list
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2861
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ what is `m_EntitiesIsLoaded[EntitiesModType + (int)EntitesAreMasked]`?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it now has 2 textures per mod
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> unmasked and masked
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should't it be `2*EntitiesModType + (int)EntitiesAreMasked`?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like this, don't `MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_FNG + true` overlap `MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_VANILLA` e.g.?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `IGraphics::CTextureHandle m_EntitiesTextures[MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_COUNT * 2][MAP_IMAGE_ENTITY_LAYER_TYPE_COUNT];
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats the member var now
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh sry
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `bool m_EntitiesIsLoaded[MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_COUNT * 2];`
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this üòÑ
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_FNG+true` is 6, but `MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_VANILLA+false` also is 6
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why isnt it 5?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_FNG` is 5, `MAP_IMAGE_MOD_TYPE_VANILLA` is 6
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean u are right yes
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u cancel bors
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i fix it
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it looked unrelated to this PR, which is why I merged it anyway. canceled
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah ok
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: see if this break something on linux
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i have no idea
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wait
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> why did some code disappeared.
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh i ssems clang-format breaks diff
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is hard to tell what changed.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what should i do.:saddog:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can use `python scripts/fix_style.py --base HEAD^` to only run clang-format on the changed lines
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok i'll try that
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but you already formatted the change
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you still have the original lying arund @TsFreddie üåà ?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can try ctrlz
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> might work.
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it worked
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~don't close editor ever~~
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 @deen I guess reformat the whole codebase
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the cons don't weigh up against the friction it creates
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh well i don't have clang-format actually install. it was vscode did the clang thing
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i need actual clang-format for fix_style to work right?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie üåà maybe don't format the PR until we sort this mess out? idk
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :wuhmm: sure
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can hold on to this.
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 with so many PRs open it's annoying, will have to resolve all the conflicts. We could wait until there are fewer PRs open
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> how about set an date for the shift. where for one day you don't accept any PR, and notice everyone before that to switch to the new base when it happens.
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~okay one day might be too short~~
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nah, not really required, fixing a few PRs is ok.
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> usually we don't have 20 open
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @abcqwerty ctrl+shift+q bind doesnt work when not on a server or when in Menu on a server pls fix
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> U
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> only function keys work on menu
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> since always
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> wat
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> i could rq with ctrl+shift+q
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> before
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ôÖ‚±ß‚Ç≥ƒê…Ü‚Ç¥‚ôÖ> No
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> anyway
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> yes
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ôÖ‚±ß‚Ç≥ƒê…Ü‚Ç¥‚ôÖ> Active hack bro
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> stfu
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ôÖ‚±ß‚Ç≥ƒê…Ü‚Ç¥‚ôÖ> This is command
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ôÖ‚±ß‚Ç≥ƒê…Ü‚Ç¥‚ôÖ> F4+shift
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ôÖ‚±ß‚Ç≥ƒê…Ü‚Ç¥‚ôÖ> Ch_mod_aimbot
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ôÖ‚±ß‚Ç≥ƒê…Ü‚Ç¥‚ôÖ> Active_teleport_gfx-780
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> how sad that the only key shortcut to exit the game is the standard one everyone knows
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> esc->q 
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> or f1->qi->tab->enter
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> oh nvm its f1->quit->enter
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> :/
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe show this button but only for a few releases then remove it so all the old players who want to skip menu can do so because it looks ugly
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758029589774860339/unknown.png
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @lola before ctrl shift q wasnt a bind
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's no reason to teach new players to hide the menu, it's just for old players who don't accept a change so they know how to go into settings and find it
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea the menu looks nice and it allows new players to easily change settings off the start
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 16:9 u wont notice it that hard xD
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 5:4 everything looks bad
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw the 4 links on left and bottom right version number i wish were in the corners
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758030851761111231/unknown.png
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or smth like thiss
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> puhh, thats too much taste discussion i think
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like it at the bottom, u like it in the mid
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen about RC could you please let people know about how much time they have. Will it be available in steam?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen about RC could you please let people know about how much time they have (next time maybe). Will it be available in steam?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rc i just nightly at a specific point of time
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea, would be nice to allow steam to update my game to RC
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> like to nightly builds but I dont like them. But RC is fine
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> this is how other games in steam pre-release testing works, as far as I know
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> all people test the same version and report bugs. But nightly is not stable tho
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay steam has even more changes with the nightly. I guess I could also add an RC channel on Steam
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it feels like already no one is using the nightlies
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen nightlies to me like "let steam use unstable DDNet version". But RC - "let steam use DDNet pre-releases".
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I guess there will be much more people who ready to go with second sentence.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> But I think the real problem is that none knows about betas in steam, but once they know they might discard nightlies.
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Another profit of RC is shorter time when people reporting the same bugs which makes search of already reported things less hard, as people might be lazy to search for bugs... as me...
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay added Release Candidates branch on Steam
