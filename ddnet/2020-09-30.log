00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> heylo
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> can someone tell me the difference between the following arrays in `CSnapState`?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> ```
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> m_paPlayerInfos[MAX_CLIENTS]
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> m_paInfoByScore[MAX_CLIENTS]
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> m_paInfoByName[MAX_CLIENTS]
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> m_paInfoByDDTeamScore[MAX_CLIENTS]
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> m_paInfoByDDTeamName[MAX_CLIENTS]
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> ```
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> they all seem to have the same contents...
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are ordered differently
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> `m_paPlayerInfos` is ordered by id, isn't it?
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think so
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add explain what this makes when i put mouse on any setting in settings
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> reason: so much settings i not know what it make
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for example? What is unclear?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add explain what this makes when i put mouse on any setting in settings
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> reason: so much settings i not know what it make most time
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like antiping limit
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> settings >ddnet
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> size
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> idk this for what relly
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that option is too confusing, shouldn't even be in settings
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 🤥
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway this just suggestion if do not have time this not necess
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Guys, have you maybe thought about https://support.discord.com/hc/pl/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server ?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we got declined
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ... why tho
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we dont meet their criteria
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> maybe except for #showroom not being NSFW
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which criteria isnt met
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they didnt say that xd
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If they said that, you could challenge their decision. They made it clear they don't want that
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> imo we have not enough members
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe something with the account of the server owner
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> try transfer ownership to me for testing
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It might be fair enough though, no one in the outside world knows about DDNet
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we had it with the account of server owner
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> xd
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meanwhile Teeworlds is well known, reviewed in game magazines, has a wikipedia article, etc
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> teeworlds is the origin
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://discord.gg/emzX6z
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At least if I was in Discord's position I would judge this based on what I find on a quick google search for the project
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but imo they would verify us if we had a lot more members
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> community server == verified server?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are way fewer people in this verified teeworlds server vs here
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but teeworlds is more known as deen said
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> flawed system
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> No, verified server is different from community server @noby
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen @jao Are you sure you're talking about **Community server** and not **Verified Server**?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 1. Community: https://support.discord.com/hc/pl/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 2. Verified: https://discord.com/verification
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> those are different terms with different perks for the server & different requirements
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whats the difference
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> read the first link
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tldr pls
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760800685922189332/Screenshot_2020-09-30-11-50-10-588_com.android.chrome.jpg
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we have that already
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> huh
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Teeworlds has it i.e with their announcements
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760800970555916288/Screenshot_2020-09-30-11-50-54-817_com.discord.jpg
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> you can easily notice by different channel image and the follow option
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats only able when ur verified
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> no, that's from plain community server
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760801219131211797/IMG_20200930_115209.jpg
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nope
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> when i set up community server it didnt let me make an announcement channel
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd assume Vanilla has both enabled
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760801573567463464/IMG_20200930_115343.jpg
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Community is listed here
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then tell me where it should be 🙂
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> update your discord xd
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> haha
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> new option under create channel
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and how do i turn an old channel into it
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or do u want us to delete #announcements
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760802270009884682/unknown.png
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> No, deleting it would suck
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :poggers:
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> You damn nobo
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it was community server all the time lol
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i told u we already have it
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xD
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> geez
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> see its useless
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> people dont even notice it
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760802899780829245/unknown.png
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only good thing is server insights when ur a big server i guess
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But you can use a custom background and have announcement channel shared to other servers. Which is nice.
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> custom background?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> On invites only
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server#:~:text=Requirements%20for%20Enabling%20Community,-In%20order%20to&text=Members%20of%20the%20server%20must,that%20have%20assigned%20roles!)
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Welcome Screen: 
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Set up a personalized welcome screen for new visitors of your server so they know what your community is about and where to start. This way, they can immediately head to the welcome and rules channels instead of wandering around lost.
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where can i change the background?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://support.discord.com/hc/pl/articles/360043913591-Public-Server-Welcome-Screen
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i didnt see anything about changing the background there
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao nobo they announced this new thing today
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with this i can add ddnet announcements to other discords
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao make map releases announcement too
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki nobo
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't anyone have some fancy silicon valley friends?
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe someone working at discord 👉 👈
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> What you wondering about?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @jao he meant this, but I'm too lazy to search how to

15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wow weird discord wont verify this server esp after its on steam and all
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Soreu stop being lazy! :rooEZSip:
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait huh u can make backgrounds for reg servers?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i thought you needed nitro boosts
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we have level 1 boost
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @louis for servers set as Community Server
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://discord.com/invite/22sqGcB
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh i found it

15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > did you guys just speedrun discord verification
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've just buyed a Nitro and boosted my server. You can change your invite background already as your server is level 1 too.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But you know that I think 😄
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the sun is on the wrong side
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it has to be right
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760854769354276934/unknown.png
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :troll:
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 haven't you fixed that 0.7 vote author issue yet? I want to investigate/fix it but if you have fixed already I will just pull your commit.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @jao use the pic with the players
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> players on right side on a good looking map
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> which one
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Multimap
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Best map
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> All players will recognize it
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> pls
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also you can kinda hack Community Server status: just embed text into that picture if you want to.
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> use this
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That's the CS status gives you I think: a page with text info on invites instead of just a background pic.

15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why are there stars
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Stars are ok. But I think that you should take a nice demo with more characters, find a right moment and crop it.
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760857950012833802/unknown.png

16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> First commit is an empty diff for your server as it contains only commits that already are on your master.
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a problem
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, I will just redo this.
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've thought that that's only github UI artefact as commit is empty for you.
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Because there is no differences.
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can just `git reset --hard ddnet/master` that branch then `git cherry-pick origin/master`
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In general, just keep your master in sync with ddnet/maste
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> master*
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just good practice
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, I will do it that way.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've wanted to try webUI 😄 but appearst that doing new things in console is still a safer way
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've wanted to try webUI 😄 but appears that doing new things in console is still a safer way
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> too bad there is no button to make git pull --ff from UI
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 updated
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you keep your master always in sync with ddnet/master you won't need --ff
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 @Pure_luck maybe u can also change pull to use rebase instead of merge
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `git config --global pull.rebase true`
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Merge makes that commit appear
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rebase is better
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe. Right now I am using a separate repository to apply changes. So it's easy to make it in sync of ddnet.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes, I use rebase to pull changes to my game repo from ddnet master usually.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But my game repo is private and as I think I cannot make PR to open repos from it so I've made a separate one just for this.
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So I just cherry-pick changes across local repos prior to pushing to a public repo fork.
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But nevermind honestly 😄
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks for an advice
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Learath2 im being told that this player has an invisible name with new clients
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760883314671747142/Screen_Shot_2020-09-30_at_10.18.10_AM.png
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if i paste the name its this: `　`
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so it makes sense that it would be invisible with fixed characters
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if the confusables system does anything to prevent invisible names can it be patched to include this
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another name we missed in the whitespace table I guess
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can it be added pls xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ty
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye it is invisible
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760884370507563048/Screen_Shot_2020-09-30_at_10.21.15_AM.png
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll have to check why we missed it
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i used the wikipedia list of whitespace-&-similar chars in unicode
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, we block that one, it is 0x3000
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> has the whitespace table been updated?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> where can i find the whitespace table :x
17:26 <+ChillerDragon>              
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby is that on your server? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2656
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohhhh
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no it wasnt
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thanks
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just added it 😄
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen it didnt work to just copy that function 1:1 lol
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are there more commits that this needs
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby yeah, it has to be used in some places. old commits though
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> confirmed that it works on ddnet server. just check where the function is used, especially with player name
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok thx ill check

21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally one of these massive self hosted giants moved over to github, maybe the rest will follow
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't even care that they hosted it themselves if only all of them didn't use that god awful gitweb thing
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they also used mercurial
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
