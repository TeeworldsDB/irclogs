09:45 < WolfAlex> EastByte: deen is there a tile that blocks grenades/lasers?
10:00 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: not sure
10:01 <@EastByte> you can teleport them away
10:02 < WolfAlex> ah
12:16 < Smegma> Hey fstd_ are you here
12:17  * Smegma slaps fstd around a bit with a large fishbot
12:17 < Smegma> well i was testing out your old tournament mod and it was working fine to start off with but then it started putting players in matches with themself?
12:17 < Smegma> maybe its because players left but the game still thinks they are here?
12:18 < Smegma> also the teleports are a bit bugged
12:18 < Smegma> when players get teleported they still have velocity which can cause them to teleport through walls some times
12:19 < Smegma> and my map has 10 spawns but it spawns all the tees in the same tile
12:21 < Smegma> thank you for reading this
12:24 < fstd> Smegma: ttyl, busy
13:36 < FlushA> Hello
