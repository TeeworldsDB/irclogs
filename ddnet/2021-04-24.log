00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i caught this in time
00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ldjam.com/
00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i probs wont do anything tho
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i always catch this after 2 days it started
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> @Ryozuki when win this
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sucks that it starts at 3 am
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such an american time
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> do u have to start working on your project at 3 am?
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> i though its just when event starts
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well no
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can start before
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Youâ€™re free to start with any base-code you may have."
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but whats the point
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing about this is to make a game in 72 hours
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> .-. seems like not really a jam then
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn it is a jam
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this is more to not limit ppl
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nono i meran
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nono i mean
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also most jams are like t his
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> the fact they allow starting code
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ah
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant rly forbid this
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody knows if u made this code before or not
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah true
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it's more about being true to urself i guess
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ahh
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
00:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a jam/compo
00:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the jam u can use code before
00:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the compo is alone and all from scratch
00:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/835285984752435211/unknown.png
00:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> neat
15:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> Hey, is it possible to add a server setting to disable weak hook? Would be awesome to see this as an option for trashmap, since a lot of gores mappers rely on it as well.
15:47 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> fddrace has it @mind
15:47 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> maybe u can convice timakro  to add fddrace to trashmap
15:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 know where https://info2.ddnet.tw/info?name=heinrich5991 is generated? I'd like to add location info
15:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should be a script on ddnet.tw
15:51 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> in some secret python script thats closed src
15:51 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> !!!! grrr
15:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You sure? It should be part of either ddnet-web or ddnet-scripts
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, if you canâ€™t find it just check /etc/nginx
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like this script: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/5e492c82fed522062d538153440ba5939c06b043/servers/scripts/info.py
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (very closed source!)
15:52 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> aaaa
15:52 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> at least its python^^
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure if we run this exact version btw, ddnet-scripts can get outdated often
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 so I just edit it on ddnet.tw and hope for the best? ðŸ˜›
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
15:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> heinrich go fix ddnet infrastructure
15:55 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> make a proper secrets sub repo and a live synced scripts repo
16:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently doing https masters, takes enough time, thanks ðŸ˜‰
16:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh thats very good
16:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> prio https master
16:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> heinrich5991:  btw i was told nodes has a working https master if that is of any help https://github.com/teeworldsnetwork/nodes
16:05 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> seems like the master it self is not public but client and server code
16:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the code is mostly done, I'm in the finishing touches
16:05 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Oh wow!
16:05 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> very cool
16:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can test it here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772
16:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> is it 0.7 or 0.6 ?
16:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> will it be for ddnet only or any plans of getting it into tw?
16:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wrote it for ddnet
16:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd extend it to 0.7 servers if ddnet gained support for connecting to them
16:07 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i see
16:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not considering porting it to teeworlds 0.7, it would be too much work, given that I was explicitly disallowed using C++11
16:07 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yikes
16:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so a masterserver fork
16:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if someone is willing to port the client part to 0.7, it can start working there too
16:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's not going to be me (I might reconsider if they'd allow some more recent version of C++)
16:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wait can i then use a simple curl command to get server info?
16:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> that is so cool
16:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> thanks for doing this :)
16:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> exciting times to be alive
16:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm glad you like it ðŸ™‚
16:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can fetch the current server info right now ðŸ˜‰ it's live at https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/servers.json
16:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh wow
16:12 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so stuff like cloudflare can be used to ddos protect masters huh?
16:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, I'm not so sure anymore that info2.ddnet.tw is hosted on ddnet.tw
16:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 nginx config says it forwards it to 127.0.0.1:9002, but netstat doesn't show anything listening on that port
16:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you netstat as root?
16:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> root doesn't show anything on 9002 either
16:33 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> real hackers use ngrep and do a request
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ curl -I 'http://127.0.0.1/info?name=heinrich5991' -H "Host: info2.ddnet.tw"
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen do you know where info2.ddnet.tw is hosted?
17:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ah I think I do
17:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> as I thought, this is indeed out of date
17:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know how I can reload this uwsgi? ^^
17:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Is teehistorian still useful in a pvp mod? Like compare to mods I guess. I'm assuming it is designed for run verification.
17:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> compare to demos*
17:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie I'd say it's only useful for stuff like cheat detection afterwards
17:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Got it. Thanks.
17:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does the location key say for you @TsFreddie https://info2.ddnet.tw/info?name=heinrich5991
17:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> `as:cn`
17:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice ðŸ™‚
17:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~is Singapore `ass g` then~~
17:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, singapore is as
17:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, singapore is `as`
17:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> af, as, as:cn, eu, na, oc, sa
17:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Oh
17:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
18:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Ok another question, would `DM|TDM|CTF` be considered spoofing standard game type? Like literally with the three together as one game type name.
18:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK only the exact strings "0", "1", "2", "CTF", "TDM", "DM" are reserved
18:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know which question comes next ðŸ˜›
18:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
18:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "0", "1", "2" are compatibility, they're replaced with "DM" etc.
18:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by the client
18:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Oh that's not what my second question would be
18:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Anyway, we might be setting up a server with all standard game types with ddnet's team support next week. Like each team is a game instance and you can have different game types for each team.
18:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uh oh, nice ðŸ˜„
18:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Just making sure what would be acceptable to call it
18:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shotgun shoots lasers though?
18:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> They should bullets
18:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Shoot*
18:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> But I did keep most ddnet things, and I (might) make some extra tiles for toggling ddnet laser and shotguns. Just in case some mappers get creative I guess.

23:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 still need help to reload uwsgi
23:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ?
23:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I killed it and started it from the history
23:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, that's how I do it too
23:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> It's running on db.ddnet.tw btw, but I guess your figures out
23:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Since the ddnet.tw main server can have high latency while regenerating /ranks/
23:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah ðŸ™‚
23:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I already deployed the change
23:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and I have it on my backlog to make us use ddnet-scripts live (but not ddnet-maps because of tournament map leakage), but it's some work and I'm busy with other stuff
