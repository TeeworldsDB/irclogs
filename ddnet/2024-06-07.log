00:17 < zombietoad> @Learath2
00:17 < bridge> <learath2> you'll have to wait until the mod who banned you for botting gets back, which will be tomorrow, which is when your ban expires anyway, try not to bot in the future

11:36 <+bridge> <avolicious> Even my appartment in zurich was cheaper compared to 910 EUR for 72qm
11:36 <+bridge> <avolicious> What type of appartment is it? Private?
11:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its thanks to airbnb
11:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i live alone there
11:36 <+bridge> <meloƞ> you live in an airbnb by rent?
11:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if u mean that by private
11:37 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i always thought airbnb's are like privately hosted houses/apartments for people on vacation
11:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
11:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i mean airbnb makes rent go up
11:37 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ah
11:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tourists pay more
11:38 <+bridge> <meloƞ> glad that i right below munich's butt - rent is cheap and it takes me 45 minutes if i wanted to enter munich
11:38 <+bridge> <meloƞ> glad that i live right below munich's butt - rent is cheap and it takes me 45 minutes if i wanted to enter munich
11:38 <+bridge> <avolicious> in austria there are different types of rentals, like government funded, cooperative or private
11:39 <+bridge> <avolicious> in austria there are different types of rentals, like partly government funded, cooperative or private
11:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah i guess its private
11:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk about that here
11:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but with my salary i dont get gov help xdd
11:40 <+bridge> <avolicious> I was looking for something in Bogenhausen, Munich
11:40 <+bridge> <avolicious> In austria you'll get gov help even with high salary, but you have to life in there already, or take over from family members 😄
11:41 <+bridge> <meloƞ> nice place - well centered as well iirc - good to go shopping :D
11:42 <+bridge> <avolicious> Sadly I am not very often in Munich, so I would do airbnb and the few weeks i am there, I would "rent" it myself
11:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <a:yep:1232334814447669268> <a:nope:1232334761624866816>
11:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @avolicious how is rust going at work
11:43 <+bridge> <avolicious> Good so far 😄
11:43 <+bridge> <avolicious> We completely moved a microservice from java to rust
11:44 <+bridge> <avolicious> its in production already, compared to java - 0 downtime so far
11:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what kind of microservice? why was it rewritten?
11:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> did u measure ram usage too?
11:45 <+bridge> <avolicious> Payment gateway, mostly because of high amount of transactions 🙂
11:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and cpu time
11:45 <+bridge> <avolicious> We considered https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum and https://rocket.rs/
11:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer axum
11:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my services use it
11:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rocket rs guy comes and goes away for years
11:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> RAM should be straight up better than the java service. has a large memory overhead
11:47 <+bridge> <avolicious> The APL team knows for sure, but afaik its more stable now. Atleast we have 100% uptime for the past few weeks now
11:47 <+bridge> <avolicious> not a single transaction failed so far
11:48 <+bridge> <avolicious> We are speaking about a few million transactions a day
11:48 <+bridge> <meloƞ> axum is goated
11:48 <+bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1248574384738664529/image.png?ex=66642902&is=6662d782&hm=9be25d229e3172b518cd22d687d46255bac1e13f4992f5923e896754ee3fa0cd&
11:48 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i use it all the time
11:50 <+bridge> <avolicious> Its pretty straightforward and regularly updated
11:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/asleep-steve-ballmer-yes-meme-microsoft-gif-18627126
11:51 <+bridge> <avolicious> Some teams already tried https://ziglang.org/ 😄
11:51 <+bridge> <avolicious> It also looks kinda fun
11:52 <+bridge> <meloƞ> zigs documentation is pretty good - i didnt try it out all that much yet
11:53 <+bridge> <avolicious> its also quite fast
11:53 <+bridge> <avolicious> For the JS/TS people in here: https://bun.sh/
11:53 <+bridge> <avolicious> this is the modern nodejs
11:53 <+bridge> <avolicious> written in zig
11:53 <+bridge> <avolicious> 😄
11:58 <+bridge> <avolicious> I will open source the new rebuilt IP Intel API from KoG, written in rustlang, with axum and and diesel[postgres] 😄
11:58 <+bridge> <avolicious> My first diesel typed ORM project

12:00 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> He she it das s muss mit
12:00 <+bridge> <meloƞ> He she it bei rust spiel ich mit
12:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> unsafe tho and less ecosystem
12:01 <+bridge> <avolicious> I was already looking into, it was looking promising for real, but I dont have a good use-case for it
12:01 <+bridge> <avolicious> For teehistorian data I am currently looking into https://www.scylladb.com/
12:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> best db is ext4 kappa
12:02 <+bridge> <avolicious> Want to move the raw data from minio to scylladb
12:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> he she it ich hab in den ford fokus gekaggert
