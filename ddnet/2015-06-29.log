00:47 < Savander> but

00:48 <@deen> Nazar: what do you mean? added to what?
00:48 < Savander> it'll look like "omg, you're famous, record it for me ! please!"

00:50 < Nazar> tommorow i will add with 3 friends +1000
00:50 <@deen> do the right thing, inform the hosters that the servers are vulnerable and how to fix it
00:51 < Nazar> deen, try to contact them, the hosters knows, the hoster are extra for this
00:51 < Nazar> ;)
00:52 < Nazar> but lsn
00:52 <@deen> eeh, then don't attack anyone I guess
00:52 < Nazar> i dont need to attack ur ddnet
00:52 < Nazar> this botnet i dont make to attack a game server :'D!
00:52 < Nazar> i maybe quit teeworlds
00:52 < Learath2> overthrowing governments ?
00:53 <@deen> i don't think it's anything worth bragging about, ddos attacks are never the right tool
00:53 <@deen> except to annoy the NSA maybe
00:53 < Nazar> lol
00:53 < Learath2> or to overthrow governments !!
00:53 < Learath2> think about it you could rule an entire country on your own
00:53 < Nazar> i called nsa with a hacked skype account, they blocked my number after 3 sec
00:53 < Nazar> :D
00:54 <@deen> best start with ddosing them now
00:54 <@deen> as revenge
00:54 < Nazar> but deen, dont worry, i wont attack u
00:54 <@deen> thanks, i guess
00:54 < Learath2> or ddos gaben for bad price on games
00:55 < Learath2> steam summer ripoff
00:55 < Nazar> deen, u got enemy server?
00:55 < Nazar> :D
00:55 <@deen> Nazar: nope, i try to be on friendly terms with everyone
00:55 < Nazar> hahaha
00:55 < Nazar> when i got tommorow my +1000 bots
00:55 < Nazar> i go trolling teamspeak server
00:55 < Nazar> _:D
00:56 < Nazar> so
00:56 < Learath2> mine bitcoin with them invest in wallstreet profit
00:57 <@deen> best bitcoin miners are the ones running on smartphones
00:58 < Learath2> utorrent development team embedded a bitcoin miner in it ran it for months on millions of computers
00:58 < Learath2> and then they said they had no idea how it got into there
00:58 < Nazar> wait i will come back, i have to start my bots
00:58 <@deen> what a convenient accident
00:59 <@deen> and then they probably had no idea how a few million dollars landed on their bank accounts
00:59 < Learath2> :D
00:59 < Learath2> and they didnt even make utorrent ad free
01:00 <@deen> might have been one of their employees who snuck it in
01:00 <@deen> that also happened with a few supercomputers that mined bitcoins at night :P
01:00 <@deen> sigh, he's attacking GER again
01:01 < Learath2> i should thread more carefully around him
01:01 <@deen> strange person indeed
01:01 < Learath2> hetzner doesnt like ddos much
01:02 < Learath2> he is probably listening in here some how 
01:02 < Learath2> Hi Nazar stop it pls its not funny
