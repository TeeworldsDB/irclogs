20:11 < pinkieval> hi
20:13 < pinkieval> I recently switched from vanilla teeworlds client to ddnet, and I noticed DDNet uses much more CPU. I suspect this is caused by the multithreaded rendering, that is always on in DDNet (code for monothread has been removed)
20:13 < pinkieval> I tried to bring back the monothread code, but it's a pain. Any suggestions?
