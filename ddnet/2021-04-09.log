03:16 <+fokkonaut> ChillerDragon: hey
03:16 <+fokkonaut> please read Wire
04:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> Please dear developers, remove /swap command forever, it just destroy the game. Effort will no longer mean anything, every time a player could not do something, he will just swap and his rank won't have any sense. I know we could do it with /save, but it was more tedious and not motivating because you had to stop playing. Now /swap is literally an exploit of it that I can't understand how it came from the developers themselves. Think about
07:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @sorgaxD  deen literaly made tutorial how to abuse timeout protection to give someone else your tee.
07:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think its too bad
09:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc swap has the same delay as save load
09:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also anyone can finish with your name, that already makes ur rank not have "any" sense right?
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a bit stupid argument tbh
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just so you know

09:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> one of the most discussed pull requests
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> swap can be planed tho. You don't actually have to wait. You just type it 30 seconds in advance
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but you still get 60 seconds added to your time, so it doesn't help for speedrunning
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes. I just want to make sure nobody calls arguments stupid without all side effects
10:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the stupid part was for the rank having sense or not
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh ok
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Swap as it is right now is really supposed to be a drop in replacement for the save/load swap being only a little more convenient. At the end of the day we have no way of preventing save/load swaps so removing swap doesnt change anything
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who doesnt love long types :FeelsGoodMan:
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830027079915405352/unknown.png
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we just remove swap and give it another go later? There seems to be more wrong with it from what I see in #general
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Time mismatches can be very bad
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> how can be there time mismatch in team
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well technically everyone still has their own time
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Huh
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> max_age looks curious xd
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> week for cookie?
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just testing tho
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> professional web-rust-ryo-programmer
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ‚òï
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> I don‚Äôt know either but i swear that i had like idk 14min50 and Blurry 16min50 on destiny 2
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> We thought we wouldn‚Äôt have the r1
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> But we had 15.50
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> We didn‚Äôt understand at all
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> And we did 3 tee swaps or smth with different players
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> I guess it changed the time for one player and not for the others
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> But then you don‚Äôt really know which time you are gonna get
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fluday> Didn‚Äôt notice on the other ranks though
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows rly sux, i have a "old" 1tb HDD where i keep stuff like anime, so since i play some win only games on windows and sometimes i wanted to watch anime I shared this drive with windows, i had it formatted with btrfs and installed a btrfs driver on windows, but for some reason (after some days) windows programs started freezing like crazy, and after removing the drive it was fixed, but on linux this drive works flawlessly
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux win
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think u mixed them up
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt mix anything bro
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know my setup
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you would get along well with my dad. he even put pinguin stickers on his windows key and back side monitorü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yeah yeah windows comes preinstalled with bloatware but at least it isnt preinstalled with 50 bugs u have to find a fix for on some obscure stackexchange page
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux also doesnt come with bugs
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :PepeLaugh: nice one
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> god u are dumb af
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a missing driver is not a bug btw
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u just dont know how to install/find them
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is it that im perfectly fine on linux?
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always have problems on winshit
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ye teeworlds doesnt have bugs u just need to know how to code a fix for them
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> will linux ever be able to emulate windows except without the "bad" ?
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wanna know if i can implement this on ddnet https://unixism.net/loti/index.html
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a good linux-only feature for ddnet
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> linux is good cus u can do so much customization without it being hidden under 500 ui-friendly useless "troubleshooters" but its so annoying cuz 50% of the stuff u expect to work requires like 50 commands
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux has it hard because companies don't want to make drivers like they do on windows, so linux relies mostly on people reverse engineering the windows drivers to know how it works and implement it on linux
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows has positive feedback loop
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more users
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> =
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better drivers
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> =
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more company interest
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> = better drivers
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah i get that windows has many downsides but they are not so bad that i want to learn how to use linux.
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly, if u all u do is search the browser and play ddnet you can do it on linux and don't really need to know much
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> would be epic if one day you can just switch with the upsides of both systems
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your biggest barrier is probably installing linux on your machine
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another downside, since most computers come with windows installed
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think installing linux is easy
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but getting ur setup how u want it is harder
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is linux big? why not install both
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even installing windows is hard for ur average joe
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they know shit
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they donth ave to install windows
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since it comes preinstalled
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux is way smaller in size than windows
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows takes 100gb typically
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ya u can dual boot linux
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ubuntu e.g needs just 8gb
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and you are done
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but idk why u would do that
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do that
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ye u forgot the other 92 gb of drivers that dont come installed
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> still too much to preinstall both on retail pcs
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis ur real dumb mman
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not 92gb of drivers
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :kek:
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 92gb of telemetry
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ya ik its joke
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but u cant compare 8gb vs 100gb its more like 20gb vs 100gb
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> if u want the same stuff
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> 20gb is an estimate idk what i'm talking about
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 8gb
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with arch its even elss
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> less
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never really tried a userfriendly linux, but i guess it always has the potential to be better than windows, someone just needs to get a easy gui)
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i installed ubuntu for a person(that really isnt good with computers), just told him how to open browser and telegramm, and he can use it
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830087164091826176/unknown.png
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yeah but windows comes with preinstalled stuff that you usually install
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830087198434656276/unknown.png
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arch is 2gb
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> like the first thing i did on linux was install a bunch of crap that doesn't come with it
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because installing stuff on linux is way too easy
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can update everything in 1 command
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont have to go through installers
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ye the thing i dont like is theres 50 different ways to install one thing
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can literally make a script to replicate my setup on a new computer
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i can have it done after taking my coffee watching someting on the tv
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i can literaly see myself accidentaly delete everything if i ever use linux
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh depends on the linux you are using but my gentoo installation is way below 20G out of the box with all drivers and essential programs, while a w7 installation is around 90G with all the patches. W10 is nicer at around 30G
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> best plus for linux is: it performs better
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i get more fps in emulators and ddnet
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> at least windows knows im dumb:greenthing:
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all i need to survive xd
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if triple A games were available on linux natively
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ubuntu is the linux for dum ppl. So if you want to give it a try try that
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would uninstall windows asap
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It protects you from yourself pretty well
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i google "how install <insert program here>" and theres some nerd on stackexchange telling me to compile 50 zips and change 20 system commands to install it when i could just do `sudo apt-install program`
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im sure AAA games on linux would outperform the windows ones
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some do even under proton, which surprised me aaaalot
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think i used ubuntu once...  all i remember is i click teeworlds pictrure but teeworlds dont start :((
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is always a graphical version of the package manager
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> haha yeah, u really need to use ubuntus package installer then, its relativly easy to use
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can search stuff there
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but honestly
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> well im on zorin
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why windows users are scared of the terminal
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the real usage of a pc
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it was 10 years ago, I see I had the same experience. But gnome is fairly streamlined now
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> the software store on zorin is outdated or smth
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it gives u power
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> could be 10 years ago.
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think its just uniniuitive to work with text üòÑ
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> For us, maybe, for users its kind of a shit ux ngl
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i can see why they would be scared of POWERSHELL BECAUSE IT SUCKS
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Get-CMD HAYSDHBASUYFDIASTYUVFYTUDSAB
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ugly af
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The reason this kind of gui took off is because its extremely pretty and easy to use
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but be honest, did you ever use a terminal in your first OS?
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i came accross it when i first installed like a minecraft server or smth xD
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the first time I encountered it was working with network problems
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://pop.system76.com/
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> become a gamer
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ipconfig /all
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> gonna make louisOS
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> use templeos
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> üôè
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> tbh templeos > linsux
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yea
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If any of you are looking to give linux a go, it's really in its prime time now. Excellent support for games, pretty uis, out of the box drivers
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first freebsd install I had took me 12 hours trying to compile an experimental driver for my gpu
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe when i have better internet bcs i cant see myslef redownload 100 games at once
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that's a pain indeed
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> linux for gaming argument doesnt make sense
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but i can see why ud install it for performance
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> well im on it right now cause its a laptop i use for school
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> my dad switched bcs his laptop got slow and he got like 5 more years out of it... not much of a gamer tho
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not? It's already better in every other aspect and now it can game just as well as windows
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only thing is that we dont get day0 drivers
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> not in my experience tbh
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do u think linux doesnt work for gaming
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux outperforms windows
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> never said it doesnt work i just think windows is better
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u dont have to install separate programs to run them
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But when was your experience? Proton is like last 3 years
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "separate programs "
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so when i have linux all set up with all drivers and whatever. i can go to steam and play every game like normal?
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i install windows i install firefox
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Steam with proton runs any game just fine for the last year or teo
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i have to go through the installer
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what that means
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> well not all my games are on steam
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and it emulates windows so i dont need to look out for linux versions specificly?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cool
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has a translator for directx that goes directly to vulkan and it sometimes even outperforms directx because dx9 is ancient
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even got aoe2 working out of the box, aoe2 is as old as me nearly
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dark Souls 3 siO says he gets better performance on linux with proton than on windows
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll test a new kernel soon with some filesystem patches that makes proton blazing fast with loading
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> welp i havent tested many games but in a lot of cases windows outperformed for me
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> maybe i have the wrong settings but
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Supposed to be faster than windows because windows does some very weird io stuff with exclusive access)
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said when did you test?
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> idk year ago or a bit more
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> oh funny story i tried teeworlds and got like 5x fps but that was just cause i had viruses on my old windows setup xd
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new games should all use vulkan and then they will have 0 excuse for making a linux version
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> These are very very recent developments but even a year ago I had proton running at a very decent fps. Though I have a beast of a gpu, so I already get way more than enough frames
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe weaker computers do struggle
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Valve likes Linux btw
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve best
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> they should make games
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ye wtf valve. Portal 3 quicc
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i would kill for portal3
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is all the games that i can play on linux
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830091130670547004/unknown.png
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of my total on steam
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only reason I keep windows around is VR
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 521 games
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> VR sadly is shit on linux
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw you can play much more if you allow untested titles too. Sometimes I need to go in with protontricks and add an extra package or too but it runs almost anything now
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830091483091828836/unknown.png
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its already like this bro
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can play 521 out of 687
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its p good
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, why not all 687?
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh new proton versions
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> are that only the games that run on proton?
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should i switch to proton 6
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. are native games in that list? üòÑ
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> well i only play teeworlds so its not like it matters. but DAWs on linux were surprisingly lacking which is why i switched back
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish oculus cared about linux :k
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> DAW? That's one acronym I'm not familiar with
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830091885808451614/unknown.png
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess cuz this
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah looks like it
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> digital audio workstation
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah. That linux lacks in indeed
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can't play The Talos Principle on linux
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'd really like to
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it works for other people
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the native version
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently the native version üòÆ
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can force proton
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it downloads the windows version üòÑ
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll try. thanks for the idea
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 tried debugging?
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a bit
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had a permission issue with a game of mine
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like reading the logs and googling error messages
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't literally use a debugger
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mesa21 fixes alot of stuff, if its gpu related xd

17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh rip
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pressing cancel seems to work
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it uses dxvk, you could still try PROTON_USE_WINED3D11=1 when starting steam
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if it works, nice xd
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, changing to fullscreen doesn't work, neither via window manager nor via ingame menu
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both crashes the game
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both crash the game
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, now that I changed it via the ingame menu, I can't start the game anymore, I guess I'll dig in some config files ^^
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> Yes, i'm totally agree with it, that's why i don't like when players change their names to give finishes to players who doesn't even died in the run. I play legally for points, and there are more people that play like that. But now I present you a real situation of a gameplay, in which there'es only 1 tee alive, and need to do a hard part. The most strategic thing would be /swap with the most pro player of the team, but would it be the cor
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> The argument of timeout and save swaps needs to be carefully analyzed, because I ask you, how many save/timeout swaps you do in a regular gameplay? Maybe 1 in 20 gameplays, but now with /swap it will happen like 3 times per gameplay. I think you are whatching it from a point of view of what can i player do from before or not, but not from what gameplay impact it will have.
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> It actually changes a lot ‚Üë‚Üë
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ thanks, that fixed it ‚ù§Ô∏è
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I got a steam playtime of 3.6 hours, now my first actual minute begins üòâ
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean in the two weeks since its release only a handful ever used it, mostly to cheat or try cheat
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> most people don't know some really new features, i still find people that didn't know /practice exist xD
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> others may not be used to it, and others may be against it.

17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> If you do a command, and don't limit its use, you must be prepared to people abusing it, not expect that in the best of cases it will be "little used"
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830109201593401404/unknown.png
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://youtu.be/rtwC3ZjoGRA?t=155 how it should look like
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I tried lowering the graphics settings and using vulkan instead of d3d11
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ideas? üòÑ
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh, the wine renderer is a bit buggy xD
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u use the env flag?
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or does it run on dxvk
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, without the env flag it didn't work
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, sadly i have minor issues with dx9 games too without dxvk
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess you can only try to upgrade the vulkan driver and hope its just some missing vulkan extension or smth that was blocking it from working with dxvk
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or maybe the native even works then
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> omg, now hte native executable works üò¶
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üôÇ
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then lets hope its not outdated xD
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hte
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> You need to look at the /swap command with a wider perspective. Obviously it wont affect you as much. You will get players who want to try something new, different and more challenging. Swap is convenient and would still allow them to try parts, learn from more complex parts and overall make them a better player. Any feature you implement will always have attempted abuse, cant pin that on 1 feature that sorts positive change and better play
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830129323901845504/unknown.png
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> By the sounds of it, what you need is Accounts. Not removing the /swap feature.
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Teeson> Hello !
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Teeson> I have warnings about textures not divisible by 8 or 4 when I start DDNet
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Teeson> Where can i find them to get rid of those warnings?
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> fix/delete the files
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> theres also a command to ignore them
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think its `dbg_gfx 0`? idk
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> its removed
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Teeson> @louis I don't know where are those files and `dbg_gfx 0` doesn't remove the warnings
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the warning tells you the name of the file
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hope you know where you installed random files from the internet xd
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> usually you put them into the skin directory that is accessable from the tee settings menu inside the client
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Teeson> Ok, I found them, thank you @Jupstar ‚ú™ !
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> yo deen i have some trouble getting https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-live to run. Do you mind giving some support? What os were you on? Any display manager or window server you recommend using?
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> ./run.sh give me currently these errors https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/zW
22:28 <@deen> arch linux, X11, no window manager

23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Rust‚Äôs code generation on the latest version of LLVM is far superior compared to an equivalent Clang version using std::clamp, even though they use the same underlying IR"
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, how did they get clamp so weird in c++ even wtf
