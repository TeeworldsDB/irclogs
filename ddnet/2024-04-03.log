09:13 < bridge> <teero777> are there any compression algos present in the ddnet codebase?
09:13 < bridge> <teero777> eh ok zlib is there
09:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can try to use xz 5.6.1 :santatrollet:
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> this looks much sexier

09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> zlib is goated
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
10:02 < bridge> <0xdeen> You can also build with the system zlib though
10:02 < bridge> <0xdeen> We just add a bunch of libs for convenience
10:03 < bridge> <teero777> i just didnt want to change anything big like including another lib for compression.
10:03 < bridge> <teero777> zlib works fine üëç

13:57 < bridge> <scrumplex> it doesnt like my phone's hotspot :/
13:57 < bridge> <scrumplex> Edit: got it working now
13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> how to fix github design https://tonsky.me/blog/github-redesign/
13:59 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github
13:59 < bridge> <scrumplex> 
13:59 < bridge> <scrumplex> this browser extension is great and makes using GitHub more pleasant overall
13:59 < bridge> <AssassinTee> My ddnet crashes, I have got a crashlog, where do I put it?
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> yee but the problem here is not just devs
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> when u present a repo to a user it should show it more friendly maybe
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> the article kind of discusses that
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1225052351422005259/210_compare.png?ex=661fb9e8&is=660d44e8&hm=9949b9becb5f85fd231bb15ed771669f8fbbbf88e8aa2cd49151fddf168f6c6f&
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> their idea
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> is the right one
14:02 < bridge> <AssassinTee> `DDNet.exe caused an Access Violation at location 00007FFC0D2C25FD in module nvoglv64.dll Reading from location 0000000000000008.` hmpf, looks like an nvidia issue?
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> segfault in windows terms
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> use rust üò¨
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say maybe ddnet managed to crash ur gpu driver idk
14:03 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how do I switch to opengl in config? According to some forums this is vulkan related
14:04 < bridge> <AssassinTee> interestingly I didn't change anything, I just restarted the game oO
14:20 < bridge> <scrumplex> fair. For Prism Launcher we decided to never share direct links to the repo to normal users, but always share links to out website or GitHub releases
14:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> even github releases is confusing for some ppl
14:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1712146870_Eshah4.png
14:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> This was our last release post
14:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> and we link to our own website for downloads, our own blog post about the release and also the GH release
14:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> but most people are probably gonna gravitate towards the "Downloads" link
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think they should let u do a nice release page
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> with a big green download button
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then the sources smaller
14:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> but what about releases that have many many artifacts?
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont wanna make a web for every project xd
14:22 < bridge> <scrumplex> github pages exist :D
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i mean highlight the binary ones or the ones meant for normies
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but it requires quite effort, i meant a quick release page thats almost automated
14:23 < bridge> <scrumplex> yeah but even then, there might be files that are not really relevant for end users
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> just improve the UI on release page

14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:24 < bridge> <scrumplex> good luck picking the right one xD
14:24 < bridge> <scrumplex> the .AppImage.zsync shouldn't be relevant for users, also the the tar.gz at the top which is a vendored tarball
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ed-lang.org/
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
14:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> I think you could try to fix the situation yourself by adding big fat download links to the release description
14:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> That way you have control over what is emphasized and what isn't
14:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> not ideal obviously, but if you have a long release post anyway it should work fine enough
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> u havent seen llvm
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-18.1.2
14:26 < bridge> <scrumplex> the .AppImage.zsync shouldn't be relevant for users, also the the tar.gz at the top which is a vendored source tarball

14:27 < bridge> <scrumplex> i remember some rust project that had binaries for every platform under the sun
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> when rewrite prism in rust
14:27 < bridge> <scrumplex> one day
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> then ill become contributor
14:27 < bridge> <scrumplex> hopefully
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and be nitpicky
14:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
14:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @scrumplex u use qt right
14:28 < bridge> <scrumplex> i actually looked into https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt for Prism Launcher but didnt have time to implement the toolchain
14:29 < bridge> <scrumplex> i actually looked into https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt for Prism Launcher but didnt have time to implement it in our build system
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @scrumplex i noticed i have prism via flatpak
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont have it on gentoo guru right
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can make it happen
14:29 < bridge> <scrumplex> we do have a gentoo package!
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> where
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not in guru or gentoo
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "prism".
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> emerge: searching for similar names...
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> emerge: Maybe you meant any of these: dev-ruby/prime, kde-frameworks/prison, sci-biology/prints?
14:30 < bridge> <scrumplex> games i think
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is games?

14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> its there
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok cya stupid flatpak
14:31 < bridge> <scrumplex> lol
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> source builds are holier

14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> how fast u compile prism?
14:32 < bridge> <scrumplex> if i had to gues i would say 1-2 minutes
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> lto?

14:34 < bridge> <scrumplex> im not sure if nix tooling enables LTO by default, but it's CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release and a few hardening c/cxxflags
14:35 < bridge> <scrumplex> took me 2min
14:35 < bridge> <scrumplex> got a 5800X3D here
14:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> I don't like the 7900X3D
14:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> unless the kernel does its scheduling well for games
14:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> unless the kernel does its scheduling better than Windows for that CPU
14:42 < bridge> <scrumplex> sounds like you are wasting a lot of power
14:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> im bottlenecking with a full HD monitor atm
14:42 < bridge> <scrumplex> I limit my DDNet to 150 fps, with freesync it's low latency either way
14:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> im bottlenecking with a full HD monitor atm anyway
14:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> Running your FPS unlocked just makes hardware work much harder and therefore draws significantly more power
14:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> Running with your FPS unlocked just makes hardware work much harder and therefore draws significantly more power
14:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> Running with your FPS unlocked just makes your hardware work much harder and therefore draws significantly more power
14:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh im obviously not running it on 0 the entire time - i usually limit it to 240
14:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> you better >:(
14:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> i couldnt handle the coil whine
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> i couldnt handle the coil whining
14:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> that too
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> only issue i have with AMD atm
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> when im not wearing headphones it can get pretty bad when under lots of load
14:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> what GPU do you have?
14:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> like what board barnet
14:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> like what board partner
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> 7900 XTX
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> hellhound
14:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> I can assure you that the GPU chip itself is not the reason xD
14:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> happily enough im not stressing my PC to the point that it gets annoying
14:46 < bridge> <scrumplex> hmm i dont think that model is specifically known for it
14:46 < bridge> <scrumplex> i mean modern high end cards just have to live with it ig
14:46 < bridge> <scrumplex> it's also different from card to card
14:46 < bridge> <scrumplex> it's also different from card to card (even with the same model)
14:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah i read that aswell - but tbf i dont mind as long as it doesnt cause tinnitus ¬∞-¬∞
14:47 < bridge> <scrumplex> just wear headphones :troll:
14:48 < bridge> <scrumplex> (mfw i have open back headphones and i can still hear the whine)
14:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:  i had some open over ear's aswell, you get crazy at some point hearing it the entire time
14:50 < bridge> <scrumplex> Honestly the only time i can actually hear coil whine is when games dont cap the framerate on loading screens
14:50 < bridge> <scrumplex> I guess I could also hear it when I am in VR, but my headset drowns out the noise of that very well
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ??
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i dont use windows
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saw a clear improvement on my gentoo
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw on linux u can change / patch shcedulers
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> open source stuff
14:53 < bridge> <scrumplex> well yeah obviously
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> also recently they updated it iirc
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway i got 128mb cache and AVX512
14:54 < bridge> <scrumplex> Gaming benchmarks of the 7900X3D just showed that it performed *worse* in gaming than the 7800X3D, because only a portion of the cores actually have 3D-V-Cache
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> worse in gaming? well give or take 5 fps
14:54 < bridge> <scrumplex> I think the 7800X3D has 8 cores with 3D-V-Cache, while the 7900X3D only has 6
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> in gaming its mostly gpu
14:54 < bridge> <scrumplex> I think the 7800X3D has 8 cores with 3D-V-Cache, while the 7900X3D only has 6 cores with 3D-V-Cache
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and the cpu is already so high end it probs doesnt matter
14:55 < bridge> <scrumplex> depends on the game really
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but with this cpu its def not a bottleneck
14:56 < bridge> <scrumplex> but even productivity tasks are worse on the 7900X3D than on the regular 7900X
14:57 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1712149041_Aesh6u.png
14:57 < bridge> <scrumplex> obv this is just one example
14:57 < bridge> <scrumplex> but wtf
14:57 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1712149063_aePho1.png
14:58 < bridge> <scrumplex> another example
14:58 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31PwSpClk8
14:58 < bridge> <scrumplex> the 7900X3D review came out before the 7800X3D so this video doesn't compare it to the former: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA1LvwZYxCM
14:59 < bridge> <scrumplex> but even then. The CPU benchmarks in the 7900X3D review show that it just isn't a well designed package
14:59 < bridge> <scrumplex> So I would personally either "downgrade" to a 7800X3D or upgrade to a 7950X3D, even though the latter isn't perfect either
14:59 < bridge> <scrumplex> With good scheduling 7950X3D *should* be at least as good as the 7800X3D
15:00 < bridge> <scrumplex> But I am not sure how good schedulers are nowadays.
15:00 < bridge> <scrumplex> But I am not sure how good schedulers are nowadays with these mixed CPUs
15:00 < bridge> <scrumplex> But I am not sure how good schedulers are nowadays with these heterogenous CPUs
15:00 < bridge> <scrumplex> But I am not sure how good schedulers are nowadays with these heterogeneous CPUs
15:02 < bridge> <scrumplex> ltt also has a good explainer about this here: https://youtu.be/nj4gn7od0jY?si=wXCpyPEgzo_KPtnC&t=197
15:03 < bridge> <scrumplex> i guess if you pin a process to certain cores, it could work great
15:03 < bridge> <scrumplex> but that's probably fairly manual
16:49 < bridge> <imilchshake> ok sorry! :pepeH:
16:50 < bridge> <imilchshake> ah thats too bad. Time do write some telenet code then, yippie
16:59 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Issue has been fixed by Nvidia driver update, but I have no idea why it worked before, I didn't change a darn thing, maybe some windows update was sneakily installed
16:59 < bridge> <zhn> tw econ just sucks xd
16:59 < bridge> <zhn> better use tw econ tui xd
16:59 < bridge> <zhn> idk if it still works though
17:00 < bridge> <imilchshake> hmm for me the colors were inverted with tui xd
17:00 < bridge> <imilchshake> ah and idk if a tui is the right tool to use as a 'library', as i wanna automate stuff with econ
17:01 < bridge> <zhn> ah
17:01 < bridge> <zhn> tw econ is fine as a lib ig
17:01 < bridge> <zhn> like its just wrapper of tcpstream
17:01 < bridge> <zhn> but its sync
18:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> is it possible that i have so many demos that the game lags when trying to save another one?
18:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> i have 6640 files in demos/auto
18:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> i use linux but this folder is on a NTFS HDD and i just created a symlink from the config directory
18:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> i read NSFW HDD and was like - where are you fckn saving your demo's to?!
