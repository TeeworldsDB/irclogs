05:37 <+o_be_one> hello, why tar.xz instead of tar.gz ? i'm curious ^^
05:40 <+fstd> it's newer and more hip
05:41 <+fstd> also compression ratio is at least .1% better and it's only 500% slower and takes 50k% more RAM
05:41 <+fstd> win-win!
07:13 <@deen> o_be_one: it's fast to extract and smaller.
07:18 <@deen> I guess it was more useful that I introduced it to Nim around the same time. For DDNet it's just 12 MB instead of 15 MB, for Nim's csources it's 4.6 MB instead of 38 MB with gzip -9
11:09 <+eeeee> cool, can store it on 4 floppies then :P
11:09 <+eeeee> or even 3 if you use that crazy tool which lets you reformat the 1.44 floppies into 1.7 or sth
13:56 <+minus> you can store 1.7M on floppies? do floppies have FEC and that tool removes that?
15:20 <+fstd_> IIRC you could just pack the tracks tighter together if the hardware allowed for it
17:41 <+o_be_one> oh good to know thanks !
17:44 <+o_be_one> i'm trying a new game server, to see if there is the same issue like last time, actually its good
18:13 <@EastByte> o_be_one: you mean ovh game server?
18:30 <+o_be_one> ys
18:31 <+o_be_one> we are debugging this issue actually (its a known OVH issue now :))
18:33 <@EastByte> nice
