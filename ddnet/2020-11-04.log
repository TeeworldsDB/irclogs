00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I highly doubt youtube has copyright on the rolling cipher used on youtube lol
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is such a classic example of copyright abuse
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 this was not the claim in the DMCA request. I don't think the the DMCA request was legitimate, but that's not the reason for it
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they claim that youtube-dl circumvents "effective copying protections" on music videos, the "cipher" that only exists on these special copyrighted videos from these companies
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> devs, why my screen become black for a second every time I switch on/out of game even though I use gfx_fullscreen = 0 ? The only thing that helps is using different from my screen resolution but then its very inconvenient to me
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 15.1.3 win64-steam amd64
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> @BannZay try ``gfx_resizable 0``
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Chillbreaker this settings already has 0
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> try using linux then :p
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> did you change anything before this blackscreening happend?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay @louis had similar problems with new intel driver. are you on intel?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen yes I am on Intel (27.20.100.8681). Have not tried older DDNet versions. For sure it might be drivers issue
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the same with DDNet 14.4.1
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @ChillerDragon I have changed nothing. Probably windows updated my Intel drivers automatically
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Intel drivers roll back fixed the problem
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> CC: @louis
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Intel drivers roll back fixed the problem for me
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> CC: @louis
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Looks like `@everyone` ping was used in #records channel and pinged everyone -- maybe use `` tags to prevent that for the @DDNet bot?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have disabled permissions to ping @ in that channel
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Simple but effective
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hey @deen, do you have any idea why show distance from ddnet client doesnt work on my server anymore? it used to work when i implemented it. Now it does only work for my F-Client, not ddnet client. The client is sending the packets but it doesnt arrive at the server, it seems
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> did you change anything there?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think so
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weird
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773569777595449375/1604500374395.png
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> some younger people might assume that this is how it works now
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> but interesting "coincidence"
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: wdym younger
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> It doesn't work like that xd
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > :thonk: wdym younger
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie he probs means ppl who dont know what or how matrices works will assume this is how they work i guess
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> thanks for explaining
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> helps a lot
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> irony? :justatest:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> :justatest:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i appreciate it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I think he really does
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Appreciate the comment
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: probably
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> :justatest:
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bytes cant fully transmit a message
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found something silly. You can't have opaque subclasses in C++
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/subclass/nested class/ I guess is more correct
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 wdym by opaque nested class
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `class A { class B{ int foo; }; };`  you can't expose `A::B` opaquely
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for namespaces it works, doesnt it?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found a jank way to do it on ##c++. You can split the definition of A::B out into another file
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> file1.h:`class A { class B; public: typedef B C; }` file2.h:`class A::B{ int foo; };`
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uh wat
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can say class A::B
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> TIL
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL aswell
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it's a shit solution
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao ^ <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wat
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was replacing tl/ with stl kinds
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/kinds/containers/
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily, there is no good way to have a sorted vector
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> responding to whom? or starting a new topic
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's easy to replace in namebans, maybe a little difficult in authmanager
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uuid manager needs some work
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Scrumplex i think thats not a discordbot issue, the records thing is a webhook coming from somewhere
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> starts with "Everyone wants accounts"
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :LowIqLaugh:
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> literally the only problem is people not wanting accounts
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This guy really has a superiority complex
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> big one
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he should try to get US president
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the best is that he things we dont know how to implement a account system
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why he wrote a big wall of text
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> only way i see accounts is in ddnet 2
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> didnt he leave the server
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes when is hookrace coming out :justatest:
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @plsplsplslol if u look at #join-leave he joins and leaves like everyday
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probably to check if someone misses him
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> lol
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually would creating ddnet 2 be possible. that'd be really cool
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> hes in server now
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i vote for the acount system that deen said. Any nickname, but an unique username(ofc)
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i vote for no account system, i like the simplicity there is right now
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well ofc, accounts optional too
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i vote ddnet 2 and have accounts there
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when u finished all novices and lot of mods and ddmax most ppl cant fake finish harder maps so its not a real problem
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet 3d
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> DDDNet
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😄
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet 2.0 made with rust a parallel ECS implementation and vulkan
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont even know what it means
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 3DNet
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> rust = no
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust = yes
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we wont need to ubsan
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and asan
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> anus
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lets call it louisnet
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone deleted
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> no
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> moderators are here
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> nouisnet
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hookrace
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ddnet hfy already make that
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets do this, if biden wins we dont add acount system ,if trump does we add it
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets call it teeworlds 2.0
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> twoworlds
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `teesworlds.com`
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I'm just curious why you didn't make an account system yet with all cool features it can provide if you know how to do it without breaking current system?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs everyone is too lazy
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they just dont say it xd
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> how do you do it without breaking the current system
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> optional accounts
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> accounts with nicknames
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only login name is unique
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @plsplsplslol so read the text and you will know
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess he atleast made it about the implementation in the community sense
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ It's not politically acceptable. I made several account systems
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 sounds good, shouldn't we just build upon the work that already has been done?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> > starts with "Everyone wants accounts"
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @Ryozuki leí eso y lo cerre
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ none of them are good bases for future work sadly
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One of them is completely based on asymmetric crypto, no way to get it user friendly
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another I implemented all the crypto myself using primitives from libsodium. No way to get that merged
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The last one is just a naive username password implementation. I don't even know if I have it on this computer
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why don't ddnet use some macros for safe pointer's function call?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what do you mean?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there are many codeblocks like
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ```cpp
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if(pointer)
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     pointer->dosomething();
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ```
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ```cpp
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #define prefix_safeCall(defaultValue, objectPointer, methodWithArguments)\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> [&](auto&& ptr) -> decltype(auto)\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> {\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     return ptr ? (ptr->methodWithArguments) : (defaultValue);\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> }\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (objectPointer)
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #define prefix_safeCallVoid(objectPointer, methodWithArguments)\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> [&](auto&& ptr)\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> {\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     if(ptr)\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>         (ptr->methodWithArguments); \
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> }\
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (objectPointer)```
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cpp14
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> btw https://m.habr.com/ru/post/246971/
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its also possible to do macro with params in/out/without
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe i see. I prefer the explicit over the macro. Also, often you need to do other things too inside the if
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but its quite often in tee code...
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also we are getting such segfaults on pointers
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can't read the article, but it's using too many #defines I think
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, you can't replace all calls with safe one anyway for performance reasons
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, it's not always correct to not call a function when a ptr is null
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it trades a segfault for a logic bug
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> title is "dirty tricks with cpp macros"
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, i thought about performance, that why i asked for opinion
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd call the macro "conditional_call" if I wanted to use it
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `safe_call` sounds like you add some safety by using it
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is not the case IMO
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ideally we should use references more instead of pointers
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> whole code is using pointers, no way
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think we have a lot of problems with null pointers (which is the problem that references solve)
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but I mean instead of the safe_call macro
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> someone gets it while changing the base code
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> not often, but not rare thing
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we had our fair share of nullpointer crashes
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, and to satisfy the name safe_call it should throw an exception if it's null
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it can also spam in console about null-pointer reference for debugging
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then you need exception handling
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have a recent one so we can check whether it would have been solved by references?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> console is too easy to ignore
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no recent ones afaik
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, actually, exception is best solution
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I kinda disagree on using more references, especially for out parameters. they hide data flow from a programmer reading the code)
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/d437c57d26c53488881fb15451eb3c197bade714

23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (just searched for "null pointer")
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, references are a bit tricky because they behave like values, but still the best way in C++ I think
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or rather can get used like values
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't look like refernces would have helped in either of these three cases
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> All of those can actually be 0, so yeah, have to check them
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> > @Scrumplex i think thats not a discordbot issue, the records thing is a webhook coming from somewhere
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> @Ryozuki but now I found the right repo :D
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can make a pr with the fix
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :D
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I can do it tomorrow (if no one else is faster :D)
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I can do it tomorrow morning (if no one else is faster :D)
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think deen alr fixed?
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > I have disabled permissions to ping @ in that channel
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk he said that earlier
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Well that's kinda a fix :D
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> But better to just fix it at the source I think
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess you could ping other people tho
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> gonna tryhard some map just to ping you lol
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <QuiX> idk why but some mappres in the editor i cant use them. Can someone explain me why? 😂
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <QuiX> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773680807566245888/screenshot_2020-11-04_22-44-43.png
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> The width or the height of the image is not divisible by 16. This is required for images used in tile layers.
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i.e. its not 1024x1024 px
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it has to be 16px multiple on each side
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <QuiX> yeh but others can use it hm
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u have a good client
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and others dont
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> send it to me @FrosTribe
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maaybe u downloaded it incorrectly from the forums
