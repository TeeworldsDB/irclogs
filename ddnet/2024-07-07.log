07:49 < bridge> <teero777> Is there a limit to demo length?
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:20 < bridge> <teero777> gm
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
08:40 < bridge> <teero777> i need at least 10 hours xd
08:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have recorded 10 hours and longer already
08:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That was fine I think
09:37 < bridge> <0xdeen> when your disk is full, also until the ticks run over (maybe a year?)
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that long?
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wasnt there also limits to the teeworlds datafile format?
09:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ticks running over would also be a server problem i am not aware of any case where that actually happend
09:53 < bridge> <egyt> Or the filesystem limitations (like no files bigger than 4GB for FAT32)
11:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably as long as you can stay on a server. Since any server should restart at `MAX_TICK`, you can record at most around 434.96 days. But if the file gets so large that file positions cannot be represented as `long` anymore, then seeking in the file would not work anymore since we use `ftell` and `fseek`.
11:10 < bridge> <reitw> @egyt this limitation is windows only
11:10 < bridge> <reitw> For fat32
11:10 < bridge> <reitw> Use linux :giga_chad:
11:12 < bridge> <egyt> Will install Linux Mint 22 as soon as it releases
11:33 < bridge> <teero777> Thx :)

21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it tells that you should turn off entities
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe there're some hints or something
