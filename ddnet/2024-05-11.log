00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> what am i missing
00:44 < bridge> <patiga> afaik the hook simply doesn't start in the center of the tee, but further out.
00:44 < bridge> <patiga> thats also the reason why if you simply hook the ceiling, you wobble a lot below it -> but if you hook the ceiling while you are right below it, you hook much further into it and wobble much less
01:17 < bridge> <Ewan> what about edgehooks and stuff
01:29 < bridge> <patiga> the hook-hitbox of tees is also larger than the tees themself, and reach through corners
01:30 < bridge> <patiga> I think the fat-tees are approximately the size of the tee hook hitboxes
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ok but http://2143.christmas/f/FWhn.png
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> see my hookline
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> still goes thru a gap due to some corner inconsistency
01:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> hitbox for blocks are weird in this game
02:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> melon i think resurrect worked for me but i stopped using it quickly because i did not like it. These days I am happy with a fresh start every morning. What does not work for you?
03:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao ``ssh terminal.shop``
06:07 < bridge> <sans._.> for 0.7, how exactly do I convert negative codes to hsl?
06:07 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238703899335065671/image.png?ex=66404067&is=663eeee7&hm=69c7a20ebeb58bf7472f0c6fae0001aff4bbc018c3ade751893ac9a28be9a5e6&
07:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 0.7 moment
07:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Chillerdragun, any idea?
07:38 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm working it out, slowly
07:38 < bridge> <sans._.> im bad at bit stuff so ai is my best friend rn
07:39 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm trying to understand what the ai has done and then re-write it in a way that makes sense to me
07:39 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238727063666561044/image.png?ex=664055fa&is=663f047a&hm=c1f81e44e6d6f3dd2da87ce6491b980da2c164e65432b124da483bd3dd0e12d7&
07:39 < bridge> <sans._.> tbh im doing all of what im doing to learn stuff xd
07:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Fresh start every morning :MonkaS:  - fair enough, Well it wont save spacing and Position of anything after restart which Kind of Defeats the Point of using it imho
07:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> we all did some AI stuff and learned how Not to do  something xd
08:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Isn't it just means that first bit is set to 1 so it becomes negative, but you can handle it any other value
08:11 < bridge> <sans._.> wut
08:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nvm :/
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.> I was able to make it work like this
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.> ```ts
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.> function HSLAfromTWcode(twCode: number, hasAlpha?: boolean): [number, number, number, number] {
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.>   const hsla: [number, number, number, number] = [0, 0, 0, 255];
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.> 
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.>   if (hasAlpha) {
08:14 < bridge> <sans._.>     hsla[3] = (twCode >> 24) & 0xff;
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>     twCode = twCode & 0x00ffffff;
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>   }
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.> 
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>   hsla[0] = ((twCode >> 16) & 0xff) * (360 / 255);
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>   hsla[1] = ((twCode >> 8) & 0xff) * (100 / 255);
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>   hsla[2] = (twCode & 0xff) * (100 / 255);
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>   hsla[3] /= 255;
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.> 
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.>   return hsla;
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.> }
08:15 < bridge> <sans._.> ```
08:16 < bridge> <sans._.> Now that I look at it it does kinda look ugly 💀
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> what are u talking about chiller
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> also wanna play gores
09:09 < bridge> <deathgood> i'm back again
09:09 < bridge> <deathgood> the negative code is alpha i'm pretty sure
09:09 < bridge> <sans._.> not always
09:10 < bridge> <sans._.> I was messing around with colors and I noticed the number isnt always negative for a code that has an encoded alpha value
09:10 < bridge> <deathgood> yes
09:10 < bridge> <deathgood> it's negative because of double negative integer something
09:10 < bridge> <sans._.> can I actually get anything from it
09:11 < bridge> <sans._.> perhaps to remove the need for an additional parameter here
09:11 < bridge> <sans._.> ?
09:11 < bridge> <sans._.> only the marking color code has an alpha value
09:11 < bridge> <deathgood> only the marking can be transparent that is why
09:12 < bridge> <sans._.> yea, since I know that I can put in `true` whenever im coloring the marking
09:12 < bridge> <deathgood> actually idk that so forgive my yapping
09:12 < bridge> <sans._.> no, no, ur right
09:12 < bridge> <sans._.> At least from what I can see, the body in 0.7 is only the shape, the decoration on top of it is the marking
09:12 < bridge> <sans._.> it's a simple overlay
09:13 < bridge> <deathgood> jes
09:13 < bridge> <deathgood> so the code is correct no?
09:13 < bridge> <sans._.> this works, yea
09:13 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238750918841995264/image.png?ex=66406c31&is=663f1ab1&hm=e0f5a1dca9f5403274987e7af14752f7b4c1550a8ad66c932a6bc95823ce7922&

09:14 < bridge> <sans._.> I only rendered the body here, I'd say it's close enough
09:14 < bridge> <sans._.> tho maybe ever so slightly lighter
09:15 < bridge> <deathgood> what's causing that discrepancy
09:15 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm not sure tbh
09:15 < bridge> <sans._.> possibly my function that takes care of coloring
09:15 < bridge> <gumbatw> Im not aure if there is one, just diff background ans brain does rhings
09:15 < bridge> <sans._.> could be that too
09:15 < bridge> <sans._.> I thought of that xd
09:15 < bridge> <deathgood> no the rgb is definitely different
09:16 < bridge> <gumbatw> ok, right one more bright?
09:16 < bridge> <deathgood> (126,34,143) left and (186,59,209) on the right yeah
09:16 < bridge> <sans._.> This is how I'm converting 
09:16 < bridge> <sans._.> ```ts
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.> function HSLToRGB(hsl: [number, number, number]): [number, number, number] {
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   const [hue, saturation, lightness] = hsl;
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.> 
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   const chroma = (1 - Math.abs((2 * lightness) / 100 - 1)) * (saturation / 100);
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   const huePrime = hue / 60;
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   const secondComponent = chroma * (1 - Math.abs((huePrime % 2) - 1));
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.> 
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   let red = 0;
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   let green = 0;
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   let blue = 0;
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.> 
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   const flHuePrime = Math.floor(huePrime);
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.> 
09:17 < bridge> <sans._.>   if (flHuePrime === 0) {
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     red = chroma;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     green = secondComponent;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     blue = 0;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>   } else if (flHuePrime === 1) {
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     red = secondComponent;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     green = chroma;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     blue = 0;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>   } else if (flHuePrime === 2) {
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     red = 0;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     green = chroma;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     blue = secondComponent;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>   } else if (flHuePrime === 3) {
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     red = 0;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     green = secondComponent;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.>     blue = chroma;
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.> Mostly taken from TeeAssembler 2.0
09:18 < bridge> <deathgood> what even is that
09:18 < bridge> <sans._.> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
09:18 < bridge> <deathgood> before you analyze that code i'd just suggest getting whatever hsl output you'd normally get and putting it through an online converter
09:19 < bridge> <sans._.> This is what I get from the tw code
09:19 < bridge> <sans._.> `[ 290.82352941176475, 61.96078431372549, 14.117647058823529, 1 ]`
09:19 < bridge> <sans._.> for the body color
09:19 < bridge> <deathgood> H S L ?
09:19 < bridge> <sans._.> yea
09:19 < bridge> <sans._.> hsla actually
09:19 < bridge> <sans._.> but if alpha doesnt exist i default to full opacity
09:20 < bridge> <deathgood> is hue in degrees?
09:20 < bridge> <sans._.> yea
09:20 < bridge> <deathgood> converter says degrees and i'm not even sure what that means for color
09:20 < bridge> <deathgood> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238752597998043156/image.png?ex=66406dc2&is=663f1c42&hm=16db4ccedd922c12944e3ca9c975d42ab609bb517966dd3ff5c3e69853d45dff&
09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> hue
09:20 < bridge> <sans._.> I did 62 for saturation cuz it's .9
09:20 < bridge> <sans._.> but yea it's about right
09:21 < bridge> <deathgood> i mean that's neither of the colors present in the image though
09:21 < bridge> <deathgood> somewhat concerning
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> function output is `[ 51, 14, 58 ]`
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238752975803908126/image.png?ex=66406e1c&is=663f1c9c&hm=0c0acdddee5045c333ffabcfd95ffcfce58cbc9fa6d4ecc830db5c8eafc9a4a8&
09:23 < bridge> <deathgood> no but like what's the rgb of the in-game skin
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> no such thing, it's in hsla
09:23 < bridge> <deathgood> probably accurate just some rounding error
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> no such thing, it's in hsl
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> yea the hue is .8
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> yea the hue is 290.8
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> if i round it it's the same as the function
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238753259460755457/image.png?ex=66406e5f&is=663f1cdf&hm=04b986618938ea97a135954a29efaef00c3139c60db47e0a97ac12beb13725a3&
09:23 < bridge> <deathgood> i mean if you screenshot it
09:23 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238753366822223912/image.png?ex=66406e79&is=663f1cf9&hm=a0cabb494665e53325c2ec78d556d856f84bdf4246116b870fbccaffe6ad08f4&
09:24 < bridge> <deathgood> the one in the bottom left is the color?
09:24 < bridge> <sans._.> yea
09:24 < bridge> <deathgood> (126,34,143)
09:25 < bridge> <sans._.> that doesnt look right
09:25 < bridge> <deathgood> did you put in the hsl here
09:25 < bridge> <deathgood> says different values
09:25 < bridge> <sans._.> yea, it's the same thing
09:26 < bridge> <deathgood> what
09:27 < bridge> <sans._.> The color from the screenshot is correctly converted to hsl, the function that converts from that to rgb also works correctly
09:27 < bridge> <sans._.> this is the tw code for that 13540900
09:27 < bridge> <deathgood> yeah but what about the discrepancy you showed me earlier?
09:28 < bridge> <sans._.> no idea where it comes from
09:31 < bridge> <sans._.> it's close enough
09:31 < bridge> <sans._.> 😩

11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: when will we do an anti german accent course to sound more professional?
11:54 < bridge> <Ewan> german is among the most professional accents imo
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i can talk with much less accent, but not in a good speed.
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. if i sing i can sing pretty well in english, since i always say the same text
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but with random sentences it's kinda hard at a good speed
11:56 < bridge> <Ewan> practice
11:58 < bridge> <learath2> Where did this come from? 😄
11:58 < bridge> <Ewan> general American perception of germans
11:58 < bridge> <Ewan> they’re all engineers n shit
11:58 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> einsteins accent was heavy :lol:
12:28 < bridge> <patiga> that is a third effect. here your hook passes perfectly through the gap with the perfect angle (not what calculation allows this). this is not related to edgehooks or the usual hooking-through-corners
13:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> it sounds so great tho :D
