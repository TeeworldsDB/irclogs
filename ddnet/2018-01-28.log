11:00 <+pinkieval> that's art
12:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> that's invalid syntax in C
12:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> `08` is interpreted as octal, but 8 isn't an octal digit
12:12 <+pinkieval> oh
12:12 <+pinkieval> nice catch
12:12 <+pinkieval> I once had a nasty bug because of something similar
13:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> Nooo pls keep bam .-.
14:04 <+Learath2> YES
14:05 <+Learath2> I finally get to nuke it
14:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> .-.

14:18 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master b5d919f Learath2: Remove bam
14:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <DanilBest> :(

14:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> lel
14:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> what about this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/bam.lua
14:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
14:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> haha xD
14:34 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vNDw6
14:34 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 71d82b2 Learath2: Really remove bam
14:35 <+Learath2> I even did `find | grep lua` how did I miss that :(
14:51 <+pinkieval> on zsh: rm **/*.lua
16:00 <+Learath2> `find | grep lua | xargs git rm` should work I guess
17:30 <+ochristi> Learath2: what would you to about hypothetical files like evaluator.c or other containing that word stem? :D
17:31 <+Learath2> `find | grep ".lua$" | xargs git rm`
17:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> regex powa
17:35 <+ochristi> admittedly using find parameters is somehow more verbose, eg. -iname "*.lua" --exec ...
17:36 <+Learath2> I never bothered learning find parameters :P
17:37 <+Learath2> `find | grep | xargs` combo seems to do everything I need
17:37 <+Learath2> so I never felt the need to learn find properly I guess
17:38 <+ochristi> unless you want to filter for let's say file age or something, then those come in handy
17:39 <+Learath2> yeah didn't need to do that yet
17:43 <+ochristi> just wanted to hint, it is a powerful tool not just for file listing :)
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 #1007 looks good but why did you need 2 seperate things for `AUTH_LOGIN` and `AUTH_LOGOUT`, why not just `AUTH_CHANGE`
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I guess it's easier to parse this way actually
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you don't believe in the power of pull requests, do you?
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> readme still contains references to bam
22:34 <+Learath2> yeah shit on my parade all of ye
22:35 <+Learath2> [learath2@l2gen2] ~/C/ddnet (master)(âœ“)[0]$ grep bam README.md | wc -l
22:35 <+Learath2> 1
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 also `CMakeLists.txt`
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> `scripts/make_release.py`
22:38 <+Learath2> I'm perfectly capable of grepping myself
22:38 <+Learath2> also we don't even need the py scripts anymore
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 not sure what you want to sayâ€¦
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> there are some non-obvious references to bam
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 just make a PR, okay? ^^
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> then we also don't accidently break the cmake build in master
22:39 <+Learath2> I'm always commiting to master from now on
22:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
22:40 <+Learath2> I'm most definitely not breaking the cmake build by removing bam
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> some source files can also be removed
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> but if you remove the wrong ones, you'll break the build
22:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1009: Scrub more references to bam (master...dd_pr_removemorebam) https://git.io/vNDjD
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> thanks
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> src/osx and src/osxlaunch
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> contain a symlink
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I think that can be removed as well (?)
22:49 <+Learath2> I fixed that notification thing properly back in the day which you reverted to make it work with bam
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I guess we can remove `make_release.py` as well?
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> what did you do?
22:50 <+Learath2> I don't remember in the slightest, I did it when I had a mac at hand
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> well, if it was just reverted, you could searc the git log
22:51 <+Learath2> iirc it was just moving notification.m to .mm but can't really remember
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> yea, that still happened, I just added a symlink?
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> so that symlink could be removed
22:52 <+Learath2> guess the other one in osxlaunch was also bam compatibility
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> yep, think so
22:54 <+Learath2> guess we'll see when travis runs
23:08 <+Learath2> lim_x->0 o(x^3)/x^4 = ?
23:08 <+Learath2> w/c
23:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Badfeeling> hello
23:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Badfeeling> i  have question
