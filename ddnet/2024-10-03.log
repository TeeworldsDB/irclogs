07:08 < bridge> <Ewan> no u are a student
07:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i am a neanderthal
07:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i wrap my head around the basic concept of writing something like a compiler and then i disregard it like i could do it with ease
07:09 < bridge> <Ewan> but bro
07:09 < bridge> <Ewan> u are doing it

09:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> btw, I checked how rust and C do it and it's interesting that rust just moves results on stack and then just loads them in registers but C puts everything in register from start and handles 3rd argument in the end

10:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how the hell does godot debugger not have a step out
10:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW: the proposal for adding one was in 2021 with no activity. gamedev just don't use debuggers huh.
10:07 < bridge> <teero777> Rip it
10:13 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, divs are shit, everyone uses mul
10:29 < bridge> <learath2> I don’t think so. Atleast a quick google suggests not
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html#the-nullable-pointer-optimization
11:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97758 it's not even hard to implement
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cellegen yesterday casually found a bug in godot with compressed textures xd
11:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did you guys fix it
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, i dislike compressed textures anyway xd
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they have really weird bug, even back when ddnet had them
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they have really weird bugs, even back when ddnet had them
11:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> godot is swapping VRAM texture compression lib in 4.4 iirc was it pre lib change or post?
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isn't that part of the driver?
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but dunno which version he used
11:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh well
11:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i probably don't care anyway
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah same
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just wanted to write random stuff
11:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/#betsy-texture-compressor was talking about this
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh wow
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah they are purely lossy it seems that makes sense
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i thought they went all out and decode on the fly in the shaders
11:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> vram compressed textures are always lossy
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah and that is also why they suck
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try to update 2 pixels on your lossy texture
12:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's kinda required for running large 3d scenes on old mobile chip tho lol
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how so
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds like the vertex buffers would also cost lot of VRAM
12:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :think_bot: big texture chokes slow mem bandwidth. it's just a snapdragon thing
12:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably same with vertex buffers i guess. our VR game really chokes on full 4k textures
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally understanable, but I am suprised still.
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What kind of resolutions do we talk about?
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah 4k
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why don't you simply give out HQ full hd textures then?
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as alternative
12:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly it is also a artist problem
12:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> our artist only worked with single objects before.
12:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> some of our big buildings are single objects that is UV unwrapped onto one texture with substance painter
12:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so is either i remake all the textures and models, or i just crank the resolution
12:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> guess which solution i chose
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 32k
12:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> i also tried secondary details, sampling a repeated texture and splat them onto the model, but the additional sample also tanks the framerate.
12:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> solution. i'm just saying i kept 4k res instead of remaking all the texture
12:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did you manually wrote shaders for Unity?
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or does unity support so much stuff?
12:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i use some third party node graph thing
12:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> free shader. lol

12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BRO WHAT
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't tell me you wrote this
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that auto generated?
12:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
12:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> shader graph
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> by ur graphs?
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sick
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so much code that has to run on the GPU xd
12:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :think_bot: probably could hand write the whole thing and save a lot
12:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but you know
12:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> crunched and stuff
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does unity offer debug tools to measure VRAM bandwidth?
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to find bottlenecks
12:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe
12:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i just use snapdragons tool or renderdoc on device
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I kinda would find it cool to add gpu benchmarks to ddnet to test out what makes it faster or slower 😄
12:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> running in editor is very different from on device, unity packs textures differently per target.
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> these engines are so massive, sometimes i really wonder how they even work at all xd
12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> gamedevs care none of that
12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it builds for your target. if something doesn't work, you just call unity and get on-site help (supposedly, but we are not unity enterprise licensed)
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah so then my question is: Does it happen often that smth doesn't work? 😄
12:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the only thing that I can't solve is the physics engine just stopped detecting raycasts
12:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it was fixed after we disabled like 15 invisible collision shapes from our character.
12:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still don't know why it happens
12:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> most other things are solvable or solved really
12:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
12:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we had a rendering issue where our stencil portal effect and outline is flying all over the place with our dynamic viewport
12:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> found the render code, forked it, applied proper xr rendering matrix, booted the official packages and rolled our own.
12:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> good time
12:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and there was also a third-party package that runs IL codegen which breaks IL2CPP randomly for half a year, but it was eventually fixed by said third-party. we just spend two unpaid weekend migrating the code to the new version since it was breaking changes

12:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> she*
12:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my lead does not make game. so he actually listen to me for everything, other than deadline. which is the product team's lead's job
12:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> our CEO is a she*
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i thought u quit
12:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> i did
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't work there anymore. just saying it was like that before
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> funny enough that they made oct 1st deadline which i thought was impossible for two interns to do without me
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but they haven't bothered me once since i left
12:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so maybe i'm actually the slow one. they actually move super fast withoute
12:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so maybe i'm actually the slow one. they actually move super fast without me
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they just make you think that

12:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> "their CEO"

12:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> our

12:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah man
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also in 2d many materials don't really work like that
12:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i forgot to stole my cool sky shader...
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i did sky boxes, i really made a box and instead murphed the texture so, that it looks round
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was super fast to render
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since it was 6 textures only 😄
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i did sky boxes, i really made a box and instead morphed the texture so, that it looks round
12:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean.. wasn't that just a regular skybox
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> many games so low poly 3d circles
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> man my english sucks xd
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> spheres
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> right
12:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> our game had day night cycle and different weathers so i made a dynamic skybox shader lol
12:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah man, now i want my shader back. i might ask my intern to stole it for me

12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> noclip.website is really the best website ever xdd
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just cool to fly around all the games u used to play as kiddo
12:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh great
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i didn't do anything today
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> time to cry in bed
12:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 I solved the problem with `rdx`, every time when I do mul/div operation it checks if `rdx` is in use, if it it push it to stack, do the operation and pop it back xd
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> Don't forget to allocate stack for it
13:23 < bridge> <learath2> Also you can use a register for it too if possible. Moving to memory is expensive
13:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but `push` instruction does it, no?
13:23 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, that's fine. I didn't think you used the push instruction for whatever reason
13:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is that bad :justatest:
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> Nonono, it's fine
13:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just pop it right after idiv
13:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just pop it right after idiv/imul
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> Actually now that I think about it. You could have handled all your expression mess using a stack machine. Very inefficient but it makes it trivial to calculate any expression
13:26 < bridge> <learath2> All you need to do would have been to traverse the expression tree in post-order. For leaves emit stack push. For non leaves, pop, pop, operation.
13:27 < bridge> <learath2> Oh well
13:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> currently it generates ```

13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there a C library that is famous and doesnt have bindings in rust?
13:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> considering what is famous
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> like used somewhere
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need project ideas
14:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> nvm they exist
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmao
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://crates.io/crates/olivec-sys
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk go make an interpreter then
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> its relatively easy
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> bro i already have my own language
14:03 < bridge> <7ovvv> @everyone
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ed-lang.org/
14:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> pro
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i should refactor it
14:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> its compiled tho
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> compiled is better
14:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> make a scripting language
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
14:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wasm2
14:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a rysk emulator https://github.com/edg-l/rysk
14:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a riscv emulator https://github.com/edg-l/rysk
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> is edlang written in edlang
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> it uses llvm
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> bootstrap it
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust is written in rust
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> edlang should be written in edlang
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> useless idea but still an idea
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> have u made your own javascript framework?
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> make new js runtime
14:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> great idea
14:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> not like there are at least 5 of them
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont wanna code in js
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna code in rust
14:10 < bridge> <motkote> Please help, how to increase the chances of registration in the community and how to change the server type from TestDD to my own?
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i could do a DSL language
14:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nobody does 😬
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> the language instructions are to draw graphics
14:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> jdsl??
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> dsl = domain specific lang

14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> make a json library that emits rust docs as comments
14:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> ask in #questions
14:13 < bridge> <motkote> Thx
14:40 < bridge> <kebscs> @jupeyy_keks nice job on the gpu prs 😄
14:40 < bridge> <kebscs> is it possible to check if vulkan would crash and swap to opengl automatically?
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probably. But probably not in a cross plattform way, easily
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Except for android there doesn't seem to be high demand for it tho
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And on Android the driver situation is horrible as expected
15:00 < bridge> <kebscs> would be great so there's no need for so many launch options
15:00 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1291384441750687815/image.png?ex=66ffe6fb&is=66fe957b&hm=9d5e553ea56ab883ff658a91de53048e92ad44f91d8c370f0d7c3bfb2dafc9e2&
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, that would be great
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But the amount doesn't matter
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> either None or it doesnt matter
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @kebscs How do you want to detect an issue like this tho:

15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The intel OpenGL driver situtation is still really horrible on Windows
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well we recently also had a case where it looked very weird
15:10 < bridge> <kebscs> idk, just the one where a game doesnt start with vulkan at all is fine
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/1281958197841887322

15:52 < bridge> <robyt3> What did you try through python? Set the econ config variables (at least `ec_port` and `ec_password`), then you should be able to connect with telnet with any type of telnet client
15:53 < bridge> <motkote> I am very bad at coding, I did it using the chat gpt, the server rejected the connection to the servers, I can provide the code
15:54 < bridge> <robyt3> First try to get econ working at all, you don't need any code for that
15:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Host a server, set the econ config variables, the use `telnet localhost 9000` (assuming your server is hosted at localhost with port 9000)
15:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Host a local server, set the econ config variables, the use `telnet localhost 9000` (assuming your server is hosted at localhost with port 9000)
15:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Should I post my development of TeeGalaxy here, or should I just create a dc server for it?
15:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1291398933058420757/image.png?ex=66fff47a&is=66fea2fa&hm=4710c39cda07be65b3d2543d8cb5ec49f3a7b9c7f1a63a89706456c327d4a572&
15:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Despite that, my tileset system is going well, using JSON to import / export configs for any Tile object
16:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does that look correct btw? xd
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can talk about it here, or do a #town-hall topic
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u want more technical talk this channel is good ig
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u just want to show some stuff, maybe better somewhere else
16:06 < bridge> <learath2> If the memory locations correspond to the variables I think they do. Yes
16:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> les goooo
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> any1 here github actions pro?
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder if actions can also create comments on a pr: "This failed bcs xy"
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://stackoverflow.com/a/64126737
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyone ever used that?

16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you trying to do? ^^ yes, I think I tested some of it
16:24 < bridge> <zhn> yeah it works perfectly, i was a bit dumb looking thru teeworlds repo xd
16:24 < bridge> <zhn> 0.5-0.6-~~0.7~~ rust server bridge
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0.7 is dead, long live 0.5
16:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're welcome. what language are you generating code for?
16:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `sv_test_cmds 0`
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I have working code for this. sec

16:41 < bridge> <zhn> rust xd, 0.5 client refused to connect at some point and i tried to look at 0.5 branch on gh
16:41 < bridge> <zhn> found out like nth time that gh search doesn't pin commit i looking code in for
16:42 < bridge> <zhn> doing the same in rust, didn't know it exists in pure cpp wow
16:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon check this out! https://dayssincelastrustmcserver.com/
16:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> lets go minecraft servers in rust mentioned
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬 😬 😬 😬
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki u know your next project
16:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> check out valence
16:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> the owner has been gone for like 3 months tho
16:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> zero online activity
17:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @jupeyy_keks # has been made. Hopefully it's ok to post all of the things there.
17:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If not, mods or admins may delete it, and will post it appropriately.
17:17 < bridge> <syrinok> I see no harm, it's related enough to the game, better there than anywhere else
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its cool but i see it as a too much grand project for a solo dev, but i dont wanna go against rule 1 so i wont comment further
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good thing I have robyte in my team
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just need 3 10x devs
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u got 300 devs
17:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I may need some developers for this project in the future, however if the basics are not up, then I cannot show any examples which can help devs understand the whole system.
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah you should defs focus on getting tile maps to be rendered
17:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The most annoying issue will be communities creating their own game modes with existing maps.... like providing a tool to automatically transform maps... may not be possible alone.
17:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Exactly.
17:58 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> yo, are there cmake flags to disable the server compilation ?

19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, is that reproducable?
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then i'd suggest to validate the map and/or try with debug mode
19:04 < bridge> <avolicious> Well well well, I will start the server again & let the players trigger it D:
19:04 < bridge> <avolicious> I never had this before with GetLayer
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> If it's reproducible, and this is a SIGSEGV, just run it with asan and it'll immediately tell you what's wrong
