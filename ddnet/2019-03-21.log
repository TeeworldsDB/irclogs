00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Dareka maybe dnsbl
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then he would still see the servers
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and ban message
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and a ban message
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eh wait i mean ddos filter
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not dnsbl ofc
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fyzzo> could you please get that stupid debug mode away from CTRL SHIFT D? I enable it by accident all the damn time and sometimes I forget how to disable it again
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> f1 exit debug_mode
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @fyzzo ctrl shift d again lol
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby troll
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fyzzo> @fokkonaut I know. its still stupid that it's there and I can't disable the hotkey
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> remove it from code
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fyzzo> ... are you serious?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes I am lol
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just search for that, remove the function where it wants to open the Debug Mode and then compile
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> easy
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 5 aec
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 5 sec

01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fyzzo> The stupidest counter to saying that a part of a program could be improved is
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fyzzo> "JUST CODE IT YOURSELF"
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> code it
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> make a pull request
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> have it for everyone
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe like a toggle: cl_use_debug_mode 0 1
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or even better, wait for @Learath2 completing composed binds and tell him to fix that aswell, so that its a default bind (ctrl+shift+d), which can be unbound
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aswell as editor
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no troll
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it  actually closes dbg mode

08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Dareka send me your ip address privately
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet GER, ddnet.tw and KoG are all hosted by the same hoster, so I'll forward the problem to them and they can probably fix it

17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so Lunar base got fixed.  but i still cant do a certain part from the map. i asked kys to try the part. kys's run was casual with 6 minutes which means th epart was not a big deal for him. but today he couldnt do it either. he also told me that the grenade parts in Binary are also difficult for him (yet they are possible)  i strongly belive that the fix with the link is either bu <message clipped>
