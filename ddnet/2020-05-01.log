00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 link?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/1824
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> .tbd is a very interesting idea, instead of including the actual object to link to in the sdks, they only include the uuid of the library/framework, the install-name and the symbols it exports
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the linker is then able to link things together as install-name is enough to link a mach binary
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (there is no static linking in mach unless you really force it)
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 how many hours did this one-liner take? ^^
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 now the NSA knows about you :justatest:
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 around 5 hours to figure out what was going on, 3 to come up with a solution that's not shit
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well also includes time to learn the ghidra codebase a bit
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao I've temporarily given up on it
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao I've temporarily given up on it
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> kk
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Kk
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 thanks, now it built. Can you test please? https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-13.1-osx.dmg
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen works great
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby you should give it a test too, you are on older macOS
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-13.1-osx.dmg
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> test what
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> whether it works
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can open it
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> open the package contents, run the actual executable to see the termina
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> l
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> check if curl is giving an error
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [2020-05-01 03:42:34][http]: libcurl version 7.69.1 (compiled = 7.55.0-DEV)
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats the only result for curl
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ship it
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the github vms are built wrong tbh, you don't need command line tools anymore, xcode includes that nowadays
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you should also try passing `VERBOSE=1` to make so we can see the commands executed, it'd be nice to see the -isysroot and -isystem values
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can we just fix up the github vm in a preparatory step
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 finally üôÇ
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, we could try
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The github action logs are the worst thing I've ever seen
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Half of the time they don't load all the text for me, sometimes nothing, and ctrl-f is totally broken
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, they are really meh
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How difficult can it be to just show a text box?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I doubt they are all stupid, I'm sure there is more to it üôÇ
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess they tried to make it lazy-load because some have dozens of MBs of logs
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I don't see how they fail to do it either though, it should just be simple polling for the logs (or html5 sse))
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I recently wrote Javascript at work instead of C++/Python btw üòÑ
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We needed some fancy userscript to integrate Jira and Bugzilla
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen can we run commands before the run? It'd be nice if we could see `xcode-select -p` and `make VERBOSE=1`
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen javascript isn't too bad as long as you know the pitfalls, the pitfalls are like dozens of meters deep
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mostly use typescript nowadays
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, so far it's survivable, but I'm basically just moving data from A to B, so nothing too hard
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> xcode-select -p gave me /Applications/Xcode_11.4.1.app/Contents/Developer
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay that's pointing to the correct place
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I wonder how it ends up including the command line tools version of the headers, I thought cmake used xcrun
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I think there's a raw log somewhere in github actions
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that one is usable
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk -g -isysroot /Applications/Xcode_11.4.1.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk` that doesn't sound right
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, raw logs are available once the run is finished
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see isysroot twice
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, you saw it too
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> try not touching the sysroot
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> xcode-select thinks we are using xcodes version of the sdk as apparent from the xcode-select -p
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> homebrew is a joke of a package manager, I wonder how no one came up with a better version yet
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish github would just let people ssh into their containers like circle used to do
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean you can hack that together üòÑ
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 hints for how to get rid of it?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure where it's coming from who decides the -isystem?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, i think I am?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep you are üòõ
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't use anything from commandlinetools, just let clang decide those, lets see what it decides to pull in
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 would be an interesting project, I wonder if the containers can access the outside world
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can access the internet, so yes
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try running DDNet servers on the containers
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you can start new ones on demand
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no need for servers anymore, check mate
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, if only they didn't time out
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just need some way to migrate servers üòõ
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/blob/master/README.md
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently someone already hacked the ssh thing together
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think I'm out of ideas
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you just let it run with verbose so we can check whats happening in the first place?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, last push
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include`
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now we just need to find where this is coming from
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know of a way to trace why cmake is adding this flag?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or whether it is the one adding it to begin with?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it's any help, it's only present when compiling the client, so it's one of the clients dependencies thinking that's the correct include dir
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh, we could just nuke CommandLineTools while preparing, but I'd rather find the issue
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen can you add CMakeCache.txt as an artifact so we can download it?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or just cat it to the console before the make
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 no idea where this is coming from
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CMakeCache should tell us why
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take a look when I'm in front of a computer I guess
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `PC_CURL_INCLUDEDIR:INTERNAL=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include`
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I found the problem, can you gimme a hand with the cmake part please?
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut oh btw i deleted whatsapp just that u know
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> why we dont have blocks that are half hookable and half unhookable
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> or even 1/4 of block
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> we could do hard maps with that feature
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one wants such pixel perfect shit
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, pkg-config in homebrew installs the curl pkg config file, which includes the wrong sdk root
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep it's homebrews fault, I guess we try nuking the commandline tools directory
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that fixes it
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @üñ§Smetanolubüíé sounds like you just want the blocks to be smaller üòÑ
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think you can merge #2518 now
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yay
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I like the way you fixed it @Learath2 üòÑ
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is what happens when you half-ass bolt on a package manager onto an OS hostile to anything except itself
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/os/mac/pkgconfig/10.15/libcurl.pc
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pacman for life
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually i just use yay
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use aurutils on archlinux
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay is the best
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Brew is supposed to be able to handle the situation if (XCode || CLT), it can't if the sdkdir is hardcoded...
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> macos sounds like a pain in the ass
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon I invited the user you needed

14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No wonder google didn't hire this guy
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm shit with algorithms, even I could invert a binary tree, but this guy is on another level, he pretends the packages aren't in any structure, they are all laid out flat, then he annotates the packages with dependencies to create a fake graph
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon how do you want me to contact you now
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can i work at google now?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you didn't do it on a whiteboard
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do agree that algorithms are not a great measure of a programmer, but still failing this one, I wouldn't hire him either
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, we should do that golf thing again sometime
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it was fun
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye but it would be better if it had better challenges
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, it did get repetitive and meh after a while
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would love to do versus challenges with https://www.codewars.com/
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best website for this kind of thigns
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to register u need to solve a challenge xd
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (a rly ez one tho)
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet I'd fail it, I'm great at failing easy things
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 bors is still choking on something
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, interactions are not allowed to touch files inside .github
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> integrations*
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, but it was choking on stuff earlier too
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally the green tick is back
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao are you around?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 awesome!
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 somewhat
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it hard to run a copy of the ddnet bot locally?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 of bors?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no of @DDNet
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you need to setup postgres rest is easy
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i think it only works on linux btw
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao how do I choose the db it uses?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you create a .pgpass file at your home dir
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Pgpass
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nice, it doesn't care about .pgpass üòõ
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> passing the dsn manually to create_pool does seem to work
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why doesnt it work
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no idea didn't even read .pgpass
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what are you using the database for btw?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> menus branch is the up to date one btw
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> for $profile $points etc
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can see data/schema.psql
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm am I supposed to be the one to create the tables btw?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cant u run the entire file in psql or smth
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, btw you have a syntax error there, a `.` instead of a `,`
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh no
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do u need the cronjobs too
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope, just doing a learning exercise
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know why regex \b would limit the matches to 1?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> figured it out, new question, are regex lookaheads bad for performance?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel they aren't that bad because you don't need backtracking
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao what do you use when coding in python?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> vsc
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, the autocompletions are shit for me
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does it complete something like `pat = re.compile(r".*"); pat.`?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> type inference for pat should be absolutely trivial
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye autocompletion works
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can use pycharm
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it‚Äôs better for that kinda stuff
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 install python extension
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not retarded, ofc I have the python extension
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what are you even making
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @Learath2
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> how to fix lags
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> :redstripe:
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ctrl shift q
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://rust-analyzer.github.io/ seems to do a way better job than RLS
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they just released their first release on 20 apr
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/04/20/first-release.html>
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i agree

23:25 <+Konsti> Hello, i have a very weird bug ingame (GER Server). I played the map Topsy Turvy with my dummy yesterday and saved at a part which couldnt be done with dummy. Now i loaded the savegame with a partner who did it and saved again. And here comes the bug. When i load the save i can play normally except for that one of the tees cant use weapon. Not like that he hit a hammer off tile, he just cant use the weapon, pressing mouse1 has no  effect. Th
23:26 <+Konsti> Before loading and after saving his weapons work again
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the first message was cut off after "no  effect. Th"
23:27 <+Konsti> I tried to change the server but the same bug happened again, also any other tee always the same bug for exactly the same tee
23:27 <+Konsti> The other tee normally can
23:31 <@deen> which weapon btw? or multiple don't work?
23:32 <+Konsti> i have no extra weapons, only hammer and pistol. none of them, works
23:32 <+Konsti> with antiping it "tries" activity but with antiping off just nothing happens
23:33 <@deen> so you can select the weapons but not shoot. sounds like m_Ammo is 0 or maybe the regeneration counter is set to a wrong time
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the fix we recently pushed
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from fokkonaut
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it probably didn't consider saves
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> damn it, I missed that
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: ^
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen ^
23:34 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2086 this one? I remember you commenting "fingers crossed" :D
23:35 <+Konsti> what was the intended use of this fix^^ And will my save work again when its refixed or is it dead now?
23:36 <@deen> heinrich5991: since you already reviewed, any idea how to fix?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Konsti: will work again after this is fixed
23:36 <+Konsti> thanks for help so fast
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my guess without looking at the source: disregard ammo while loading
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and set it to -1 if we have the weapon and 0 if we don't
23:36 <@deen> for all weapons?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but let me look at the saving code
23:37 <@deen> why don't we care about it anymore?
23:37 <@deen> it's easy to do in save code, i can make a pr
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> needs to be the load code
23:37 <@deen> yeah, i figured
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because we don't track freeze by "no ammo" anymore
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (which was a hack that I'm happy about getting rid of)
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there any commit that adds the ddnet ingame updater?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I would like to apply it for F-Client
23:40 <@deen> nope
23:40 <@deen> we had to change lots of stuff about it
23:40 <@deen> but the code is relatively modular
23:41 <@deen> see updater.cpp/h and all uses of its functions I guess
23:41 <@deen> and be prepared for lots of fiddling and failing updates :D
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks, I will try it :)
23:42 <@deen> and on the server side you'll need something like https://update4.ddnet.tw/update.json
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> uhm, what? :D
23:43 <@deen> to specify what to update
23:44 <+Konsti> when will the commit be merged?
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when I finish reviewing it
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then it needs to be deployed to the servers
23:45 <+Konsti> ok thanks
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen what does all of it mean? and do i need to do it manually?
23:45 <@deen> Konsti: yes, manually
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> konsti? :D
23:46 <@deen> whether to update server executable, client exec, libs, files. and you'll need to provide them from your web server as well
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: I think you need to set it to `m_aWeapons[i].m_Got ? -1 : 0`
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 it can be -1, it doesnt matter
23:46 <@deen> ah, so we don't ignore it totally
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you dont have the weapon, it doesnt matter whether you have 0 or -1 ammo
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen or remove that variable completely, that would work as well
23:47 <@deen> in m_aWeapons you mean?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .m_Ammo*
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in `CCharacter`
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wouldnt remove it tho
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So mods have it easier to work with it
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's non-functional for us
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't have code to decrement it
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen, if i just want to update the executable i just set client = true, and if i need to update some other files i need to set them in download: ?
23:48 <@deen> yes
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and does the server need anything more?
23:49 <@deen> only the update.json and the files in correct location, but you'll see the client error messages if they're not there
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do you keep track of what changed?
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do you go back commit by commit before a release?
23:50 <@deen> by looking at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/13.0.2...13.1
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: but you do need to set it to -1 if you got the weapon, otherwise it won't fix Konsti's problem
23:50 <@deen> if something in data or ddnet-libs changed -> need to put it on server and add it to update.json
23:50 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, I noticed, so always -1 is the easiest fix I guess
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen okay, can you give me an example of how the server structure has to look like? so where to put the json, where the other files?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: yes
23:51 <@deen> Konsti: wanna give it a try?
23:52 <@deen> huh, only one empty ger server
23:52 <@deen> on ger2, none on ger
23:54 <@deen> ok, tested with konsti, works
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's in the queu
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e
23:55 <+Konsti> thanks to u both
23:55 <@deen> i'll rebuild servers once it's submitted
23:55 <@deen> you're welcome Konsti 
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm really not pleased about the updater, I wrote it but apparently I wasn't really thinking while making it üòõ
23:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: bors is a bit stupid about the queue isn't it? If the builds were green already and nothing was merged inbetween, then no need to rerun them
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes @deen I think there's an issue about it
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> anyone else having problems with borderless window?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sometimes the border appears
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> usually when im tabbed out for a while or when pc is sleeping and i repoen
