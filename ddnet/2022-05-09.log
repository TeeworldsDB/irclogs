00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @ReD did you work a bit with map generation? do u have anything i can look at
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you are familiar with numpy, my twmap python module works with numpy arrays for the tilemaps
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> here is a simple example of the module usage
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/972992605086449724/resize_tiles_layers_to_game.py
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you decide to use it (install with `pip install twmap`), I will try to get the update I worked on some months ago out, it improves the usage significantly
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm using spotifyd + spotify-tui nowadays, not really sure if I can recommend them though, tui going thru the web api is a bit jank
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> mmmmh
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, that's how I feel about it aswell
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> eheh
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> why spotify has cringed linux
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> snap sux
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> canonical sux
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Every single one of these newfangled services that don't let you use your own client also seem to have shit linux support
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast let us build our own you goofs..
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will make a spotify client of my own using librespot one of these days, but just haven't gotten around to it
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> does spotify-tui use librespot ?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, it just interacts with the web api
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ah ok they have a rest api
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you have this jank setup where spotify-tui goes thru spotify servers to control your spotifyd instance using spotify connect
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x)
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can send spotifyd commands on dbus, I had my own small spotify web api wrapper in bash once upon a time
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could search songs/playlists on dmenu, which was fine, but I do sometimes want a better "browsing" experience
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y i see
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> could be interesting to build a spotify client
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> you want to pursue music piracy?
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spotify isn't mean to third party clients, librespot requires a premium account
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> oh then its nice
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973046053278470204/unknown.png
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thanks patiga :happy: made this impossible map now
05:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> who knows
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> send .map kekw
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> actually u should release it as nouispossible
05:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hfy did it in #showroom it took a long time
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a simple generator but its in rust not python https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-gen
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it can generate a maze and a simple hammerfly map
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973111091599114250/ddnet-map-gen.zip
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cross compiled for windows
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if it works xd
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its a cli app
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome! if you have any questions regarding the module, I'll happily answer everything :)
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> looks ez
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im learning some rust egui so i decided to make a ddnet related program (nothing is done yet)
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973166926366933042/unknown.png
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> @Ryozuki im very close to download https://surf.suckless.org/
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> :pepega:
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sucks
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine having to recompile to config it
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also alacritty exists
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and is made in rust
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its not even a web browser my brother
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> :default:
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> surf is a browser
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> alicritty cant browse the web no ?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh true
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thought it was the terminal
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my bad
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> How can I disable dummy on my server?(not sv_max_clients_per_ip 0)
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes just like you did, its client side code so it should work. For me it did not do the double hammer
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> would be nice if someone could test/review this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5063 Maybe I missed some other physics.... The videos are not valid anymore, need to do a new comparison
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> DDNet servers can't distinguish whether a tee is a dummy or not, so only way to prevent people from using dummies is to set `sv_max_clients_per_ip 1`
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> damnit cargo fmt screws up my twmap-py :c
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can put flags to ignore it i think
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk what twmap-py is exactly
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #[rustfmt::skip]
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mod dont_format_this_file;
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or #![rustfmt::skip]
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on top
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In ddnet we have `IEngine::Add` and `IEngine::RunBlocking`, I want to make some jobs that should never be ran non-blocking. Can you think of a way to enforce that?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> replace it all with libevent
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Perfect idea, except that doesn't handle any part of the issue ðŸ˜„
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a true c dev never enforces stuff on others
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or alternatively an `IJob` that couldn't accidentally be used with `IEngine` directly
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to keep the `IJob` interface, but these tasks really shouldn't be ran on the engines pool but another pool
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> IEngineJob and IGameJob?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they extend IJob
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I guess that'll be my backup idea if I don't come up with something else
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just add a comment
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> // dont run this blocking
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feels like awful design ðŸ˜„
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the c way
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The term "pool tag" keeps coming to my mind, some sort of marker on the jobs that indicate to which pool they should go
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But not quite sure what form that tag should be in, it probably shouldn't incur a run-time cost since we know at compile time what pools will exist
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are there jobs right now t hat run both blocking and non blocking?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just add a virtual method that returns whether it should be ran blocking
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and remove runblocking
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently there is `IJob` you can run anything that implements that interface blocking or on one of the worker threads that belong to the engine
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would a ijob be blocking
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt that the point of ijob
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to not block
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk what exactly is used for this
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should look into the code xd
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jobs that are ran within other jobs are ran blocking iirc
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @louis updated twmap in pip, there are many bug fixes in there as well as better documentation :)
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cool thanks
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im working on trying to autogenerate gores maps with actual pathing
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/642582131066929152/973072322435108864/unknown.png
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have that but theres no consistent path ofc
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> cool project!
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> this is rly cool
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i dont know shit about it, but ive  about another world generator, that wave functions are helpful
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i dont know shit about it, but ive readed about another world generator, that wave functions are helpful
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have created an absolute monstrosity
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll throw it away but I'd like to show it first
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/5g?c Look at this insanity
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > enable_if_t
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use concepts
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> embrace c++20
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't it was supposed to be for ddnet
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mold requires c++20 btw
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well cool but afaik KoG has refused that, someone already did a project like this & generated maps were not accepted
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have this disease of overly general code, it's unlikely we'll ever want to create another pool... brain damage
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye, im doing it mainly for fun
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > mold is written in C++20, so if you build mold yourself, you need a recent version of a C++ compiler and a C++ standard library. GCC 10.2 or Clang 12.0.0 (or later) as well as libstdc++ 10 or libc++ 7 (or later) are recommended.
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gigachad mold developer
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> where is ping tf, is discord buggy
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe if its convincing ill upload it under a fake name
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can choose to ping or not
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye happens
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as one says "dont make stuff you wont use"
