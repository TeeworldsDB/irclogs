00:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What do you mean by that?
00:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how about switch case construction with a default at the end?

01:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> #3016
01:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> wurde bereits schon von deen empfohlen, sorry :/
01:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3016
01:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> yes me
01:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it u
01:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> seems chromes developer tools are still better after all this time :/
01:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> how long has n9mkoik had rank 1 in rankpoints
01:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there are still some weird things with both browsers concerning css
01:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> on chrome, scrollbar props are still prefixed and don't follow the conventions, and on firefox, form inputs are very ugly and often have different rules when it comes to changing their appearance

12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> what about hosting tournaments on a separate server that's not accessible over IPv4?
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> rip ddosers ðŸ˜„
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> too bad modern internet still relies on protocols that were designed 40 years ago when only a few computers were connected to the "internet"
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Comrade many ISPs don't provide ipv6 yet. I couldn't even connect to the tournament server myself
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> you should blame your ISP hard then
12:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's 2021!
12:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> but maybe this is the reason why IPv6 internet is still clean
12:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think you haven't interacted with many ISPs if you think they'll react to that ðŸ˜„
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> well, i used tunneled IPv6 for a few years until my ISP finally implemented it
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> but they did it ðŸ˜„
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> the only problem is that their IPv6 connectivity got broken a few months ago and they still haven't fixed it...
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> i'm the only customer that spams their support with that so they don't really care probably
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> so back to tunnel....
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe i'm the only customer that spams their support with that so they don't really care probably
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have ipv6 either
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> you should try it
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> no malicious SSH connections there
12:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> you don't need to worry about SSH server on default port being available from internet
12:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's like a dream compared to IPv4
13:50 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Comrade go add ipv6 support to ddnet then
13:51 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh wait or does ipv6 work already?
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes it does i think
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> lazy internet providers are the problem ðŸ˜„
13:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> well if it was widley adopted it would also be the same amount of attacks there xd
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> who knows
13:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> scanning whole IPv6 address space to get some vulnerable devices for your botnet sounds pretty insane ðŸ˜„
13:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yea
13:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> in web
13:55 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> or like iot
13:55 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> or ssh
13:55 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> or what am i talking xd
13:55 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i mean it doesnt help in tw since the address is known
13:55 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but sure maybe it has some advantages im all in for trying it out.
14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> if everything is configured correctly, massive attacks are not possible
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> IPv4 internet is old and many networks are not configured correctly there
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> but with IPv6 there's a chance that it will get better
14:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Comrade well ipv6 has its advantages and issues too
14:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like theorically by default all your devices are visible from internet
14:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> you think NAT makes networks more secure?
14:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> i think it's a big myth
14:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no, but it's better at least
14:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> better than nothing as we can say :p
14:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> NAT != firewall
14:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ik lmao
14:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> But by default on most of isps your internal devices aren't accessible from outside, only if someone does the bad move to open a port for a specific device
14:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's why, better than nothing at least
14:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> what if random unpredictable addresses in IPv6 are much better than some crappy NAT?
14:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> my computer gets random public IPv6 address (the lower 64 bits) every time i power it on
14:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> (well, not now because my provider screwed up IPv6 in their network ðŸ˜„)
14:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well won't hide your IP if you go on a shit website or game server
14:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> and how NAT prevents shit websites from running malicious JS code on my computer?
14:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol this is a browser application issue
14:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and noscript helps
14:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> most modern websites don't work without JS unfortunately, but that's another story ðŸ˜„
14:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well with noscript at least it's not automatically executed lmao
14:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im all for ipv6 i just cant use it cuz my isp doesnt have it
14:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you can then accept
14:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my vps has ipv6 tho
14:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836583097310117888/unknown.png
14:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html
14:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Ryozuki you can use your VPS to get IPv6 connectivity if the hosting gives your more addresses (they should)
14:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> i'm doing that right now
14:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> because my ISP is piece of trash ðŸ˜„
14:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836583702623813722/unknown.png
14:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a /64
14:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i can use 18,446,744,073,709,551,61 ips
14:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the power of modern tech
14:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
14:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i can use 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 ips
14:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> my VPS has /64 prefix too
14:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> ideal situation is when they give you /56 for example, so you can leave one /64 on your VPS and route another /64 to your home network over some VPN
14:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> and everything will work as intended
14:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> random addresses etc
15:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think they really should have stuck to the initial /48 assignments per end user, that'd have given us so much flexibility
15:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> server hostings definitely should provide more than one /64
15:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> however home connection is a different story
15:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> a single /64 is often enough there, but not always
15:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> i think /56 (or even /60) is a good compromise
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> it would be really nice if everyone could have:
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> - one /64 prefix for guest WiFi
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> - one /64 prefix for IoT devices
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> - one /64 prefix for home VPN
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> - one /64 prefix for everything else
15:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> each of these in separate VLAN under different firewall rules
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> networking done right ðŸ˜„
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade with the sheer amount of ips we have I agree that more than a /64 should have been provided to homes
18:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we have like 4 billion /56s in just one /24, no point in making these small assignments imo
18:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, assigning only a single /64 to end user should be illegal ðŸ˜„
18:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've heard of ISPs considering assigning /112s...
18:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Luckily network equipment vendors and RIPE stepped in to stop them from breaking autoconfiguration which is almost like the most useful thing about ipv6
18:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, some people get IPv6 wrong
18:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> everyone is used to ADDRESS:PORT (32+16 bit ID), but in IPv6 it's more like NETWORK:DEVICE:PORT (64+64+16 bit ID)
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we'll ever get a decent amount of ipv6 adoption
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's been stagnating for so long
18:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> india leading the world with a mere 55% adoption :/
18:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> if IPv4 global routing table gets larger than most backbone routers can handle, IPv4 dies finally ðŸ˜„
18:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> hopefully
18:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hetzner only gives a /64 to servers so I can't have a subnet for my own either ðŸ˜¦
19:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> check https://tunnelbroker.net/
19:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> eeeh I don't think I'd want a tunnelbroker idk in the middle
19:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> you can get your own /48 there for free
19:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> and they have servers in many countries
19:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> but you should have your own public IPv4 address if you want to use that
19:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can't even order an extra /64 at hetzner...
19:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> heinrich5991: Are you coming back to tw?
19:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> have you tried contacting their support?
19:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not yet, I will give them a mail just to ask
19:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They give /56s with their colocation slots maybe they can do me a solid and gimme another /64 for free ðŸ˜›
19:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> i have one server at Hetzner too, so let's ask them
19:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or I don't really mind paying a couple cents extra per month tbf
19:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> yo somebody wanna help me? so i wanna learn how to code in ddnet, and i know this is a c++ language, so i learn but not this is the problem. when i wanna compile ddnet.server i got a error:
19:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836657453881884682/unknown.png
19:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> how to fix it?
19:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You picked the wrong target to launch
19:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> what can i do
19:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836657763929161808/unknown.png
19:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The third one, without (Install) is the correct one
19:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> now i got this :/
19:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/836658077133439056/unknown.png
19:41 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> timakro[m]: you mean "are you playing some ddnet again?"
19:41 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> yes
19:42 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> heinrich5991: I mean the map we were just on when you were afk
19:42 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> but we continued without you
19:42 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> yes :)
19:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> but you can also answer the other question :D
19:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> well, I don't feel like I've been away from ddnet development
19:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> playing i mean ^^
19:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> somebody wanna help me please? i really want to learn
19:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did you get there? what did you do?
19:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not hopeful that I'll figure out why this doesn't work, unfortunately :/
19:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> so first of all, i tried this normal teeworlds and its working, now i want this with ddnet client and i watched chillerdragon video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pFajc0PYg)  and i want to execute/compile the ddnet server, and i got this
19:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> (and i got this)
19:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry, I don't know how to fix that
19:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's hard to find something on the internet about this
19:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you already tried deleting the project and generating it again?
19:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> yes i tried
19:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> ddnet.exe is working if i compile
19:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> so
20:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> yo somebody help me where can i test messages in client.cpp?
20:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> or i create a new void?
20:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what kind of messages in client.cpp? chat messages?
20:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what void means in that context
20:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> yes!
20:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> i just want a hello world
21:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where should the hello world display?
21:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do dbg_msg("hello", "world"); to display it in the black console window
21:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> thank you! :D
21:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <mate> i wanted to display in console, and chat
21:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> anyone know of a utility to quickly measure something in px across your screen
21:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> without taking a screenshot and checking the size of it lol
