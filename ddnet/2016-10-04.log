16:00 <+luca> Hey, is it possible to compile the TW src in Linux for a Windows OS without ah VS?
16:12 <+laxadedi> yes it is
16:12 <+laxadedi> You should search for cross-compilation
16:13 <+laxadedi> Anyway, VS does't run on linux
16:13 <+laxadedi> Not sure if current Windows build is made in a VM or not
16:13 <+laxadedi> but build is made using mingw
16:13 <@heinrich5991> you can use cl.exe in wine AFAIK
16:13 <+luca> Well it runs, but its shit :D
16:14 <+luca> I don't even have a license
16:14 <+luca> Thanks
16:14 <+laxadedi> VS 2015 community should be enough to compile ddnet afaik
16:14 <+laxadedi> and it's free
16:14 <+laxadedi> but that does't run on linux
16:14 <+luca> I will try mingw. I only have Linux
16:14 <+laxadedi> Why do you wanna make windows build then ?
16:15 <+luca> Cause some of my friends are using win, and I want to share my Client with them :)
16:32 <+luca> Ya know how to do it?
16:32 <+luca> heinrich, what is cl.exe?
16:43 <@heinrich5991> cl.exe is the msvc compiler
16:43 <@heinrich5991> https://hookrace.net/blog/ddnet-evolution-architecture-technology/
16:43 <@heinrich5991> here they say that they cross-compile
16:57 <+luca> mhmm ok thanks, I read it, but his method is useless for me...i have to do it manual :(
16:59 <+luca> Mhe I am so bad with compilers in Shells -.-

20:48 <+fstd_> luca: on the off chance that it's somehow useful for you, here are my notes for building an entirely tw-unrelated project on windows: https://github.com/fstd/libsrsirc/blob/devel/doc/winbuild.txt
20:48 <+fstd_> and the script referred to therin: https://github.com/fstd/libsrsirc/blob/devel/scripts/winbuild.sh
20:49 <+fstd_> the general procedure should be the same, the details differ pretty much (bam instead of make, etc)
20:49 <+luca> thx
20:52 <+luca> ye thank you :)
20:53 <+fstd_> np
