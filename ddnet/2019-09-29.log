10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 no clue how to debug such thing. Any ideas?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> watch/breakpoints in the graphics thread
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and what am i searching there?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @ChillerDragon try gfx_resizable 0
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yea that helped thanks @Jupstar ✪ 
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I will play around the next time ill need to launch the client but for now it sometimes worked.
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 nice blogpost
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where did u read it?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do youe men github/heinrich/blog ?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://heinrich5991.github.io/blog/blog/one-tick-unfreeze
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ahty
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i even starred the repo and didnt notice it was published xd
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 anything new this patch allow that we might not want?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool blog post love it.
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But yikes the patch sounds really game changing.
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I suggest letting some pros play with the patch first before merging it. And see what becomes possible. So that he do not risk some unexpected op behaviour.
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> would this allow for freeze hammer chaining for example?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if hammer buffers like grenade then yes
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> could be op on some maps i guess
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you could easily hammer through thick freeze walls
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for sure a t0 speedrunning game changer
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean idk maybe not too bad and i really like the idea of supporting it without deepfly bind but we have to test it for sure,
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye it is cool but probably causes some cheats on old maps
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, you could do hammer chains with a scrollwheel
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also completely removes the timing aspect of "double hammer" out of unfreeze during a hammerhit
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> definitely needs testing
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> on the other hand it was the same with weapons in freeze before deen fixed it way back in 2013.  maybe this should have been added years ago as well
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @heinrich5991 wouldnt that allow deepflying with normal players?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> basically means cheating a huge chunk of our current deepfreeze parts
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (which are already cheatable with dummy - which is bad - but not intended to be done that way)
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe just allow it on dummy and new maps first
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what if its possible to just walk infinitly through freeze:tee_thinking:
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> having inconsistent mechanics from map to map is rly bad xd
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> just on dummy would be better that what we have now tho ye
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/7df4f9c8bfed13f9f0e6216cc93dc263ff85f8a6
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> might be worth cherrypickin
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait,0.7 has sha256 hashes? 😄
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> would never think they'd implement that citing something like map names too long or ugly
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure 0.7 has it all
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did i mention already that 0.7 might be worth taking a look at and updating to it? xd
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon did I mention a lot of people need to pitch in to get ddnet to 0.7?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> didn't we agree that we'd get a lite ddnet version running on 0.7?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't it only missing sql?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> y
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wouldn't implementing sql be better then asking me?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not really interested in porting the broken sql code as is
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> upgrading sql good sounds good
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm exploring web assembly now, maybe i'll look at rewriting sql tomorrow
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> would be amazing
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> (hope ur not trollin me rn :c)
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 is the stopper fixed now completely? if yes, can you commit it to ddnet7?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can you please be here to assist me with some cmake? 😛
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix have a minute to spare
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> About the sql stuff... You want to stick to  the old db scheme I think? 
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I started implementing a sqlite based backend (should be easy to add MySQL aswell) but I'm using IDs instead of names and right now it only implements finishes and no teams, scores etc.
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix I was thinking of working on the db scheme aswell
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you mean IDs tho? players don't really have ids when we don't have accounts
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix if you have a couple seconds to spare can you try building this? https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-c-api
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Table for players and primary key as id
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Their cmake example can't possibly work (and it doesn't) but they wouldn't have commited it if it doesn't work
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> And in the finish you use the id instead of the name. So you don't have to store the name multiple times in the finish table
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> But it makes only sense in 0.7 since you cannot change the name
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What a joke that change is
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I ever get a workable plugin system, i'll fork teeworlds and it'll be the first change I'm reverting
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Haha :D well I'm not sure why you would change the name... But not being able the change the skin was really a bad idea
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Those things belonged in the snap and the couple dozen bytes saved by the initial snapshot being a full snapshot is not worth it
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Yes
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe if I'm feeling particularly nice I'll implement it as a new extended snapobject so vanilla players can still connect but see the wrong names
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> It just bloats the code since you have to handle it differently in demos
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix did you try compiling the wasmer example?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "will you?" is a better question if not I'll bug someone else 😄
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I'm on a phone right now 😅
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 hello my fellow developer, would you mind compiling a small example for me on this fine day?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut or you? 😛
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you give https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-c-api a quick compile?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oof hpow
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just clone
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then `cmake  . && make`
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why dont you do it? (just wondering, no offense)
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't work for me, I'm wondering whether they commited a broken example or it's my cmake version or it's another macOS oddity
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (My hypothesis is `cmake .` should fail)
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it also fails on linux so that leaves broken example or cmake version
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay as a last resort I'll ask @HMH if he is any good with cmake 😛
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://paste.pr0.tips/jg
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> debian10
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh u already tested linux
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nvm then
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, that settles it, the stupid example just doesn't compile at all
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> trolls 😄
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 25 stars repo
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where did u find dat xd
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ExternalProject_Add builds at compile time, find_library happens at configure time
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon it's part of wasmer
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah wasm
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you might want to build the thing first in the app folder
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-c-api/tree/master/wasm-sample-app
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah wait thats a sample
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxD
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they are all examples?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are you sure this is the correct repo?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah you just want to build a example
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i see
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the sample app is compiled to wasm
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the actual project then runs the wasm file
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so wasm is also used for desktop apps?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fine, I'll implement lua instead..........
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> luajit is quite quick anyway
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lua yikes
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lua is a very convenient language imho
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only did a very lil project with it and some bam so i cant judge i guess
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you have cargo installed btw Learath2?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cmake seems to need that
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I do have cargo installed
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk then
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> problem is that the build doesn't happen until build time
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and find_library is looking for it before
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which it's obv not there
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea :c
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 still need me? xd
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 nope
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 if you are familiar with cmake, you can help me link to wasmer
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Learath2 cmake fails for me too. removing `WASMER_LIB`, calling make, adding it again and calling cmake and make again works 😄
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wat?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> remove the find library from cmakelist.txt?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah that should work
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm I guess I can develop like that, and when @heinrich5991 is around he can fix it with his cmake-fu
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> 👍
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just make an issue
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and let those devs fix it
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> made an issue, doubt they'll fix it tho
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ill like it
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if a heroinfluencer on github like me likes theyll do it
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is surprisingly little resource on how to do cmake properly
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who needs ressources if you have a heinrich :troll:
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so you are going with c instead of lua again?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well with wasm you can compile a lot of things to wasm
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rust is madness
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont even get wasmer compiled at all
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> emcc can compile c to wasm
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is also a compiler from typescript iirc
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but we'd only be supporting c like this :/
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ill give up on it you have it running anyways huh?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon am trying
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> will see if it works 😛
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i get bunch of rust errors
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `use of unstable library feature 'try_from' (see issue #33417)`...
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just rust things
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I give up, I'll work on revamping sql instead
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya thats what i ment by rust madness
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe luajit, I'll decide in a minute or so
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> at least it links some issues haha
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (not like luajit has any proper integration examples around either)
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hate this step of getting shit to link
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just want to code, I don't want to mess around with cmake for hours at end
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> +1
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just non bash things
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it always just works
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when are we porting ddnet to shell?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I should make my own build system
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bam°
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bam is weak
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> o.O
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ill tell magnus
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm imagining something like npm or cargo that handles dependencies aswell
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's pretty hard to get right for C/C++ tho
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> apt also handles dependencys 🙂 it works pretty fine from shell script
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fstd: how to create pstd from copy buffer?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon there is xsel
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the -b switch sounds useful
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xsel?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> -b ?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but how to finish -b then
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> xsel -b is supposed to output the clipboard to stdout
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> works perfect thanks
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm done messing around with cmake, what an absolute waste of time
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm going to have a damn seizure
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent 4 hours trying to get it to link, now it links but I can't add the include dirs
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :c
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might start crying
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah all will be fine
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> linking is good 🙂
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure you are in top5 most productive ddnet devs today
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats a win
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you need, specifically?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm trying to compile and link libluajit
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well download from git, compile, link
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail that enables deepflying with normal players. but actually it just makes it ping-independent. people with bad pings can start to do the dummy maps
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except that it allows hammer unfreezing from higher client IDs to lower ones, nothing is changed
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon My productivity is technically 0 as I haven't achieved anything
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://gist.github.com/Learath2/3d8149b80f1c986b9e6dce97d6ebfdbd this is what I have
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also added a `add_dependencies(engine-shared libluajit)` which sounds wrong to me tbh
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail @jao I think that the change is great, because:
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1) it removes the annoying tick-perfect gameplay that was required
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2) it'll probably enable pros to do more fun tricks without buying some hardware 😉 I guess we'll see some new interesting tricks pop up
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 3) it removes the weird restriction of only lower client IDs being able to unfreeze higher client IDs for hammering
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I think that by default, you'd want to link to the already built library
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for testing, install libluajit on your distro, add a `cmake/FindLibluajit.cmake` and just go with it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can bundle the libs later
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does one even write the "FindLibluajit.cmake"?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> copy `FindOgg.cmake` and replace all instances of ogg with appropriately cased luajit
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what does find_package_handle_standard_args do?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> set OGG_FOUND if OGG_INCLUDEDIR is found
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and maybe a couple of other things, don't remember
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `man cmake-modules`
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never had so much trouble working with any language
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's quite insane
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unfortunately it's the best supported build system for c/c++
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might one day make something like cargo for C/C++
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or npm
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wasnt there something planned?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i saw it in a talk once i think
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But do you really want to invest a full project time to only do building and linking @Learath2 ? xd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I never ever have to mess with this again, sure
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something like `cpm link --bundle luajit@v2.1` would be so useful
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Learath2: @heinrich5991 nice blogpost
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks btw
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon yea, I wonder why you even starred an empty repo
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fan num1
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not very smart fan that missed the actual post tho
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> be honest that star kept you going :feelsamazingman:
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I noticed the star before publishing
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I actually wondered before clicking: is that myself that is automatically starring my own repo or might that be chillerdragon
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxxD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know the history of these? how did cmake ever become popular with such an insanely hard to use configuration?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because configure.sh was worse
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was the only thing that worked cross-platform in a sane way
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I had better time with autohell tbh
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (including windows)
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> autohell doesn't really work on windows
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> relies on `fork()` too much
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was sure I'd see poettering in the credits of cmake
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks like something he might make
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my answer to that sounds like it could a flamewar
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *could start
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm okay with bashing on poettering
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even ignoring his mess of a project, his behaviour is deplorable
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If he'd contribute to ddnet I'd stop tbh
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rq
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol, it links compiles, then it doesn't work because of some macOS weirdness
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is life so hard?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wa mac weirdness btw?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have you tried just installing the lib instead of compiling it from source?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macOS revolutionises the OS space by allowing libs to bundle more then one architecture
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 on mac the only way to install it is from brew or by hand
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I installed it from brew
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> brew is nice
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i even have brew on linux lol
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> brew is garbage, what is wrong with you
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you trying to fuck up your distribution? ^^
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why would you have brew on linux where packages are properly maintained
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> at least i dont have macports :troll:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway I forced brew to compile from source, maybe that'll compile 64 bit properly
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so u get a 32?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the developer for brew was salty google didn't accept him
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxD
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> beste meme
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently because he couldn't reverse a linked list
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he doesnt have to
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he basically built google
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 😄
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you'd trust a programmer that doesn't know even the basics of algorithms with your systems package management?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can't remember the cool way you can just put everything into a stack in order then reinsert it in a linked list 😛
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Compiling from source worked
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hacker
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @heinrich5991 if the "cool tricks" allow you to cheat parts, it’s rather bad tho
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can do that today
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we tried it out with an unlocked mouse
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wheel
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when kintafly was discovered, it also ment that parts could be done in ways mappers didn't anticipate
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can you consistently deepfly with a real person today?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we haven't tried that
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's probably possible by sending inputs much more often
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean the input is clearly possible
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so u have to have a bot client
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can try it with the unlocked scroll wheel
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have one
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will eat something first
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think an unlocked scroll wheel would indeed send enough input to have one per each tick
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao another example btw: in the past we had unreliable one tick unfreeze even with laser and automatic weapons
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it sendss more than one +fire per tick and bot detects hate it
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people with good internet were able to do it
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen fixed it by sending input more often
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it sendss more than one +fire per tick and bot detects hate it (@scrollwheel)
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wasnt it speedy?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could claim that it's a bot feature, but I think having game features reliable is better?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya that sounds good.
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> <food>
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i just feel like it could have some unwanted side effects that you didnt think of
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes for sure
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we just need some pros test if you can do some crazy unfreezing
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes, it's frame perfect. and not even that, the frame you need to click in depends on whether you have a higher or lower client ID than the other tee
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how we all got so good at it
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 btw do we render one frame per tick?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's independent
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it's not really frame perfect per se, but tick perfect 😛
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in single-player games this coincides, therefore the terminology I guess?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was onboard with the change at first, but I think I agree more with the others that this kind of thing is something that you just need to learn
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's definitely not that tough to time even on a bad connection and making it easier just, idk devalues peoples time spent learning the timing?
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess it'd allow these people to think of much more fun tricks tbh
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the people who are good at it
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deepfly being inconsistent though I don't really like that, maybe we could come up with a better fix for it?
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> of course the fix could be separated for deep/non-deep
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [11:33 PM] heinrich5991: I'd guess it'd allow these people to think of much more fun tricks tbh
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [11:33 PM] heinrich5991: the people who are good at it
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you think about that?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean evolving gameplay a little is fun, isn't it?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you don't really need to be good after the change though
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not for that exact trick
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hammerflies suddenly become very hard to fail
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it could allow some nice new gameplay though
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people will be able to do crazier stuff
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean I kinda feel the cat is out of the bag already by the server accepting these inputs
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [12:35 AM] heinrich5991: people will be able to do crazier stuff
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes but with a much lower barrier to entry
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> would it still constitute as "crazy" if it's just holding down the fire button?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not this exact trick
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can combine it with other stuff
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. hammerfly used to be crazy
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then 0.6 came and it was a lot easier
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but people still managed to get much more complicated tricks with it
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and so there is more interesting stuff since then
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 are you sure the hf save is exactly the same thing as a hammer in freeze?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it should be, but even though I can get the hf save like 80% of the time, I've never once in my life got the hammer while I'm in freeze
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I try every time
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm pretty sure
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can see the results of me studying the code in the blog post
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe it's the set rhythm of the hammerfly that helps time the hammers
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup, maybe
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what did 0.6 do to make hammerflies easier?
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> changed tee collision
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah yes
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think ddnet should be a never changing game
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we'll just kill it with that…
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't disagree, but I also think it's bound to die, so my opinion in that regard is irrelevant
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but e.g. the hammerfly thing
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think pros were sad that their old hammerfly skills were done by less skilled people
23:41 <+Konsti> oh ofc they would
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The way to convince people to accept that change would be to show them the possibilities I guess
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just allowed new mechanics
23:42 <+Konsti> no thats cheating
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember a couple people being salty about the hammerfly mechanics
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm k
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but in the long run, nobody would want the 0.5 mechanics back
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they were just less fun
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but in hind-sight I think they just had their egos bruised, they didn't really hate the change itself
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hindsight*
23:43 <+Konsti> yeah apply an aim assist to make edgehooks easier too, people will like it but that doesnt mean its fair
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti: edgehooks aren't inconsistent between machines or network connections
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nor are they timed to 0.02th of a second
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also not easily done by stupidly pressing the button often enough
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you actually have to aim
23:44 <+Konsti> wtf
23:44 <+Konsti> u dont spam hammer button for this
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can
23:44 <+Konsti> its feeling
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the thing
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you can, exactly 😛
23:45 <+Konsti> u cant know nevause you are a nobo lmao 
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for your nice discussion style…
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> feed enough fire inputs and it'll actually work a 100% of the time Konsti
23:45 <+Konsti> sorry but what do you know about pro mechanics
23:46 <+Konsti> then fix the spam input by mousewheel thing ez
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorry but what do you know about how the code actually works?
23:46 <+Konsti> nothing
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you stop it too, learath2 😦
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if he gets to argue like a dickhead, I get to reciprocate
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just unfair if he only gets to pick on people
23:47 <+Konsti> i'm sorry heinrich
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. the usual way to deal with that would be moderators I guess
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti: to fix the spam input, we'd need to discard some input
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How would you know what to discard? a rate-limit?
23:49 <+Konsti> how is it rate limited if using key but not if using mousewheel
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not rate limited using the key
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only by how fast you can press it
23:50 <+Konsti> yeah why does it work there
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess if you'd bind it to multiple keys, you could even reach it, but it would be impractical
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because you don't click 50 times a second
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean we could probably just ban people that send a fire input every tick?
23:51 <+Konsti> not ban 
23:51 <+Konsti> could be false positive right
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but it'd kinda go against what deen did before
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that still leaves the trick inconsistent as client id's also matter
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen didn't patch out things like setting the "max mouse range" to 2 or so to get a perfect upward grenade
23:51 <+Konsti> better than chaning the physics of the game and affect tons of ranks and parts
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is not changing the physics of the game
23:52 <+Konsti> of the client then
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the same thing is possible before
23:52 <+Konsti> u make it not only way more easier, you delete a complete kind of skill out of the game
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but allow for more to be discovered
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> isn't that something you'd like?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but how can u discover new things if it doesnt change the physic ;D
23:53 <+Konsti> when do u check
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it allows you to pull the trick reliably @Jupstar ✪
23:53 <+Konsti> that ddracers never want any changes
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then its just easier not new
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it does allow new things
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ assume that you have a gameplay mechanic that works 25% of the time. you'd never get to see the tricks that need 5 of these in a row
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> once you are able to do one thing consistently, you can expand on it @Jupstar ✪
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even if you are fairly consistent, you wouldn't be able to pull off a couple of them in a row
23:54 <+Konsti> its not a big deal to do it 5 times in a row when it works 100% 
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its mostly about tryhard
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which allows new interesting parts, which can be enough
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> however I also said before that yes it might not be interesting enough if it works for everyone at any skill level all the time
23:55 <+Konsti> make a new mod for it then but dont affect all existing maps with those things
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's possible that some ranks were already done with it Konsti 😉
23:56 <+Konsti> how
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To be perfectly honest, if we commit this right now, Konsti and a handful other will be pissed for like a week or max a month, then people will forget the change even happened
23:56 <+Konsti> did u already apple this thing
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> look at how Wombat cried for a month about the double rocket change
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the best would be to collect all things that could possible currently be affected:
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hammer fly start from freeze, deepfly without dummy, hammers between freezes, and probs alot more
23:57 <+Konsti> the rocket change was a thing that affected like nothing and still tons of people complained and nobody wanted a change
23:57 <+Konsti> and u made 2 maps unfinishable
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti: nobody as in you and wombat
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the rocket change was something different
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wasnt a skill change
23:58 <+Konsti> there were a lot more people but they dont talk to you because u do whatever u want anyway
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is always a small amount of people resistant to any change
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this change is more like getting closer to bot client
23:58 <+Konsti> ddnet is a bot client since dummy
23:58 <+Konsti> source from dummy comes from z-client btw 
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this does not make sense
23:59 <+Konsti> @noby :troll:
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there can't be a cheat in the official client
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by definition of a cheat I guess
23:59 <+Konsti> there are still people playing vanilla
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well wow
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats stupid argumentation
23:59 <+Konsti> deen always wanted to keep vanilla support
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ call of duty has aim assist on consoles, is that a cheat?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it wasnt there before
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
