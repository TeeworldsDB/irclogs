00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> will fix that too
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Oh boy, I had some horrible SQL statements running in /ranks/. Got a few down from 20 s per query to 0.05 s...
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sry @deen
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> canceled your bors
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hope i didnt destroy it xd
00:50 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> deen: nice :)
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Is someone working on a skinfetcher?
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> :justatest:
03:22 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> is there acually someone working on a skinfetcher?
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> And discord presences?
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @b3z Skin fetcher https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2733
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone have a friend working in google or sth? Their stupid geolocation is so convinced that my very german ip is in fact an ip in the united arab emirates and support doesn't even understand the concept of ip
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> Im not sure if this has been reported before but there is a bug with the website
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> When you look at the last finishes for novice,moderate,brutal or the other types it shows the last finishes for every server type and not that specific one you clicked on
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ True lol
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It shows the same ranks but without server type prefixes
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, my bad
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen what the point of cheating by admin using "sv_test_cmds" if he can easily modify database, modify binaries and so on. Additionaly why would not just save the flag, add to logs data about using this command
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont understand the reason to completely disabling this command 😦
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont understand the reason to disable this command completely  😦
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @BannZay this was introduced in a time where admin cheating was common
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it helped with that
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but we have rights system nowadays "mods, helper"
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> had that back then as well
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so deen was cheating and you introduced it LMAO
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it helps in the case "ah, we failed. well, might as well enable sv_test_cmds"
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are more servers than just ddnet's official servers
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact, that setting is older than ddnet itself, I think
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so we need kinda "super admin" ?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont understand, I need full control over my own app
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have it
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just restart the server
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or fork ddnet if you absolutely have to
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> this is ridiculous
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I told you what it helped with, why is it still ridiculous?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it is ridiculous that we preventing admins from cheating in the middle of the race
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but if he restarted the server - go ahead
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> do cheat
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> what the point?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I told you the point above
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we achieved a clearer distinction of servers where people use cheats and where people don't use them
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we didn't have that before
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so to be able to cheat admin should use /save then restart and the load?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its good that there is no way to abuse cheat commands in a run
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you so desire, yes, you can do that
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> cool anticheat
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you think it's an anticheat?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I told you five lines above what problem it helped with
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's NOT to prevent admins from cheating
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [12:49 PM] heinrich5991: we achieved a clearer distinction of servers where people use cheats and where people don't use them
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please argue against that point, and not some made up one
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but wait, to cheat you had to have acess to rcon
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so if you admin why you should not be able to control this setting?
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [12:51 PM] heinrich5991: [12:49 PM] heinrich5991: we achieved a clearer distinction of servers where people use cheats and where people don't use them
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> in the middle of the game
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> by people you mean admins?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btu that doesn't really matter to the users
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> because it would encourage "hmm this fail was so unfair ill help in this case but oooonly in this"
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, what konsti says
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it creates some friction
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i also cant think of a good reason *not* to add it
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> prevents u from accidentally pressing ur `rcon up` bind as well
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> like u on fng
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean let it be
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no proof
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I was talking about a possibility to change this setting without a need to restart the server
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then it would be useless, lol
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :ban:zay
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> definitly not
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just fork and do it on ur server
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if it is ur server then u can just leave test commands enabled always
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> noby is a big tester too
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> tbh i have test commands enabled on fng
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> definitly not allow changing it mid game*
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> xd
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I KNOW
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Ryozuki why?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u choted urself in wall to troll me
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why should u need to
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was explained by heinrich and konsti perfectly
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Ryozuki  just dont give admin pw to untrusted persons
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its open source so if u want it and we dont want to add it you can fork
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and do it
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is not about untrusted persons @BannZay
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's about every admin
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do u need ddnet to add it? u are not admin
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u wouldnt care less
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add it for ur own fork
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> if an admin is untrustworthy he dont need test commands, he can just insert ranks in the database
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> indeed
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's about the friction it creates
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay sometimes I feel *really* bad if I watch a team fail. So I removed the possibility for me to just help them quickly after they failed at 3 am while no one is watching
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Thats what i thought at
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> omg deen is untrusted admin pls remove
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u dont know Where is the border to help
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Of course I can work around it and cheat with the DB, edit the memory directly to allow cheats, etc. But that's harder and then I think about if I actually should do that
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but yes exactly this
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u feel more guilty editing the database xdd
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh konsti
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> troll
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> not if u let others do it
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> isnt this the same guy who tried to submit a pull request to add cheating features to ddnet client
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> obvious troll
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont know, it makes some sense but to me its like "hello bank service, could you please take out my rights to use my money because when I walk across the street I want to help to poor people but I should not do this"
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I feel like admin should have full control
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a bank, the people at the top do not have full control either
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact, in security systems, they usually don't
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> admin rcon already doesnt give full control, since it doesnt allow u to modify the files on the server or make hardly any persistent changes to the config
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> i think you can change gravity?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> with admin rcon
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> that sounds right that tune isnt counted as a test command for some reason
13:15 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> yes but tune isn't a test command in my opinion.
13:17 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> /join #politics
13:17 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> lul since when is this escaped :$
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how isnt it
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> If there are default tunes, why would you change them while racing?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> to cheat
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> exactly
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because some maps have different default tunes set
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we would break those maps if we disable it
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> do the map settings have the same permission level as admin
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> would it be abusable if they had higher permissions so tune could be a test command
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean so  that map can turn on cheats? 😄
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i guess so lol
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but doesnt someone look at the map settings before any map is released
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they might forget
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have a whitelist of allowed commands for maps
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> could tune be added
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or not without enabling cheats
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it wouldn't work if you add it but remove it for admin
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the way we overwrite those for admin is by binding a new function that only returns the value, but can't set
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hmm i see
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > I think it wouldn't work if you add it but remove it for admin
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen seems like CFGFLAG_GAME | CFGFLAG_CMDFLAG_TEST stands exactly for this case
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think that would work right now
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> needs some implemenmtation
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as well I suggest to introduce CFGFLAG_READONLY to avoid doing "binding a new function that only returns the value"
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen you can use GetModuleFileNameA to find currently executing assembly path, DDNet-Server.exe should be located at the same directory
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> (for windows)
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> > and we would break those maps if we disable it
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @deen just disable modification by client side if cheats are not enabled?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @m!ki @BannZay sure, please refactor the code for that and make sure everything keeps working
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ so far no complaints about graphics bugs in 14.6.2. Good job 👍
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen ur econ pr has commits from ur other prs too xD
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👀
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752537846182707200/unknown.png
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is it intended
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, it depends on them
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't want to rip it out cleanly
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But if you want to work on it and get it fixed, I can later extract it
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think github allows for one PR to depend on another, right?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen can you say how to connect via econ?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> idk how to test it
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen github doesnt allow it, but other platforms do
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Ryozuki you can fork them and use
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @gerdoe
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > Currently can't even connect, not sure why.
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so he most likely won't help
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> https://ddnet.tw/client/, dead link. Idk what its even supposed to represent
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752552453450367091/unknown.png
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> i thought he tried to connect but it didnt establishe
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> i can do nothing with this econ
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> client just have it
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ScReeNy All of the skins with 0s as prefixes
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Banana Brothers Clan skins in the database
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Okay, link is refering on some external dead site tho
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why sv_team_lock is map controlled?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why do we need this setting at all?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> wat
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does it do? @BannZay
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> allows you to use /lock
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, not sure why it would be map controlled
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> nobys favorite feature
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752556369286267040/IMG_20200907_174939.jpg
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> sounds like some "fun" map setting. But idk if it will be ever used
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can we search across maps and maybe remove map controlled or maybe completely?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can probably remove map controlled, and probably even completely
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay sure, you can download all maps and use config_retrieve to get all map configs
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in libtw2 you can find a tool that can output settings of multiple maps to stdout
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be a bit faster
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen thx, I`ll try
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is not IConsole::m_cheated prevent any team on server from being scored if admin use any cheat command?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Or am I missing something?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay it only marks the player that cheated, not those he helped

20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like my fault
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only tested on linux obviously 😦
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :pepehands:
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Profi> same @jao :nouis:
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao is it live rn?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or just nightly
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 14.7
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> steam? ddnet.tw?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Profi> ddnet.tw for me
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> http://prntscr.com/ud6t7t
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> i got same
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> just pressed update in client
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> what now
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Profi> ded
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> rip
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen does the package on ddnet.tw contain an up-to-date steam_api.dll stub?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, i have to update that every time?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> every time I add more functions, yes
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry, missed that
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's the danger with shared libs
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fair
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twike> so any fix ideas so far?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> downgrade for now
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @twistandflex just download 14.7 from ddnet.tw
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Twike ^
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Profi> can I just use the ddnet.old file and rename it to exe or does that not work?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that works
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 alternatively we could automate the update creation
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, and it's weird that this didn't fail in wine...
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I even tested the upgrade in wine
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linux supports late binding of symbols
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this symbol is never called
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> damn
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps wine inherits this property
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now the autoupdate should be fixed
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you need for the autogeneration?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just a tool to diff two trees?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> look on ddnet.tw's /var/www-update5
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could just override all the files I guess. And then I need an updated update.json
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At the moment what I do is look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/14.6.2...master and enter everything in data/
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that obviously fails for shared libs
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (but I see the libs in ddnet-libs, except for steam_api)
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would it work to generate it from two subsequent release zips?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k, that sounds like a doable thing. will try to do it
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess there are some annoying corner cases though, like only a dll in win32 updated
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <twistandflex> ?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> was just a typo
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he meant smone else ;D
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sorry!
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen i got the logfile when my ddnet client says update failed, but it actually worked. (not steam ofc)
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752605843089784912/update_error.rtf
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b that looks like bad permissions on your directory
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> updater failed to overwrite most files
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Why did all teamranks >80 disappear on the website?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Is it intended?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen maybe it is because i deleted those files XD
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i opened DDNet on steam and it fucked up my settings on my normal client and why the hell does it make mouse_follow_factor 60??? :peperage:
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> but the updates always work. but it says it failed so i thought i let you know
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> bcs there's nothing wrong with exe file probably, it's just doesn't works properly
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Bacon wait what?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b if it fails to write most files that were updated that doesn't count as "working"
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> @deen
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752612308022460456/unknown.png
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> They are cut off like they don't exist
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Check any profile u can't find teamranks >80
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Turns out our number of players has grown quite a bit, /points is slow now. If I limit it to Points > 10 it's quite fast though 😄
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah I think I know how I can optimze this
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ha, down from 3 seconds to 0.003:
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   SELECT Rank, Points, Name FROM (SELECT RANK() OVER w AS Rank, Points, Name FROM record_points where Points >= (select Points from record_points where Name = 'deen')  WINDOW w as (ORDER BY Points DESC)) as a WHERE Name = 'deen';
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sql god
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to search what OVER does
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i see
21:39 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> its like GROUP BY but the windowed aggregate function version :D
21:39 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> or am i wrong
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it allows non aggregate and aggregate values
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i read correctly
21:40 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> @deen what was the previous query?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://amethyst.rs/posts/legion-ecs-v0.3
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Why does writing play teetris in f1 kick u
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> play is for demos right
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Thats dumb that play command kick u
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> well u cant watch demos in game
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> well it shouldnt work when ingame
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> trolls are writing to players they should write play teetris in f1
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we go there, we might as well unbind f1 by default
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's quite a few things you shouldn't enter there
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> how to bind f1 if u cant open console then
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :justatest:
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> settings
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Ik
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> oh, i realesed that CCharacter fully depends on CPlayer
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> b3z: The same but without `where Points >= (select Points from record_points where Name = 'deen')`
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen what's the `"client": true, "server": true` in the update json?
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> whether to update client and server
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client could be removed, it's always true
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we can also autoenable server i guess, most releases change it
