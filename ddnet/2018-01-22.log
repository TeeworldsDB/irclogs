20:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @deen you can probably merge it â€“ mac build was broken before and the travis mac queue has a size of 2k
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> the worst it can do is not fix the mac build
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> oh wait, that's the only purpose. mh..

20:58 <@heinrich5991> .
22:16 <+eeeee> circleci seems to offer 500 minutes per month of macos builds for open source projects
22:17 <+eeeee> is there a specific reason we're using travis?
22:20 <+Learath2> we didn't know circleci was offering
22:20 <@heinrich5991> I knew
22:20 <@heinrich5991> but it's either/or
22:20 <@heinrich5991> you can't have both macos and linux on circleci
22:20 <+Learath2> y u no say anything then? :D
22:21 <+Learath2> we could have given it a try, travises times sucked from day 1
22:21 <@heinrich5991> and circleci provides us with the ancient linux environment
22:21 <+Learath2> oic
22:22 <+eeeee> hm sux
22:23 <+eeeee> i hate apple for keeping this bullshit restrictions on not running the fag os on real server hardware or at least in VMs
22:24 <+eeeee> s/not//
22:24 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: we can cross-compile now :)
22:24 <@heinrich5991> see instructions in README.md
22:25 <+eeeee> true but you can't really test in real os which is the whole point of CI
22:25 <@heinrich5991> true
