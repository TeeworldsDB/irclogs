01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
01:47 < bridge> <Ewan> so i had process monitor running on my computer like an hour ago
01:47 < bridge> <Ewan> apparently League won't let you play if process monitor was even running at any point in your machine's uptime
01:48 < bridge> <Ewan> so i queued up and then went to get into the game then i get this error https://2143.christmas/f/WCWr.png
01:48 < bridge> <Ewan> and by the time i was able to get everything saved, closed, my computer restarted, and back into league, i get a leaverbuster warning

08:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> Lgtm!
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~me when I really want operator overloads in javascript~~
08:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it looks so bad
10:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> javascript
10:13 < bridge> <learath2> for once I'm actually baffled, does that work or is that a dream of yours?
10:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it does work
10:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Welcome to JavaScript land :justatest:
10:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> let me grab the oini function
10:14 < bridge> <learath2> What is an oini?
10:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just a function i worte
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ```typescript
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> interface OiniOptions<TA, TB, TC> {
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>   operators: { [operator: string]: (a: TA, b: TB) => TC };
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> }
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> export const oini =
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>   <TA, TB, TC>(options: OiniOptions<TA, TB, TC>) =>
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>   (template: TemplateStringsArray, a: TA, b: TB) => {
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>     const operator = template[1].trim();
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>     const operatorFunction = options.operators[operator];
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>     if (!operatorFunction) {
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>       throw new Error(`Operator ${operator} not found`);
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>     }
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>     return operatorFunction(a, b);
10:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie>   };
10:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fair
10:34 < bridge> <learath2> One day I'll sit down and learn more compiler theory. It's something I'm heavily lacking in
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ez
10:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not if i don't want to think about it
09:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why not just do smth like a.mul(b).add(a.sub(b)) :justatest:
09:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why not do smth like a.mul(b).add(a.sub(b)) :justatest:

09:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> t was just a experiment.

10:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> video games
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> Makes sense. I was last messing around with Unity about 8 years ago
10:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> basically
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> You can write a babel plugin to do the interpreting at compile time üòÑ
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> tis a nice and simple algorithm too
12:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i know it by other names
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, that would make sense

14:37 < bridge> <teero777> use opengl xdd
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> use opengl 1.4 xdd
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the max limit should be much higher
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> we discussed this already lmao
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we did
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> it is flattened
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dd-pg's limit is u16::MAX - 1
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> per axis
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks to this limitation vram dropped by 4 bytes per vertex
14:44 < bridge> <teero777> yea but since we are flattening the 2d array and only use integers for doing stuff to it it would max out at sqrt(2^31)
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> yea but since we are flattening the 2d array and only use integers for doing stuff to it it would max out at sqrt(2^31) per axis
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> and some other thing was there that it was halved
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> put that on the list that rust ddnet fixes
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> put that on the list of what rust ddnet fixes
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> also make chunk based loading :D
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u16::MAX xd
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok bit less
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> ?
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but why 2^31
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> 2^16 = 65536
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> since we dont use uints
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> we use ints!
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah no, it's bcs we reverse 1 bit
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for if the tile exists or not
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> really?
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> well if we the iterators would overlflow anyway
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 46340
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah wait
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> i am trying rn
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u talk about opengl 1.x
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true, they use ints
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> and vulkan uses exponential memory
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> so my pc crashes lmao
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> fix pls
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to load 46340x46340 map 
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> => 17‚ÄØ179‚ÄØ164‚ÄØ800 bytes VRAM are needed
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so 17 GB VRAM
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> using dd-pg
14:48 < bridge> <teero777> thats alot
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean you load a 160MB file basically
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine loading a png of that size at once
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ur pc would explode
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i should be able to load this on my pc üòÑ
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i convert it to dd-pg map file now, let's see if the converter can handle it xD
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i havent heavily tested it yet

14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the file reader dislikes it
14:51 < bridge> <teero777> well with external tools like twmap you could probably
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the converter didnt crash yet
14:51 < bridge> <egyt> "yet"
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder how the file size will be
14:51 < bridge> <robyt3> The maximum size of a map is 23170¬≤ because of the datafile format, it's not a graphics limitation

15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well small game tiles, but tbh, maybe it doesnt matter for game layer

15:33 < bridge> <teero777> server loading in to vram?
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> server loading into vram?
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, but normal RAM
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for collision and stuff
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and client does so too
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> if my 16gb are enugh then your 2tb should we working too xd
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> if my 16gb are enough then your 2tb should we working too xd
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i stream in General 1
15:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ryo nice 2b2t readup you linked 
15:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait its called writeup ? :D 
15:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyways ryo 2b2t enjoyer confirmed

15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/fasc1.pdf
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why wait. Do it today
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> I need less insanely impractical niche skills
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> Not more
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> No swap?
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> oh wait
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> you‚Äôre talking about 64GB of swap üíÄ
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> too much‚Ä¶
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope ur disk is fast
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know avl trees
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not often, but i already had programs that used more than 32GB RAM when compiling
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/flowers-tree-dance-gif-7391218
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> Only that it's a self balancing tree option. Never really looked into why/when one is used
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> same, like the linker
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> linkers are ram hogs
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well when u gotta link together libraries that take gbs
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> like llvm
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> I only ever implement rb trees when I need one, might be worth learning one more
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and rust linking too
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> when it links 8 programs
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> at same time
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz paralel
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye a coworker mentioned avl when i mentioned rb
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> common occurrence
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> esp w heavy optimization
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 ur daily dose of C https://github.com/CodaFi/C-Macs
18:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in my mind rb is associated with spinning drives for whatever reason
18:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my first instinct when needing a balanced bst was always avl
18:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> rb feels old to me but i dont have any reasons
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ryo the c dev
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :cammo:
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> hardly the first but good to see nonetheless
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> chairn, have you ever seen a framework laptop in person?
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> I'm likely going to get one soon
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> yea, they seem very nice
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> great prices on their essentially in-house refurbished stuff
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1230934466508099687/image.png?ex=6635200e&is=6622ab0e&hm=291ef0b64c080c8cac35fe18cbd584187bde8191005bdd05d664ee7112153bbb&
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> btw i am curious about how their modular I/O works
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf xD that looks extremly expensive
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> is that handled on a firmware level or is it up to the OS to make sense of various signals over USB
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is the whole laptop 619?
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or just the CPU
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> whole laptop
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd like to buy a US English CPU please [steamhappy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1207076645115265044.webp?size=48&quality=lossless&name=steamhappy)
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> they also sell the kit at the same cost
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1230935779677573120/image.png?ex=66352147&is=6622ac47&hm=cad9bc0a3abe0675231a1c42d11d083799ef78cd899a151f73e60e47027faa99&
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> which is really nice
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> so it's totally up to preference whether you assemble it or not
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> or stock ig
19:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> what's the point in building it yourself if they offer a prebuild one for the same price?, considering you can modify the prebuild the same way you can the DIY kit (if you can even)
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> for fun?
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> considering all the R&D that has to go into it, should be much more $
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> they literally have staff assemble the laptop at no extra charge to you... seems like a W to me
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on if u have time to waste on your new toy
19:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> i assume because their production loves assembling just as much as the customer :kek:
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not
19:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> i assume because their production loves assembling just as much as their customers :kek:
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> they are very early game in this market
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> they have to cater more to survive
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes that means eating assembly cost or w/e
19:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> i was working in a tech store for only a few months back in school, but i helped assemble a few PC's and phones (mostly repairs but sometimes from scratch) - and i always enjoyed it
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it's fun stuff
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i've built a few computers in my day
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> but laptop different
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> much easier to break
19:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> tbf the first 0 - 100 PC i built was my current one and i was scared shitless to break smth xD
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> first one i built from scratch was  in 2016 or so
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> hand-me-down amd phenom ii, GT 730, HDD and the cheapest case on amazon
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i have built a few of my own since then
19:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> i bought one pre-build in 2012 from my local supermarket for 150‚Ç¨ - and just switched certain parts over 12 years before finally just buying a new one (mostly because the case was so filled up my airflow was as bad as it can get)
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> buy a new case xD
19:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D im very glad i finally made the jump to get myself a good working pc
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i built my current one while trying to keep my old computer complete
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> otherwise i would have reused case and drives and stuff
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> old pc lives in the closet now
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> running headless
19:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> same! - well.. kind off, its just a server with a spare monitor attached to it in the back of my office xD
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i see
19:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> i just realised it was most likely early 2014, because it had win 8.1 IIRC
19:59 < bridge> <chairn> no, never. my current laptop is 10y olds, i might change in the coming year
20:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> confused, windows says 2015
20:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> confused, google says 2015
20:00 < bridge> <chairn> what's a stock vs b stock ?
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> You right
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> > The only functional difference between the A-stock and B-stock configurations is in the display. We found that some of the excess displays have slight cosmetic issues. One issue is a wavy pattern on the surface that is noticeable from certain angles, and the other is a backlight non-uniformity visible from an angle on a white screen. We‚Äôve categorized those as B-stock and further reduced pricing on them. Aside from the display, the A-stock and B-s
20:04 < bridge> <chairn> thx
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> np
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://frame.work/marketplace?outlet[]=Factory+seconds&outlet[]=Last+gen&outlet[]=Refurbished&availability[]=in_stock&availability[]=coming_soon>
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> latest gen starts at $1050
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> for 13"
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> looks like you can preorder 16" (starting at $1700
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> but it has dedicated gpu and 165Hz display
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> looks like you can preorder 16" (starting at $1400, $1700 pre-built)
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040?tab=specs>
23:09 < bridge_> <louis> unfortunately no amd for those yet
23:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> imo the main benefit of buying AMD nowadays is the socket longevity
23:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> and that all goes out the window here
23:11 < bridge_> <louis> i want a framework but no reason to get one yet since my current laptop works fine xd
23:11 < bridge_> <louis> the clear bezel + clear keyboard is rly cool though
23:11 < bridge_> <louis> or black bezel + blank keyboard
