09:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @heinrich5991 why does the demo data have to be handled like in link after huffman decoding. i mean it takes 5 bytes to get 4? :thonk: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/2c77f799f0e40ff80c2580c6ff0ed8ad19041c4e/demo/src/raw.rs#L247
09:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> wdym, why? that's how it's stored, so you have to undo the steps to read it
09:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> are you asking about why it was designed that way?
09:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> yea
09:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure. I think I was also confused by that when I first looked at it
09:39 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ddnet feature
09:39 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i see, thanks :D
10:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @Iza good luck detecting this gentleman https://youtu.be/dFwomDFdBSY
10:39 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> This looks kinda human'ish but more shocking for me is that there is a kog map including those edges
10:39 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Kog players went beyond and above
10:41 < ChillerDragon> is the new quitting screen a feature or a bug?
10:41 < ChillerDragon> i guess earlier the gui window closed while the terminal still was doing stuff and now it has a proper ui?
10:43 < ChillerDragon> it felt way more snappy when it just closed :( @Robyt3
10:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ideally the quitting screen wouldn't be shown as long as right now if we fix #4563
10:43 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4563
10:43 < ChillerDragon> i see
10:44 < ChillerDragon> but your quit screen now stops my gui from closing
10:44 < ChillerDragon> i didnt really mind it haning on curl as long as the gui closes instantly
10:44 < ChillerDragon> that is no longer the case now
10:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> It was already the case a bit before that the Window is left open but not updated anymore while the client waits for the curl jobs to stop
10:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> It just renders one final frame with the message before entering that state now
10:45 < ChillerDragon> never seen that
10:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Previously we destroyed the graphics including the window before stopping the jobs
10:45 < ChillerDragon> only thing i see is my client that used to close its window instantly now hangs in a black screen
10:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> But that can cause crashes in the skin download jobs
10:45 < ChillerDragon> i see
10:46 < ChillerDragon> does this screen have to be black because all graphics are unloaded?
10:46 < ChillerDragon> looks a bit intense
10:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> I didn't want to make it too hacky and also render a menu background or something like that
10:47 < ChillerDragon> I see
10:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Other games also just a black screen with a message or even just a black screen while quitting
10:47 < ChillerDragon> There are reasons why i dont play other games
10:48 < ChillerDragon> Oky yea sorry for bashing your new feature just seems like a ression for my workflow
10:48 < bridge_> <robyt3> Would be improved if we figure out how to properly shutdown the jobs and graphics
10:48 < ChillerDragon> ill get used to it
10:48 < ChillerDragon> oh yea and that
10:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 I think just quitting without waiting for anything would also be a viable option
10:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you don't like that?
10:58 < bridge_> <robyt3> Not really, seems too unclear to me. Maybe we eventually need some of the destructors/shutdown functions for other saving functions so I'd prefer if we shutdown all components properly
13:17 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 so you really want to mix in a 0.6 and 0.7 flag into the NETADDR type field which is used for ipv4 and ipv6 already?
13:17 < ChillerDragon> seems a bit messy to me

14:56 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 @Robyt3 have you ever thought about maintaining a community fork of teeworlds to improve merge speeds and then lobby to Oy to merge into that fork?
14:57 < bridge_> <Merie Komlofske> How dare you!
14:57 < bridge_> <Merie Komlofske> Center of your universes ha ha
14:59 < bridge_> <totar> Teeworlds coup
15:00 < ChillerDragon> i wouldnt market it as so dramatic just merging a few branches while oy is afk
15:01 < ChillerDragon> to encourage new devs not rage quitting due to no merges happenin g

16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So many bugs in ddnet++ that need urgent fixes ChillerDragon
16:28 < ChillerDragon> xd indeed
16:29 < ChillerDragon> but i kinda put ddnet++ on hold to focus on 0.7 :p
16:31 < ChillerDragon> adding more bugs to ddnet++ is more fun than getting ddnet 0.7 to actually work but i gotta finish that shit
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah bugs in ddnet++ are the greatest, I'm a huge supporter of it
16:44 < ChillerDragon> omg which mf added these integration tests to ci
16:44 < ChillerDragon> pain in da ass
16:44 < ChillerDragon> how am i supposed to work with this output https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/uz

17:00 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> latest build crashes on Vulkan for some reason, openGL works fine
17:00 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>  I vulkan: acquire next image failed -1000000000
17:00 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>  I vulkan: surface lost
17:07 < ChillerDragon> @
17:07 < ChillerDragon> @Merie Komlofske wtf is that link
17:07 < ChillerDragon> does it show as image on discord?
17:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That you mean it crashed inside the GPU. Did you change drivers?
17:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can you revert to the previous commit to verify
17:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thats why i mentionedit, previous worked/works fine
17:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> neither changed/updated drivers
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well worked != Works xd
17:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> it worked before, and works when i try it now - sry üòÑ
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So you checked previous client after the crash?
17:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> yes
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
17:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Linux?
17:24 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Distributor ID: Ubuntu
17:24 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Description:    Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
17:24 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Release:        22.04
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Install Vulkan validation layers
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Start client with `dbg_gfx 4`
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then it should report validation errors
17:26 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> vulkan: warning: requested presentation mode was not available. falling back to mailbox / fifo relaxed
17:26 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i have absolutely no idea what that means
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That means you probably use Wayland xd
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Forced vsync
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But that's not an error
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Have you done
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apt install 
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vulkan-validationlayers
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Before starting
17:30 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> after running that and update && upgrade, im getting "the device surfac format feching failed" now
17:30 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> life is pain
17:30 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> previous version STILL opens and runs fine btw
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh that's weird. Do you compile previous version or use from website?
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have the feeling this is an sdl2 issue
17:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> compiled both myself
17:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> its weird.
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes very weird.. have u tried to restart PC xd
17:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> üòÑ i will
17:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> but before ima test the prebuild website version
17:35 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> interesting, i rebuild the latest commit seperately just now aswell as tried the website version, both run fine for some reason
17:35 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> maybe my cmake did some shinanigans
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If it works, it works xd

19:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sad day for everyone
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Bram Moolenaar was Vim's creator/maintainer/benevolent-dictator for life. Early this morning his family shared sad news on the Vim-announce Google Group. "It is with a heavy heart that we have to inform you that Bram Moolenaar passed away on 3 August 2023." Moolenaar was 62 years old, and died from "a medical condition that progressed quickly over the last few weeks."
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > "Bram dedicated a large part of his life to VIM and he was very proud of the VIM community that you are all part of."
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Anyone who's used Vim has seen evidence of Moolenaar's generosity. "Vim is Charityware," Moolenaar wrotes in its pioneering license. "You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda." Moolenaar pioneered the concept of charityware decades ago, and also helped to popularize its adoption. To this day Vim users can still view the license by typing the command :help Uganda or :help 
21:46 < bridge_> <Voxel> i dont think games should be able to be that big
21:50 < bridge_> <teero777> is there a tunezone for hammer range?
21:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> No, you can't tune hammer range
21:55 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm...
21:56 < bridge_> <teero777> is there a tune for hammer range?
22:36 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Sad. I am using neovim. I wonder what the future of vim will be.
22:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> neovim is long a fork fork of vin

22:54 < bridge_> <cauldron1> From an interview from 2022 üôÇ
22:54 < bridge_> <cauldron1> 
22:54 < bridge_> <cauldron1> >Evrone: In your opinion, is software development closer to art or science? Does it allow deviations from traditional techniques or do you have to strictly follow the main direction?
22:54 < bridge_> <cauldron1> 
22:55 < bridge_> <cauldron1> >Bram: I do not see much science in software development. Science implies there is proof that something is true. In software, there are a lot of opinions and there is experience, but is there any proof that one programming language is better than another? Is there proof that object-oriented programming results in better productivity? Most proofs are about performance measurements, and there are statistics, but hardly any relation to what languag
