00:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: a wild blogpost appear on hn :)
10:42 <@deen> heinrich5991: surprised me that it made it to the frontpage
11:02 < FreddyJoeBob> Hi
11:02 <+FreddyJoeBob> thx
11:04 <+FreddyJoeBob> well who is connected?$*
11:30 <@deen> FreddyJoeBob: hi
11:31 <+FreddyJoeBob> how are you?
11:31 <@deen> Fine, thanks. How are you, FreddyJoeBob ?
11:31 <+FreddyJoeBob> fine too ^^
11:31 <+FreddyJoeBob> do you know a litlle about making tilesets?
11:32 <@deen> Fixed size, you can use a grid in gimp, i think it's 64x64 pixels for each tile. keep a copy of the original file, then run it through dilate and tileset_borderfix (I think)
11:33 <@deen> both available in the mapping graphics tools here: https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
11:33 <@deen> there is probably a tutorial in the ddnet forum
11:33 <+FreddyJoeBob> thx ^^
11:34 <@deen> Tutorials section: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewforum.php?f=16
11:34 <+FreddyJoeBob> thx
11:34 <+FreddyJoeBob> i will understand what is the problem with my tile set
11:35 <@deen> Are you a DDNet player? I don't remember seeing you around
11:35 <+FreddyJoeBob> well i'm new
11:36 <+FreddyJoeBob> the last update of teeworlds was in 2013
11:37 <+FreddyJoeBob> So when i saw DDNet i take it like the continuation of teeworlds
11:39 <@deen> Not really
11:39 <@deen> I consider DDRace/DDNet a totally different game, that just happens to be implemented as a TW mod
11:41 <+FreddyJoeBob> well i saw that
11:41 <+FreddyJoeBob> ddrace is no more a shooter game
11:50 <+FreddyJoeBob> well i'm sorry but don't realy find how make a tile set
11:50 <+FreddyJoeBob> there isn't any special tutorial for that
11:51 <@deen> There's a bit about tilesets here: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2419
11:51 <@deen> But generally, what do you need a tutorial for? Try opening an existing tileset and experiment around, see what looks good and works
11:53 <+FreddyJoeBob> that what i were doing
11:53 <@deen> and what's the problem?
11:54 <@deen> There's also this: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=2415
11:55 <+FreddyJoeBob> well i find some interesting things i'm going to try the grid
12:02 <+FreddyJoeBob> hopefully it's only the super tux tileset that i want to port
12:03 <+FreddyJoeBob> Hey maybe you have the awnser who make a vanilla game type withh DDNet server?
12:05 <@deen> FreddyJoeBob: yeah, i responded to your forum post already
12:05 <@deen> Just use the Teeworlds server, not DDNet
12:05 <@deen> DDNet server can only run DDNet game type
12:07 <+FreddyJoeBob> Because there is interesting features of the ddnet server
12:07 <+FreddyJoeBob> with ddnet maping
12:07 <+FreddyJoeBob> but they do not exist in the teeworlds 
12:07 <@deen> Right, nothing we can do about that
12:07 <@deen> You should just come over to the dark side and play DDNet instead ;)
12:08 <+FreddyJoeBob> X) do you have cookies in the dark side
12:10 <@deen> We have points you can get addicted to instead of cookies
12:12 <+FreddyJoeBob> oki doki X)
12:13 <+FreddyJoeBob> i'm pretty sure if we work in the source code we can have both vanilla and ddrace mod
12:13 <+FreddyJoeBob> but for now on i just don't know
12:15 <@deen> Yeah, you could. But no one is going to reimplement all the removed Vanilla code in DDNet
12:16 <+FreddyJoeBob> well maybe with some mod
12:18  * Leeo97one slaps FreddyJoeBob around a bit with a large fishbot
12:18 <+Leeo97one> Thanks but what's that?
20:46 <+Ryozuki> deen is fra server down?
20:46 <+Ryozuki> releasing a map and it still didn't said it's updated, though all others did
20:58 <@deen> FRA?
20:58 <@deen> we have a FRA server?^^
20:58 <@deen> ah, the main server is still called FRA in git-update.sh
20:58 <@deen> well, it takes a lot longer than the other ones
20:59 <@deen> I see CPU is still busy on FRA
20:59 <@deen> not it might be finished
20:59 <@deen> now*
20:59 <+Ryozuki> Traceback (most recent call last):
20:59 <+Ryozuki>   File "scripts/releases.py", line 46, in <module>
20:59 <+Ryozuki>     date, server, y = x
20:59 <+Ryozuki> ValueError: need more than 2 values to unpack
20:59 <+Ryozuki> this is the error
20:59 <@deen> yeah, you made a mistake!
21:00 <+Ryozuki> :o really?
21:00 <@deen> ep
21:00 <@deen> yep
21:00 <@deen> the ~/servers/releases file is broken
21:00 <@deen> maybe a typo in the map name or you forgot to git add the map
21:00 <+Ryozuki> lol
21:00 <+Ryozuki> i didnt forgot to add it to git
21:00 <@deen> remove the first line in ~/servers/releases, fix the underlying cause, try again
21:00 <+Ryozuki> and im checking it and i don't see nothing wrong O.o
21:01 <@deen> ~/servers/maps/run_inTheHell.map does not exist
21:01 <@deen> so you clearly did something wrong
21:01 <+Ryozuki> mm but i did git add maps/name xD
21:01 <+Ryozuki> weird, ill reupload
21:02 <@deen> you might have forgotten to move it from test/maps
21:02 <+Ryozuki> na i use a script hmh gave me since time ago
21:02 <@deen> then the script is broken!
21:02 <+Ryozuki> no it isnt!
21:02 <+Ryozuki> i made lot of uploads xD
21:02 <+Ryozuki> releases*
21:22 <+Ryozuki> it was map name typo
21:23 <+Ryozuki> i copied it from planned map releaes and it was wrong name there, my bad, i should have copied it from file directly
