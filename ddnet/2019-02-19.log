07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> No „install Linux“ suggestions yet ? xd
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The only things that you miss from your C drive are cringe images ? xd
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Next time your Windows breaks and you have important files on the C: drive use a live Linux USB stick to recover them before reinstalling
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon i dont expect him to be able to use linux xd
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> ok so first off that you want to do is
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> not use windows
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> not use mac too, @onby don't use cancer pc
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> NO U
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you got it deen :danAmazing:
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @Im 'corneum false. Ninja also doesn't work, making e.g. Kobra 4's ninja solo a pain when the ping is high
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I think it should be make to buffer as well...
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think i got why. all wepons that dont buffer in freeze also dont buffer up when you are unfreeze and you have to click again to shoot.
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> so, gun (without jetpack) is also not buffered?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i didnt test it
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> just tested, you are right
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I think it is expected, since when you are hammered inside freeze you get unfrozen for around a tick, and nothing special happens
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I think it is expected, since when you are hammered inside freeze you just get unfrozen for around a tick, and nothing special happens
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> would be dangerous to change that now tho. you could create long hammer chains in freeze.
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> it could be an option
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> "sv_old_hammer_in_freeze"
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hmm
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> also, for gun and ninja it makes more sense to buffer
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> waaait, can't two (more) tees hammer each other reciprocially with that? like A->B->C->D->A
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> waaait, can't two (or more) tees hammer each other reciprocially with that? like A->B->C->D->A
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes ninja makes sense. id like to know why the dev decided it that way because its been like it since forever
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes thats what i meant. and the hammer through double wall in twists new video would be super easy and open up many cheats in older maps.
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> it wasn't a decision, it just happened
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nah i think they did it to make more differences within the weapons
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I mean, if it shoots automatically when held, it just shoots at the first possible time while in freeze
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> which is for the one tick when hammered
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> and when it doesn't shoot automatically, it just checks if the user pressed the button last tick, and attempts to shoot only then
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that also wasnt the casse btw until deen changed it.
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> ah.
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i mean it was random with buffer weapons when you got hammered in freeze
13:54 <@deen> All I did was make the client send input more often when you are in freeze
13:54 <@deen> Since some pros were already doing that with binds
13:54 <@deen> and people who didn't know had a disadvantage in speed runs
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how can you rapid shoot with binds
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> deen: does it work with vanilia client then?
13:55 <@deen> dunno, never tried it, just saw others use it
13:55 <@deen> nope, it's a client feature
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes i saw that in some clients. you can hold hammer and it rapidly shoots
13:56 <@deen> https://ddnet.tw/client/ "Feature: Inputs always work in freeze" even with a video
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> deen can you remove the freeze wobble when you hold buttons server side? i heard noby did just that
13:57 <@deen> I tried it server side but then moving in and out of freeze is laggy instead
13:57 <@deen> it has to be done client side
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it hard. would be cool for laser-on-edge kind of parts
13:58 <@deen> we even had it server side for a day or so
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i didnt
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its a fng2 feature
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Im 'corneum it sends fake tuning to frozen tees that tells their clients they cant move or hook
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i just copied it to my server and its not a true fix, the true fix would be adjusting the prediction of the client
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and its not laggy, its just unnecessarily complicated
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> rotating tiles are messed up in the latest client. it only mirrors up and down when i press T or R
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> thats litterally what rotating is most of the time
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i cant put sideways stoppers is what i meant
17:44 <+Learath2> Didn't we have proper freeze prediction on the client for a while? I think people didn't like it that much
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> make it optional
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> If ure muted you cant lock ur team
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like watching where im moving frozen
21:29 <+Learath2> @Konsti, have you considering not getting muted?...
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Dat answer ...
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> This is clearly a bug I thought all chat commands work even tho you are muted? Or is this some sort of feature?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> what was the browser teeworlds website again
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> ?
23:17 <+Learath2> @worstwish, teewebs, if it's still alive that is
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> well
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> it seems like its almost dead
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> because it doesnt connect to servers
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> it just says connecting
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> even tho it finds them
23:18 <+Learath2> did you wait, it uses some pretty weird networking, takes a bit to connect
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> ill see
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> can you try if it connects foru
23:22 <+Learath2> nah, neither the beta nor the normal client connects
23:22 <+Learath2> eeeee: idk if you still want to keep it alive but it's borked :P
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> tell the man to fix it
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> right now
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> ive acknowledged it so it means its good
23:29 <+eeeee> idk, i was pretty demotivated by the 0.7 release. maybe i'll fix it next year
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> its already next year fam
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Learath2 lol are u a troll?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It can happen to be muted even the most innocent people and thats a bug i just report here.
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And its really not hard to fix
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then fix it? :D
