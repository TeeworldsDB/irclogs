01:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet is based of 0.6.4
01:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> theyre hard forks but the same people contributed to both
01:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but tw development has been on maintence mode
01:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet is a better client in every way
01:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (and ddnet-insta a better server)
01:07 < bridge_> <sqwinix> What about 0xf? Despite the closed source, it's pretty good.
01:07 < bridge_> <sqwinix> But there is still a difference?
01:07 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> uhh
01:07 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> that is what i said
01:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> its based on ddnet, idk what it adds
01:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> no clue
01:10 < bridge_> <sqwinix> It's just that in the distant past, someone told me that TeeWorlds is easier than DDNet and I was like, oh well.
01:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe ddnet has more stuff
01:11 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I hate udp
01:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont have to touch that
01:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont have to touch networking
01:12 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Udp is such a piece of crap.
01:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> uhh
01:12 < bridge_> <sqwinix> For me
01:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> not really
01:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> in unix atleast you do udp and tcp in the same way, you just have to deal with udp being connectionless
01:13 < bridge_> <sqwinix> My opinion is that my internet is just bad, and a lot of packets are lost and some kind of crap is happening to me
01:13 < bridge_> <sqwinix> on screen
01:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> uhh
01:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> totally
01:15 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> UDP is nice and good. If you want to be angry at something for misbehaving when packets get dropped you should complain about Teeworlds
01:16 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It is the application developer's responsibility to handle problems, and that's a feature not a bug
01:16 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I know, but in my opinion, if ddnet (including teeworlds) was available, then it would be better for people who have bad internet or frequent connection problems.
01:17 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> "was available"?
01:17 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I mean tcp would be
01:17 < bridge_> <sqwinix> was
01:17 < bridge_> <sqwinix> my English is bad
01:17 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Sry
01:17 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> TCP DDNet would be awfully laggy
01:19 < bridge_> <sqwinix> UDP It's more suited to dynamic shooters. TweeWorlds is a shooter, and the concept of DDNet is about completing maps.

01:19 < bridge_> <sqwinix> UDP Is more suited to dynamic shooters. TeeWorlds is a shooter, and the concept of DDNet is about completing maps.
01:20 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The Teeworlds server is strict on the arrival time of packets and it doesn't handle rollback, so your inputs would get dropped just as often
01:22 < bridge_> <Teero> lol and what exactly is the difference between a shooter and a time based coop game lmao?
01:22 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, I don't know. Minecraft, for example, has a good network, even though it's both dynamic and not. But it's silly to compare a 3D game with a 2D one, which have two different ideas.
01:23 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, think about it yourself.
01:23 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Although
01:23 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Hm
01:24 < bridge_> <Teero> There is 0 difference, since both rely on immediate response from other players.
01:24 < bridge_> <Teero> There is 0 difference, since both rely on immediate responses from other players.
01:24 < bridge_> <Teero> The dimensionality of the game has nothing to do with the networking...
01:25 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Minecraft doesn't send inputs to the server, it sends positions
01:25 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Exactly
01:25 < bridge_> <Teero> are you suggesting this for ddnet?
01:26 < bridge_> <sqwinix> No, but it would just be interesting to see something like that.
01:26 < bridge_> <sqwinix> In fact, then it would be possible to make a fly
01:26 < bridge_> <Teero> This game is open source xd
01:26 < bridge_> <Teero> You can't rely on the client to send you anything valid.
01:26 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you send positions then the server has to reverse engineer those to get the inputs that created those positions
01:27 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> because else it would be trivial to make fly hacks or even the power to teleport freely around the map
01:27 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we have enough of an issue with cheats as it is
01:27 < bridge_> <sqwinix> However, everything has its pros and cons.
01:27 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What you really want is for DDNet to have rollback
01:28 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, essentially there's not much you can do (in terms of cheats)
01:28 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> then you can lose a few packets and send the info late and the server can compensate (within reasonable bounds)
01:28 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the current structure of the game already inherently prevents a whole class of cheats
01:28 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so in that sense we're already doing a ton
01:29 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Compared to games that send a position rather than an input, those games that send a position have more cheating capabilities.
01:30 < bridge_> <sqwinix> It would be interesting to see this.
01:30 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah that's what I said
05:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ddnet has spaghetti code. Which means it uses lots of useless abstractions which make you navigate around between many files and has no clear hierarchy which makes e.g. client know about component a and b, while component b also knows about a. It still uses quite a lot of pointers without nonnull tag, which is oldschool and unsafe.
05:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
05:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The server code is the worst. It uses many cpp hacks and just throws in random stuff everywhere. It's not hard to understand in a sense that you'll find the code that makes your tee freeze. But changing it probably unintended also changes something else

06:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you want to start, change something you can visible see.. On server you could add a new tile, or change behavior of something. On ui you could change ui or other rendering code
07:24 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> very cool chat
07:24 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1424265872259813507/image.png?ex=68e35275&is=68e200f5&hm=718eb57a1fb366af4af693a54ad2bb57de63e31cf3b6c0533f15152903337845&
08:57 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> what is the antiping predictive margin
09:43 < bridge_> <remakepower> Minecraft run on the 20 ticks per seconds by default.
09:43 < bridge_> <remakepower> Minecraft runs on the 20 ticks per seconds by default.
09:43 < bridge_> <remakepower> Teeworlds runs on the 50 ticks per seconds by default.
09:47 < bridge_> <totar> I've seen so much worse, the server is pretty bad but the client is passable.
09:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's okish. But i dont like that we have so many interfaces without any gain
09:48 < bridge_> <totar> I think if you removed all fear you could clean it up pretty well
09:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why is there a client interface and graphics interface and components interface
09:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> where components is the least bad of the three
09:48 < bridge_> <totar> that's true
09:48 < bridge_> <totar> the "client interface" is the worst part for sure
09:48 < bridge_> <zhn> for whatever reason server looks better for me, just because it's smaller and has no ties that tight between "components", decomposing and abstracting client components will be much worse as process imho
09:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> server code has traps
09:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you change a single line of code and your whole server is a different game
09:49 < bridge_> <totar> this is extremely true
09:49 < bridge_> <totar> it's like it was designed for maximum fragility
09:50 < bridge_> <zhn> had never experienced it so bad honestly
09:50 < bridge_> <zhn> only when i just did start digging in server code i suppose
09:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well we talk about ddnet right
09:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not teeworlds
09:50 < bridge_> <zhn> yes
09:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> even tho teeworlds is also not the best code
09:51 < bridge_> <zhn> ah i can understand what you say now, yep
09:51 < bridge_> <zhn> keeping ddrace features working and doing new/fix others is a huge pain in ass
09:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
09:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and additionally teeworlds introduced some weird hacks to reuse memory and shit like that.
09:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not impossible to understand. but it's useless spaghetti
09:52 < bridge_> <zhn> first step of ddnet server mod is to remove every ddrace feature :justatest:
09:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> saves you 1us
09:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> teero optimization
09:52 < bridge_> <melon> :kek:
09:53 < bridge_> <remakepower> That's why I like vanilla teeworlds as the code base.
09:54 < bridge_> <totar> you should see the depressing state that my favorite game is in. It makes every bit of ddnet code look like it was written by god, and yet we keep working on it anyway.
09:54 < bridge_> <totar> 
09:54 < bridge_> <totar> every object in the game inherits this class
09:54 < bridge_> <totar> <https://github.com/TheFlyingFoool/DuckGameRebuilt/blob/master/DuckGame/src/DuckGame/Thing.cs>

09:56 < bridge_> <totar> btw that first class, has a few dozen members that ONLY affect the last class. but every object gets them anyway
09:56 < bridge_> <melon> duck.cs being almost 5.4K loc
09:56 < bridge_> <melon> :megupuke:
09:58 < bridge_> <totar> this is only a small fraction of the terribleness, every individual component of the game is equally bad
10:01 < bridge_> <totar> the UI, the networking, The control input, all of it is unsavageably tangled and bad
10:02 < bridge_> <totar> when you want to add a new menu you need to edit like 4 files in 6 total locations, and if you forget any of them the whole menu system will break randomly in subtle ways across the whole game
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ouch
11:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anybody know why i cant ssh to my local network server lol

11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the router
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i can reach the web from the home server via the public ip
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but not the local ip lol
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh i can with local too
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hmm
12:58 < bridge_> <zhn> no vanilla teeworods lacks a lot of qol code changes, it's just uncomfortable to go back to vanilla 0.6/0.7 sources

14:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** woah `fix_style.py` just turned compiling code into this `#include <game/server //entities/character.h>`
14:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** could also have let a llm format my code if i want hallucinations wtf
14:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** does anyone know how to please clang complaining that it can not check the format string here?
14:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), GameServer()->Loc("%d players needed to start a spree.", Killer), g_Config.m_SvSpreePlayers);`
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** seems to work for ddnet client code with `Localize()`
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `warning: format not a string literal, argument types not checked [-Wformat-nonliteral]`
14:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** like why does this one not warn but mine does? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/9329e0e0a4ccc3dbf3f0ba2cbc707a10eaece483/src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp#L609-L610

14:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but it hides the lint :C 
14:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i like the lint
14:47 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i think there is no other way, as str_format does not know you return a string with a formatter from Loc
14:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how does it work on the client side then?
14:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> wasnt there like some differences
14:49 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> ah
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller why do you not create a str_format overload that directly takes an array
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> instead of passing sizeof(aBuf)
14:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** you mean Loc taking a format string?
14:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i struggle to think it throught but doesnt it just move the lint error from call site to implementation then?

15:06 < bridge_> <Teero> Could it not write your super complex refraction shader?
15:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean that one was coded when i still had codex :lol:
15:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but dunno it just does everything bad i ask it to do
15:07 < bridge_> <Teero> xd
15:07 < bridge_> <melon> did you really vibecode the glass shader
15:07 < bridge_> <melon> :kekw:
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i used 60% brain, 40% vibe
15:13 < bridge_> <Teero> I wish lain would come true
15:14 < bridge_> <Teero> Using 60% of your brain to press 2 key combos is crazy work
15:14 < bridge_> <Teero> imagine what 90% could do
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean yes, that was my workday. give me my money
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as if 90% of your ui isnt vibe coded as well
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in ddnet-rs i made everything by hand
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sweating to death
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gpt 4 was too bad in rust and especially egui
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and gpt5.. you saw the analog clock xDDD
15:20 < bridge_> <Teero> xD
15:20 < bridge_> <Teero> ~40% maybe
15:21 < bridge_> <Teero> At first it was really bad because it had no idea about the cimgui wrappers so it got everything wrong
15:21 < bridge_> <Teero> So I had to write a lot of it by hand and then give it that so it knew what to write x
15:21 < bridge_> <Teero> So I had to write a lot of it by hand and then give it that so it knew what to write xd
16:49 < bridge_> <manikoo> vibe coding
16:52 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> pretty sure some servers which are currently listed as communities do provide p2w bonuses
16:52 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1424409002774757527/image.png?ex=68e3d7c2&is=68e28642&hm=58bd5d1634133e035bd08b9edff905ebaddde1e2d0d56130a527b8c40ca51ceb&
16:53 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> good change tho i hate p2w we gotta fight against it
16:58 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> need that crazy big donator bonus like osu! has
16:58 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> instead of a pale yellow nickname in chat you get a bright yellow one
16:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> people would go crazy for a badge or name color
16:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but we dont have accounts
17:25 < bridge_> <pilonpl> yeah
17:25 < bridge_> <pilonpl> even i would donate then
17:25 < bridge_> <pilonpl> right now it's more convenient to buy random games on steam
17:44 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> which servers ARENT p2w?
18:03 < bridge_> <byfox> This rule saves us from servers like clbs2, because you can even buy "super" there
18:17 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the ones you pay not to be pay to win.
19:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> nuklear hater
19:03 < bridge_> <Teero> what?

19:54 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Hi everyone, how are y’all doing?
19:55 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> good wby

20:19 < bridge_> <Teero> imgui is just way better
20:19 < bridge_> <sqwinix> @qxdfox can you check dm pls
20:20 < bridge_> <sqwinix> https://github.com/FamiliarCougar/2pacalypse
20:20 < bridge_> <qxdfox> I won't work on anything other than my client and server
20:22 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, you probably misunderstood. I mean the mod will be installed on my servers as official. Like 0xf on TF.
20:22 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> Souly stuff
20:22 < bridge_> <sqwinix> idk
20:22 < bridge_> <qxdfox> You can use my mod for anything you'd like but I won't work on anything I don't want on my servers
20:23 < bridge_> <qxdfox> I won't even have that much time for anything anyways since schools deciding to touch me
20:23 < bridge_> <sqwinix> ok
20:24 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> you mean those TeeUnion servers?
20:24 < bridge_> <byfox> Yes...
20:25 < bridge_> <sqwinix> You can use cheats on TeeUnion
20:25 < bridge_> <sqwinix> You can use cheats on Tiiunion
20:25 < bridge_> <sqwinix> but not all
20:25 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> xd those servers were removed from custom communities database for that
20:25 < bridge_> <sqwinix> hvh lol
20:25 < bridge_> <byfox> This is prohibited by the master server rules
20:26 < bridge_> <melon> i cba anymore, please stop posting screenshots with the n word in them, is it that hard -.-
20:26 < bridge_> <sqwinix> its gif
20:26 < bridge_> <sqwinix> this is actually written

20:27 < bridge_> <melon> thanks, deleted that and your response.
20:28 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Honestly, TeeUnion pisses me off. I used to play there a little, and it was through sweat, so to speak. Because every second or third person is a cheater.
20:28 < bridge_> <sqwinix> NOOOO
20:28 < bridge_> <sqwinix> WHY
20:28 < bridge_> <sqwinix> i wanna cry
20:30 < bridge_> <nouaa> hi, is there a place I could find tw mods ported to DDNet? like gctf, ictf..

20:31 < bridge_> <nouaa> hmm alright thanks, will take a look!
20:31 < bridge_> <nouaa> Trouly
20:32 < bridge_> <byfox> They must be removed from the master server if they have not already been removed according to the rules of the main server
20:32 < bridge_> <byfox> 
20:32 < bridge_> <byfox> https://ddnet.org/rules/master/
20:32 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> NO U
20:33 < bridge_> <sqwinix> thx
20:34 < bridge_> <byfox> They must be removed from the master server if they have not already been removed according to the rules of the master server
20:34 < bridge_> <byfox> 
20:34 < bridge_> <byfox> https://ddnet.org/rules/master/
20:34 < bridge_> <sqwinix> so, we can report them?
20:34 < bridge_> <sqwinix> but we need proof
20:34 < bridge_> <byfox> We need accurate evidence.
20:36 < bridge_> <byfox> Look in his discord, maybe there's some evidence to support this
20:40 < bridge_> <sqwinix> lol

20:41 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Why are only certain cheats banned and not all? The first guy there said he is krx
20:42 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> don't mention cheat client names, please

21:20 < bridge_> <sqwinix> guys, give me some ideas for a name for the multi mod.
21:20 < bridge_> <sqwinix> guys, give me some ideas for a name for the multi mod
21:21 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I have no idea
21:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds_multi_mod_mod
21:30 < bridge_> <sqwinix> crazy name
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah here, my template:
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds_<mod_name>_mod
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Example:
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> minus instead of underscore is ofc fine too
21:33 < bridge_> <kebscs> ddnet-insta
21:33 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> whats with his nipples lmao
21:35 < bridge_> <zhn> whats multimod
21:36 < bridge_> <zhn> frozen
21:36 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> what's multi mod?
21:38 < bridge_> <Teero> it symbolizes melon
21:39 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> melons shirts have nipple holes?
21:41 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I want to make a mod like ddnet-insta, but with steroids. I'll also learn C++.
21:41 < bridge_> <Teero> when he flexes it rips them
21:41 < bridge_> <melon> 👍
21:41 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What are the steroids? How do you get more insta than insta?
21:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> @blaiszephyr is that one of your superpowers?
21:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> making nipple holes at will
21:42 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Your opponent dies in the past
21:44 < bridge_> <sqwinix> "On steroids" is a Russian proverb meaning "improved" or something like that. I want to make a mod that will be like a mix of mods that has everything, and even more.
21:47 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> to me "on steroids" means something like "more intense", not just general improvement
21:47 < bridge_> <zhn> yeah same, didn't understand the real purpose of mod
21:47 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but at least I understand your idea more now
21:49 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, like the son of F-DDrace, ddnet-insta, 0xF
21:53 < bridge_> <sqwinix> @vahemaaa I remembered you
21:53 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> you know me?
21:53 < bridge_> <sqwinix> yes
21:53 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> from where
21:53 < bridge_> <sqwinix> You had an f-ddrace server and you helped my friend set up a ddnet server.
21:54 < bridge_> <sqwinix> and you are from Turkey
21:54 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> yes i try to help about these things if someone need 😅
21:55 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> what is your friends name
21:56 < bridge_> <sqwinix> It was a long time ago, I don't remember anymore (he changed his nickname)
21:56 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> hmm understood
21:56 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> you know how to code ddnet?
22:00 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> if so, can you tell me how did you learn to code ddnet
22:02 < bridge_> <sqwinix> i am learning yer
22:02 < bridge_> <sqwinix> i am learning yet
22:02 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> how u learn
22:03 < bridge_> <sqwinix> learncpp.com
22:04 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> thanks
22:04 < bridge_> <sqwinix> + studying the source code of ddnet
22:04 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> how u do that
22:05 < bridge_> <sqwinix> You look through the source code and draw conclusions
22:05 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> hmm ok
22:15 < bridge_> <zhn> well if you want to make something like 0xf you will need a great amount of both cpp and ddnet modding experience, bless you though
22:22 < bridge_> <filoqcus> At first, it will be difficult to understand how ddnet works, and of course you will need to learn cpp
22:22 < bridge_> <filoqcus> https://tenor.com/view/pipotam-baby-hippo-hippo-wash-shower-gif-3406421565683572068
22:22 < bridge_> <filoqcus> :owo:
22:32 < bridge_> <manikoo> pipo supremasy
22:36 < bridge_> <sqwinix> yeah, but its wll be opensource. So maybe someone can help
22:37 < bridge_> <blazulite> titopam
22:37 < bridge_> <sqwinix> etc
22:39 < bridge_> <zhn> xd a huge mistake
22:40 < bridge_> <sqwinix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1424496532190793840/9k.png?ex=68e42947&is=68e2d7c7&hm=70342ee2de2fe9b834113c15be8d05534a31a741d8f6527689aa9b6bd7fc28d6&
22:50 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> why tho
22:59 < bridge_> <sqwinix> btw, why do you think so?
