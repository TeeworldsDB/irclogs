06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> bro wtf
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> visual studio fucking sucks
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> rider for the win
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> what is rider lul
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing, use vim
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish github notifications redirected you when someone force pushes after the notif
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its so annoying

10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen serverlist is not showing the flag on finished maps
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works for me
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> indicate map finish turned off for some reason
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> antiping is always bugged
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> @noby what do you do to combat imposters in fng destroying other users KD?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ChillerDragon ban them
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> manually?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah do u have a better idea
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> besides using ip ranges to guess if its really a faker
18:43 <+ChillerDragon> oof ofc i would never thing of something stoopid like ip ranges :/
18:43 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609954816.png
18:44 <+ChillerDragon> its this time of the day again where ``pkill`` hangs forever because firefox hang in crash it cant be closed
18:44 <+ChillerDragon> xd
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> well ``htop`` is not starting either
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> any ideas?
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> reboot it is
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why doesn't /pause stop time on solo maps?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> pause was made for it, no?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> pause is for spectating
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then why is there also /spec
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on some maps, you despawn your character with s/
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /spec
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> anyway my question was: why doesn't /pause stop time on solo maps?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> pause is pause ðŸ˜„
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> break
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> then you would have to pause tee
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> frame by frame input :justatest:
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to simply answer that question: pause doesn't pause your time because it never did. I have the feeling that this wasn't a question, actually, though, but a suggestion
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this is my indignation, not a question, i guess
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why indignation?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it does sound exploitable to be able to stop time
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> should probably add some time and at that point i think it would annoy some people that use it regularly
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> on solo maps? really?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye, if added it would need to be very specific things like must be standing on a tile, no nades/weapons in play
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or else there'd probs be exploits
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> every tee on solo map has his own world
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they can be paused, just whole projectile collection and tee will pause
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> remember this /pause on twplus servers?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it just paused gameplay
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think u could pause on rly hard parts and plan movements in advance, etc
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> even if we suppose that pausing the world is perfectly done, it might enable setups that would be hard otherwise
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tees don't have their own worlds
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I worked on making that happen for ddnet7 but it's not trivial. In reality teams all share the same gameworld
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddnet 2
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ðŸ‘€
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey, then it will just check grounded and so on like louis suggested
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "so on" is where trouble happens
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can never quite know you got the "so on" part right. All 3 of us reviewed the practice feature before merging it, there still were mistakes made in the "so on" part
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey? group of testers or test server will be pretty good thing
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do release candidates now, about 3 people check them. In reality people don't care to test anything
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think what Learath2 wants to say is that we likely won't implement the feature, as we don't feel confident about it
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its not about "test", it should sound like "hey guys, there are new features, you can see them before release"
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to have a go at it, go ahead, and we'll try to assist you with testing; but you also need to address gameplay concerns first that this might enable new stuff
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes if a rc has cool features i usually do it but otherwise not much
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there really any value in this?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, we have test servers for map testing
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why are features test servers something foreign then
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why are features test servers anything foreign then
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> set some up ðŸ™‚
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> noby's fng is up already xd
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okay I didn't want to press on you or something just any update for you and for us is some kind of risk something can be misconfigured or misunderstood and so on
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we had some very cool new gameplay feature requiring testing it would work. We had servers for the first strong/weak fix we tried, we had servers for telegun.
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This feature would be something so minor people won't even notice. The kind of testing we need for this is rigorous testing trying to break it, the kind Konsti and Sp Someone do and they won't waste their best ideas to report the issues to us. They'll just wait until we release it and they'll abuse it instead ðŸ˜›
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, as heinrich said, if you make it, we'll review it as with any other change. Though I don't really see much value in it as a feature
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> coffee break while long solo map speedrun xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do /save
