01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/commit/165ab18cd230a1450832bef11835234d1627094f if/when you have a minute
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well a couple minutes, but not more then the amount of minutes you can count on two hands
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 style as well?
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't really combed over stlye, but anything you catch would be useful
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/commit/165ab18cd230a1450832bef11835234d1627094f#diff-4c1480841d96bf73e07b29e10fbd394bR465 `m_aName` etc., one tab too many
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I wasn't quite sure how to name those properly
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it leads to a generation of a const char * field, which should be m_pName
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh, then m_p
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but other Netobjs used without the p
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh rly
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not all of them though
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it differs
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `NetArray(NetStringStrict("m_apSkinPartNames"), 6),`
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure what to do
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess network.py needs a once over
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have a dynamic allocation in there
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you mean m_pFilter?
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's one I couldn't figure out how to avoid
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you have any divine inspiration, I'd love to hear it ðŸ˜›
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the size of the amount of commands, right?
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, but the amount of commands can change
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could use an `array<bool>` and use `set_size` there
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would get rid of most of the allocations
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, that'd be great
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you think I should sort the commands btw?
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dunno\
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still unsure about this being it's own system and not just being hooked into the console but I guess I'll make the UI n-command capable and PR this
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Great
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wrote worlds most inefficient scrollbar
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice ðŸ™‚
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon do you have a moment to test?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜„
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/tree/pr_chatcom
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm hosting a server that adds an absurd amount of commands to test
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why me testing tho?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why cnt u test it?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tested it, the more eyes the better
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You might try something I hadn't considered yet
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thought u wanted a windows test or something cuz i do not have a win in reach
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do u have artifcats link?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or do i have to build mi self?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/suites/433729566/artifacts/1515314
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> looks good to me
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol how can wget say 404 but browser finds it
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You probably need to be logged in
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And wget is probably lacking the cookie
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why does it need a cookie?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is downloading artifacts github member only?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To verify that you are logged in to github
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think they changed it to member only because of a potential security thing
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so all the artifacts links i share..
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobody can download it? ðŸ˜„
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bru why did never get any feedback on that
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and why is it a tar.xz inside a zip my unpacking skills are reaching its limits
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where do i find ur srv?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what should i do next in 0.7 that you will later improve? :greenthing:
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :P
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure it's too improved tbh, its still dirtier then I wanted
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki antiping :troll:
