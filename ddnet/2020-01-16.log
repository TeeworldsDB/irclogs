13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ScReeNy @ChillerDragon
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> About the "+" eye emote, just found this:
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/667338445416562688/grid_skins.png
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Seems like it was shown when using ninja, but I'm quite sure that now the `hurt eyes` is used
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it used to be the ninja eye, but now jts just the surprise one
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> afaik
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or as u said, for ninja damage, not sure
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also in the client, this eye is not used. Only the others
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> what eye is used for closed eyes
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the mormal one but compressed
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since teeworlds is on github this eye was never used tho
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (the +)
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> long time didn't happened , i was mapping and same crush appear when i was choosing area to delete :/ (in newest version of ddnet )
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> there is text document with error somewhere ?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah :/
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only in client console
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or when u attach a debugger
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you could also set a logfile but there is none set by default
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``logile filename.txt`` in f1 or your settings
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @texnonik can you consitently reproduce it? if yes then please explain and maybe attach the map you were using
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.blog/2020-01-14-the-github-for-android-beta-is-here/
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> finally
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> iOS when xd
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It’s literally one of the top sites if not number one in my most visited currently
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ios app is really bad imo
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant view code
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is there one?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> No official one huh?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> testflight
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ima wait for rls
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> beta program full :(
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> @ChillerDragon in older versions it happened 25 % of mapping now it happened in 0.001 chance maybe i was too lucky :/
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a crash is a crash
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if it happens in 0.0001% of the cases, its even worse
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because its very hard to debug
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> In older versions it happened with me too many times , i already forgot about it
