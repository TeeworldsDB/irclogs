00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> never
04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> This skin editor is incredibly good
05:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> mine says "failed to find autoexec.cfg"
05:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> and closes
05:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> is it broken or am i just a stupid nobo
05:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> what even is autoexec.cfg
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @abcqwerty like the name implies it is **cfg** settings that are **auto**matically **exec**uted when u launch the game
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :GWfroggyMonkaThink:
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> does ddnet have that
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> yes and the first line of it says "abcqwerty" is gay
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> if u dont believe me check ur client
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> no u
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Brokecdx- use brownbear body and twinbop decoration :feelsamazingman: 
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the system could be good, but its not improved..
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> oh lol lmao
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Brokecdx- why so long awake?
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> i just woke up lol
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> went to bed at 5am?
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> no i stood up 3:30
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> am
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD?
07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> i have different sleep shedules
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> I hope, now official 0.7 will be not less reliable and get updates as often as ddnet, and with community help reach stable state very fast and we all will have a wonderful future and all that.. üòÄ
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Go play 0.7 and give them feedback
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> show them their community is active
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Its bad
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Done xD
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> @heinrich5991 what about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1333 PR it's waits for checking or?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you kinggta?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> nope
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> but i wait this fix üòÉ
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> @heinrich5991 i am kinggta
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how do i compile 0.7 with vs and cmake? do i need to download sdl? if yes what are the next steps?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't. download bam 0.5
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you also need to download sdl and freetype manually
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doesnt bam 4 work?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or wait
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what bam version is for ddnet 9.0.2?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compatible with 4 and 5
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compatible with 0.4 and 0.5
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> really?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where do i get Freetype and sdl?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and how do i Update bam 0.4 to 0.5?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bam: https://github.com/matricks/bam/releases
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sdl: https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> freetype: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=freetype+windows+binary
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> @deen if you have plan to migrate to ddnet with teeworlds 7.0 base i create a mac ban system that i want to you use this in your new ddnet
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can't know the MAC address so you can't ban based on it
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> No you cant find mac from server
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> But you can get mac from client and send it to server
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> Wait i'll give you screenshot
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but you can modify the client to just pretend to have another mac
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If someone writes a bot the first thing they'd do is to randomize the mac address
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and on most network cards you can change the mac address on the fly
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> On my laptop for example I configured it to have a different mac address every time I connect to a network to make tracking me a bit harder
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> oh i didn't think about that
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> so forget mac ban
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> but ddnet and teeworlds ban is very weak
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> all my players can change their ip and even their range ip  address
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N>

14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Thats.... Concerning...
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's Sv3N's custom client
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> PlayerPcName: i like banana :troll: üçå
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> üòÑ
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> @Cellegen me too
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> alright üçå
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 are you sure ddnet 9.0.2 is compatible with bam4 and bam5 i dont think so
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah and nice u use ddg c:
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I'm sure
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bam 0.4 and 0.5* btw
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/DDNetPP/commit/f30bb5a9a6ad3eaa5bd4fab42d21f817a4facecc
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is this ddnet++ commit then?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet++ is 9.0.2 based...
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. then it was added later maybe
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i guess fokkonaut asked for ddnet 9.0.2 because he wants to know if his ddnet++ compiler setup works for 0.7 so your answer might be correct xd
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> someone experience with reactjs?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> @ChillerDragon I looked at your character.cpp in DDNetPP, that's absolutely looks like code "Hell" with more than 10000 lines in one tick method as "Hell" center and million `if` blocks around like "Circles of Hell", pls make something with this
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sowwy
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> code that works is good code
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Faulty we make a new mod for 0.7 either xd
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and make everything in tick functions:feelsamazingman: :feelsamazingman: :feelsamazingman:
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with many if states
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :feelsamazingman: :pepeH:
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon youre right, sherlock
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Faulty the DummyTick function is many thousands of lines long, we shouldve put all that code into a single class. @ChillerDragon we wont do such messy code ever again!
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao wrong
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```if (!m_Var)
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>      m_Var = true;
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> else
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Var = false;```
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be bad code even if it works
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```if (!m_Var)
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>      m_Var = true;
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> else
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     m_Var = false;```
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be bad code even if it works
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> instead use
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Var = !m_Var;
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or 
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Var ^= true;
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :GWchadThonkery:
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :thonkery:
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is it bad
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> too much code
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so using as few lines as possible is best :GWchadMEGATHINK:
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean in many cases yes
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but id say there are possibly things that are good even if not the shortest form of it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so you don‚Äôt know üòÑ
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Code that works is good code? You would be fired at my company if you say that
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> my heart broke
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> its about readability, structure, increase of performance, stability and much more
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how does freetype work?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if it‚Äôs readable and well structured but doesn‚Äôt work
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> The code should work ofc, what is this argument
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> it depends on the situation. 
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> f.e. code where performance is actually needed can be ugly as long as it's faster than the pretty solution (example of a CMS: switch case with > 20 cases to pass the arguments is faster than using the reflection class)
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> in the most case it's about readability and structure so if the employee is leaving another employee can actually work with the code instead of trying to figure out wtf the previous guy tried to do.
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> obviously the code has to work in all cases, not working code is never good code
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> it depends on the situation.

16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Thats why you go solo :3
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Then ur code can work in all messy ways!
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ‚ú™ how to compile 0.7 now? what do i need to do? where to get sdl and freetype? what to do? i cant do it xd
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> U still use bam
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> xD
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> http://matricks.github.io/bam/
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why don‚Äôt you read the docs
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Tho u do need Bam 0.5
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Welp. Seems like theres an error in compiling it xD
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sdl and freetype needed
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nobo
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> download
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut lol heinrich even gave u the links to download
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u need a tutorial to klick on urls?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just never used this stuff
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so sorry xd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> download then
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> them for x86_64
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then in directory "other" in tw directory there is SDL and freetype
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> both need additional directories:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> /include
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> /lib/x64
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in lib/x64 goes the .lib and .dll
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in include goes the  include from the downloads
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u cant find freetype binaries
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/tree/master/freetype
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet has them, just collect the .lib and .dll
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used to checkout the other directory from 0.6 back in the day
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doubt thats a great idea though :D
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it possible to only release server in 0.7?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bam conf=release server
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats the name of the autoexec file in 0.7??
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and doesnt 0.7 has a config_Directory? xd
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where to define a new CNetMsg?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't define any in src/engine/shared/protocol.h
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean something like CNetMsg_Sv_Motd
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `src/engine/shared/protocol_ex_msgs.h` for engine messages and `datasrc/network.py` for `CNetMsg`s
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh sorry, i am on vanilla 0.7 and not ddnet^^
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> forgot to say that
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ahh
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm ok
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> datasrc
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will look at it
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> remember that the tw protocol might be extended in a potential 0.7.1. or similar, so don't clash with these IDs
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks btw, worked
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you read "[9:35 PM] heinrich5991: remember that the tw protocol might be extended in a potential 0.7.1. or similar, so don't clash with these IDs"
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, it was just a test for me
