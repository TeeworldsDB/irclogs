00:13 < bridge_> <Dev7z> too bad that many bot clients already exist
00:13 < bridge_> <Dev7z> (@_voxeldoesart)
00:14 < bridge_> <Dev7z> also can you like unmute me in discord
00:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> why
00:24 < bridge_> <teero777> i tried my best but i dont see a diffrence :justatest:
00:24 < bridge_> <teero777> @robyt3 i tried my best but i dont see a diffrence :justatest:
00:25 < bridge_> <teero777> maybe things are a tiny bit bigger?
00:25 < bridge_> <teero777> idk

08:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why doesnt he speak by itself? lmao
08:38 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Asking for a friend
10:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> It tells you what to do in the screenshot
11:10 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @patiga can your pixelart method be adpated for RGBA images?
11:28 < bridge_> <winston> Which of the moderators can go to
11:28 < bridge_> <winston> on rus server copy playing with a bot
11:29 < bridge_> <winston> on rus server copy love box playing with a bot
11:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> use the #reports channel for that @winston
12:22 < ChillerDragon> watfk why does ``./integration_test.sh --valgrind-memcheck`` max out my bandwith ? xd
12:22 < ChillerDragon> rip my 10mbit conenction
12:27 < ChillerDragon> ryo when fix rust pipeline
12:27 < ChillerDragon> it broken af
14:19 < bridge_> <7mzomalonso> hi
14:19 < bridge_> <7mzomalonso> i want link to join ger 10 whitelist

14:32 < bridge_> <Jurai!> what about to add translate for site?
14:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think with the technology the current website uses it will suck
14:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with javascript maybe
14:51 < bridge_> <patiga> I don't think thats possible, completely transparent pixels are supported but semi-transparent probably only works somewhat if all pixels have the same alpha
15:44 < bridge_> <Jurai!> someone have config to translate the tooltips on editor
16:08 < bridge_> <Jurai!> ?
16:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont translate editor yet
16:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, he is asking if someone can make it happen
16:20 < bridge_> <robyt3> I can do it for the game layer explanations, since it's relatively easy, but I don't feel motivated to add `Localize` for all the tooltips right now
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> editor is also harder to translate probably
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lot of long explanations
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if its really worth it, since the editor itself is not a good place to learn mapping anyway
16:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> Making just the entities layer explanations localizable will add 151 strings. We currently have 574 strings.
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is the question if one should translate the common teeworlds terminilogy
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like let's say hammer fly or similar
16:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think it's better to have one term that everyone uses instead of introducing weird translations
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but u also have to tell that to the translators xD
16:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> :justatest:

17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez stats üò¨
17:15 < bridge_> <bencie.> üò¨
17:36 < ChillerDragon> imagine saying rockert fly if you can translaet it to granatwerfer flug
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> panzerfaust flug
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> german has best military words
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> panzer just sounds so funny for an outsider

18:59 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @robyt3 does it make sense to move the toolbar buttons into the classes (like `CProofMode::RenderToolbarButton`)?
19:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'd lean towards "no" for individual buttons
19:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> Too spread out code could make it unreadable
19:04 < bridge_> <marmare_314> It would make the code a bit more self-contained and would avoid some getters/setters and long inderictions like `MapView()->ProofMode()->m_ProofBorders != CProofMode::PROOF_BORDER_OFF`
19:08 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I think separating `DoToolbarLayers` into functions  would be good either way, the only difference would then be if they belong to some `CToolbar` or the different classes
19:12 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Maybe youre right, I'll add some getters for now, if it turns out to be too much at some point this could still be changed
19:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's makes it harder to understand the UI layout if everything is spread out, but some functions would probably make sense, because `DoToolbarLayers` is pretty long
19:18 < bridge_> <marmare_314> But adding good getters and extracting the actions should already make the function quite short. Then once the input is not part of it anymore I think it should be fine
20:06 < ChillerDragon> jopsti wat are textcontainers?
20:06 < ChillerDragon> can we get docs on that? :)
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buffered text
20:07 < ChillerDragon> wat
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> text that is buffered/cached on the GPU
20:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's not required to be reevaluated every frame
20:08 < ChillerDragon> yea i kinda thought its doing that
20:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
20:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so no docs needed
20:08 < ChillerDragon> okay i guess there is not really more to it 
20:08 < ChillerDragon> yea seems like it
20:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> somewhere in the code (if still exists) is a streamed label
20:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should be very easy to use, almost like a normal label
20:09 < ChillerDragon> ah nice
20:10 < ChillerDragon> yea my chilerbot texts always get super bugged and blurry
20:10 < ChillerDragon> now i was thinking about doing a pr involving text so i decided to do my research aka ask u
20:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs wrong canvas mapping
20:13 < ChillerDragon> idk i usually restart the client that fixes it xd
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i wont blame you.. the whole graphics interface isnt the nicest
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dont want to refactor, bcs im lazzzzy
20:14 < ChillerDragon> pls
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never change a running system üò¨
20:14 < ChillerDragon> if you have ideas
20:14 < ChillerDragon> break it xd
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that 0% fits me
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll start with 0.7 support
20:15 < ChillerDragon> trol
20:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just be future human and use my ddnet client
20:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we can release in 20 years and chillerbotting is directly included
20:15 < ChillerDragon> pog
20:16 < ChillerDragon> in 20years i will already have adopted kids together with lerato
20:16 < ChillerDragon> or im dead
20:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or bots
20:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> both
20:16 < ChillerDragon> poor kids
20:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well they lost their dad... but they still have a second one
20:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so guess not too bad
20:17 < bridge_> <Dev7z> because 300kg mods got angry at him, and he is too lazy to ask from matrix
20:17 < bridge_> <Dev7z> (@jupeyy_keks)
20:17 < ChillerDragon> xd ez
20:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you speak about kio? xd
20:17 < ChillerDragon> infinite dad glitch
20:17 < bridge_> <Dev7z> who is that
20:17 < bridge_> <Dev7z> (@jupeyy_keks)
20:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nvm
20:18 < ChillerDragon> how does it cache on gpu?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> using string compare?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> or memory address?
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, pretty much all text is static
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it u have to manually free it
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u done
20:19 < ChillerDragon> wotf
20:19 < ChillerDragon> u defs gotta review my pr
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pls no xd
20:19 < ChillerDragon> my text is going places
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have to play bg3, have a job and have to code ddnet-pg
20:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's 3 full time jobs
20:20 < ChillerDragon> u dont have a job
20:20 < ChillerDragon> yur in this chat 24/7
20:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tru
20:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm paid by love & air üòè
21:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did smbody change smth about antiping?
21:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in nightly it's very buggy
21:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i hit myself while i cant, it still predicts it like that
21:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (on Hardstyle 2)
21:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1142902958942605332/test.mp4
21:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
21:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why my entities dark xD
21:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well anyway, the glitch is visible
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> is this a public server
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wanna hammer you
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wanna hammer you in game
21:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wanna hit you with a hammer in game
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> aw
21:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> before i rq bcs 0 iq fail
21:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> i dont see devs in game often
21:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i play every day xd
21:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but fake name
21:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> o
21:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and mostly gores
21:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> ok that makes sense
21:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> lol
22:21 < bridge_> <learath2> I watch people with a fake name
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i sometimes join
23:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> I‚Äôve never played the game in my life
23:53 < bridge_> <teero777> reveal :poggers:
23:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> python is a bad fit for sandboxes though. pyjail is a common ctf task
23:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Just 2 interpreted languages that came to my mind that are popular with game modding
