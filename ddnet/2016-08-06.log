17:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] H-M-H opened pull request #524: Store ranks as json on sql-failure & add tool to put them to a database (master...sql_json) https://git.io/v63If
18:00 <+Henningstone> Got a question, how do you do the 64 bit windows builds of ddnet client? For me it always fails linking because of a missing libopusfile-0.lib
19:38 <@deen> Henningstone: yes, i know we're missing that and someone with VS needs to build it for us. We use gcc which doesn't need .lib
19:38 <@deen> So I also can't build the lib file because I'm too stupid to install VS
19:39 <+Henningstone> Ah ok, let's see, maybe I can get that lib file to appear out of my compiler :D
19:42 <@deen> you need to compile libopusfile from source for that
19:43 <@deen> if you get it working, just make a PR to add the file to ddnet
19:51 <+Henningstone> which version should I use? Best we'll have that match...
19:54 <@deen> update all libs to most recent one best :P
19:54 <+Henningstone> Ok ^^
20:14 <+Henningstone> oh damn... They only got a VS project files for VS2015 -.- I've only got 2010 and will certainly not install 2015 for this. So I can only stick to the currently shipped versions (which have 2010 projects) and just add 64 bit windows libs... :/
21:37 <+Henningstone> meh, doesn't seem to work :( I do get a lib, but it is insanely big (about 200kb compared to ddnet's shipped win32 lib with 12kb) and it has a lot of unresolved externals from opus and ogg in it...
