00:04 < savander> weird bug
00:04 < savander> don't know how to reproduce
00:04 < savander> but, when i switched to dummy
00:04 < savander> i don't see and don't hear any effects
00:04 < savander> jump sound, jump clouds
00:04 < savander> hook sounds
01:13 <@deen> aaaaaaargh, spent half a day to find out my left shift in the NES CPU was broken for some values...
01:14 <@deen> I actually printed GBs of cpu data in the last days and compared to other emulators so i was pretty sure i had no bugs in there =/
01:29 <@deen> emscripten works better than expected
01:29 <@deen> nim --gc:none --cc:clang --clang.exe:emcc --clang.linkerexe:emcc --cpu:i386 -o:h.html c hello.nim
02:33 < eeeee> nice
02:41 <@deen> Have it working with SDL2! Get about 1 frame every 5 seconds :P
02:42 <@deen> And keys don't seem to work properly, but Enter, left right should work: http://hookrace.net/nimes.html
02:43 <@deen> I guess I'll see if I can get performance rendering, should be 4 times faster
02:47 < eeeee> i get pretty solid fps in chrome
02:47 < eeeee> vsync rate
02:48 <@deen> wow?
02:50 <@deen> Can't really believe that
02:50 < eeeee> ff is kinda a bit laggy but still maybe 30 fps
02:50 <@deen> what's wrong with my ff and chrome? don't they like 8 year old CPUs?
02:50 < eeeee> probably
02:50 < eeeee> also there are some warnings in browser console
02:51 < eeeee> and it seems that you're not using main loop?
02:51 <@deen> I should be using it
02:51 < eeeee> emscripten_set_main_loop ?
02:51 <@deen> right
02:51 <@deen> oooh
02:52 <@deen> why do i use fps=1 as parameter?...
02:52 < eeeee> huh
02:53 <@deen> ah no, i'm calling with fps=0
02:53 < eeeee> yeah that should be correct
02:55 < eeeee> are you using -O2 ?
02:55 <@deen> -O3
02:55 <@deen> I thought
02:56 <@deen> but i see a warning
02:56 < eeeee> wouldn't hurt to double check that linker also gets -O3
03:01 <@deen> woah, now it's playable in firefox
03:01 <@deen> 60fps at 85% cpu
03:16 <@deen> audio should also work, but can't figure it out right now
03:32 < eeeee> can't jump tho, so i always get rekt by the first mushroom
03:32 < eeeee> or whatever the fuck that is
03:33 < eeeee> so what did you do to make it playable?
03:36 <@deen> jump should be z or y
03:37 <@deen> mostly i did nothing, this stuff just seems to work
03:38 < eeeee> yeah jump is z
03:38 <@deen> x is running faster
03:39 < eeeee> too late, just failed the flag
03:39 <@deen> and i know why audio doesn't work, they broke it in SDL 2.0.4, also for desktop :P
03:41 <@deen> I'm so surprised that this works
03:41 < eeeee> why
03:42 <@deen> because I just wrote this without thinking about JS/web stuff any the necessary changes are a few lines
03:43 <@deen> and then it's in Nim. I haven't seen anyone use Nim seriously for JS
03:44 < eeeee> but why does that matter if it's compiled to c++?
03:44 <@deen> I don't know, lots of stuff that can go wrong
03:45 < eeeee> if anything, that only increases the chance of being js-compatible as it'll likely not use any fancy C/C++ stuff like inline assembly or weird sse, misaligned reads/writes, etc..
03:46 < eeeee> +dynamic linking
03:47 <@deen> well, i had to fix the SDL2 wrapper to work with static linking
14:35 <@deen> anyone want to tell me if this works? http://hookrace.net/nimes/

19:29 < EastByte> deen: does it have anything special?
19:34 <@deen> fewer bugs
19:34 < Learath2> deen: sound ?
19:34 <@deen> right, the desktop version has sound
