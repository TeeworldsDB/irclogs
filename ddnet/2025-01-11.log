00:20 < bridge> <totar> it's for monetary purposes. It would be cracked and distributed very quickly if they didn't use some third party drm.
00:22 < bridge> <totar> many cheat devs know more about windows kernel than the actual microsoft developers who wrote the kernel
00:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> DRM in game cheats is always the funniest thing to me even though it makes perfect sense
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> ok but are ppl really clicking UAC prompts for KRX
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> ok but are ppl really clicking yes on UAC prompts for KRX
00:24 < bridge> <totar> UAC?
00:25 < bridge> <totar> no
00:25 < bridge> <totar> teeworlds does not attract the smart cheat devs
00:25 < bridge> <totar> they're busy making millions/year selling AAA game cheats
00:26 < bridge> <Ewan> right
00:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> make a nested menu out of your keypad binds
07:19 < bridge> <matodor> can't connect to RUS2 location

09:47 < bridge> <drafakiller> The title should have been `Add/Fix language translations for Portuguese`.
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You could theoretically sue all closed source ddnets anyway, because they don't disable the ffmpeg feature xd

10:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Any linux networking pros? I've registered a packet handler for ip packets, but the problem is that `pkt_type` field(shows if the packet is incoming or outgoing) always has value of incoming packet. Can a vm be a reason for this?

10:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The pic looks like incoming traffic tho
10:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> Isn't that the case for a lot of libs where distribution is only allowed under the same license which isn't the case when you sell it ?
10:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> No idea about licensing btw
10:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> I just choose Apache and call It a day
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Selling isn't really the thing. Distribution in any form is. And x264 is not a free format and the implementation of it is GPL source
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> It is most probably a vm thing
10:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> :cat_woah:
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> Check your routing table, see where the default route leads
10:57 < bridge> <learath2> Oh also yeah the screenshot does look like it only has incoming traffic üòÑ
10:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh ye, there's no a single line with destination being a remote address üò¨
10:59 < bridge> <totar> I remember seeing some article about how there are billions of ffmpeg license violations
11:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> New problem, outgoing packets aren't shown xd
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> If I were a multibillionaire I'd donate a billion to help ffmpeg sue everyone
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> Just to be annoying. No other purpose
11:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's a weird hack but I made it work by listening to all the packets and then filtering out the ones I need, instead of registering the handler only for ip packets :\
12:06 < bridge> <filoqcus> @blaiszephyr How to change gametype color in server list?
12:16 < bridge> <avolicious> We dont have ffmpeg üôÇ
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For servers it doesn't apply anyway, since they don't distribute anything.
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With AGPL that would be different again tho
