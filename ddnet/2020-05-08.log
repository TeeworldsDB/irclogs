17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> cant compile on Windows ðŸ˜¦
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> made a post here https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765&p=68316#p68316
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which version are you compiling?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do provide a FindCrypt.cmake which you seem to be missing
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also you can't use bash to generate MSYS Makefiles
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can but it's finding g++ which is an issue
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you first need to decide whether you want to compile with `MinGW and gcc` or `VS and MSVC`
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know how to compile in VS at all so you'll have to ask someone else, but I think I can figure out how to get it to compile on the command prompt with msvc
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Did you initialize the submodules?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> in ddnet-libs?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> shouldn't be necessary for `FindCrypto.cmake` to be there, but yeah that'd also help for future problems
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Hmm okay. Just noticed that it did not find any deps
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, i did git submodules update
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, starting from a fresh clone works
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so i guess sth went wrong in my fork
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i'll just clean everything then
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> It does not use the modules in the cmake directory
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > Also you can't use bash to generate MSYS Makefiles
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Indeed, any idea why? It says syntax error with make, but it works with MinGW makefiles
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Did you modify this block in your fork:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2649fb52342bf8772fd7963ff2e3de301492176c/CMakeLists.txt#L48-L52
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> ?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, wasn't marked as modified by status
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, wasn't marked as modified by git status
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i just hard resetted things, and it worked
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Can you check the value of `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` in your CMakeCache.txt?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Ah okay :)
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Chairn do you have msys2?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not really
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah you got it working
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing with VS
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> got rid of it
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> stayed with a fresh install of mingw
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + bash that is installed with git
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interesting combination, surprised that it all worked out ðŸ™‚
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, there are some weird things when i build, but it does build
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> msys2 with mingw cmake is the combination I got working
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like i got thousands of warning for glew
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + some unrecognized flag for ddnet files
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it does build so, i don't really care
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Can the server freely change the view position of a client?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> position is always on the tee
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> even in spec?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i tried to force CPlayer::m_ViewPos but without any success
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can tp the tee places
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> obviously
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> you can do some faketee stuff
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Chairn you can set the viewpos only if spectatorinfo is on
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so while setting viewpos you need to send spectatorinfo from snap
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> from server to client or from client to server?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> server to client, its the snap from CPlayer
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so `if (var) m_ViewPos = ` and then in the snap just a `|| var` for the spectatorinfo part
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And of course in the spectatorinfo force the spectatorID that gets sent to -1 (freeview) if `var == true`
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, thx
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Well, i can force to go spec, but i still can't figure out why viewpos is not updated
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess i'll need client modification as well
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course you dont.
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You need to check all places where m_ViewPos gets set. Maybe just try adding a new variable `m_ViewPosFromYourMod` (xd) and then set that, in the spectatorinfo then send this variable if `var == true`
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ahah, found
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :)
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> should have not used spec_freeview as the client ignores it
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it ignores the pos if specid is freeview, so i just put the client id instead and it worked
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that shouldnt be the way to go
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> are you on 0.7 or 0.6
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 0.6
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then it should be enough tho, mh
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, not working perfectly everytime ðŸ˜¦
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/708419664690151606
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the problem is to find the order in which every function is called
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as i said, just use a new variable
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> already done, still the viewpos is not always exactly like i want, there seems to have some movement around the target, i don't know why
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do you want to set it to view a tee, or a random position?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you want it to be on a tee, then of course send the real client id of the tee (like in /pause). otherwise just set the position to -1, if the viewpos is not on a tee
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> random position
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does anyone here know the story behind multiple front/tele layers and so on in maps?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> im kinda confused by how that is a thing
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think u can edit them in with a custom client
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> multiple front/tele layers sounds useful
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> should be implemented into ddnet imo
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> pls no
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> pls yes
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> by what i saw they appear to be empty, at least in the map edito
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> r
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this makes needlessly complicated
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with more stuff stacking
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u could do cool things tho
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thats already what the front layer is for
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u could make a hookthru telegun
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :o
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk why hookthrough is in the front layer
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> very confusing to new mappers
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> dang, i made it work with ddnet client, but doesn't work with tw client...
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ofc theres the "shortcut for hookthru" but i still think it places in front iirc
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Chairn made what
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why are there two chairns in this srv lol
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where you see 2?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Chairn @Chairn
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i probably connected once with web browser
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
