10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> 33 hrs on one map
10:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Gamer
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> im setting up ccache and distcc
11:22 < bridge> <Dreamless> is this publicly available? Never saw playtime before
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 odd, compiling ddnet with distcc takes more than without
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess distcc is only worht for the slower machine
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> or idk
12:20 < bridge> <vappy19> Maybe Next update, hype! :0
12:24 < bridge> <patiga> @robyt3 hey, I thought that bezier envelope data is stored in a single item of a new ex item type. https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1156657072780361738/1157765215061016586 this map however contains a bezier curve (in envelope 3/8), but only 2 ex item types: automapper and GroupEx.
12:24 < bridge> <patiga> Do you know if there is something wrong here, or if I just misunderstand something?
12:26 < bridge> <patiga> https://ide.kaitai.io/ with https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/602156e4cb787f3d2c4afeb267706233741aea9c/doc/datafile_v4.ksy is great to view the structure of datafiles btw :)
12:30 < bridge> <patiga> hm I must be understanding smth wrong, because bezier values do indeed get saved
12:30 < bridge> <patiga> my question is: where are they stored then?
12:35 < bridge> <patiga> okay, so some clues:
12:36 < bridge> <patiga> with the newest client (17.3) from steam, when I store a map with bezier it does indeed add the expected ex-item-type
12:38 < bridge> <patiga> that ex-item-type is not included in the map linked above, however
12:38 < bridge> <patiga> suggesting that saving the map failed somehow
12:52 < ChillerDragon> madlad deen hinted that he might merge #5949 tomorrow. If that actually happens I appreciate every who looks over the code and maybe even runs it before the merge.

15:37 < bridge> <patiga> @robyt3  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2b115b92fa4077a30f76b50b97ef503e12757c77/src/game/editor/mapitems/map_io.cpp#L378-L387
15:37 < bridge> <patiga> if I see this correctly, the bezier curve values aren't stored only in the bezier values of the envelope point with the bezier curve type, but instead spread between that point and the next?
15:40 < bridge> <patiga> Maybe I got it wrong for a long time already, but I thought that the interpolation between two points is only ever determined by the values of the first of the two. I think/thought that this is the way teeworlds 0.7 stores their bezier values, but here we do it differently?
15:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes, the 0.7 format stores them interleaved
15:42 < bridge> <robyt3> We store them in two separate items
15:43 < bridge> <patiga> yes, but I'm confused about which bezier values are stored where
15:45 < bridge> <patiga> in the code segment above, if a envelope point has the bezier type, half of the bezier values are stored in the envelope point with the appropriate type, and half in the next point, regardless of which curve type that point has
15:46 < bridge> <patiga> so my first question kinda is: if we look at the 0.7 format, at the 16 bezier values of the first point, are these values equal to the first 16 values in the ddnet bezier data?
15:46 < bridge> <robyt3> We always store bezier data for all points but unused data should be 0
15:49 < bridge> <patiga> the bezier curve has in\_ and out\_ values. 8 values each. if we look at the first bezier curve, between the first and second point. are the in\_ and out\_ values of the first bezier curve the first 16 values, or the 8th till 24th value?
15:50 < bridge> <patiga> when I wrote the 0.7 parser I kinda just assumed that the bezier values are entirely stored in the envelope point with the type bezier, not split up between two points. but the code above does not do that
15:54 < bridge> <patiga> I'm questioning right now if I was parsing 0.7 maps wrong. do I need to keep the bezier values of non-bezier envelope points (which are used if the point before was a bezier point)
16:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes thatâ€™s the same
16:16 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok, i just realized there's protocol.h and protocol.h and type_id = 6 means different stuff in these 2 versions and i dont have to try to put 8 ints in 3 anymore :pepeW:
16:16 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok, i just realized there's protocol.h and protocol7.h and type_id = 6 means different stuff in these 2 versions and i dont have to try to put 8 ints in 3 anymore :pepeW:

16:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> godot :poggers2:
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye godot
16:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> If I may ask, is it a personal project or is it a team one but you switched because of the Unity changes?
16:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Personal
16:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> moving an entire team to godot might cost too much for training
16:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye
16:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> At least 2022 lts isn't affected now anyway
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> godot isn't really fully featured tho. It feels really weird to develop toolset for it for the time being.
16:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe it's just the unfamiliarity, idk
16:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye many features are missing still
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ew windows
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Just now I found it lacks some timing related hooks where I need them like before and after rendering a viewport. had to workaround them.
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bite me
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie glad ur into godot
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> fck unity
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> also godot is better at cross platform iirc
16:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm not into godot
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> so better for linux
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> betrayal
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> im angry now
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bite me again :brownbear:
16:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's fine
16:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
16:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really liking it. maybe I'll get used to it after i just started using the engine code as base instead of only in-engine stuff
16:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Also godot never showed any tooltips on my machine since godot 3.1
16:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm trying to fix it now that's why I'm compiling it
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It took me years to realise why it is so damn hard to use.  just because it never told me what any buttons do on my machine lmao
16:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> that sucks, do other ppl have it too?
16:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the problem or the tooltips
16:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the tooltips
16:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, i asked
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also I can make them show up by turning off one of my monitor
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so at least I might know why it isn't showing up
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'd imagine no one really noticed it since it was unchanged for so long
16:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm weird maybe they show up in the other monitor?
16:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not, I would've noticed
16:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> even if they do then it is definitely bugged anyway
16:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What you hacking on?
16:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just need to find the code where they render the damn thing tho. the codebase is quite huge than what i'm used to:justatest:
16:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah hmm
16:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just need to find the code where they render the damn thing tho. the codebase is quite huge compared to what i'm used to:justatest:
16:48 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> web demo renderer. still :pepeW:. ive parsed messages and map, now its snapshot time
16:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You know that you are kinda reinventing the wheel here?
16:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Half tw is working on that
16:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> hell yeah
16:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> on what?
16:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Web demo
16:50 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> eeeeeehm
16:50 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> is there a working thing?
16:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also why you working with da protocol? Cant you just copy paste tw code?
16:50 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> if no, then ill be first :clueless:
16:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1159502964801687655/2023-10-05_18-52-19.mp4?ex=65314249&is=651ecd49&hm=fa6a4aa3edc8dfd4eb5f7b5e0b52807a6f6575f2725089e6ac12db3a4af5efe2&
16:50 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> if yes, i aint finish this
16:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nothing is super finished but many things are showcasesable
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u try watching a tutorial
16:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ask patiga and jupsti for their current state and judge your self if itâ€™s finished enough for you
16:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> tutorials are for the weak
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> there u have the answer
16:51 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> lets see whose wheel is better :owo:
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> also godot is diferent
16:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> u attach a script to each node
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> its more modular
16:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean. i know that
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> in c# unity u use 1 script for many ythings iirc
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but thats like a big change for ppl i guess idk
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not a game dev
16:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea not telling you to stop. Just warning you it might not be too useful to double the work
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only do game dev in ddnet
16:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean just moving stuff around. sometime there's a button and I hate I can't tell what it is by the icon
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> imagine having a editor
16:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also why do you reimplement the protocol?
16:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do you use a new language?
16:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> js? :D
16:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i just need to get the focken data from snapshot
16:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
16:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do you get it into the web?
16:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ah
16:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> je
16:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> js
16:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> D:
16:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pure or cross compile?
16:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ye
16:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Webassemblign I mean
16:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think actual hand written js would be a first
16:54 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> rn its in ts, and its only nodejs application
16:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw @tsfreddie have you tried if godot 4 has this problem?
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes
16:54 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> but very soon ill transform it into a webpage
16:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If thatâ€™s the case there is also a snapshot parser in ts you know that right?
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> both 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 which just released
16:54 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :clueless:
16:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's what I mean since, cuz it's been years lmao

16:58 < bridge> <swarfey> xd tyty
16:59 < bridge> <swarfey> wouldnt say actively, i already kinda abandoned it brrt
16:59 < bridge> <swarfey> myr wanted to see the code tho, so i published it to gitlab
17:00 < ChillerDragon> sussy russians
17:01 < ChillerDragon> i dont get the code swarfey
17:01 < ChillerDragon> does it need a server? or is it client side js only?
17:02 < ChillerDragon> last time i checked web cant do udp right? So your client lib would need to support ws? But why is there ws stuff in the web repo then?
17:03 < ChillerDragon> @swarfey
17:03 < bridge> <swarfey> xd yes i did some trol in the code
17:07 < bridge> <swarfey> ye u showed it to me in early ruby lib development i think
17:08 < bridge> <swarfey> thought it was web
17:08 < ChillerDragon> when did u start the web stuff?
17:08 < ChillerDragon> i started mine 3 weeks ago
17:08 < bridge> <swarfey> ehh same day i published it
17:08 < ChillerDragon> ez
17:08 < ChillerDragon> earlier
17:08 < bridge> <swarfey> ye 2 weeks ago
17:08 < bridge> <swarfey> didnt work on it after that either
17:08 < ChillerDragon> mood
17:09 < ChillerDragon> mine was also super short lived development effort xd
17:09 < ChillerDragon> but its hella fun using a own lib
17:09 < bridge> <swarfey> xd yeah
17:09 < bridge> <swarfey> i have a lot of small projects using my own lib too
17:09 < ChillerDragon> ok pro developer
17:09 < ChillerDragon> i dont
17:10 < bridge> <swarfey> well
17:10 < bridge> <swarfey> with small i mean extremely small like hello world to test some stuff in my mod or something
17:10 < bridge> <swarfey> idk
17:10 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:10 < ChillerDragon> wat
17:11 < ChillerDragon> you made a lib for hello world and used that?
17:11 < bridge> <swarfey> what no
17:11 < ChillerDragon> u made a tw server mod framework and used it to build hello world plugin?
17:11 < bridge> <swarfey> i use the teeworlds lib to connect to a server and do some weird movement
17:11 < bridge> <swarfey> or do some commands to test something in the mod
17:11 < ChillerDragon> a
17:11 < bridge> <swarfey> with 64 tees
17:11 < ChillerDragon> ou yea same
17:11 < ChillerDragon> https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/master/examples/07/flood/flood.py?ref_type=heads
17:11 < ChillerDragon> i use sussy flood.py

17:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
17:16 < ChillerDragon> so it china virus confirmed
17:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so you do know
17:16 < ChillerDragon> i guess
17:17 < ChillerDragon> where sing up button
17:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i forgot to build godot with symbols now i'm building it again. sad
17:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> disabled lmao
17:17 < ChillerDragon> trol
17:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why do you want sign up tho
17:17 < ChillerDragon> u sent link
17:17 < ChillerDragon> i click
17:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean i can invite for sign ups
17:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i probably need to setup the SMTP first tho
17:18 < ChillerDragon> yea dw
17:18 < ChillerDragon> i dont see me using it anyways
17:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it wasn't supposed to be used by others too lmao
17:19 < ChillerDragon> sure sure 
17:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just where I store my stuff that might be private
17:20 < ChillerDragon> if heinrich would offer some git hosting i might use it. Eventho he revealed that he has no backup strategy he is the most ethernal person i know.
17:20 < ChillerDragon> i sent heinrich some map 10 yrs ago and its still vibin on his drive
17:21 < ChillerDragon> ryo recreates git hosting services faster than i change my underwear
17:22 < ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie i also selfhost for private stuff. I just dont use any cloud provider. Raw git is all i need for private stuff. Or do you need clickibuntu web gui and issues etc?
17:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just want something that's familiar and also shareable in case i need it
17:22 < ChillerDragon> i see
17:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also it's just a nas sitting in my living room

17:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe it changed some setting hmm
17:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't do anything with the settings btw
17:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i compiled a debug version of the engine
17:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye I understood xD
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> windows shenanigans
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> use linux
17:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw this is what I've been working on with godot

17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
17:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye I made many projects but the hooks where awful so I made yet another one and I figured it out xD
17:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I hate life
17:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It just randomly decided to work
17:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Also cool project (definitely watched)
17:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> my best guess would be this ^
17:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Nah, it worked before
17:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It will just stop working at some point
17:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> no I mean the debug version did on it's own
17:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> When it feels like it
17:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> That happened once or twice before
17:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm
17:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Just hate it to randomly fix itself right now when I'm just about to debug it
17:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Honestly, the last time it worked it's when I decided to open an issue
17:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Then it started working so i thought i just didn't hover long enough
17:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> The program is definitely sentient
17:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It knows
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> O0 to O1 is a massive change
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust too
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust without opts can be slower than python
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> with opts higher level abstractiosn become "zero cost"
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> or almost zero cost
17:58 < bridge> <teero777> teeworlds 2.0?!?
18:20 < bridge> <patiga> okay twmap does parse teeworlds 0.7 bezier values wrong, but imo my interpretation makes more sense :p
18:20 < bridge> <patiga> but damn
18:25 < bridge> <patiga> tho the naming does make more sense now
18:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok, finally discord decided to load the video
18:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> pretty cool project
18:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for real this time
18:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> kinda the repo is here https://github.com/Inateblig/Plydring. It's mainly a try of implementing 3D Teeworlds mechanics in godot.
18:52 < bridge> <patiga> @robyt3 I understand my problem with the bezier values now. the values for a single bezier curve are split between two points, which I deemed improbable at first. The problem of my first ping with the map with missing bezier data still holds up though.
18:52 < bridge> <patiga> New question: in the code it always calls the bezier values (in|out)_tangent_d(x|y). however on wikipedia it mostly talks about control points and only about tangents for a short segment. are the values in the map also control points, or are they something different? I ask this to get the naming correct in twmap. I'm not familiar with the calculations yet and hope to skip that trouble by asking you for now ^^
18:52 < bridge> <patiga> (btw, please tell me if you want to be pinged less)
18:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, it's a bit confusing how there are N points but N-1 curve types associated with the segments between the points. I don't know what's going on with the specific map missing the bezier ex item, if it's not something with the tool not displaying it correctly. I mostly copied cinaera's bezier implementation and naming from upstream, I don't really know all about how it works myself.
19:00 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess "control point" would have been correct to use, since the exact X and Y position of matters, whereas for a tangent it would only be the direction that's important

19:03 < bridge> <teero777> theroretically you could just rewrite ddnet to 3d. hard thing would be the graphics.
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> theoretically you could just rewrite ddnet to 3d. hard thing would be the graphics.
19:04 < bridge> <patiga> thanks for the input! it was really helpful. the specific map still confuses me, I think something definitely went wrong there, but maybe its already patched, we'll see if it comes up in the future
19:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I had made a 3D client/frontend for the ddnet client but it sucked. It was made in godot so it was easy but the communication was the hard part. I used fifos (first in first out files) to communicate with the ddnet client and godot. If I ever make another 3D client for teeworlds I'll again make it in godot but I'll also rewrite the networking in it instead of using the ddnet client. That way it should be faster/cleaner and would run on windows too
20:25 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ure making some cool ass 3d projects. heres my triangle on opengl :owo:

20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats doper than using a already made game engine
20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> now do vulkan

22:02 < bridge> <Ewan> good afternoon
22:05 < bridge> <k2d222> depends where you are ðŸ™ƒ
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ohhh shit really i didn't know that
22:06 < bridge> <k2d222> XD
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> ???
22:39 < bridge> <yekrm> DDNetPP Is there a build? chilleeeer
23:08 < bridge> <Ewan> build for what
23:14 < bridge> <yekrm> For a server
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> what server??
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> u want a linux build
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> or something else
23:15 < bridge> <yekrm> Linux
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/releases/tag/v.0.0.7
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> linux_DDNetPP
23:16 < bridge> <yekrm> I think it's very old
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that is 4 years old yeah
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP#cmake
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP#cmake>
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> very ez build
23:18 < bridge> <yekrm> :owo:
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> im not the chiller
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but i'd be surprised if he had builds hosted anywhere but the releases page
