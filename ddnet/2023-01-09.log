00:07 <+bridge> <Avolicious> We are running our Server on K3s but with a OCI standard image - so docker compliant
00:08 <+bridge> <Avolicious> docker uses its own resolver
00:08 <+bridge> <Avolicious> internally
00:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why use kubernetes at all
00:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or docker
00:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just use nixos
00:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 1 config, replicate everywhere
00:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the future is here
00:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its reproducible too!
00:12 <+bridge> <Avolicious> k3s
00:12 <+bridge> <Avolicious> much simpler than k8s
00:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whather that is
00:12 <+bridge> <Avolicious> its for edge services
00:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sry im not up to date with the hip words xD
00:12 <+bridge> <deen> I always thought k3s is people writing k8s wrong 😄
00:13 <+bridge> <Avolicious> https://k3s.io/
00:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> r u running ddnet on arm?
00:13 <+bridge> <Avolicious> no
00:13 <+bridge> <Avolicious> but our servers are not powerful enough to run k8s 😄
00:13 <+bridge> <Avolicious> k8s takes a lot of ressources
00:14 <+bridge> <Avolicious> k3s is smaller and simpler
00:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway this looks like uneeded complexity and overhead to me
00:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> specially for a game server
00:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nixos ftw
00:14 <+bridge> <Avolicious> nah its not
00:14 <+bridge> <Avolicious> you can run minecraft next to teeworlds without dependency problems
00:14 <+bridge> <Avolicious> you can run different teeworlds versions without dependency problems at all
00:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so can u with nix
00:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and u dont have a container overhead
00:15 <+bridge> <Avolicious> but learning k8s is great for some jobs 🙂
00:15 <+bridge> <Avolicious> cloud native and so on
00:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i know there is lot of fuzz about this and jobs
00:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i dont like it idk
00:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> something in it
00:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer bare metal
00:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how did you call dig? did you include the resolver IP?
00:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> solutions
00:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u agree
00:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `dig ddnet.org @8.8.8.8`
00:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tl;dr
00:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks using nixos over e.g docker containers since they run on the native kernel and they are reproducible, thus, u can deploy like docker
00:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> docker also runs on the native kernel btw
00:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but it has overhead
00:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is docker open source'd?
00:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what kind of overhead do you envision?
00:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just using linux namespaces
00:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> "The cost of security"
00:17 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Yes
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     One of these security mechanisms is seccomp, which Docker uses to constrain what system calls containers can run.
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     Older versions of seccomp have a performance problem that can slow down operations.
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     Docker still hasn’t enabled this performance fix.
00:18 <+bridge> <deen> docker is not using an open source license though
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> that too
00:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But talking about docker is different
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-performance-overhead/
00:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Its built using multiple technologies
00:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/introduction-crun
00:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> the alternative to runc is crun
00:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> a docker OCI runtime
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there is another too
00:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> made in rust
00:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> there are multiple
00:19 <+bridge> <Avolicious> thats why its soo cool
00:19 <+bridge> <Avolicious> you can switch them without a hassle
00:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well its not cool to me but i get it
00:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/containers/youki
00:19 <+bridge> <deen> ```
00:19 <+bridge> <deen> /var/lib/pterodactyl # nslookup ddnet.org 8.8.8.8
00:19 <+bridge> <deen> ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
00:19 <+bridge> <deen> ```
00:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki the article says you can disable that via `--privileged`
00:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can I access that server somewhere to poke it a bit?
00:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u know if volumes are slower than normal partitions?
00:20 <+bridge> <deen> Yeah, it's a bit crazy to me, the huge costs everyone seems to accept nowadays to be on cloud
00:20 <+bridge> <deen> sure, `ssh root@bra.ddnet.org`
00:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this, big time
00:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> aws costs a fortune
00:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but companies glad to pay
00:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its "google fever" they all think they are on google-scale so they need to use that
00:21 <+bridge> <deen> I guess I shouldn't complain since it's what's bringing in my salary though
00:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but in reality not
00:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> docker uses overlayfs with many layers AFAIK, that might slow things down; but you wouldn't need to do many layers in theory
00:22 <+bridge> <Avolicious> You can fix that
00:23 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Its a bit work ngl, but its worth it
00:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it looks like UDP is blocked but TCP isn't
00:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry, no new information from me
00:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the FORWARD table has a default policy of DROP, this might be one source
00:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> additionally, the DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-2 DROPs everything as well
00:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> only changing the FORWARD table's default policy does not fix the problem
00:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> prepending an ACCEPT rule to the FORWARD table didn't help either
08:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> They all think they need to be able to scale to google level overnight
08:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Docker reminds me of that typical horrible spy disguise glasses with the nose and the mustache
08:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> "Hello there fellow kids, I too am open source, definitely not some weird proprietary that is patiently waiting to lock you all into my platform haha"
08:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> s\/proprietary/proprietary project/
09:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> TIL i learned that my headset cable can use my phone's touchscreen even tho it is isolated xd
09:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> TIL that my headset cable can use my phone's touchscreen even tho it is isolated xd
09:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think in general I'd prefer smth like nix. But i didn't use either of those, so maybe I'd choose based on amount of work and what i want to achieve^^ but the license defs strikes me
09:21 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @Avolicious\: what do you run on k3s? The official KoG game servers?
09:33 <+bridge> <Izanagi> I think I requested this already a long time ago, but is there a way to add an artificial delay to anti ping? Since alot of people who don't use anti ping get used to compensating the ping delay on their main server, so that when they turn on anti ping it messes with their mental ping compensation and it feels too responsive in a way
09:34 <+bridge> <Izanagi> would be very useful for when you want to not play on your main server
09:38 <+bridge> <Izanagi> would be very useful for when you want to not play on your main server, where the ping is different
09:40 <+bridge> <Izanagi> I think I requested this already a long time ago, but is there a way to add an artificial delay to anti ping? Since alot of people who don't use anti ping get used to compensating the ping delay on their main server, so that when they turn on anti ping it messes with their mental ping compensation and it feels too responsive in a way. You can especially feel it when you need to catch a falling tee
09:45 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Yes
10:00 <+bridge> <deen> What do you mean by that? You mean changing volume using headset controls?
10:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think he means the cable is causing weird behaviour on the touchscreen
10:01 <+bridge> <deen> oh, insulated cable then I guess
10:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> I guess it's not as isolated as you think it is and some electric fields are leaking out
10:02 <+bridge> <deen> insulated just means there is some plastic around it, right? Shielded cable is what you want, but I don't think people do that for headset cables
10:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> Oh, yep true. Needs to be shielded
10:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Interesting. I assume you do not have your infrastructure Config files public tho right? .\_.
10:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Avolicious)
10:06 <+bridge> <Александр Язов> hi, my ddnet client closes with error "segmentation fault (core dumped)"
10:06 <+bridge> <Александр Язов> how can this be solved?
10:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> By fixing the bug. And we can find the bug if you provide us the crash dump in dumps from config directory
10:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> Segmentation fault (core dumped) sounds like linux, I don’t think we have our cores in the config folder, do we?
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh true mb
10:11 <+bridge> <deen> Can you compile your own client with Debug mode and then check for a coredump? Or just run it in gdb?
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Start with gdb in debug mode is probably easiest if reproducible
10:12 <+bridge> <deen> If you are on Arch Linux it might be this bug: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6157
10:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can check where your coredumps go with `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`
10:14 <+bridge> <deen> (`coredumpctl` on most distros)
10:14 <+bridge> <deen> And `coredumpctl gdb $pid` to open the correct coredump in GDB directly
10:34 <+bridge> <Avolicious> No, our infrastructure is being built with terraform and ansible
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Avolicious do u work as a sysadmin?
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Outside tw
10:44 <+bridge> <Emily Brown> https://t.me/+UcYGEjBQwa7gIPN1
10:44 <+bridge> <Emily Brown> (<@302059820905922560_=47it=48ub>)
10:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've been wanting to make ddnet infrastructure into a collection of ansible playbooks for a while now
11:11 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Just out of interest, has anyone here worked with VueJS before? Currently doing that at work, it's quite fun but I do prefer C++ over everything :D
11:11 <+bridge> <Avolicious> No, cant describe my current Position Well, its somewhere between Software Developer and gitops. But also doing system administration
11:14 <+bridge> <Avolicious> The not yet released version of the kog website has been built with vuejs
11:14 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I've started with react, but then changed to vue because of its simplicity compared to react
11:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> I do, it's quite pleasant. I love the mix of approaches
11:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> Not as ideological as react
11:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, that's what I think too
11:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> But for some reason C++ burned into my heart xd
11:17 <+bridge> <Learath2> Well C++ you cant use for web frontend 😄
11:18 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, of course, but I mean when it just comes to programming in general
11:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Do you listen to music while working/programming?
11:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I always find that very distracting, but lofi works well imo
11:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> I can't study/work/be productive without music. I get intrusive thoughts otherwise. I need the music to occupy my mind
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> No, i use svelte
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> For my projects
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Best so far
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Way better than react
11:21 <+bridge> <Avolicious> and TailwindCSS?
11:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> I still didn't get to try svelte. Maybe I should make some toy project to mess around with it
11:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Feel you, but listening to singing or rapping while working lets me follow the lyrics aka getting distracted again
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I used to, but frontend is boring so i just slap bootstrap xd
11:22 <+bridge> <Avolicious> ah oke, yeah bootstrap seems fair enough
11:22 <+bridge> <Avolicious> but tailwind is soo much easier
11:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I listen to one piece ost xd
11:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They best
11:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'd rather get distracted by lyrics than crippling depressionthoughts
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Devops?
11:23 <+bridge> <ReD> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dh0K9lLIUk
11:23 <+bridge> <ReD> good background music I can recommend
11:23 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Yeah GitOps, the superset of DevOps
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I told u im not upnto date with the buzzwords xd
11:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Can't focus when distracted tho 😄
11:24 <+bridge> <Avolicious> GitOps is the "correct" way of implementing how DevOps should be
11:24 <+bridge> <Avolicious> https://www.gitops.tech
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I listen to lofi or synthwave
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> When coding
11:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea, lofi
11:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Music only distracts the part of my brain telling me life sucks
11:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Life does suck, but it aint that bad if you do something out of it ❤️
11:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> So I can keep working just fine
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Insert standards xkcd here*
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I know its "easy" but it requires u to invent a consisten and new style
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> And i dont wanna put yhat effort rn
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> So i take bootstrap style xd
11:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I have an easy solution for you: Just invent something and you'll be rich :P xd
11:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no 9-5 anymore
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Way faster prototyping
11:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Sure, with bootstrap you get everything you need
11:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I also worked a lot with bootstrap in the past
11:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> it does exactly what I wanted and nothing more or less
11:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> My god, no matter how much I love tea, I always get sooo fucking warm when I drink it :D
11:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't have a 9-5. Nor does my life suck by any objective metric really. Not that easy to solve. Some flavour of brain damage
11:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> You gotta find your peace brother ❤️
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Life is not daijoubu
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Inventing is not that easy, and then u gotta maintain
11:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Hire employees to work for ou
11:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
11:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> What do you do for a living, if I may ask?
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Thats the thing, once u have a company
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> The company is ur whole life
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Its not a 9-5 job
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Its a 24/7
11:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I know, but you can definitely create a nice work-life-balance, especially if you have a partner on your side.
11:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Or step down as the head
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Having a partner doesnt solve the problems right away 😄
11:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Well, you can split things
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But not work related, only if you work in the same business
11:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Thats what I mean, sorry, I mean a partner you invent a company with
11:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nothing. I study, I get an allowance. Literally the cushiest life ever
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Ahhhh, now everythings clear 😄
11:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Not a love partner
11:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh thats nice
11:33 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Ah sure, wrong turn from my side then
11:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how long till grad
11:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think I can pull it off on september
11:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Nice
11:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Huh, I missed jumping in here and talking a little :)
11:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I skipped uni altogether xd
11:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> This is the last thing I'd like to try. If that doesn't work either I'm planning to spend everything I've saved up so far and moving to new zealand
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Why new zealand
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Visiting gabe?
11:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'll become a sheep herder and get hooked on DXM
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Lmao
11:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> why DXM
11:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> No thoughts, no sadness, only sheep
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Whats dxm
11:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> drug
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I mean yeah ik its a drug
11:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> Cough syrup. It reduces your iq by a fair bit
11:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Lel
11:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> Turns you into a vegetable mostly
11:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Like Codeine?
11:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I mean, cough syrup
11:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why not get some "easy" tech job @Learath2
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> easy doesnt mean its soul consuming tho
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
11:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> are you missing a "not"?
11:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i think xd
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Ye
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Mobilr
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> zzz
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I think learath doesnt need a easy but a exciting one
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> To work the brain
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> And get distracted
11:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Did you guys ever feel like you don't want to work as a programmer your whole life? The whole concept of working in an office/only in front of your computer doesnt please me personally so much.
11:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> But I do like programming in general. What I dislike about it is that you can't "finish" a project.
11:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> I feel sad just sitting around, I doubt the difficulty of work matters
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> No
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I feel like i will
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> And want
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Cant wait to tell stories on 2069 about what rust was and how much change brought
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> To the kidsos
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Kek
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> To the kiddos
11:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> You mean that 2069 where AI's create new programs? :P xD
11:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm excited to see what the future brings to technology
11:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Given we dont get nuked
11:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym, sitting around? sitting around and programming stuff would make you feel bad?
11:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Learath simply has no goals
11:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> dont think its that simple :D
11:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> Maybe it might work. Idk, will see after I graduate. Once upon a time I used to enjoy that
11:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No start a revolution
11:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> More fun
11:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> What sort of revolution are we doing
11:50 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> November
11:51 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz our democracy aint democracy
11:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in what way is germany's democracy not a democracy?
11:51 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> just a try getting close to it
11:51 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> well ea
11:51 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it is in generel of course
11:52 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> But I personally like the concept of Switzerland better
11:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah 🙂
11:52 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> But it has been integrated into their culture for a long time, that's the reason it works so well over there
11:52 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> of course we cant just take that approach and live that
11:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> societies are weird
11:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> + smaller countr
11:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Closed src infrastructure cring
11:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> I prefer if we could vote different ppl for different areas
11:57 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Sharing is caring avo
11:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> you mean smaller countries? D:
11:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :D*
11:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Subjects i mean
11:58 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> oh
11:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Exterior, interior, tech, environment
11:58 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> we have that in germany
11:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Isnt it u vote a party
11:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah now i get it
11:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yes you do, and they provide people for sbjects
11:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Yea
11:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and u want to vote them directly?
12:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Ye
12:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Idc. We have everything in our community, from iran protesters, drug dealers to doctors. But we are missing a true revolutionist
12:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So please fill the gab
12:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Gap
12:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> I can't be a lone revolutionary
12:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I think every community thats bigger than x people has people from A to Z
12:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Turn into religion kek
12:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Pope Learath
12:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh holy Learath
12:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 🙏
12:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've considered joining some non-religious cult. Those people are irrationally happy
12:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz they dont give a fuk
12:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Happiness wont come by searching it
12:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> Exactly. Maybe I can believe in some weird science based cult
12:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Join the big bang theor
12:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> y
12:07 <+bridge> <Avolicious> What would you like to know? All tools I used are open source 👀
12:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> have you tried ea? ^^ not sure if that makes happy though
12:07 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xDD
12:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ea?
12:08 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ITS IN THE GAME
12:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism
12:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> I do have one last goal. I'd like to have a gf. If others are right and that's useless too I'll be truly goalless
12:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> It's not useless.
12:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Dont reject love. Let life happen. If it's not good for you, end that chapter and move on. There will be a perfect woman for you.
12:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Love is the most beautiful thing on earth.
12:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> Letting life happen is what I did so far, look where it got me
12:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Dont let life passively happen
12:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Let it actively happen
12:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Go out, do things, meet people
12:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Dont pressure yourself or others. Be yourself.
12:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> And you shouldnt fall in self doubt
12:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He already did
12:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He has to learn to think different and that can take years
12:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Wishing all the best, never give up
13:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> You seem to understand me well
13:46 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Not my job so :gigachad:
14:36 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> can I set $CURRENTDIR when i run DDnet-Server executable?
14:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, that one we get from the parent process. So I guess running the executable using an absolute path while inside another might work
17:19 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I wanna see your terraform/ansible and kubernetes repo

17:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> If u ever used go
17:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Be reminded the simple use of "go get" gives google lot of info
17:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://sourcehut.org/blog/2023-01-09-gomodulemirror/
17:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yikes google banning ppl from issue trackers. But sourcehut seems to be a chill place never heard of it
18:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> all platforms ban some people
18:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> AFAIK
18:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. name me one that doesn't ^^
19:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Why did we have those externs
19:08 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Last time someone said "for antibot" I think
19:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Add extern "Rust"
19:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> extern "Python" {
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪>   void make_my_code_run_at_moderate_speed();
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> }

20:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 2b2t hehe
20:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
20:25 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo banning is always bad but especially banning without or with bad reasons and explanation is trash like the dude mentioned in the article ryo sent
20:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But yea most places do ban and I critique all of them
20:26 <+bridge> <Sylex> hello, I just switched to Linux mint and when I'm starting ddnet I'm getting a blacksccren / sccrenfreeze
20:56 <+bridge> <Sylex> hello, I just switched to Linux mint and when I'm starting ddnet I'm getting a blackscreen / sccrenfreeze.
20:56 <+bridge> <Sylex> 
20:56 <+bridge> <Sylex> I also compile it myself, same issue
21:46 <+bridge> <deen> any error message on terminal? can you post the full output? other games work fine?
22:15 <+bridge> <Sylex> My sccren freeze like that, can't even move my mouse. Didn't try other games
22:15 <+bridge> <Sylex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1062117525229412413/a9190641-151e-4392-8935-1a38d4260871.jpg
22:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> some endless loops or deadlock?
22:28 <+bridge> <Sylex> Games which are windowed working fine but games which are in fullscreen aren't working
22:30 <+bridge> <Chairn> @Jupeyy_Keks ^
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am not a mesa dev
22:42 <+bridge> <deen> Try `./DDNet "gfx_fullscreen 0"`
22:46 <+bridge> <Sylex> Well I can use alt f4
22:47 <+bridge> <Sylex> Well I try the same again and it worked this time
22:53 <+bridge> <deen> You should figure out what's wrong with fullscreen on your system, doesn't seem like a DDNet issue
23:23 <+bridge> <Sylex> How can I find that problem? I never used Linux really before sorry
23:42 <+bridge> <Alexander> Start with a google search like `linux screen frozen on fullscreen games`
23:43 <+bridge> <Alexander> Maybe specify distro too
