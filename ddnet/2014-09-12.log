11:00 <@deen> laxa_work: next time disable the fps display, the chat and the HUD
11:00 <@deen> still, nice!
11:02 <@deen> Ah, and maybe include a link to ddnet.tw, probably to the map in the description
11:19 <@deen> Also, I think you have the wrong names in the title...
11:19 <@deen> That is SickCunt & BlaGK
11:20 <@deen> not iParano
11:20 <@deen> it even says so bottom right
11:21 < laxa_work> he finished with iParano as nickname
11:21 <@deen> eh
11:21 <@deen> so now we have a video in the hall of fame of someone faking a record for someone else
11:21 < laxa_work> I think he just have 2 nicknames
11:21 < laxa_work> how to disable chat & hud with commands ?
11:22 <@deen> cl_showchat 0
11:22 <@deen> cl_showhud 0
11:22 <@deen> and probably also disable all the chat sounds in settings
11:22 < laxa_work> ok, I'll do that next time
11:22 <@deen> nice video
11:23 < laxa_work> I added the link to the map records
11:24 <@deen> so, now i can add the Hall of Fame website on ddnet.tw
11:25 <@deen> any ideas for it?
11:25 <@deen> Just a chronological list of videos?
11:26 < laxa_work> Yeah
11:26 < laxa_work> Maybe you could add a link to videos from records
11:26 < laxa_work> but don't think it's easy to do
11:26 <@deen> Yeah, it's not really easy
11:26 <@deen> and there are 600 maps, so I doubt many people would even find the links there^^
11:27 < laxa_work> Well, I can't reupload a video and keep comments & views, so I'll try to do better for next video
11:27 <@deen> yeah, sure
11:27 < laxa_work> I had to reencode twice this one ^^
11:28 < laxa_work> I even do that with open source software :p
11:28 <@deen> my adrenaline 3 video i had to record 4 times
11:28 <@deen> until i got lags removed, audio synchronized =/
11:29 < laxa_work> I need to check tonight if I have my records from my rank 1, but I don't think so :(
11:36 < laxa_work> deen: I opened an issue about the time not displaying when time > server time
11:37 <@deen> Hm, should I put my old record videos in the Hall of Fame too?
11:39 <@deen> and hm, websites load slowly with many youtube videos on
11:41 <@deen> laxa_work: did you test it a bit more, is that actually the reason?
11:41 < laxa_work> Well, I can't see any other reason, and you said it yourself :p
11:41 <@deen> ...
11:42 <@deen> oh, and with the thing we found yesterday, we can now crash every client!
11:42 < laxa_work> Yeah sure, put your records into the hall of fame
11:42 <@deen> (except ddnet client newest version)
11:42 <@deen> and the TW devs even knew about that...
11:42 < laxa_work> oO ? How ?
11:42 <@deen> the network packets are not checked for invalid values
11:43 <@deen> you can just send negative array offsets
11:43 <@deen> and the client will access any illegal memory
11:43 < laxa_work> nice
11:43 <@deen> which is why i released yesterday
11:43 < laxa_work> now you can make everyone use ddnet to play on ddnet xD
11:43 <@deen> some people really don't like ddnet client, no idea why
11:46 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/halloffame/
11:48 < laxa_work> Just needs a link on the frontpage, and it's good :p
11:52 <@deen> too bad the adrenaline 3 run was on ddmax :P
11:52 <@deen> see, that's why i wanted to fuse ddmax with ddnet!
11:52 <@deen> my ranks on ddnet would be much better
11:52 <@deen> I'd have 30 videos for you
11:52 < laxa_work> Hehe
11:52 <@deen> but then everyone would realize that we cheated every single ddmax map
11:54 <@deen> players on every ddnet server except FRA
11:54 <@deen> lucky that i got a tournament map for Sunday
12:06 < laxa_work> deen: I think you forgot to add Halloffame in menu links ?
12:06 <@deen> true
12:09 < laxa_work> Going to eat, cya later
12:14 <@deen> bye
12:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/VqULfA
12:14 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3ea1bab def: Fix: Allow any tick (fixes #35)
13:24 < laxa_work> Yeah, got 2 screens to work now :p
14:33 <@deen> laxa_work: iParano is NOT SickCunt
14:33 <@deen> they are different people
14:34 <@deen> I don't know why anyone would send you a video of how they cheat a rank for someone
14:34 <@deen> but I should probably delete the rank now^^
14:35 < laxa_work> T_T
14:35 < laxa_work> Minecraft has been bought by Microsoft for 1.4 Billion dollars... Wtf really !
14:36 <@deen> Probably call it SickCunt & BlaGK at least
14:36 < laxa_work> ok
14:36 < laxa_work> wow
14:37 < laxa_work> already 300 views !
14:39 < laxa_work> ok edited
14:50 < EastBite> deen: yesterday I forgot to tell you that about 90% of the fixes in tw aren't even merged =)
14:51 <@deen> EastBite: yeah, i see...
14:52 <@deen> but it's crazy to have security bugs around like this
14:52 <@deen> you can just go to the pull requests, pick a bug and use it on any server
14:52 <@deen> before ddnet i tried fixing stuff in ddrace, but noone even reacted
14:57 < EastBite> I guess because the owner of the ddrace branch doesn't care about it anymore
14:59 < EastBite> the things I heard about ddrace were like "it is going to be rewritten from scratch"
14:59 <@deen> yes, in summer 2013
14:59 <@deen> ^^
15:00 < EastBite> yep
15:00 <@deen> and ddmax will be reborn in 2013 too, or maybe it's summer 2014 now
15:00 <@deen> oh, and there were people saying they know that TW 0.7 will be released in 2013
15:01 <@deen> I should just stop listening to all these promises and rumours
15:01 < laxa_work> teeworlds dev is currently dead 
15:01 < laxa_work> just ddnet development is active
15:01 < EastBite> it often happens on open projects
15:01 < EastBite> deen: pls try to let hookrace happen :D
15:02 <@deen> EastBite: really bad right now =/
15:02 <@deen> laxa always wants 1000 things for ddnet
15:02 <@deen> exams, master thesis, work
15:03 < EastBite> you are busy^^
15:03 < EastBite> I had my first school day today :D
15:03 <@deen> what kind of school?
15:04 < EastBite> fachgymnasium klasse 13
15:04 < EastBite> dunno what that means in english
15:05 < o_be_one> hi guys :)
15:05 <@deen> ok
15:05 < EastBite> hello o_be_one 
15:05 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
15:05 < o_be_one> i've tried some ddner server, on brutal GER ... Woaw hard but very funny :D
15:06 <@deen> Yeah, you usally start with Novice^^
15:06 < o_be_one> i was at the begin of ddrace, i've some skill
15:06 < o_be_one> i think i'm intermediate ^^
15:06 <@deen> Moderate then!
15:06 < o_be_one> but i dont like solo part :(
15:06 < o_be_one> more funny when we play together :D
15:07 < o_be_one> yeah next time, it was just to try in less than 30 min :D
15:07 < o_be_one> but impossible, too addictiv :p
15:07 <@deen> We have nice videos on http://ddnet.tw/halloffame/ now
15:11 < o_be_one> oh good to know :)
15:11 < o_be_one> cause i need to "pause" to see good players do parts :D
15:11 <@deen> that's normal
15:11 < EastBite> hm I still forget that blagk is a clanmember of me
15:11 < EastBite> should get more active
15:11 < o_be_one> omg pros :o !
15:22 <@deen> EastBite: yeah, make 1 top-1 rank every day!
15:26 < o_be_one> deen, what are you studying ? Computer sciences as developer ?
15:26 <@deen> Computer science, yeah
15:26 < o_be_one> nice i've done that too :D
15:26 < o_be_one> ive made r0x.fr and used it for my master thesis, 15/20 B) like a boss ahah :D
15:27 <@deen> huh, how did you use it?
15:28 < o_be_one> r0x.fr as grown very fast ... my education is for system specialized in linux so it just require a bunch of servers, a little virtualization ... But the marketing/communication was important too in my thesis
15:28 < o_be_one> they asked for something not too technical, they wanted something more "user friendly" to explain
15:29 < o_be_one> so i've spoke more about the creation of the community, team management, communication, servers choice, servers security and setup ... Well the entire project from A to Z
15:29 < o_be_one> at this time r0x.fr Minecraft servers was TOP3 France .........
15:30 < o_be_one> since 2 years.
15:30 <@deen> nice
15:33 < laxa_work> deen: don't you wanna add hall of fame below forum in menu of the website ? You could add a submenu for demo upload in it
15:33 < o_be_one> you ddnet network seems to be very big and awesome, it could be powerful for you master thesis
15:33 < o_be_one> do you use it for that too ?
15:37 < EastBite> hhe
15:37 < EastBite> hehe*
15:37 <@deen> o_be_one: no, that would never work here
15:37 <@deen> my master thesis is about graph algorithms on massively parallel machines
15:38 < o_be_one> nice !
15:38 <@deen> laxa_work: i feel like there may already be too many links on the side =/
15:39 < laxa_work> lol
15:39 <@deen> Directly on ddnet.tw i added a note "More videos in the Hall of Fame" below the video
15:39 < laxa_work> Imo, you should really add it in context menu
15:40 < laxa_work> with the submenu upload demo
15:40 < laxa_work> but do as you want
15:40 <@deen> upload demo i should do, yes
15:41 <@deen> if i want to add more entries to the side menu, i would need to make it move with the website
15:41 <@deen> otherwise it takes too much space and people with low resolutions can't use the site
15:46 < laxa_work> the website has already a responsive design, don't see how adding another item in the menu would break it
15:46 <@deen> it's still ugly when the website is too wide and the sidebar even disappears
15:47 < o_be_one> is it possible that on ddnet client we can see official ddnet demo from hall of fame :D ? Will be awesome !!
15:47 <@deen> i don't think we should upload the demos
15:47 < o_be_one> k
15:47 <@deen> and yeah, it would be nice, and something like this is planned for hookrace
15:48 <@deen> uploading demos now is a bit bad because they contain all chat on the server
15:48 <@deen> and some people surely don't want their discussions public like that
15:49 < o_be_one> ok but you publish already on ddnet.tw ..
15:49 <@deen> That was laxa's fault for including the chat!
15:49 <@deen> in the future he should remove it
15:49 < o_be_one> k
15:49 < o_be_one> laxa_work, you noob :D !
15:49 < laxa_work> Yeah yeah :p
15:50 < o_be_one> omg what this, petjack Oo
15:51 <@deen> it's a jetpack map
15:51 <@deen> if you like that, try Joyride on Solo, it's easier
15:51 < o_be_one> thats awesome wtf! :o
15:51 < o_be_one> ok
15:52 <@deen> it's one of the "new" ddnet features
15:53 < o_be_one> walljump awesome too
15:53 <@deen> =)
15:53 < o_be_one> you play sometime deen ?
15:53 <@deen> those 2 videos are of me, so yes :P
15:53 < o_be_one> ahah nice: )
15:54 < o_be_one> my tee is grey too but with white feet ^^
15:55 <@deen> Other new features: http://youtu.be/Tw-vq1wwb4A http://youtu.be/BOtjKKmhQq0
15:55 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Teeworlds DDRace: DDraceNetwork - Bootcamp #1 | Rating: 5.00/5.00 | Views: 443
15:56 < o_be_one> the teleport for ammo is not new feature ... Do you talk about that oO ?
15:56 < o_be_one> ive already played this map like 3 or 4 months ago
15:57 <@deen> Yeah, "new"
15:57 <@deen> I made it about a year ago
15:58 < o_be_one> ahah was a very good idea ^^
15:59 < o_be_one> i seriously need to host some true ddnet servers :p
15:59 < laxa_work> you won't have a singe player :p
15:59 <@deen> why?
15:59 < laxa_work> and you won't exclusive map unless you make them
15:59 <@deen> huh?
15:59 < laxa_work> cause everyone plays on ddnet
16:00 <@deen> nah, not everyone
16:00 <@deen> in Iran Persian Pro is more popular
16:00 <@deen> and in South Africa AfriGamer is also popular
16:00 <@deen> both running DDNet mod
16:00 < o_be_one> they play ddnet cause i dont host true ddrace :p
16:00 < o_be_one> ive just one server :D
16:01 < o_be_one> with old maps ^^
16:01 < o_be_one> aip-race <3
16:01 < o_be_one> ahah before aip stop his activity, ive hosted them, their team, their maps and their bin :D
16:02 < o_be_one> Zarnexx was cool too :)
16:06 <@deen> I'm really curious how the tournament on Sunday will be
16:06 < o_be_one> hope will be awesome :)
16:10 <@deen> i heard that some ddosers are stopping, might also help
16:11 < o_be_one> yeah and your are lucky cause vali only plays on my servers ahah
16:11 < o_be_one> i dont know why
16:11 < o_be_one> hes a big ddoser ...
16:11 < o_be_one> hes back after like 6 month away ...
16:14 <@deen> oh, and one of the ddos panels is currently down^^
16:16 < laxa_work> No more work to do, should I come back home earlier ?
16:21 <@deen> you're chatting more than you're working!
16:21 <@deen> but I'm studying for an exam right now too^^
16:26 < Savander> Hi
16:26 <@deen> Hi Savander 
16:28 < o_be_one> hi Savander :)
16:29 < laxa_work> I'll go off in 30 minutes, what to do in the meantime !?
16:29 <@deen> laxa_work: fix bugs: http://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues
16:30 < o_be_one> laxa_work, you can make a script to go off automaticly in 30 min :D
16:30 < laxa_work> I'd use windows event handler
16:31 < laxa_work> I don't need to script anything
16:31 < o_be_one> k
16:31 <@deen> really difficult to script!
16:31 <@deen> sleep 30m; halt
16:31 < laxa_work> I dont halt my computer at work :p
16:31 < laxa_work> Well, I don't halt any computer at all to be honest
16:31 < laxa_work> even my mac that I use one day per week is powered on, but just sleeping
16:32 <@deen> you have a mac? does ddnet client work on it?
16:32 <@deen> how does one start the server?
16:33 < laxa_work> yes I do
16:33 < laxa_work> but I only uses it at school :p
16:33 < laxa_work> ddnet clients wasn't working at start, but now it is.
16:34 < laxa_work> I don't see why ddnet server would not run, it's UNIX like after all
16:34 < laxa_work> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/21, you can close !
16:34 < laxa_work> oh, well, I'll do it meself
16:35 <@deen> sometimes people ask me how to start ddnet server on mac
16:35 <@deen> but i have no idea
16:35 < laxa_work> in command line
16:35 < laxa_work> like on Linux
16:35 <@deen> they don't know about command line
16:35 <@deen> and the whole thing is just one package
16:35 < laxa_work> hum
16:35 < laxa_work> oh
16:35 <@deen> so you can't go inside i think
16:35 < laxa_work> then I don't know
16:36 <@deen> i think you can open it in a special way and then click on the server
16:37 < laxa_work> http://vimeo.com/8014263
16:37 <@deen> yeah, exactly that!
16:38 < laxa_work> and I think you need to compill the server in a sepate way
16:38 < laxa_work> for the mac
16:38 < laxa_work> cause server is probably not in the .dmg package
16:38 <@deen> yes it is
16:38 < laxa_work> hum
16:38 < laxa_work> I dont have my mac with me
16:38 < laxa_work> I could look tonight
16:38 < laxa_work> and I think auto update doesnt work on Mac too
16:39 <@deen> yeah, it doesn't
16:39 < o_be_one> WHY :'(
16:39 <@deen> and i don't plan to implement it, feel free to do that yourself
16:39 <@deen> i don't have a mac to do it, and i wouldn't know how to update the contents of a dmg package
16:39 < o_be_one> k
16:43 < laxa_work> I guess you could make a tutorial on how to compile teeworlds on MAC, then you would have no problem to launch the server from a command line.
16:43 <@deen> don't need a tutorial for that
16:44 <@deen> but i don't think people want to compile 
16:44 <@deen> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
16:44 <@deen> works like this
16:44 < laxa_work> The bad thing about mac, there is no default packet manager, you have to install one.
16:44 <@deen> just like windows
16:45 <@deen> hi bor
16:45 < bor> hi
16:45 <@deen> bor: when i last was on the persian server it was lagging very badly
16:45 < bor> is it like that right now too ? or only then ?
16:46 <@deen> i often see weird stuff on the server
16:46 <@deen> now i can't tell whether it's laggy because i have ping 400 on it
16:46 <@deen> but sometimes CPU is very weak, sometimes RAM is used up
16:47 < bor> we still have 12 more days left on this server but after that if you think it is not a good server we could switch 
16:47 <@deen> yeah
16:47 < bor> we bought it from someplace called mw2.ir , king recommended them 
16:47 <@deen> Do you know about parspack? http://parspack.com/
16:48 <@deen> i think Persian DDNet was initially with them and they worked really well, even low ping from Europe
16:48 <@deen> but they threw us out because we had too many ddos attacks^^
16:48 < bor> they don't have any unlimited traffic plans 
16:49 <@deen> we don't need that much traffic i think
16:49 <@deen> or do you need?
16:49 <@deen> server is lagging now too i think
16:50 < bor> i personally prefer to get services from small companies , i have the mw2.ir's admin phone number , but they don't give you that in big companies , you have to call them in working hours and some noob answers who has no idea what to do nor has access to any panels where he actually can do sth
16:50 < bor> which port ? i will join now to test from iran
16:50 <@deen> yeah, but bigger companies have better routing in my experience
16:50 <@deen> every port
16:50 <@deen> players just left because of lags
16:51 < bor> small companies don't have their own DC , they just have one dedicated server in a big DC 
16:51 < o_be_one> +1
16:51 < o_be_one> we have a local DC
16:51 < o_be_one> but we have too et colocation on a big DC
16:51 < o_be_one> and now we have added a dedicated cloud from OVH
16:52 < bor> which one is better ?
16:53 < bor> deen: i just joined the fng , doesn't seem to lag
16:53 < o_be_one> i think that you need to choose your host with unmetered bandwith and ddos protection
16:53 < o_be_one> candis was using cloudflare if i remember well no ? The 200$/month plan
16:55 <@deen> o_be_one: for me low ping from many locations and stable performance and stable ping are much more important
16:55 <@deen> you feel every spike in ddrace
16:57 < o_be_one> you cant get a low ping from many location
16:57 < o_be_one> you need a server on all continent ...
16:57 <@deen> we have a server on every continent :P
16:57 <@deen> nearly
16:57 < o_be_one> but yes about stability its very important
16:57 < o_be_one> yes thats awesome ahah :D
16:58 <@deen> I didn't want Australian DDNet because no players
16:58 <@deen> but I had a server offered for free
16:59 < o_be_one> very nice !
16:59 <@deen> By that Australian guy
17:00 < laxa_work> xD
17:00 < o_be_one> i'll host a full ddos protected server in Canada ...
17:00 <@deen> TW player, played as "Julian Assange"
17:00 < laxa_work> "That guy" is weird
17:00 < o_be_one> i just need to start the VM ahah
17:01 <@deen> laxa_work: he threw around his bitcoin money, it was funny
17:01 < laxa_work> Yeah I know
17:01 < laxa_work> Did he gave you some ?
17:01 <@deen> nope
17:01 < laxa_work> Too bad :(
17:01 < laxa_work> Well, everyone is going off early at work for the week-end ! I'll do the same and head towards home !
17:02 < laxa_work> See you in 1 hour.
17:02 <@deen> bye
17:14 <@deen> afk
17:31 < Savander> 32 plyaers
17:31 < Savander> yaay !<3
17:59 < laxa> Savander: you know capgemini ?
17:59 < Savander> nop
17:59 < Savander> nope, what is it?
17:59 < laxa> it's a big enterprise, I work for them
17:59 < laxa> their hotline is in Poland
17:59 < Savander> what
17:59 < Savander> xD
18:00 < laxa> Well, I just called them cause I have a strange problem on my laptop
18:00 < laxa> and they are in Poland
18:00 < laxa> but they do speak french :p
18:00 < Savander> Hehe ;], 
18:00 < Savander> I think, it's required?
18:00 < Savander> in poland?
18:01 < Savander> ;D
18:01 < laxa> What ?
18:07 < laxa> deen: are you there ?
18:07 <@deen> ?
18:07 < laxa> I wanna do the following, in my /home/laxa/.teesworlds/maps
18:07 < laxa> I want this folder to be a git clone folder
18:07 < laxa> for the maps you host
18:07 < laxa> is that possible ?
18:07 < laxa> so whenever you release a map, I just do "git pull"
18:09 < laxa> cause, afaik, if I do "git clone xxx"
18:09 < laxa> it will create a new folder
18:09 < laxa> and I don't want that :)
18:11 <@deen> not possible because the maps are in subdirectories
18:11 < laxa> boah
18:13 <@deen> what's so bad about the 1 second download?
18:14 < laxa> I am hosting my own ddnet server
18:14 < laxa> just for myself :p
18:16 < o_be_one> i'm hosting my own ddnet server, just for blmapPepe :D
18:16 < laxa> and btw, the 1 second download doesn't always work.
18:16 < o_be_one> fastdl, awesome feature ^^
18:16 < laxa> fastdl isn't from ddnet :)
18:16 < laxa> it's from eeeee
18:17 < o_be_one> i know
18:17 < laxa> and I have the only race server with it :p
18:17 < o_be_one> yes i know i used it on ddwar before, i use it on xxlddrace too :D
18:17 < o_be_one> and openfng too
18:23 <@deen> tw 0.7 also has fastdl i think
18:23 < laxa> teeworlds 0.7 will never go out :(
18:23 < laxa> never be released I mean
18:23 < laxa> deen: you know every command I should use before recording ?
18:23 < laxa> I'll make a .cfg file, more handy :)

18:27 < laxa> is that good ?
18:27 <@deen> don't need healthammo and score
18:27 <@deen> that's included in hud
18:27 < laxa> ok
18:27 <@deen> server message sounds off to
18:27 < laxa> command ?
18:27 < laxa> ok go tit

18:28 <@deen> snd_highlight 0
18:28 <@deen> eh
18:29 < laxa> ok sounds good :), thanks !
18:34 <@deen> laxa: In English there is no space before !, ? and .
18:34 < laxa> yeah I know
18:34 <@deen> But you always add one
18:34 < laxa> but it's better I find :p
18:35 < laxa> ok, I have 1 demo for the Hall of Fame :p
18:35 < laxa> I'll fraps now and upload when eating !
18:36 < laxa> Please no highlight for 15 minutes, recording now !
18:38 <@deen> you could also just close your irc client or disable the highlights^^
18:42 < o_be_one> maybe we can hl flood :D ?
18:46 < EastBite> hl what?
18:50 < laxa> It's good now :p
18:50 < laxa> Such a bad bad run :(
18:52 < laxa> Now compressing !
18:52 < EastBite> encoding*
18:52 < laxa> my bad :p
18:52 < EastBite> :q
18:54 < laxa> maybe someone knows a bit about encoding ?
18:54 < laxa> I am currently using MPEG-4 or H.263
18:55 < laxa> with a bitrate of 2500 kbps
18:55 < laxa> I tried h.264, but the encoding is really long, less than 1 fps/s
18:55 < laxa> any other codec that would be better than h.263 for not too long encoding ?
18:55 < EastBite> hm h.264 encoding is really fast for me
18:56 < EastBite> I use vpx (webm)
18:57 < laxa> I use virtualdub
18:58 < EastBite> not available for linux I think
18:58 < EastBite> I'm just using ffmpeg on commandline
18:58 < laxa> how fast are you encoding h.264 ?
18:59 < EastBite> hm would need to do a test encode
19:01 < EastBite> frame=   99 fps= 67 q=-1.0 Lsize=     380kB time=00:00:04.04 bitrate= 768.7kbits/s
19:01 < laxa> 67fps/s ?
19:01 < laxa> are you kidding me lol ?
19:01 < EastBite> it goes between 50 and 100 for a 1080p yuotube video
19:06 < laxa> well anyway, I am not that unhappy with h.263, but still, it's weird
19:14 < laxa> deen: new demo ! From redfight :p
19:19 <@deen> ideally you would use h264 in a way that youtube doesn't need to reencode
19:20 <@deen> 390 players
19:23 < EastBite> youtube doesn't reencode? how do you know?
19:23 <@deen> i think they analyze the video before and if it's in the exactly correct format and settings they don't
19:23 <@deen> but my information is old, might have changed
19:24 < EastBite> it would be the right way ofcourse
19:24 <@deen> Ah yeah, they reencode by now, probably to prevent security bugs
19:25 < EastBite> meh :/
19:25 <@deen> well, then just upload the video raw!
19:25 < EastBite> for sure xd
19:25 <@deen> x264 has an uncompressed mode
19:25 <@deen> it's not that big, and extremely fast
19:25 < laxa> sure
19:25 < laxa> I'll upload raw video
19:25 <@deen> not uncompressed, without quality loss
19:25 < laxa> without fiber
19:25 < EastBite> rather stick to webm and upload on a webspace <3
19:25 <@deen> EastBite: but expensive =/
19:28 <@deen> ddos
19:28 <@deen> on GER
19:29 < EastBite> yes the website is down
19:35 <@deen> next big ddos
19:36 <@deen> hm, at least 10 gbit/s
22:39 < EastBite> [22:38:02] ah
22:39 <@deen> [22:38:48] ddnet.tw back!
22:49 <@deen> Already getting complaints about GER being down
22:49 <@deen> some people lag on FRA
23:06 < laxa> deen: you there ? :)
23:08 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/1UjQgQ
23:08 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 6ab4c56 def: Add a small close button in editor for people who happen to accidentally click on the Editor symbol in menu, but are unable to find File -> Exit
23:11 < laxa> deen: ok it's fixed :p
23:25 <@deen> hm, some people just look at their favorites
23:25 <@deen> they won't notice ddnet moved from GER to FRA
23:26 < EastBite> we need a ddnet tab
23:30 <@deen> seriously?
23:30 <@deen> because i don't think so
23:30 <@deen> you can just search for ddnet
23:30 < EastBite> a nice list of all ddnet servers sortable by country
23:30 < EastBite> but search is slow
23:31 <@deen> hmm
23:31 <@deen> not a bad idea, want to impement it?
23:31 < EastBite> what's the best way to implement it
23:31 < EastBite> you need to be able to update the list somehow
23:32 < EastBite> or maybe a second master?
23:32 <@deen> similar to the news i would say
23:32 < EastBite> didnt look into that
23:33 <@deen> it just downloads a file over http
23:33 < EastBite> ah I see
23:33 <@deen> and if it can't download the file it uses the local version
23:33 <@deen> much better when masterserver is down
23:35 < EastBite> doesn't look like http
23:35 <@deen> ehm, sorry
23:35 <@deen> it's udp^^
23:35 < EastBite> :P
23:35 <@deen> the ddnet.upd file was http!
23:35 <@deen> yeah, udp works as well
23:35 <@deen> just make the versionsrv send a list of servers
23:35 <@deen> additionally to news and version
23:36 < EastBite> y
23:36 < EastBite> yes*
23:37 <@deen> do you want to make the interface nicer as well?
23:37 < EastBite> btw. the news txt has a bunch of null bytes at the end
23:37 <@deen> so they are grouped into servers, and then you can do sort inside these groups
23:37 < EastBite> would be an option
23:37 <@deen> i know, but does it matter?^^
23:38 < EastBite> but not sure how much time I have in the weekend
23:38 < EastBite> it does :D
23:39 < EastBite> a thing I don't like in favs is that not reachable servers are displayed
23:39 < EastBite> so you have to scroll
23:39 < EastBite> oh wait there are filter options
23:40 <@deen> you could add a filter for "Server not reachable"
23:40 <@deen> unreachable*
23:40 < EastBite> sur
23:40 < EastBite> sure
23:40 < EastBite> my keyboard sucks
