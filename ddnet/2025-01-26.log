01:02 < bridge> <Solly> amazing
01:02 < bridge> <oxyzo.> no thats chillerdragon
01:03 < bridge> <Solly> lies & deceit
01:03 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :nouis:
01:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am Solly
01:09 < bridge> <zhn> ur souli
01:12 < bridge> <soulyvevo> üò≠
01:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im noby
02:10 < bridge> <totar> I got the macos build working! :D
02:10 < bridge> <totar> I went back to the native build because those problems looked easier to fix
02:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What exactly does the gametime margin mean, especially when it's spiking?
02:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> How can I debug this?
02:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What server-side thing could affect it?
02:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> & what could cause high pred ms in debug menu? also searching for a serverside fix
02:46 < bridge> <davide55> ChillerDragon, filter now fully compatible with 0.7
02:53 < bridge> <totar> gametime is the stability of the snapshots the server is sending you
02:54 < bridge> <totar> the graph is not that useful
02:54 < bridge> <totar> it won't show missing snapshots
02:54 < bridge> <totar> only ones that are delayed
02:54 < bridge> <totar> but not that delayed
02:55 < bridge> <totar> I think the direction is also reversed
02:55 < bridge> <totar> so a high spike means the snapshot was late, a low spike means it was early
03:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks

03:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> @cellegenrih 
03:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for the most basic example, consider the case of a moving point colliding with a box
03:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Instead of checking the point's location at a number of substeps and checking if any of those are inside the box, you instead consider the collision between a line segment and a box, where the line segment is just the path that the point would've traveled during that tick
03:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> wouldn't you get that line segment from a raycast tho?
03:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The line segment in this example is simply the line between the previous position of the point and the position the point would end up at if there was nothing obstructing its motion
03:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> what is the line represented as?
03:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> in terms of code
03:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a line segment is naturally represented as its start and end points
03:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so two vectors
03:21 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ty
03:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh, that comes in a neat way of detecting things then right?
03:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If you make a rectangle out of those two vectors (previous position - current position), then inbetween those positions are the entities that we care about right? so in cases of comparision, we only compare to entities inside that region
03:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But I guess you gonna mention other stuff xd
03:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though I guess representing it as the starting point and the vector from the starting point to the end point would be just as good
03:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yep!
03:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so in this case it'd just be the position last tick and `velocity * dt`
03:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And I assume any entity in the appr. middle of the region is a guaranteed hit right?
03:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well depends on the size of the entity you're colliding with but yeah
03:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> let me find you a nice Wikipedia page
03:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the approximation would be the middle part +- the size of the tee
03:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the approximation would be the middle part +- the size of the tee / 2
03:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> pls do :owo:
03:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sorry, I couldn't seem to find a Wikipedia page that explains the simpler cases that I'm talking about üòî
03:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> üëç np, I kinda got the jest of it
04:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Look into Minkowski sums and differences, and see if you can understand the idea of the GJK algorithm
04:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
04:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What I was talking about earlier was basically the special cases where you can skip the whole GJK part and immediately determine if the Minkowski difference contains the origin
04:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> For example, the Minkowski difference of two spheres is also a sphere, and finding whether a point is inside a sphere is trivial
04:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (tees are conveniently circular)
04:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The Minkowski difference of two axis aligned rectangles is also an axis aligned rectangle, and those are trivial too

08:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would blame your network but if teeworlds works that‚Äôs weird.
08:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea no idea sorry.
08:09 < bridge> <.inclosed> Yes, if I connect via master.teeworlds, the servers are working and I can log in to them
08:09 < bridge> <.inclosed> Is it possible to run DDNet server through master teeworlds?
08:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can not even log into the ddnet servers?
08:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Technically yes but it‚Äôs not trivial @.inclosed
08:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You should be able to connect to the server even if it is not in the master

08:12 < bridge> <davide55> D:
08:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Aren‚Äôt you in Italy timezone?
08:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It was like middle of the night when we were still gaming

08:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When did you sleep
08:13 < bridge> <davide55> Yeah
08:13 < bridge> <davide55> Well, I just woke up
08:13 < bridge> <davide55> I don't sleep a lot
08:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How did you even manage to do 0.7 without redirect

08:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Epic puzzle

08:14 < bridge> <davide55> You will underatand it even without dissector
08:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Of course
08:14 < bridge> <davide55> I did something stupd but it works
08:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can read the raw bytes
08:14 < bridge> <davide55> No
08:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can!

08:16 < bridge> <davide55> If you are too far from the master
08:16 < bridge> <davide55> It can lead to a timeout
08:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The other issue says can‚Äôt resolve like it was dns
08:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pretty weird that curl works
08:17 < bridge> <davide55> Probably no timeouts in normal curl
08:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You think he just has reaaaally slow internet?
08:17 < bridge> <davide55> By default curl timeout is something like 160s
08:17 < bridge> <davide55> It can be!
08:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The teeworlds master works for him
08:18 < bridge> <davide55> Well, UDP don't really have a timeout most of the times
08:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @.inclosed: how long did it take for the curl to finish?

08:28 < ChillerDragon> yea i am not sure if it is possible i would have to think about it

08:29 < bridge> <davide55> well, I don't really care telling how it works, I'll not open source it a) because it's useless, nobody can use it without proper hardware and uplinks and b) I use a lot of "helper functions" whiich I use in a lot of filters, and I'll never share them üòÑ

08:34 < ChillerDragon> yes
08:34 < ChillerDragon> yes
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it was using relative offsets for replies but that's bad, i think it would be better if every message had some kind of id and you could reply to it at any time

18:28 < bridge> <learath2> They don't move fast and break things. The pace of mature languages is incompatible with most modern developers
20:03 < bridge> <Solly> @art0007i boo
20:58 < bridge> <totar> they move slow and break things
20:59 < bridge> <totar> they should stop moving so people make c+++
21:01 < bridge> <totar> actually to be fair they have done a few crazy things in the past but the compiler just refuse to implement them so they can't really do that much

21:03 < bridge> <totar> modules would be cool if they worked
21:59 < bridge> <totar> actually to be fair they have done a few crazy things in the past but the compilers just refuse to implement them so they can only do so much
22:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: u know what is in ddnet anti bot repo? And how is it linked into the servers? I am looking for the recommended way to set it up. Every project I saw so far had some non clean solutions for storing the anti bot code.
22:51 < bridge> <learath2> it's basically just `g++ antibot_lib.cpp <some_other_cpp_files>... -I/ddnet/src -I/ddnet/build/src -fvisibility=hidden -fPIC -shared -o libantibot.so -Og -g`
