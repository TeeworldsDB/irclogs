02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `:)` now maps to the right emoji on discord ðŸ™‚
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (was ðŸ˜„ in the past)
06:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `:bot:`
06:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cool works now too
06:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before it still made an emoji
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how to spell ddrace? xd
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> DDrace or DDRace ?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I vote for the latter
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea seems like its the most used in ddnet code base
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but is DDracenetwork speeled differnetly then?
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because its shortend to DDNet
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only those 3 letters are uppercase and the R gets lowered=
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also spelled DDRaceNetwork in some places
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> DummyDragRaceNetwork
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we should rename it to 0.7race, it'd show off the glory of 0.7 properly
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 7race
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 7zip
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to fuck up identifiers in programming languages
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because they usually can't start with numbers ðŸ™‚
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:

12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ¤¡
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> call it DD7 as Dummy Drag 7.0
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> hey all i have a problem with my pc
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> i have ddr5 memory 
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> does this mean I can only play ddrace 5.0 and I cannot play 0.6?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> hey all i have a problem with my pc
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> i have ddr5 memory 
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> does this mean I can only play ddrace 0.5 and I cannot play 0.6?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :troll: yes
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and for 0.7 you need atleast an intel i7
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and for 0.7 you need atleast an intel i7 or amd ryzen 7
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jason54 | BlackPast> there would be a possibility to disable the rocket projections on the other player with mod mkrace for a solo server 0.7
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I already answered on that one @jason54 | BlackPast
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/407308363031117832/407308363031117834/620835409450106890
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> poor guy stole too many servers but doesnt know how they work :pepeH:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> correct
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jason54 | BlackPast> @noby I'm not stealing so calm down
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fine ur using peoples shit without asking permission which is technically not stealing but still scummy
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jason54 | BlackPast> @noby I know very well how it works I meant that there was an opportunity to put it in mod
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jason54 | BlackPast> all the mods I have are not modifying ....
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :wtf:
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i heard u took someones mod and changed the info/credits to say that u made it instead of them
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk but seems prety skechy
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mr reverse engineer over here
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh maybe he had the source
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah i think he did have source thats why its not really stealing
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its just rude to take someones open source mod and replace their name with urs
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a dick move
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> +
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> But
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Does this mod have license
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk ask @fokkonaut he knows more about what happened than i do
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hey, sorry to interrupt, but my question would be that what it needs to be done exactly, to have a well working account system that shouldnt be exploitable by bots or players?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this project would interest me
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Was
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> was
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> there is nothing that would be perfect
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well working not perfect,
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> in every situations people would get their name stole
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and there would be no way to recognize the real player and the fake
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i dont think there would be a problem with that, unless blockmark or other stupid team would actually do that
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We still have no way of finding who someone is
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> as if now
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Of course there will be problems lol
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> without it is the same
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> isnt it
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to do something like steam
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where you can have whatever name you want
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you can be whoever i want, i can spam or funvote as much as i want, and like exploit the shit out of the system with modifying the clients or your connection with it
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I had some form of it working, but people just didn't like the idea)
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it isnt safe as much as having an acount
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it depends on how much control you have above player who use them
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> wtf
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> are u stupid
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why do u think having accounts will prevent people from modifying client..
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> or what
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @onby do we have client detector?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean you made one
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> If there is account system
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why not implement it
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> People who get stolen
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> wouldn't be able to use THEIR name anymore
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and thats the problem
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who would give their passwords, yes?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ????????????????????
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wtf
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who would get their account stolen?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> modified clients are a completely separate problem
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> anyone can just recompile ddnet with bot code added
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and how
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> if someone register before you do
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ???
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and then it becomes impossible to detect the client itself
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u have to guess by the inputs
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> imagine right now Learath releases account system
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and i register before you do
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> with ur name
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Gwendal I also solved that one, by not "claiming" names
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> what could u do ?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> absolutely nothing
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @Learath2 whats the point of account system then ?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> jesus, there can be a solution for that too gwendal, but think about anything else but that
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The owner of the finishes is definitely known with an account system
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> yeah aight
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> got it
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> but uh
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> + we can do fancy moderation stuff
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i do not rly like this idea
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> even tho thats the best way we have
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> which isnt as personal
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> instead its public, everybody can use that
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If people start spamming, we could have a +m mode like in irc, where people without accounts cant talk
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and claim those as their own
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ingame lea?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like social media room?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye ath had that :troll:
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but nice idea tho.
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd stop the spam completely if we add some proof of work to be submitted to get an account
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yeah.... i dont see it coming xd
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> as if, the chat depends on the server and not on the client
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said, I had a PoC of it working, people just weren't too keen on accounts all together
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i dont see the reason why wouldnt be a good try at least
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just to see what happens you know.
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In other news I killed the clock for my 8 bit computer ðŸ˜¦
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oof
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> too many voltage
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> feelsbadman
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what, I have exams until the 20th, then I'll do another proof of concept for accounts
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> see how people like it
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lea, so you guys will change the ui of the chat, so it'll be pretty? :3
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Wat
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Its pretty af
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> lmao
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye, i cant see the white font chat infront of the map
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I had trouble with that aswell
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I never had that problem, but i only play with entities
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of maybe showing a small gray background when you hold u
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> at least make an update font with shadows behind it? ðŸ˜¦
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> would be nice
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> There is
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we do have shadows
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Maybe u use opengl3
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i cant see it tbh
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe could add a setting to boost the outline
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> sigh.... *cheat engine opening* time to modify that setting too
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its gonna be fun, just do that :troll:
19:18  * Learath2 is studying java rn
19:18 <+Learath2> :C
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh lea, what is the pixel ratio of the debug font picture?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i would try something
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, found a bug with the irc link
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cool
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Cellegen noidea
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> seems like 16x16 but no idea
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye seems like 16x16, its weird how it looks like in editor
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GIMP and photoshop both have rulers, even paint can work in a rush ðŸ˜›
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have brain, i just counted how many fonts we have in the x and y ratio
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its quiet ***effective***
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> quite*
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also i'll try to add more special fonts if you guys dont mind, and send it to here
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and i hope it wont break anything
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 btw do u have any other idea what could cause the empty chat line bug
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> itâ€™s not actually adding an extra line
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao how did you check? Did you take a look at the contents of the chat string?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i checked the line count which was 1
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if it would actually wrap it would be 2
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and ye there were no strange chars either
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ddnet text on opengl has an outline
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U can see the shader to find out
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk without opengl
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> probably because of the transparent tiles that the debug font picture has?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like 9 tiles worth of space is transparent, i dont know if you can write it down on chat ðŸ˜›
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bro u know what u talking about?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and YOU know what im talking about?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> at least try to hide your intellection
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¡
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ¤¡

20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> these red tiles are transparent but i dont know it its coded into ingame chat
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddddd
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly think a png is used as font?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man...
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then how do you explain debug_font.png you idiot :troll:
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> debug_font.png is not used for chat
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nor for menus
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only for ctrl shift d
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh wait, it is ..................

20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i can still look at the right folder
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and if i see any transparency, then im still not done with that problem
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just dont understand why u try to speak on something you don't know
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its for your own good
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you just look stupid
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no offense
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> bruh, i only missed the file where the ingame fonts are at
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not about missing a file the problem here xD
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess its no use trying to convince you
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but otherwise im still searching for answers and not infoing anything
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have fun so i can laugh more
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why is ryo in #developer
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sent some scripts in html to jao

20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the role
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sent some scripts in html to @jao
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> are you proud of yourself now?

20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> riiiight, so i've been looking onto the folder where the different truetypes are at
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> have we tried replacing the truetype font which is on ingame chat and try to replicate the bug?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk how to replicate it
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @Cellegen why did u lie
