00:02 < bridge> <murpi> Wouldn't it be possible to adjust how many tabs the client can display based of the currently set resolution?
00:08 < bridge> <murpi> or maybe pivot to a vertical setup, perhaps by introducing a dropdown menu
00:24 < bridge> <peter0x44> personally I pity the maintainer here
00:24 < bridge> <peter0x44> I'm sure the situation is not nice for them
00:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> how does it justify that?
00:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> isn't github the "real main git repo"? afaik it was just the published tarballs that had problems
00:56 < bridge> <louis> what about letting the tabs be scrollable
01:10 < bridge> <peter0x44> I have a 5:4 1280*1024 monitor

01:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The alpha in ColorRGBA is not behaving as I expected it to behave. The marking has a lighter shade of red than the body. And as soon as the transparency goes below like 8ish it turns darker.
01:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Did i mess something up in RenderTee7 or is that just how the ddnet rendering behaves?
09:02 < bridge> <reitw> Apparently it wasn't before
10:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like the most realistic solution that doesn't add a lot of effort for 5:4 resolutions. Initially I didn't want to add complicated logic to prevent more favorite communities from being added than can be shown in the menu, which would add a weird dependency on the screen size in the engine serverbrowser component.
11:21 < bridge> <robyt3> 5 favorite communities should be enough :justatest:

12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know what -fno-common does?
12:04 < bridge> <learath2> iirc it prevents sharing of globals
12:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> `I'd generally prefer having Python scripts over bash scripts, Python runs on more operating systems and seems easier to maintain.` doesnt bash run on more operating systems? i mean it runs on almost all systems (windows, mac, linux) - without the need of an additional intepreter like python, even tho i highly agree that its easier to maintain
12:36 < bridge> <robyt3> > I'd generally prefer having Python scripts over bash scripts, Python runs on more operating systems and seems easier to maintain.
12:36 < bridge> <robyt3> I agree. Bash only works on all systems if all the individual programs you execute in your script work an all system. For Python you simply install the modules you need and it works on all systems. Python is also significantly faster than Bash.
12:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> that makes a lot more sense - thanks for the clarification :)
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> that applies to rust too

15:34 < bridge> <teero777> yo what is GameTickTime? or rather how does it work?
15:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does client send or receive more data when entities are off?
15:40 < bridge> <robyt3> No, this should only affect rendering

15:44 < bridge> <teero777> cpu bottleneck?
15:45 < bridge> <robyt3> As far as I understand it, it's the time in seconds between the previous tick and the current tick, see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/8412d2be6ea14c8d1b8ba3207e19ae2890c0ebce/src/engine/docs/client_time.txt
15:47 < bridge> <teero777> but it isnt always 0.02 s. i assume you mean the time from current time until the next tick?
15:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1223644842131718164/image.png?ex=661a9b10&is=66082610&hm=5cb374687df6eac12471fab9d430c07ab0af5f8c8239fb616e6e4b808919e5b6&
15:50 < bridge> <robyt3> It should be the time between previous tick and current tick according to the code and the docs, but the time of the current tick is determined by `CSmoothTime`

16:18 < bridge> <peter0x44> I find the whole story suspicious
16:19 < bridge> <peter0x44> keep in mind the guy reporting it is a microsoft employee and MS definitely has NSA ties
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder how many backdoors are in the billion lines of code that is systemd
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> const float TimeSinceLastTick = (float)std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(std::chrono::steady_clock::now() - LastTickTime).count();
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> float GameTickTime = TimeSinceLastTick / 1000.f;
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> ```
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> so something like this would be correct?
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> @robyt3
16:26 < bridge> <teero777> and the intra tick would then be smth like `TimeSinceLastTick / (1000.f / (float)SERVER_TICK_SPEED)`?
16:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> HAPPY BIRTHDAY MILKY
16:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait for AI to accept 500 billion tokens so we can ask it
16:35 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know exactly how it works, but that looks too simple to be correct
16:35 < bridge> <teero777> xD
16:36 < bridge> <teero777> i just tried
16:36 < bridge> <teero777> it works :D
16:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Intra tick should be a float between 0 and 1 that specifies how far between the previous and the current tick you are
16:37 < bridge> <teero777> yes thats exactly what that doies
16:37 < bridge> <teero777> yes thats exactly what that dois
16:37 < bridge> <teero777> yes thats exactly what that does
16:38 < bridge> <teero777> TimeSinceLastTick is in a range of 0..0.02.
16:38 < bridge> <teero777> divinding that by 0.02 gives a range of 0..1
16:38 < bridge> <teero777> :D
16:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like you are ignoring whatever `CSmoothTime` does then
16:39 < bridge> <teero777> i have no idea what CSmoothTime even is
16:39 < bridge> <teero777> i have no idea what `CSmoothTime` even is
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> prediction need a steady timing where the client runs a fixed amount of ticks ahead of the server
16:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in practice it is impossible
16:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> CSmoothTime tracks the timing sent by the server and make sure the pacing is roughly the same regardless of jitter and adjust for latency
16:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> from what i can read out of smooth_time.h - it takes a target time val and returns a smoothed time by adjusting it:
16:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> `void SetAdjustSpeed(EAdjustDirection Direction, float Value);`
16:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> So basically the client is actually constantly speeding up and slowing down just to make sure it stays ahead of the server and not by too much
16:43 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet is over engineered...
16:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no, that's how client-side prediction has always worked
16:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also that was teeworlds' code
16:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> ddnet is based off of teeworlds, teeworlds was supposed to be a game engine before actually becoming a game afair
16:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> rocket league, counter strike, etc. any sensible game is done this way. teeworlds has physics no less so it really need it
16:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> espacially since teeworlds is a lot more sensible than any other game i know
16:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean.. basically anytime you need server authoring client side movement, you need client-side prediction
16:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is good for making sure only the server has the ground truth of a state of any given moment
16:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~or you can just give up and introduce input latency like old style fighting games~~

22:23 < bridge> <headshotnoby> only the main screen can render 3D, in this case the bottom screen

22:25 < bridge> <headshotnoby> opengl however, yes and no
22:26 < bridge> <headshotnoby> libnds (the NDS homebrew library i use) offers an opengl-like syntax for interacting with the 3D hardware
