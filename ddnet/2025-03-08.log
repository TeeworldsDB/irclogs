00:05 < bridge> <zhn> i wonder if this caused by sdl3-compat
01:23 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm back to complain about my inability to right click in the browser. : angryemoji :
01:28 < bridge> <syrinok> fix it or there will be consequences
01:32 < bridge> <kebscs> Why right click
01:33 < bridge> <syrinok> I love to right click, that is all
01:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I can right click in firefox
01:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :GreemDev:
01:35 < bridge> <syrinok> :jaouis:
01:36 < bridge> <hectavoxel> the devs want there to soon be special interation through right click, i think
01:36 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i dunno what type of interaction, or if they even said thay
01:36 < bridge> <syrinok> HELP
01:37 < bridge> <syrinok> FOR WHAT
01:37 < bridge> <syrinok> o
01:37 < bridge> <syrinok> I'll die on this hill
01:37 < bridge> <syrinok> :feelsamazingman:
01:38 < bridge> <syrinok> jk, they took away my right click, I have no reason to ever come back to this game gg
01:38 < bridge> <syrinok> 🫡
01:38 < bridge> <zerolacqua> :poggers2:
01:39 < bridge> <syrinok> I have no clue who you are :justatest:
01:41 < bridge> <syrinok> new dev, must be the one that removed my right click :feelsbadman:
01:41 < bridge> <syrinok> @learath2 im crashing out
01:42 < bridge> <syrinok> console me
01:42 < bridge> <totar> what did right click do
01:43 < bridge> <learath2> There is no consolation. Game ruined
01:43 < bridge> <syrinok> gg
01:43 < bridge> <syrinok> it provided me comfort and happiness
01:45 < bridge> <syrinok> Long story short: Left click had a bug that would randomly connect you to the game if you were to press it once, no clue if it was ever fixed or not, so I refused to press it ever since. (Though, it did happen with right click at one point as well, but I believe that was actually fixed after robyt removed right click and I complained about it then got it added back)
01:45 < bridge> <syrinok> So I love to right click and if I don't get it back, I don't know what I'll even do with my life
01:46 < bridge> <totar> ah
01:46 < bridge> <syrinok> It's my safety button
01:46 < bridge> <totar> I remember this pr
01:47 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9774
01:47 < bridge> <syrinok> I like to look at servers to see what people are on them without the risk of joining them, cause that's very awkward
01:47 < bridge> <totar> @kebscs
01:47 < bridge> <syrinok> Like, what if I joined the server, I'd have to interact with the person
01:47 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't wanna do that, you know?
01:49 < bridge> <syrinok> Sigh...
01:49 < bridge> <syrinok> I'll be willing to part ways with my right click, as long as something good gets added that uses it... If it's just outright removed... There will be actual consequences
01:50 < bridge> <totar> it's trivial to add back, it's like a 1 line change
01:50 < bridge> <syrinok> (I won't do fucking SHIT about it, but I will be upset)
01:50 < bridge> <totar> ask kebs
01:50 < bridge> <totar> this is textbook spacebar heating moment
01:53 < bridge> <syrinok> Honestly, I believe this was a direct attack against me
01:54 < bridge> <syrinok> They saw me step down and "quit" playing, they thought they could slip this change in when I'm at my weakest
02:01 < bridge> <louis> i never experienced this bug
02:01 < bridge> <syrinok> I'M NOT CRAZY
02:02 < bridge> <louis> are you sure your mouse doesn't have a funky left click 😅
02:02 < bridge> <syrinok> That could've been the case at the time.........................
02:02 < bridge> <syrinok> But that's besides the point...
02:02 < bridge> <syrinok> Right click could never betray me like that, right click could never connect me
02:05 < bridge> <syrinok> (I'm mostly joking, if it wasn't obvious. But it would be cool to have right click back :owo: )
02:08 < bridge> <syrinok> I just right clicked to select a server and it made me mad again, whoever did the change, just know you brought me much pain
02:19 < bridge> <kebscs> :justatest:
02:24 < bridge> <kebscs> @totar when fast input in ddnet client?
02:24 < bridge> <totar> open an issue for it
02:25 < bridge> <totar> if maintainers want it I'll consider doing a PR
02:43 < bridge> <kebscs> Sure
02:43 < bridge> <kebscs> I think it's good because visual only
03:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just came up with the most evil, most heinous, most *diabolical* feature:
03:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> hook fire delay
03:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> make it a new tune, default to 0
03:52 < bridge> <Solly> D:
03:52 < bridge> <Solly> thats horrible
04:03 < bridge> <Ewan> random hook fire delay range
04:04 < bridge> <Solly> you can just have a delay then use lots of zones or fifo pipe to randomize
04:17 < bridge> <zerolacqua> :wtf: fire delay for wall hammer :kek:
05:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> I'd like to know who is supposed to delete the bug-abusing rank
06:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> any admin
06:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> green names
06:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i believe you can just use admin tickets for sus records. but for the practice thing that uses server bugs, they'll just have internal tool that checks player inputs and mass delete them once the tools are ready. so probably don't bother them with that.
06:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> this isn't even the third time something like this happened.
07:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> okay i actually meant to offer help if needed
07:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> 💀

07:19 < bridge> <Solly> What's going on
07:19 < bridge> <Solly> Ping
07:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> i think it's caused by your recent pr so
07:20 < bridge> <Solly> Right but what's going on in the image
07:20 < bridge> <Solly> You just have directions enabled, is this in-game?
07:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> i have copy  move on and am stacking with my dummy
07:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> yes ingame
07:21 < bridge> <Solly> Your dummy looks transparent and their nameplate looks fine
07:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> their direction is shown above the hook strength indicator
07:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> but for myself the indicator isn't shown
07:22 < bridge> <Solly> Oh I misread
07:22 < bridge> <Solly> Why is it not transparent
07:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> idk
07:22 < bridge> <Solly> I thought the 3 arrows where all yours
07:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh only the left two
07:22 < bridge> <Solly> Directions were originally on top I thought
07:23 < bridge> <Solly> I put them on the bottom because of this
07:23 < bridge> <Solly> But reverted it because I was told otherwise
07:23 < bridge> <Solly> I didn't actually check thouh
07:24 < bridge> <pioooooo> hmm
07:24 < bridge> <Solly> Do you remember
07:24 < bridge> <Solly> Cuz I dont
07:24 < bridge> <pioooooo> let me check
07:24 < bridge> <Solly> It's 6am and 6 hours past my bedtime
07:25 < bridge> <Solly> Darn
07:25 < bridge> <pioooooo> why still awake
07:25 < bridge> <Solly> I don't know
07:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347819586405273691/54d6523aebb34070.png?ex=67cd364e&is=67cbe4ce&hm=13d84149656d10285d1fe89aaa56c0bd6666c4612dd2cf06cd49a77cd38d89e4&
07:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> this is 19.0
07:37 < bridge> <Solly> It is on the bottom
07:37 < bridge> <Solly> I got lied to
07:37 < bridge> <Solly> Well I'll change it back and make it transparent again idk why it's not
07:37 < bridge> <Solly> After some eep tho
07:38 < bridge> <Solly> There hasn't been a release for this I hope
07:38 < bridge> <Solly> With this in it
07:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> yeah not yet
07:41 < bridge> <Solly> Sleep isn't working
07:44 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347822185959657563/image.png?ex=67cd38ba&is=67cbe73a&hm=c6bf169fb2a7e3d45104d90fafe9ccd1ac48f08a66b9c15790e8623bd99d9a78&
07:44 < bridge> <Solly> 😭
07:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> just put down phone and pc
07:45 < bridge> <Solly> thats an idea
07:54 < bridge> <Solly> @pioooooo ive fixed it
07:55 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347824929130676294/image.png?ex=67cd3b48&is=67cbe9c8&hm=4f693331eee1c24fa0f1d22f541dc26c2a0275bc15e917e99169b5086b504cce&
07:55 < bridge> <Solly> this look okay?
08:21 < bridge> <pioooooo> The padding looks different tho
08:21 < bridge> <pioooooo> Idk
08:21 < bridge> <Solly> you can change the size and gap from tee to first item
08:21 < bridge> <pioooooo> Okay for me, but idk what about hook strength indicator
08:21 < bridge> <pioooooo> Oh I see
08:21 < bridge> <Solly> modular nameplates go brr
08:22 < bridge> <Solly> the transparency thing idk why its like that
08:22 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347831749077368872/image.png?ex=67cd41a2&is=67cbf022&hm=1c0d86440f2dfa74843172a444403b6de68a2cd1c3c51123c6f046ac5f340e2c&
08:22 < bridge> <Solly> its not going transparent
08:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> I think same item should be at same place
08:22 < bridge> <Solly> or yellow
08:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> Modular is overkill for nameplates imo tho
08:23 < bridge> <Solly> but then you start to have left heavy nameplates (ping circle tclient ;D), friend mark and id
08:23 < bridge> <Solly> so many magic numbers to add new things
08:23 < bridge> <Solly> idk how tater did it
08:23 < bridge> <pilonpl> i think i figured out why my game crashes
08:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> i think it's when i switch to entities
08:24 < bridge> <pioooooo> maybe
08:25 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347832595219742753/image.png?ex=67cd426c&is=67cbf0ec&hm=2421caecf2410c1413ec0f3b5292b83a0b8f755bcf942439eb069bc4b3efe2a3&
08:25 < bridge> <Solly> i added a SetColor between every line
08:26 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
08:26 < bridge> <Solly> void CGraphics_Threaded::QuadsBegin()
08:26 < bridge> <Solly> {
08:26 < bridge> <Solly>     dbg_assert(m_Drawing == 0, "called Graphics()->QuadsBegin twice");
08:26 < bridge> <Solly>     m_Drawing = DRAWING_QUADS;
08:26 < bridge> <Solly> 
08:26 < bridge> <Solly>     QuadsSetSubset(0, 0, 1, 1);
08:26 < bridge> <Solly>     QuadsSetRotation(0);
08:26 < bridge> <Solly>     SetColor(1, 1, 1, 1);
08:26 < bridge> <Solly> }
08:26 < bridge> <Solly> ```

09:59 < bridge> <zhn> sheesh local list would be good indeed
10:00 < bridge> <zhn> nevermind now anyway too late to argue on this xd
10:23 < bridge> <remakepower> Is there any detailed documentation about the DDNet registration process?
10:30 < bridge> <teero777> I don't see it please help
10:30 < bridge> <teero777> ohh
10:30 < bridge> <teero777> Okay I found it
10:30 < bridge> <Solly> Lmao
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> what registration
11:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> he probably means the community registration
11:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> which is not available right now iirc
12:24 < bridge> <remakepower> master and server
12:24 < bridge> <remakepower> Our communtiy had already registered.
12:30 < bridge> <remakepower> I want to create an ddnet register implementation that's easy to port to old modes.
12:47 < bridge> <pioooooo> prediction is borked on nightly
12:47 < bridge> <pioooooo> is that known?
12:47 < bridge> <kebscs> @essigautomat do you want to do the auto rcon auth on local?
12:47 < bridge> <pioooooo> i mean on cerebos
12:47 < bridge> <kebscs> i have some time rn i could code it
12:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> cerberus
12:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> which has a onentertune(0)
14:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> closefest
14:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> why tunes look damn broken in 19.0
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Please be more specific.. A video maybe
14:49 < bridge> <kebscs> if you mean prediction, then tune override broke it
14:49 < bridge> <kebscs> fixed on nightly
14:49 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ok
14:50 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i will download nightly
14:50 < furo> @remakepower You can take a look at the PR that added it, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5064
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/octocrab/

14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1741441836.png
14:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> do you know what nightly it is fixed on
14:52 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9788>
14:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> does server also need to have that version or something because it still looks broken in ddnet servers
14:55 < bridge> <kebscs> just client side
14:55 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm
14:55 < bridge> <kebscs> its serversided yes
14:58 < bridge> <kebscs> @cyberfrighter if you want to rever it client side, revert this pr <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8959>
14:58 < bridge> <kebscs> @cyberfrighter if you want to revert it client side, revert this pr <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8959>
15:10 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> so the pr only fixes mods if they have the tunezones in the mapfile?
15:14 < bridge> <kebscs> the override pr should just work for mods yes
15:14 < bridge> <kebscs> but bcs of oversight it sent incorrect tune to players
15:14 < bridge> <kebscs> so i fixed it in my pr
15:15 < bridge> <kebscs> but bcs of oversight it sent incorrect tune to players even on ddnet
15:40 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently busy this weekend
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> ive added it already
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> if it gets merged you can just edit your pr since i didnt touch it
15:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> could you check map Cerberus? Prediction looks wrong on my end (nightly)
15:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> When you're in one of those cage

16:04 < bridge> <kebscs> both client+server on latest commit
16:23 < bridge> <kebscs> @pioooooo check dbg_tuning if smth wrong with prediction
16:23 < bridge> <kebscs> should be like on my screenshot
16:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> Oh I mean you don't move
16:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> But everyone else is jittering
16:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> Okay I tried on local nightly is fine
17:02 < bridge> <pioooooo> It seems server is running on older version
17:03 < bridge> <pioooooo> 🥺

18:10 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> mirrored stoppers in map jungledread, do these get fixed or smth

18:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm developing my cultural awareness!
18:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> are they gamebreaking?
18:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> at this point it is just a feature of the map
18:11 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> load it up and youll see its buggy and fucks up prediction
18:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> if you touch them you will be sent to hell full of tees who play linear 24/7
18:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> fix it, send it somewhere and hope that a god picks it up <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
18:13 < bridge> <teero777> @blaiszephyr will you accompany me while im eating my last sahne mumu? #Private 1
18:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> As a noob tee in DDNet civilization you can either run Linear for eternal suffering... or run Multeasymap for *also* eternal suffering
18:50 < bridge> <Solly> yeah i thought it would be funny for the commit to have a mispelling
19:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> that just looks hypocritical 🤓
19:16 < bridge> <Solly> its funnneee
19:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> best chance is to open an issue
19:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Not for map bugs tbh, - a GitHub issue would be something like
19:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
19:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> "send map bot through all existing maps"
19:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
19:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Mirrored stoppers are detected, etc
19:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I mean, the stoppers are broken on specific rotation.
19:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That's a bug, I think it got discussed tho, so opening an issue would still be benefical, to link to the other one, if there's one
19:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe a discord town-hall post people could post these in for testers/admins to see would be better
19:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
19:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> I'm fairly confident that more people use and check discord rather than a GitHub issue about stuff like this
19:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Heinrich is more active on github than discord as far as I can tell. Me too :p     
19:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So all relevant people actually are on github not discord
19:45 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe a bot that posts on both at the same time
19:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> a discord bot that posts github replies would be so troll
19:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you get to see robyt3 slaughtering peoples code live in chat
20:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I have a tw chat to github comments bridge on my todo since forever
20:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> gotta bridge everything everywhere
21:20 < bridge> <protocolhttps> how can i get m_vpAllVariables from m_pClient?
21:27 < bridge> <protocolhttps> i found how
21:28 < bridge> <Solly> $config
21:29 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
21:29 < bridge> <Solly> $configdirs
21:29 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
21:29 < bridge> <Solly> whats the command
21:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> $configdir
21:30 < bridge> <Solly> thanks
22:48 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> @robyt3 to be clear you do want me to report undefined behavor in the demo parsing correct?
22:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes, the demo player should have proper checks already, so feel free to open an issue if you find crashes/UB
22:54 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok
23:03 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> done
23:03 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> that is all i have found sadly
23:39 < bridge> <teero777> sadly? isnt this good? xD
23:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> for you yes, for me no. i wanted to find a exsplote lol
23:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> makes sense tbh
23:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddnet is all about exploiting
23:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> why do you think mapbugs exist LOL
23:50 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i mean there are a bunch just none that seem exsplotable
23:51 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> oh yea i should probs make a report about that oob write soon as it doesnt seem exsplotable due to needing to contral the memory to contual what gets writen to the memory so not that useful
