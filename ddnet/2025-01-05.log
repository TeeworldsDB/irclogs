00:10 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe
00:10 < bridge> <kebscs> just debug dummies for older clients
00:13 < bridge> <kebscs> i meant not just texture, but displaying it and mechanics
00:14 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i guess so
00:14 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i mean wouldnt there be a way to recieve extra velocity data and render a tee on the server
00:14 < bridge> <kebscs> probably, but 64 tee limit
00:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Should crates be jumpable like tiles or like doors?
00:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea, would make for fun map ideas
00:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> Prop fly moment
00:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> some things to think about is:
00:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> how would making and destroying crates work?
00:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> is there a limit?
00:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> how easy is it to break a map with too many crates?
00:25 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @cattide Thanks!
00:25 < bridge> <hectavoxel> (im deen guys trust me)
00:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> big sigma
00:41 < bridge> <swarfey> that is really cool, tho i wonder what is the point behind it? is it just a hobby project or does this aim to replace ddnet as a whole sometime?
00:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i hope it does replace ddnet
00:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> so much potential with a new framework
00:43 < bridge> <BratOK> 😄
00:43 < bridge> <BratOK> I’m always glad to support this game and community
00:44 < bridge> <swarfey> yeah it would be really cool if there would be some protocol changes but i fear all the old cool mods that will be dead forever
00:44 < bridge> <swarfey> and i believe the ddnet staff is quite conservative when it comes to such things, trying to keep backwards compatibility at all times
00:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno if it could replace ddnet, but I do hope that it some day can connect to the official database.
00:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Making it an actual alternative.
00:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
00:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's fair to say it's just a hobby project yet tho. Since it's still pretty unfinished
00:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd counter argue that modding now allows creating higher quality mods and potentially motivating modders again ^^
00:47 < bridge> <swarfey> i agree, i'd for sure be down to port my mod to ddnet-rs
00:47 < bridge> <swarfey> (if it becomes a thing)
00:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Fair
00:48 < bridge> <swarfey> but i'll play with it sometime, new framework sounds rly interesting
07:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: there's no way
07:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> good morning
07:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> question: If Godot would have a fully developed C++ support (using modern C++ 20 standards) and can also use Rust alongside it through Godot's API, would you guys try running Teeworlds through that Engine?
07:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> idk how much code can it be transfered to Godot, but I think the majority may be able to run the client side as you would expect it
08:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat well you get the shape (air or not) of one layer into another sounds like a feature to me
08:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar does ddnet-rs feel to you as smooth as ddnet? Can you play it normally? I am getting a bit nervous something feels off
08:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Why would we switch to something less efficient, less stable, less straightforward, just generally less suitable? Style points I guess?
08:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: But what if it's not air
08:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1325368185704157237/image.png?ex=677b88cf&is=677a374f&hm=7924c2491eb841b68d6248937523203154fef9676a68e3501302af76a9e820eb&

08:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Or is this just for the sake of argument because you're using Godot?
09:40 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks @davide55 !
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh? I'd say it's super smooth. The mouse movement isn't as fps dependent either. I can even play on 50 fps
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The cursor is properly 360°
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But do a video of both versions and show me what you mean
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller antiping is off by default.
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also noticed the hookline is bit buggy with antiping on, lemme fix that
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon do you use x11 or xwayland?
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tested with ms 1 now.
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sdl reports both correct for xwayland and wayland
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but winit does smth weird with x11 xD
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so maybe you are right
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try native wayland for testing
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller i reported it:
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/4077 xdd
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lets see what they say
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i was already on xorg when i tested ddnet-rs i just switched from wayland because the ddnet client cant capture the mouse on wayland -.-
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yes updating the brush texture would be nice
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar i do not think its anything a video can catch it just feels a bit different i can retest when im back home
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we talk about that there is a variable ``CCharacter::m_Pos`` and a function ``CCharacter::SetPosition`` which does not set it?
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/43524b9b20ef8a3f4a213e92b6a193236a1aba39/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L2445-L2448
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> CCharacter is an entity so it inherits https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/43524b9b20ef8a3f4a213e92b6a193236a1aba39/src/game/server/entity.h#L51
12:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like the character `m_Pos` is updated every tick based on the core position

16:32 < bridge> <Solly> filthy casuals
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> average gerdoe commit
17:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think set position still should set both to avoid unexpected values in the first tick
17:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea that should really be solved problem by now
17:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't think these claims are true tho, Godot is efficient enough for a 2D game like Teeworlds to run perfectly on older computers as well, since it can use OpenGL as an Engine Backend and the pipeline has also been improved by a lot since previous versions.
17:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It is actually more straight forward, than doing all of the work on Visual Studio, since the IDE has a visual interface to work on and you can test those changes in a more creative manner! I think Godot is a perfect way to let users interact with the source code better.
17:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It may be not suitable, since it's not built for Godot, but that doesn't mean it cannot be remade to be suitable. The whole reason I mentioned this, is because you guys lack ways to improve the dev experience for common folks, like me. You may say, that they could just make their own game if they don't like the engine, which I do it myself.
17:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> We'll see how many people off of this playerbase want this kind of change.
17:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean straightforward on a technical level, not ease of use. The engine is doing a number of extra steps not needed for Teeworlds because it needs to be general.
17:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sure people wouldn't be getting 15k fps anymore
17:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So you think Godot would shit itself?
17:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Nah it would run fine, but it wouldn't be exceptionally good like Teeworlds is currently
17:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Why would you need 15k FPS in the first place? You need a decent amount of FPS for rendering, the rest is handled differently
17:29 < bridge> <Solly> using a different ide is a pain for alot of people because all the tools you like are gone or different, specially if you are a emacs/vim bro
17:29 < bridge> <Solly> godot is a general purpose game engine, ddnet/teeworlds has made its own. i cant say anything truthfully about speed but  but it would probably be worse. the size would be much worse as well.
17:29 < bridge> <Solly> using a different ide is a pain for alot of people because all the tools you like are gone or different, especially if you are a emacs/vim bro
17:29 < bridge> <Solly> godot is a general purpose game engine, ddnet/teeworlds has made its own. i cant say anything truthfully about speed but  but it would probably be worse. the size would be much worse as well.
17:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If the sacrifice is performance, for the sake of better programming on it, I would take it every day
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well for some people going down from 300 to 60 or something along those lines would be a significant downgrade
17:30 < bridge> <learath2> What is the benefit of moving from an engine purpose built for this game to one that isn't? The only thing I can imagine is attracting godot developers to bolster our dev numbers, but I don't think any would show up just because we are on godot
17:30 < bridge> <Solly> it would also be a lot of work to completley port tw to godot since ya know its a big game. starting from scratch would take less time. making teeworlds run inside a godot environment might be possible (idk about the rust bits but those can be made into cpp) would not provide much of the benefit
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Also, gdscript is the best supported language in godot, but none of us write gdscript
17:31 < bridge> <Solly> even if (with vsync or otherwise) you limit yourself to 60fps its the difference between your computr blowing up, and being able to have discord open with vc and chrome open streaming music
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Well I write a little bit but I wouldn't say I'm great
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 11/10 best argument
17:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ddnet-godot when?
17:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also ddnet-ue5, ddnet-unity
17:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that just means it needs optimizing, nothing new... for old developers
17:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How good is Rust's C++ interop? It's all native modules after all
17:37 < bridge> <Solly> to me it looks like an ugly mess and i label it as "it works".tldr dont ask me :)
17:37 < bridge> <Solly> you should be able to easily convert rust -> cpp pretty easily (minus crates)
17:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> But if we have to start modifying Godot ourselves and maintaining our own fork or at least low level add-ons then I doubt the effort is worth it
17:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> True! Simply rewrite in *not* Rust!
17:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> an effort to make a bigger game, than what we have? From not getting limits on an old ass engine?
17:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You guys just cannot take a risk don't you?
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @cellegenrih just do your teegalaxy. if it's done i bet many ppl will like it
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> because of the more advanced features godot can do
17:40 < bridge> <Solly> the limits that there are is more from lazy programming and can be refactored to remove them for less work
17:40 < bridge> <Solly> the risk is 100s of hours of work, and no one wants to do that even if it is worth it
17:40 < bridge> <kebscs> if godot bad why is a rust rewrite a thing?
17:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How much are you thinking of adding? If we keep it a platformer with funny circular player models then I feel the current engine is plenty good
17:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I only hope I can finish the basics, so people have some good ideas on how to improve / build on it
17:40 < bridge> <kebscs> if godot rewrite bad why is a rust rewrite a thing?
17:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> main reason why it takes so long, as is, alongside real life issues
17:41 < bridge> <Cammodude> hey, could any devs please look at and consider adding #  and # 
17:41 < bridge> <Cammodude> would be really helpful to mappers and I don't see why they would break anything
17:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Unless you're seeking modern graphics effects instead of flat 2D
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even for 2d godot is defs better than the ddnet engine
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if your goal is to have more complex effects at least
17:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> How much? I cannot list all in my head, but I think https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1291415577142755399 has your answer (TeeGalaxy post)

17:42 < bridge> <Solly> hows this for effects?
17:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm seeking a better playerbase
17:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> plain and simple
17:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> not in a way of "better", but "more"
17:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> more people = good
17:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Better as in more mature? More dedicated (doubt you'll find that)? More creative?
17:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ok I agree with this but I think it's a marketing thing because the game itself is peak
17:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Better as in more active, less troublesome and more fun to play with them
17:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Ask people how they enjoy the game, and they'll say less positive things, than negative things
17:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I want to flip it around, so we'll have more positive things and near non-existent negative things
17:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if you say a few thousand (from russian and eastern regions) is peak, then I hope you don't find my work to be too much of a hassle when I say, that I target at least 10k
17:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Free game that runs on potato will attract kids, can't avoid that, so the troublesome and socially inactive portion is just a natural consequence
17:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> kids?
17:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> No I mean that the gameplay is already great
17:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Are you guys attracting kids with the game?
17:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well russian kids are a big part of the problem
17:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> arent games made for kids?
17:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Russians. You know I never got a surprise bigger, than having russians and eastern people suddenly know the game
17:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> supposedly, until adults are playing them too
17:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the majority of the veteran part of the community is already in adulthood
17:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> including me, who was around 9-10 years old when I started playing this game
17:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm 23 currently
17:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If this doesn't tell you, that the game is stuck in an endless loop of nostalgia, then idk
17:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Nowadays, people can buy the cheapest, most acceptable computer, for around 200-250€. Not a PC, maybe a laptop or a notebook, but that can also run Godot the same way. Problem with Godot is mostly draw calls, physics engine and cycles in code.
17:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It can reach a maximum of 1000-3000 fps for 2D, which is more than enough. You can build around it, and whenever it drops significantly, that's where you need to optimize
18:02 < bridge> <learath2> Risks are only worth taking if the upsides justify it  This would be investing significant dev effort for almost no gain
18:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well this is what a risk is really. You never know if it turns out to be a net positive or net negative. It's a gamble, willing to take it
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno what the problem is. If your base game has a good concept and ppl like it they will try it out
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't see it as risk
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The risk would be if all developers at once would stop the current version and only do the new version
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> Not what you made, I'm talking about him wanting a godot rewrite
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah, I mean, he isn't really contributing to ddnet. If he makes a really good godot base, that has potential. Why not 😄
18:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's not nostalgia, it just caters to an audience of players with patience who like tons of practice. People's tastes have shifted, but there are still plenty of younger people who this sort of game appeals to.
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He made it sound like there even is a risk
18:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm a bit older than you and I just recently started playing, definitely not nostalgia for me
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> Well if he is just doing it on his own then it really is none of our concern, the only risk is he wastes his time. I'm just saying it's not an investment that's worth it for us
18:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Only risk is the opportunity cost for the developers
18:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> naturally, I don't doubt that it is the case
18:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I asked it to see what you guys think of it, not that I order you all to do that xd
18:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> a conversation is not all about getting you to a different mindset
18:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but rather let me understand how you guys think generally
18:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> u can be my grandpa :poggers2:
18:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddnet code is so bad that there are currently 3 known rewrites going on right now
18:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> XD
18:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> An anecdote: after seeing the game's website and playing for a bit, a younger friend of mine was genuinely surprised that this game still gets updates frequently
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no matter how good or bad a codebase is, it will at least have a rust rewrite
18:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait are there really that many
18:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet-rs is not the only one?
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> And I told you what I personally think, that's all
18:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, a CPP to Rust is probably a lot easier for them, than to GDScript or native langauge compatibility on Godot
18:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Good, nice to see we can talk about this stuff ^^
18:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> DDNet is an old game and it *feels* like an old game. I think that pushes away some people
18:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> it also looks like an old game as well, design haven't changed that much from the vanilla, except from the main menu
18:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That's why I'm saying it's a marketing thing
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Some visual redesign, better support for UI customization on the side, less reliance on the website, and redesign that too
18:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> does not look that hard
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Accounts, accounts would be huge
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> Some parts of the website are really outdated, like https://ddnet.org/client/ doesn't describe any recent features
18:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like, im literally right here spitting out new ideas but no one cares because it breaks backwards compatability
18:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> i care
18:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like. no one uses any old version anymore and we are literally on our knees to maintain a version only 10 people or so use
18:26 < bridge> <kebscs> real
18:27 < bridge> <kebscs> its not 2007 anymore, updating the client takes 3 seconds, i dont get it why old versions are supported
18:29 < bridge> <hectavoxel> because people are stubborn and hate it when something changes
18:29 < bridge> <kebscs> but literally nothing changes, just because it needs to be backwards compatible :kek:
18:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> the ui changes and thats enough for them
18:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> remove uuids from the protocol
18:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> or, OMG THE TEES ARE SITTING
18:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> or, OMG THEY REMOVED ONE BUTTON (that was useless to begin with)
18:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> save bandwidth
18:31 < bridge> <kebscs> if thats real then its probably like 2 people
18:31 < bridge> <kebscs> making the life harder of 10k playing atm
18:31 < bridge> <kebscs> making the life harder for 10k ppl playing atm
18:31 < bridge> <hectavoxel> exactly!
18:35 < bridge> <Solly> in many cases breaking compatability with 0.6 also means breaking compatibility with every other ddnet version which alot of people use
18:35 < bridge> <Solly> eg if you were to increase the switch limit by making it a big number, oh no now you have to be on the latest version for this to work or you get corrupted maps
18:37 < bridge> <kebscs> why do they use old versions
18:38 < bridge> <Solly> dont ask me
18:38 < bridge> <Solly> well do ask me, before i compiled it myself i didnt use steam so i only updated once every so often
18:38 < bridge> <Solly> and i bet there are people who havent updated in ages
18:38 < bridge> <kebscs> who do i ask then
18:38 < bridge> <kebscs> these are imaginary people
18:38 < bridge> <Solly> @everyone what version do you use
18:39 < bridge> <Solly> doesnt ddnet say what version people are on when they join
18:39 < bridge> <kebscs> fng does
18:39 < bridge> <kebscs> everyone was on latest whenever i played
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> 19.0?
18:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The noob experience is also quite ass imo
18:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> technically new features that do not change physics can be brought to the game without compatibility issues
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> and physics do not change that often xd
18:41 < bridge> <Solly> the old clients would have to atleast not freak out when new physics happen
18:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's Tutorial (great btw), Linear, Multeasy, and the list of novice maps does not help noobs pick suitable maps
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet still supports vanilla clients
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> imagine
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> freeze is treated like ninja
18:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Like, recommended novices are so old and crusty
18:42 < bridge> <Solly> ninja has the sword, freeze doesnt
18:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The tutorial also only covers single player mechanics
18:42 < bridge> <kebscs> supports, but its laggy and kinda unplayable
18:42 < bridge> <kebscs> fall into freeze and hook starts glitching etc
18:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes, but why should it still exist today
18:43 < bridge> <robyt3> The Tutorial map is great but it's already too long IMO, we should have multiple smaller Tutorial maps teaching individual concepts
18:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yep yep yep
18:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> A tutorial taking over ten minutes your first go is unusual
18:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk it was kinda fun
18:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> took me like 12 or 15 minutes
18:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It is, but the number of people I see getting stuck on the grenade part :justatest:
18:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> grenade is unintuitive for new players
18:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> and why the tutorial only has grenade
18:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> no laser no shotgun
18:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I only knew how to do it because I've played Quake
18:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Rocket jump even working is a quirk of how games tend to add velocities in a physically inaccurate way
18:49 < bridge> <Solly> if we had ✨ accounts ✨ we could dish out achievements for doing slightly shorter than tutorial but more comprehensive tutorials for each mechanic and that would motivate atleast me (i like achievements)
18:50 < bridge> <Solly> achievements could also be purely client side / steam but ✨ accounts ✨are cool
18:50 < bridge> <kebscs> or just smaller tutorial maps with a popup to continue to next map when you finish
18:51 < bridge> <kebscs> and when you finish all of them it should teach you how to use browser 👍
18:51 < bridge> <kebscs> and when you finish all of them it should teach you how to use server browser 👍
18:52 < bridge> <Solly> when i was novice (still am kek) and i found someone decent to play with it was a real gamble to whether or not they could follow me xd
18:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> there should be a feature to follow someone
18:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Also a way for people to return to the tutorials if they stop playing them halfway through
18:53 < bridge> <Solly> (or autosaves for all solo maps)
18:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> In-client notifications for when a friend joins a server
18:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> osu!lazer has a whole notifications sidebar
18:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Better difficulty ratings would be nice, the discrepancy between new and old maps is huge
18:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Some systematic way of updating them...
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> imagine ddnet!lazer
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> osu!lazer was a rewrite but osu was previously made by only 1 person so it worked
18:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I keep thinking about osu! in general because you can draw so many parallels between it and DDNet
19:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Both are community based games completely funded by donations where you grind skill for hours on end
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> osu is more mainstream and easier to get into tho
19:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah and that's kinda what I would want to happen to DDNet
19:01 < bridge> <hectavoxel> we need better ddnet advertizing
19:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I could see it happening
19:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I've said this like thrice now :P
19:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh
19:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> then i agree
19:10 < bridge> <learath2> I think we should address some more of the issues before we attract many more users
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> We scale well, but it's all extremely manual and when we do scale we end up on servers with no ddos protection. If this game gets too popular too quick we'll have a lot more ddos issues and ddnet is simply unplayable with ddos
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> Ideally steam datagram relay support and a some other relay solution for standalone clients should come before any massive increase in playercount.
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> We only get one chance to make a good impression
19:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah and advertising is secondary to making the game itself feel fresh and fluid
19:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We have modern UX standards to live up to
19:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet logo redesign when
19:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> osu! gets away easy-ish, they just do everything over http and partially IRC
19:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> its too big imo
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> I did do a couple UI reworks on my free time a couple months back, but I always felt like by modernizing I lost that unique teeish feel
19:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Though they certainly pay Cloudflare more than DDNet's entire budget
19:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> are prs on improving the website design welcome?
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> I think some work can be done there to help new players ease into the game. Show them how to use the serverbrowser and vote for maps and stuff
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> Sure, but a nasty surprise awaits you in the website source. It's quite unlike anything a modern web dev is used to
19:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Now this is a statement dripping with a concerning amount of nostalgia
19:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> well its not like it is html 4 with jquery right
19:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> nothing against jquery
19:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> jquery is fine
19:17 < bridge> <learath2> Almost everything on that website is statically generated
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I would prefer a comprehensive customization system with the old design as a preset, since I too am scared of angering the old timers
19:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> does loading the player page takes so long because of querying finished maps?
19:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> does loading the player page take so long because of querying finished maps?
19:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> But I know UI is pain and complex UI is prone to becoming a nightmare
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> Player pages aren't that bad but some map pages just kill everything
19:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We should not write another UI framework, but that's also kinda what we'd want for a nice user customizable system
19:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> osu! players love their waifu skins but I'd like to go further than just retexturing the same layout
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of customization for this. It's a lot of work to make things like this customizable and I don't see much reward in the entire ui being customizable
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> I see HUD customization being very valuable
19:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Some people love it
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> Backgrounds are also nice and very cheap devtime and maintainance wise
19:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> DDNet already suits the kind of obsessive person who spends their entire life in the client
19:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm telling you people would love their waifu skins :p
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> We should also look into making a UI tutorial of some sort and make the tutorial map integrate with the client somehow
19:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> On the topic of scalability, I was terrified when I learned that the game loads hundreds of skins into VRAM on load
19:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And submission through Discord feels anything but elegant
19:27 < bridge> <learath2> You need to be careful with this. Not loading them at start is a good idea but you need to load them on a different thread at runtime so as not to cause lag
19:27 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, we should have a UI that guides the user through multiple different Tutorial maps and shows the completion state; or just a UI for all DDNet maps in general
19:28 < bridge> <learath2> I really really want to implement a map vote thing with proper filtering and map thumbnails
19:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah you absolutely want to pre-allocate the vram for min(number of installed skins, max players on server) skins
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> I've however been debating whether I want to make server-pushed-ui first and build it on top of that
19:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Thumbnails :poggers2:
19:31 < bridge> <robyt3> It's on my list to dynamically unload downloaded skins again so the memory usage doesn't keep increasing without bound
19:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I at least appreciate that the discord is being archived
19:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think discord as documentation/forums is an awful idea
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> It is but the forum is a dead concept to youngsters. They don't like to register for different things
19:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I hate that I have to use discord in general. Feels almost like Facebook back in the day when you couldn't do things without an account because everything was there
19:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Luckily I am young enough to never have needed an account with them
19:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well if we happened to have DDNet accounts... :greenthing:
19:37 < bridge> <hectavoxel> lets have ddnet forums but put subway surfers on the side
19:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> holy damn
19:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1325533776025227284/image.png?ex=677c2307&is=677ad187&hm=1f0e965cbbd0065edba13a6e82726108962e8d1e106f2062a3497a5a31aee8eb&
19:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> over 50 folders
19:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I had a wacky idea a while back... Different hit sounds for how you hit your hammer
19:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Like make it sound different if the other tee was not colliding with you
19:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Unfair advantage go brrr
19:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Mainly for teaching your brain how to play, not for execution
19:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> @learath2 where can i find the source of the player page?
19:41 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you mean like a distance thing? its different for if a tee is closer to you or not?
19:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah, and a distinct difference between in your hitbox and outside, so you can easily notice even grazing hits
19:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> f3 menu like in minecraft
19:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> :f3:
19:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ctrl+D or do you also have to press Shift?
19:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> its bad
19:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> does not show anything useful
19:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> position and velocity hud can be part of it
19:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> For coordinates and velocity and fps and angle you already have dedicated displays
19:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> well yeah
19:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> it can be a single bind
19:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You can bind them to a key if you find them distracting
19:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> which toggles all of that
19:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Writing binds is piss easy but intimidating to people who don't use text based interfaces in general
19:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And managing complex ones requires file management skills and terrifyingly enough those are no longer common
19:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> a scripting api would have fixed that but
19:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> hax
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, it's probably in ddnet-scripts rather than ddnet-web
19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> such a mess xD
19:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Sadly a menu good enough to produce most common advanced binds would be so complex that nobody would learn that either
19:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Maybe a feature for displaying custom icons could be cute for replacing `echo Deepfly ON` and the like
19:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but ugh bloat
19:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> i had the same idea
19:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> but its not bloat
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> Any changes I make to it takes many minutes of investigation
19:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> u can take down whole ddnet if u dont put a semicolon lmao
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah the lack of this sort of thing is what makes the game feel old
19:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> solution: rewrite it in rust
19:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> no wonder player page takes so long to load
19:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> its written in python
19:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's endearing and pleasant for the technical crowd but weird for everyone else
19:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> python 2
19:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> xD
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> It has nothing to do with that. It's that queries have become very slow
19:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's fiiiine
19:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> alright alright
19:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah the DB scares me a bit
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> There are millions of ranks and the db structure is absolutely godawful for the queries we are doing
19:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> why not use a template engine?
19:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1325538089157787884/image.png?ex=677c270b&is=677ad58b&hm=96b640be35435de9263484c98c677f3416b2e09cea80ff7ec110754d7f60e593&
19:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I've never had to scale up you know :)
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> I wish we had a db wizard around that can help us a little
19:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> we all want a db wizard
19:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> dbs are hard
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> Probably just how deen felt like doing it. I would probably do it in go with go templates if it was me doing it now
19:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Time to download the entire db and use it as learning material hehe
19:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> so it it is going to stay like that forever?
19:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> so it is going to stay like that forever?
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> An optimization we pinpointed was to start keeping another table with only top ranks that is kept up to date with triggers. That should improve query times immensely. I just didn't have time to do it yet
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> Not really. But you'd need to put significant effort to re do all of it
19:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddnet ai :(
19:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah i know
19:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Nah I'm a natural intelligence
19:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> and perhaps use redis for that db
19:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> nvm
19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> now u will have to manage 2 dbs
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> No need for any other db imo
19:58 < bridge> <headshotnoby> based
19:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ok unironically if someone were to train an ai off of ddnet skins id be fine with it. not like im getting anything from my skins anyways
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> I also wanted to move to postgres sometime. I'm more familiar with postgres
19:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I meant to get a big blob of representative data that I can use for testing to see if I break things with changes
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> We have terabytes of teehistorian runs that might lead to veeery interesting ai projects in the future
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> It's raw input from real humans
20:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ooh, anti-cheat material
20:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Don't release it to the bad guys
20:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> the only problem is money
20:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> where will u train the ai
20:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is not NLP or even image generation, it's probably way easier to get useful output with a reasonable amount of training
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> Money is something we can figure out np. I have a good friend with like a dozen 4090s I can probably even use for free
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> I've just never been much of an AI guy, so never really had any projects
20:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The data is probably most comparable to audio? considering all the mouse aim with a very human frequency range
20:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think it's really fun as long as you don't start going for massive scale before elegant solutions
20:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ~~monetize ddnet~~
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> My next ddnet project is fourier analysis of teehistorian data to see if I can get some antibot features out of that
20:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Now this is the right kind of thinking :brownbear:
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> I have a feeling the input data from a bot looks pretty different to humans in frequency domain
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> I might first write a client that displays live windowed fft of different values, to see if my hypothesis is right before writing code to parse the teehistorian files
20:24 < bridge> <Solly> forum crawling is a thing ive done but rarely. its not any more fun than searching thru discord. often theres an attempt to organize information is an almost wikilike fassion (sprawling faqs) but i dont think its a thing which should be brought back
21:11 < bridge> <kickerx> Is there toggle on off for new "zoom copy" when you are spectating someone? its quite annoying to change zoom all the time i start to spec someone and i cant find the cmd
21:11 < bridge> <kickerx> Is there toggle on/off for new "zoom copy" when you are spectating someone? its quite annoying to change zoom all the time i start to spec someone and i cant find the cmd
21:11 < bridge> <kickerx> Is there toggle on/off for new "zoom copy" when you are spectating someone? its quite annoying to change zoom all the time i start to spec someone and i cant find the cmd. DDNet 18.9
21:12 < bridge> <kebscs> @tsfreddie
21:14 < bridge> <chairn> is that compliant with RGPD ?
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think it contains any PII
21:46 < bridge> <chairn> but you did not get consent from users
21:49 < bridge> <learath2> Do you even need consent to collect non-PII?
21:50 < bridge> <learath2> > PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.
21:51 < bridge> <chairn> hmm, definitely not an rgpd expert, i thought consent was always mandatory
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> Whenever personal data is involved, yes
21:52 < bridge> <chairn> weirdly enough, im pretty sure you can recognize people through their keystroke, so that could still be considered personal data
21:53 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly it is all very complicated. We probably would need a lawyer to parse through it and he would probably advise to take the conservative approach and just request consent even if not needed
21:54 < bridge> <learath2> But you can't really connect that to their real person without a database that does contain PII. Hm
21:54 < bridge> <chairn> don't you store the pseudonym and maybe the ip as well ?
21:56 < bridge> <learath2> Pseudonyms yes we store it in records. Ip we store for 48h and delete. Those probably do constitute personal data
21:57 < bridge> <learath2> We probably should have a discussion sometime about going through all the data we have and determining if we need to add a consent prompt somewhere
21:58 < bridge> <learath2> But we don't even have accounts to store that consent anywhere 😄
21:58 < bridge> <totar> On disk is good enough
21:59 < bridge> <learath2> Is it really? What if they sue us after wiping their disk saying they never consented?
21:59 < bridge> <totar> Cookie banners store your consent in a cookie
22:00 < bridge> <learath2> I guess you can show that you can't get past the prompt without consenting?
22:00 < bridge> <learath2> Idk, all very complicated
22:00 < bridge> <totar> Yeah
22:01 < bridge> <learath2> This is very anti small-business/community-project
22:01 < bridge> <learath2> With what money are we supposed to hire a lawyer to help us navigate this? 😄
22:02 < bridge> <chairn> we're not supposed being sued 😄
22:04 < bridge> <learath2> If keystroke data can be considered PII it would be very hard to fulfill data deletion requests
22:09 < bridge> <davide55> A forced consent message before loading the list should do the trick, if you reject the ToS the client will close itself, after your first consent the preference will be saved on disk, the fact that the consent is it mandatory to accept it (code side) is already legally enough to certify that a player accepted the ToS to play

22:10 < bridge> <robyt3> We also need some sort of privacy policy anyway if ever want to release on the Google Play Store
22:10 < bridge> <davide55> It can be done at the same way I guess
22:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i cant wait for half the current fanbase to just quit LOL
23:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Oh no my keystrokes
