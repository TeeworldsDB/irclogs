00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> Doesnt `Floating point exception (core dumped)` only happen on divisions by zero?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The error comes from DDNet server or from your discord music bot?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> from ddnet server
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not aware of us having this failure on official server, what version are you running?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Any way to reproduce the error?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> yep when my musicbot is online and i start my ddnet server and join on it i will come after some time
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> the thing is that my musicbot right now still gives me some errors i need to fix and i dont know if that errors by anyway influence the ddnet servers?
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901594274938884146/IMG_20211024_001255.jpg
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> Sorry i dont know how to take a screenshot and send it over my discord xd
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> but here is the terminal of the ddnet server
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> Sorry i dont know how to take a screenshot in my vserver and send it over my discord xd
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> Sorry i dont know how to take a screenshot in my vserver and send it over my discord on my pc xd
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> run it with gdb to show the stack trace
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't understand what the musicbot has to do with it
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they shouldn't affect each other
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> how do i run it with gdb? xd i installed gdb but now hot so start it trough it
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> gdb --args executablename arg1 arg2 arg3
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then type run
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and when it crashes, type backtrace
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> i dont know, the thing is everything worked and after we got it i setup my bot on the vserver and with that i maybe change something
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Did you build the ddnet server yourself or take the version from ddnet.tw?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and is it the latest version?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> he showed me a gdb log, but there are no debugging symbols
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> are they included in the release version?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> dang
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe it would be nice to compile it with -g1 to be able to recover a stack trace
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe it would be nice to compile it with -g1 to be able to recover a call stack
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> yep i did use the latest version
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> over ddnet.tw
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could check if it's something that's already been fixed by chance by taking https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-15.6-rc2-linux_x86_64.tar.xz
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> must say tho that i am a complete noob with linux and vservers nearly everything did @HappyFray 
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> 
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> thats why i asked should i wait for him till tommorow to fix it or is it something im capable of fixing myself? c:
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Looks a bit difficult
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> well i can try the other version u send me
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> but if its still gets the same problem i just wait for him
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> so the new server works
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, good. maybe we just fixed it and I forgot
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> but i use the default `autoexec_server.cfg`
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> let me try the old on if it still works
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh yeah, it could also be caused by your config
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> ah ok cool so the old config works right now without crashing as for now
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> but with the new version u send me the terminal just leaves blanks?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901608433361494016/unknown.png
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> ah needed to hide ip xd
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901608693597081701/unknown.png
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> there are blanks in the terminal now, if compared to the logs
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some problem with the colored output I guess
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We print colors on terminal now
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How do you run the terminal? Is it inside of screen?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> yup
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can you mark the text on the empty lines?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> oh no my bad
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> i was running it outside of screen
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> with screen its showing fine but witout it i still got blanks
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, can you `echo $TERM`?
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> when running without screen?
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> is that what u wanted?
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901614184041693224/unknown.png

01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can just change the terminal background color
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> yup now i worked
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901615931795591240/unknown.png
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> still running without screen but with the white background as default i just didnt saw anything xd
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is white default on ubuntu?
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> well i played with the text color and found this out
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901617290410344488/unknown.png
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> there are only 2 colors to chose for text
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> and default being marked yellow now (like u can see on the left in my discord bot)
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> 
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> and the other text is just white
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> the default text is marked yellow (like u can see on the left in my discord bot)
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> 
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> and the other text is just white
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> im only able to see the other text with a black background bc the text is white
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> default is black normally
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> as i see it there is just 2 forms of text, default being default black and "other" i would call it
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901618989464170496/unknown.png
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> "other" text is just always white no matte the background
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> "other" text is just always white no matter the background
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> default text is color in the screenshots to visualize
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say aslong as you stay greyscale it should work
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's fair enough then
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> i still have a problem xd
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> when im in the screen of the Server over putty everything works
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> in ubuntu i cant scroll up and down in the `screen`
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/901627347239862332/unknown.png
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> in putty i can scroll without a problem tho

02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> **So for everyone that wonders i got it fixed** programms run with `screen` in ubuntu are not scrollable and u need to turn on **copy mode** with `strg a [` to scroll and to leave `esc`

10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i recommend that instead of using screen you setup a service
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/ddnet-server.service?h=ddnet
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an example service
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just change the paths
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez with flexbox

11:29 < _23> @heinrich5991 Hey there! I got interested in tee's hitbox. Do you know sizes and position of borders of hitbox?
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> yo _23 check out this https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/World

13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Any idea how it can not know the type CSaveTee even tho i include save.h which defines it?
13:29  * _23 slaps heinrich5991 around a bit with a large fishbot
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ok I brutforced the buggo away. Seems like save.h needs a CCharatcer and when included from gamecontext.h there is none yet or something like that i dunno. Removing the save.h include from gamecontext.h did the trick. I wish this was a bit more obvious to debug.
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> why workingdirectory?

19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I successfully merged my really messy ddnet server fork from 9.0.2 to current master. It was 1.4k commits strong with his own git repo. Took around 7 full days to slap ddnet history under it and merge up \:D i lost some features a long the way but it builds and it runs!
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Btw 9.0.2 was released Aug 2015
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> congrats
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gratz
