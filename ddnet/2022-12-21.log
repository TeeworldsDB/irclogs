00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> google keeps giving me german results when I tunnel through germany even though I set my results to be english, how do they even keep making this product more shit over time?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's so easy, just stop messing around with it, this used to work perfectly fine, I used to get english results when I picked english
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to find the answer to anything now? Can't even use my untunneled connection because that one gets me italian results
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1054896888014446713/image.png
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also, how do these multi billion dollar giants keep producing shitware? SMB binds only to one network interface, with no way to change it except to change the default interface for your entire computer
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It still should register something then right? And for me the Apache proxy worked wonderfully. I could see a server pop up in the master and in the ddnet server log I got the proper responses from the master.
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@deen)
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> On the ddnet Persian master I miss responses in the log and nothing gets registered

01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> was the server on localhost?
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Nope
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah wait
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hmm
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Shit
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh wow my test was trash haha
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Good catch Heinrich
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Guess next up is run the tw Server on another vps to better reproduce
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Just run a master server on every vps. EzBut the client only asks one master and expects it to have all entries right?
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Then just bundle the server.jsons into one. Or edit the client to merge multiple masters.Both weird hacks. But both should work for the Persian empire.
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It would just defeat the purpose of a master server haha
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Heinrich why is localhost so easy and non localhost such a bitch?
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you proxy the stuff with apache
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (which you should)
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then the masterserver needs some way to get the original IP address
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the request will come from apache (127.0.0.1)
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Doesn’t Apache set a header by default?
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which header is that?
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> X- whatever
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Forwarded For
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Or something
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I used it before in nodejs behind Apache
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this looks like a bad header
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has security advice right in the mdn
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oof
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes about non existent proxy’s
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> You said one should use a proxy for the master
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the reverse proxy should set a header to the remote IP address
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't found a simple way to do that with apache in 5 min already
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also what on earth kind of deranged engineer made apple's implementation of smb? Who in their right mind would copy a file sync in a ui routine?
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> My Apache does it by default
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> > f any trusted reverse proxies are between the client and server, the final X-Forwarded-For IP addresses (one for each trusted proxy) are trustworthy, as they were added by trusted proxies. (That's true as long as the server is only accessible through those proxies and not also directly).
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I don’t see the problem
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [Edit](https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1054929198730465320): If any trusted reverse proxies are between the client and server, the final X-Forwarded-For IP addresses (one for each trusted proxy) are trustworthy, as they were added by trusted proxies.

02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If the ip is 127.0.0.1 assume trusted proxy and fallback to the header. Sounds sane to me.
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/46659932
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do something like this:
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> RequestHeader set TRUEIP "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then start the masterserver with `--connecting-ip-header TRUEIP`
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: can you try that? 🙂
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Bruv I’m on ma phony
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> My header is set anyways
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what header?
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I don’t know what you mean
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> x-forwarded-for?
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html#x-headers
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I use this proxy pass
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to implement that, seems like a security vulnerability waiting to happen
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the masterserver currently only supports getting the IP address via a header, not from a comma-separated list
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the masterserver currently only supports getting the IP address via a header, not from a comma-separated list in a header
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes but is it a security vuln if you only look at the http header if the tcp header is 127.0.0.1 ?
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im sure it can be but then the admin messed up anyways
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Always take the first entry and you good
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, because apache will merge the existing X-Forwarded-For header into the one forwarded
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to get into parsing this obviously badly thought out header
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea ignore those
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It will prefix the ip from the tcp header
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when the secure alternative is so easy
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `RequestHeader set TRUEIP "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"`
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Okay now I get you
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `--connecting-ip-header TRUEIP`
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> This modifys the tcp header?
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. this throws away any TRUEIP header the client sends
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and sets the TRUEIP http header to the connecting client IP address
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I got it
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the advantage is that this either doesn't work (because the admin hasn't configured it) or works securely
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Is that your intended way of doing it since you have a cli flag for that in the master?
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if I started parsing the x-forwarded-for header, I'm sure some admin will manage to mess it up so it's insecure
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If yes that’s the 2nd sentence your readme could enjoy \:p
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also might be the fix for our Persian friend \:)
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> plus the hints for logging
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, sounds like it
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes true
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> add the following to the apache proxy config:
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> RequestHeader set TRUEIP "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then start the masterserver with `--connecting-ip-header TRUEIP`
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (pinging @OR-MAhdiyar
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (pinging @OR-MAhdiyar)

12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Its not in settings
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Its pop-up when you start the game
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Afaik:justatest:
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> there i only get the 2 options, play and cancel button
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> This is most likely still a beta feature
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I had a choice first few starts of the game, then its just opened it how it wants to
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good news is that the latest amd driver works again, so the bug is fixed
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so soon the option will be gone anyway
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @murpi if u want u can already drop it now tbh
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it didnt help for many ppl anyway, and all new players hopefully dont have this driver or use the latest one
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> That's great news :brownbear:
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> ah yeah i upgraded to steam beta too, got it now ^^
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: does https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6173 look good to you?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> does DDNet now have a required dependency on discord-game-sdk?!
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/327f7de09bd59057b31e185c6645bb87f1a62999/CMakeLists.txt#L126-L127
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> ah good. kinda unfortunate, that the AUR `ddnet` package has that on :/
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think u can disable game support in discord per app
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and if u dont run discord it shouldnt do anything anyway i guess
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> thats not the point, the point is that i dont even trust that proprietary lib as far as i can throw it.
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, but then arch is maybe not the right distribution, they allow some non free packages
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i guess u can overload the AUR flags?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> shouldnt be too hard
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> its not that bad that they allow them, but i prefer not using them.
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> yea i guess ill have to redo the PKGBUILD
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe we can try out
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/discord-sdk
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ^^
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> oh that sounds nice!
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> ive seen that theres a cargo config in DDNet now, but how much of it has been RIIR'd?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for the first release we just wanted to make sure to not drop any users by using rust
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> why would anyone bother?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so there is not really any code inside the client yet except rust_version 😄
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to drop users?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean there are some exotic archicetures out there XD
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and even tho not the case, some libs also only support newer windows
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and even tho not the case here, some libs also only support newer windows
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> so theres arches that DDNet supports but rust doesnt?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess so
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> thats gotta be insanely exotic tho 😛
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> however, since our main audience is windows. we also have to make sure to not drop win7 for example
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am already happy we dont support win xp anymore lmao
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> lol
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> why is win7 endangered tho?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well win7 support ended
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at some point libs will use win8+ API
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> there's been winapi changes? i thought that stuff didnt change in at least 10 years lol
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont really change it in a sense of dropping smth
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they simply add new calls
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> just suggesting
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i always searching for unfinish map and find this maps i don't like ( so if i can put sign on them will be nice)
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> +
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> put in filter servers to i can for example hide insane or show only novice 😛

14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> nah i will put in Github

14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> @Jupeyy_Keks  i was thinking about the render multiple demos thing… how would you want to see it done: a) ingame menu with rendering minimized and maybe even progress bar in the demo list b) startup parameter like `ddnet —renderdemo demo.demo` or c) extract the whole render code and have a pure command line tool. Nice about c) would be, you could put it on a server and render without gui. What‘s most realistic too?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with vulkan you can™️ render without any surface attached. but i dunno if u can do it xD
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a) shouldnt be too hard if i understand correctly. simply add smth like a demo queue to render
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> b) is basically the easiest i'd say
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for a) if u want it to work minimized u need to create a background framebuffer, since minimizing changes the surfaces -> changes framebuffer (and u need to add it for both opengl and vk, and for OpenGL i think it is only core since 3.0)

16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TheNoobestNoob> i am looking for a way to install bam 0.4 next to version 0.5 to build old projects, is that possible on wsl?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u could simply name it bam_04
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TheNoobestNoob> what's the name of the package for 0.4?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah u mean from a repo
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TheNoobestNoob> oh yeah
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess u need to compile yourself
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/bam/bam_0.4.0-5_amd64.deb
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> unpack this
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rename the bam binary, then put it into /usr/bin with sudo
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the package does not do lot more
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in worst case u might need https://packages.debian.org/stretch/liblua5.1-0 too
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno how exactly its linked
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> easier is probs to compile urself ^^
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> This is fine for me, but when I put it on another VPS, it has a problem
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are you a true arch user?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should know how to use a PKGBUILD without a aur helper
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> download the PKGBUILD
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modify it to ur liking
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> donne
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the way linux is done
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> i know 😛 i even have my own server that builds PKGBUILDs automatically for me 😛
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LordMZTE> i just havent bothered yet.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would edit the PKGBUILD but i am no longer a arch user
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i upgraded to gentoo
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i maintain the ebuild
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Ryozuki planning on keeping as co-maintainer?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly sry
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mainly cuz i wiped my arch xD
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Let me know if you have any other suggestion, preferably that involves still having the feature enabled.
