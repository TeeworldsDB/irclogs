08:45 < bridge> <TsFredium> another one again
08:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> pro crasher
08:53 < bridge> <TsFredium> i think it's the same guy as before. i forgot the previous guy's name
08:54 < bridge> <TsFredium> they said it crashes on certain maps (even if no one is in the server)
09:00 < bridge> <TsFredium> weird that it would have anything to do with maps tho
09:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> GRRRR

09:11 < bridge> <TsFredium> @robyt3 ^ some more dumps
09:13 < bridge> <TsFredium> not the same guy btw.
09:13 < bridge> <TsFredium> I'm just bad at memorizing people
09:18 < bridge> <TsFredium> the guy says it crashes as soon as they load `Tutorial` `double up` or `[SI] LAVITA`
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's already fixed in master, pinged deen about it again
09:24 < bridge> <TsFredium> :greenthing: oh cool
09:24 < bridge> <TsFredium> didn't know
09:25 < bridge> <TsFredium> i
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you
09:25 < bridge> <TsFredium> i'll tell them to use test branch then
11:27 < bridge> <patiga> I did a thing :)
11:27 < bridge> <patiga> http://twmap.patiga.eu/
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> modify and download button doesnt seem to do anything
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> or it takes a long time
11:33 < bridge> <patiga> it should trigger a download after a short moment
11:33 < bridge> <patiga> could you verify that the download did not happen?
11:34 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> it didnt
11:34 < bridge> <patiga> works for me on firefox and chrome
11:34 < bridge> <patiga> you did load a map?
11:34 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ctf5
11:34 < bridge> <patiga> could you send it?
11:35 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373232381812539463/ctf5.map?ex=6829a9d1&is=68285851&hm=b634edbb45875e1e9282fc0a977cfe55858b0692b0aa9159b30365b2d9683922&
11:35 < bridge> <patiga> firefox/chrome?
11:35 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh now it worked
11:35 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> after refreshing and putting it in again
11:35 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> firefox
11:35 < bridge> <patiga> ouch, weird
11:35 < bridge> <patiga> nice that it works the second time I guess ðŸ˜…
11:35 < bridge> <patiga> thanks for the report!
11:36 < bridge> <patiga> when it happens again. please check the browser console and send me any errors that popped up, I'm new to the whole webdev thingy
11:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Cool! Can't believe they made Tutorial so hard :santatrollet: Dropping map files doesn't work for me in Firefox and Edge though.
11:37 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373233040821583892/image.png?ex=6829aa6e&is=682858ee&hm=93315cebdad5f4e0815437e1fa9a29f144d39597e9d4758104826d18a498ebbe&
11:44 < bridge> <patiga> ah crap I forgotto implement dropping files again ^^
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> :justatest: real

11:48 < bridge> <robyt3> The map preview also doesn't appear to work for me with either browser
11:50 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't have the "Preview map" checkbox so I guess my browser doesn't support it?
11:50 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't have the "Preview map" checkbox so I guess my browser/system doesn't support it?
12:14 < bridge> <patiga> that was fake news from @cyberfrighter ^^
12:14 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> just an idea
12:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I want to play this now
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cybertrtol
14:27 < bridge> <TsFredium> did we removed the old debug mode?
14:27 < bridge> <TsFredium> the new graph thingy doesn't tell user how to close it.
14:29 < bridge> <TsFredium> oh i'm too tired to clock in i'm not even pressing the right button.
14:30 < bridge> <TsFredium> :GreemDev:
16:20 < bridge> <faffa81> I have a question am I allowed to add the dummy deepfly and dummy tripple fly mode directly to the OnSnapInput function?
16:23 < bridge> <bober_1567> [steamcommunity.com/gift-card/8114736275890](https://surl.li/nojylv) 50$ gift
16:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Why would you be adding any of those to the client code in the first place? They're just binds!
16:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you're talking about adding something so involved that it can't be done through binds then you shouldn't be doing it in the first place
16:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it'll be considered cheating
16:27 < bridge> <faffa81> I don't know but I think cactus client did the same with the deepfly bind
16:28 < bridge> <faffa81> And when binding you have to manually set your shoot bind/fire bind but this just directly does it
16:29 < bridge> <robyt3> I made debug mode and debug graphs independent. I suppose you could add a message for it as well.
17:33 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> make a system that changes the config on/off.cfg directly
17:50 < bridge> <faffa81> Yeah but you did it with gores mode and I find it better directly changing it because then it becomes more reliable and you don't have to get the bind, you don't have to unbind it I would, more appreciate the function change. I tested it out in my own server and it works just like the normal bind but is a bit more synced. And of course I added anti hold fire protection because that would I think be considered cheat. And the only thing I am not sure
17:50 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> tbh i think the gores mode is also considered cheating
17:50 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> tbh i think  gores mode is also considered cheating
17:51 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> any automation is generally afaik considered cheating
17:52 < bridge> <faffa81> Idk
17:52 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> it depends on what mod you stumble upon
17:53 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> but the auto changing dummy thing is 100% not allowed, big unfair advantage i believe
17:53 < bridge> <faffa81> I mean cactus client added deepfly too
17:53 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> how did they do it?
17:54 < bridge> <faffa81> idk but i think they added it with direct instead of config files because if it would be config files you could see them somewhere but my cactus version has no config files for dummy deepfly
17:55 < bridge> <faffa81> but if that isn't allowed i'll just use the deepfly binds so get the bind and then fill it out in a .cfg
17:55 < bridge> <faffa81> Idk if that's not allowed because it only changes the weapon once firing to the mode you have set into the variable
17:56 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> they only made it so when you press the bind it rebinds your mouse1 to +fire;+toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0
17:57 < bridge> <faffa81> oh how do you know?
17:57 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i just checked
17:57 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> gonna reset my system soon anyways
17:57 < bridge> <faffa81> you have cactus client source code???
17:57 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> no
17:57 < bridge> <faffa81> oh
17:57 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i did cc_deepfly or whatever the command was called, checked my mouse1 bind and saw that it changed
17:58 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
17:58 < bridge> <faffa81> oh ok
17:58 < bridge> <faffa81> btw i added translation but the translation isn't that good because of google translate api
17:58 < bridge> <faffa81> but hey atleast some sort of translation in progress
17:59 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i dont think itll get better than this
17:59 < bridge> <faffa81> wait i mean if there is cldummyhammer then that would be considered cheating too
18:00 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> what
18:00 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> thats from ddnet
18:00 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> its normal hammer fly
18:01 < bridge> <faffa81> ik
18:01 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> dummy is already op enough
18:01 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> just make it rebind your mouse1 or whatever
18:02 < bridge> <faffa81> or i just use my tactics and make it quickly switch to the dummy change the weapon then switch back and then you can use
18:02 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
18:02 < bridge> <faffa81> i mean it works with auto join dummy so it must work with that
18:04 < bridge> <faffa81> I don't have any ideas for my client release and i need to wait till i get the green or red light for adding that or changing that
18:04 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> ping an admin :p
18:04 < bridge> <faffa81> i will get banned if i do they don't like me xD
18:04 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> ghost ping them
18:04 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> trust
18:05 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> :bb_proud:
18:05 < bridge> <faffa81> i only know one form of pining from my friends clan and that is spamming and pinging
18:05 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i advise you dont
18:06 < bridge> <faffa81> yeah i wont dw but who to ping because i dont ask questions generally here
18:06 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> uh
18:06 < bridge> <faffa81> they are sleeping
18:07 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i guess you could ask Robyt
18:07 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> they will read this eventually
18:07 < bridge> <faffa81> yeah just like in a few days
18:07 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i bet on 2-4 hours
18:08 < bridge> <faffa81> @ Robyt3 I have a question am I allowed to add the dummy deepfly and dummy tripple fly mode directly to the OnSnapInput function?
18:08 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> enough #developer spamming im out
18:09 < bridge> <faffa81> oh someone is typing
18:12 < bridge> <faffa81> @robyt3 I have a question am I allowed to add the dummy deepfly and dummy tripple fly mode directly to the OnSnapInput function? These features will have these config variables for mode: it will change the dummies weapon to one of the mode. So the mode feature is only for the deepfly and the tripple fly hammers the player when shooting and aims the hook at the cursor of the player.
18:16 < bridge> <robyt3> No. "It is forbidden to manipulate the game input in any way that the official DDNet client does not support. This includes any method of input manipulation such as using custom clients, 3rd party tools or hardware automation (this is not an exhaustive list)."
18:16 < bridge> <faffa81> But using configs is allowed?
18:17 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, anything that the client supports with configs is allowed
18:17 < bridge> <faffa81> oh ok
18:17 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, anything that the official client supports with configs is allowed
18:19 < bridge> <faffa81> ok so now everything is 10 x more complicated
18:19 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> get used to it
18:19 < bridge> <faffa81> no clue how to get the bind
18:20 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> dont gotta
18:21 < bridge> <murpi> What you're describing is literally the 3fly dummy bind, no?
18:21 < bridge> <murpi> Instead of switching to pistol, stay on hammer and disable +fire, that way you can still have your dummy hit you, but not the other way around
18:23 < bridge> <faffa81> ok
18:26 < bridge> <faffa81> Is it possible to remove the server messages once entering and leaving the solo state because i have a notification Hud system for this. And when trying to put these messages that are sent by the server in if statements it still displays it.
18:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> You can always suppress/handle server information differently, StormA's client did that
18:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but ofc you would have to code it
18:29 < bridge> <faffa81> yeah because i suppressed everywhere in the DDRace.cpp in the other files where the tile changes are handled but it still displays it
18:29 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> DDRace.cpp is for the server
18:29 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> are you making stuff for servers?
18:29 < bridge> <faffa81> oh i might be dumb
18:30 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> you should go to the chat
18:30 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> search for ClShowChatSystem
18:30 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> that should give you a general direction
18:31 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> on how n where
18:31 < bridge> <faffa81> i was too dumb to notice the server/ folder
18:32 < bridge> <faffa81> (ClientId == SERVER_MSG && !g_Config.m_ClShowChatSystem) the only option i see and the other options are in the menus files
18:32 < bridge> <faffa81> and the config variables file
18:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: is doping allowed?
18:34 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> yes
18:35 < bridge> <faffa81> now what i do?
18:35 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> just do if(!str_comp(pLine, "yourtext") && ClientId == SERVER_MSG)
18:35 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> return
18:35 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> or smth
18:36 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> dunno what you wanna do use that big coder brain
18:36 < bridge> <faffa81> oh ok
18:36 < bridge> <faffa81> i dont have big brain, i have small brain because of school and all that
19:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> noo you go to school for big brain!
19:06 < bridge> <faffa81> i break brain
19:07 < bridge> <faffa81> I don't even know how to make a github updater that's why i am bad
19:09 < bridge> <faffa81> can i share picture of my favrouite part of my client?
19:23 < bridge> <Ewan> doping for ddnet ranks LOL
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> @totar is doping allowed in programming competitions?? xd
22:15 < bridge> <eliza_chu> 50$ gift https://e.vg/bvIRSeNlh
22:45 < bridge> <totar> how would I know
22:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> go to school for smaller brain ðŸ‘€
