22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Hey, a friend has a problem that the editor is full bugged.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If he change the colors of a tile, all tiles will deleted and you can't even place the tiles anymore.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Also he can't change the tile layer anymore, for example there is a layer with grass_main and he wants to change it to grass_main_white, thats also not possible.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Any help here?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Ok fixed, he had the old version
