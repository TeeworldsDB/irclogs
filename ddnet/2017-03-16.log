07:40 < Ryozuki> is this intended? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/base/vmath.h#L29
07:40 < Ryozuki> (it returns a vector3_base
07:40 < Ryozuki> and it's a vector2_base operator ovelroad
07:40 < Ryozuki> overload*
07:52 < necropotame> Looks like a copypaste failure
07:52 < Ryozuki> wait
07:52 < Ryozuki> ill make a pr with some fixes

10:35 <@heinrich5991> no such file or directory /path/to/mysql.socket on the forums for a couple of seconds
10:37 <@deen> yeah, just updated servers
10:37 <@deen> so mysql probably got restarted
10:38 <@deen> HaHAxD* is one point below milk!
10:38 <@deen> haha

10:38 <@heinrich5991> ? :)

10:39 <@EastByte> poor milk
10:51 <@heinrich5991> I think that must be my fastest-merged PR :) <1min
10:56 < necropotame> mh, sorry, I've not though about it this way.
10:56 < necropotame> heinrich5991, the Ryozuki version is more precise, no? (just to be sure)
10:57 <@heinrich5991> yes
10:57 <@heinrich5991> but it's also a change
10:57 < necropotame> Yeah, I understand the argument.
10:58 < necropotame> I've not in my mind that making a function more precise can make the game worst, but that's not the problem here. You just want to keep the computation identical (and i understand it)
11:17 < Ryozuki> Mmm i tested it before the pr and the game behaved identically
11:21 <@deen> very difficult to notice these small changes
11:21 <@deen> speedrunners notice them though, especially when using ghost
11:45 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #683: Refcount the IME usage (master...pr_ddnet_input_ime_refcount) https://git.io/vyS9z
12:32 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] necropotame closed pull request #679: Fix #577 (blocked chat input after console) (master...pr-i577-console) https://git.io/vyMAb
14:46 < Learath2> necropotame || heinrich5991: ddracechat.cpp:L1275 why is this now in file scope under generic name?
14:46 <@heinrich5991> because necropotame liked that better
14:46 <@heinrich5991> and I didn't care
14:48 < Learath2> are you in a particularly bad mood?
14:48 <@heinrich5991> no? :)
14:48 <@heinrich5991> did you miss my smiley?
14:48 < Learath2> how is littering around in the file scope okay?
14:49 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't affect other files, it's `static`
14:49 <@heinrich5991> unless I'm remembering something wrong
14:49 < Learath2> but it does affect the entire file
14:50 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:50 < Learath2> if its not going to be used in another function its in the wrong scope
14:50 <@heinrich5991> yea, I guess s_aaMsg is a bit too generic
14:50 < Learath2> even if so i'd name it s_aaTimerMsg
15:18 < necropotame> Well, I agree that it's better in the function. I've just tried to explain why I've made it like that. Since the PR was already accepted, I've not tried to change it
15:41 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: feel free to change it, that's like a two line change
16:49 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: due to the replacement of Retangle with Rectangle, the alignment is off again
16:49 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: (of the function call in maplayers.cpp)
16:52 < necropotame> done :)
16:53 < necropotame> Oh shit, I've failed with my commit messages. I've said you reviewed the issue instead of the PR -_-
17:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 pushed 5 new commits to master: https://git.io/vy9uO
17:01 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 6f58c49 necropotame: Fix #586 (display the killing clipping rectangle)
17:01 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 9bae313 necropotame: Changes after heinrich5991's review of #586 - Code cleanup, Fix typo, Fix bug with Y clipping

19:12 <@deen> I'm pretty happy that there is so much activity on ddnet repo recently, thanks heinrich5991, necropotame, Learath2, EastByte and everyone else contributing!
19:13 < Ryozuki> :o
19:13 < Ryozuki> yeah, it's true there is lot of activity :)
19:16 < necropotame> :)
19:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vy95m
19:17 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 1257648 def: Update credits (I probably missed a few)
19:25 <@deen> Ryozuki: thanks for your contributions as well, and releasing maps
23:26 < Learath2> maybe we should clean up the ddnet/ddnet main repo too many branches
23:26 < Learath2> and also unless we are collaborating on a feature we should probably not even create branches there
23:39 < necropotame> I agree that the number of branches are too much. But I like to work on a separated branch when a "project" need several iterations. Like this we can validate step by step without sending half-done features in the next release
