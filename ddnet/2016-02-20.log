08:10 < ACTom1> Hello
08:11 < ACTom1> I found someone's points in ddnet website is different from in ddnet client at CHN server, how to fix it?
12:23 <@deen> ACTom: name?
12:48 < ACTom> many
12:48 < ACTom> like /\/\, KuNao
12:51 <@deen> that's caused by DB syncing problems, mostly because the connection the the chinese server is so bad from the rest of the world
14:05 < ACTom> hnnn, so sad message.
14:12 < ACTom> It's more bad…when finished a map, time is not shown either.
14:15 <@deen> what?
14:19 <@deen> ACTom: seems like that's only on one server, but no idea why, never seen that before
14:30 < ACTom> yeah, I don't know why, but Chinese network connect to other country is so bad..
14:30 < ACTom> deen: maybe I'll buy a new server and have a try.
14:46 < Gabeee> It's normal if it's bad
14:46 < Gabeee> Ehh..
14:49 < Gabeee> hello ACTom
14:49 < Gabeee> it is normal to have a bad connection from inside China if the server is outside of china
14:49 < Gabeee> (Unless your server is located in singapore or HK for example)
14:50 < ACTom> But, when my server is located in HK, the players in China will play very unhappy..
14:53 < ACTom> deen: can I use a HK server to transfer data from China server to other server?
14:56 <@deen> not really, no
15:00 < ACTom> Now this server has frame skip, I don't know why...
16:16 < ACTom> deen: server cannot use /rank is network problem?
16:16 <@deen> no, that's not a network problem
16:16 <@deen> that uses the local mysql server
16:17 <@deen> hm, it's broken on one server again in CHN, no idea why
16:18 < ACTom> !
16:18 <@deen> there is no error in the log
16:18 <@deen> and this never happened on any other ddnet server to my knowledge
16:18 < ACTom> Now I cannot use /rank and /points
16:19 <@deen> yeah, database connection is broken up and not re-establishing, which it should
16:19 < ACTom> mysql's problem?
16:19 <@deen> no idea, i don't find an error anywhere
16:21 <@deen> you haven't changed anything on the server, have you?
16:22 < ACTom> I didn't change any thing in your directory and mysql, I only restart other teeworlds server, like solofng and teefoot
16:22 < ACTom> even I don't know mysql's password..
16:31 <@deen> my only guess is that no new threads can be started
16:31 <@deen> every other error would throw an error message, that one is not caught
16:34 < ACTom> How to fix it? you can do everything in this server
16:34 <@deen> i'm trying to find out
16:35 <@deen> oh yeah, lots of threads are being spawned
16:35 <@deen> but that means threads can be spawned
16:35 <@deen> and they can't acquire the lock
16:39 < ACTom> ulimit？
16:40 <@deen> nono, that's not the problem
16:41 <@deen> either the MySQL server is blocking or we have a bug that crashes the mysql thread
16:45 < ACTom> I see.
16:55 < ACTom> If need a restart?
16:56 <@deen> what?
16:56 <@deen> restarting that server is the only thing that seems to help, yeah
16:56 <@deen> maybe this PR would help with this problem:  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/378/
16:57 < ACTom> And I have deleted a software that IDC installed to monitor server
17:01 < ACTom> If you think is better, you can restart server now.
17:01 <@deen> nono, i mean restarting the game servers, not the entire server
17:01 <@deen> i did it already and tried something, maybe it helps
17:02 < ACTom> OK~
17:03 < ACTom> I'll go to sleep now, if you need any help with me, you can write email to me
17:03 < ACTom> i@actom.me
17:03 <@deen> good night
17:57 < yulu> hey
22:12 < Maxed_out> hi, can someone give me the contact info for the german ddnet server owner ?
