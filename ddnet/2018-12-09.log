01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is there a tutorial on how to host a ddnet server on a vserver?
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> or any other mod
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @NeXus I'm sure there's one somewhere, it's really not complicated u can get the binary or build the server yourself on ur vps and clone maps from ddnet-maps, after that it's just a matter of setting the configuration u want and writing a service file to start it on boot and such.  What part of the whole process are you not understanding ?
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hm like everything ^^ Which binary files? Cant I just upload the ddnet folder and run the ddnet-server file
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> If your pc and the vps are running the same OS it should work yeah
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Now I run ubuntu 16.4 on my vps, but I installed linux ddnet version
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> No I run ubuntu 16.4 on my vps, but I installed linux ddnet version
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> No I run ubuntu 16.4 on my vps, but I downloaded linux ddnet version
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you downloaded it where, on your vps ?
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> on my desktop, but I wan to upload it to my vps via ssh or ftp, thats correct?
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> on my desktop, but I want to upload it to my vps via ssh or ftp, thats correct?
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I mean yeah you could do that, it's usually way faster to just download it directly from your vps
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ok, and in which directory do I put these files
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> For webhosting its var/www for example
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> or does it not matter
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> it doesn't really matter like put it in your home directory /home/YOURUSERNAME
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ty Ill try
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> what os is your vps running ? do you want to have a server with all maps like on ddnet's servers ?
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ubuntu 16.4, no
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Just want to experiment, but Ill probably do a race server after that
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> alright, yeah so you need to configure like the server config's file for like the basic settings, storage.cfg should be generated if it doesn't exists or something, then you can just run the server from an ssh session like ./DDNet-server
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> be aware that's not a really good way to do it like if you want to have mutiple servers running and so on
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> it also won't start on boot nor restart automatically if it crashes
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> but for testing purpose i guess it's alright
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> for sv_map where does the system get the maps from
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I mean theres no config_directory/maps
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i think without configuring anything it'll take the directory where the executable is/maps or ~/.teeworlds/maps something like that
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah ok
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you also won't get /save and so on
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I know
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Dont need all that for now ^^ Database integration maybe later
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yeah, you'd also need to open ports if you have a firewall that blocks by default
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Cool my server is online, worked like a charm
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ty
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ^^
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> awesome ! that's not really a good way to do that but for testing purpose let's say it's ok. Just ask when you'll need a better way
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> ( as it is you'll need something like tmux or screen to let your server run when you close your ssh session, also if you're not used to linux be aware don't run your server as "root" that's pretty  bad )
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Wait what, the server will close when my ssh connection is gone?
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> How do I make it 24/7
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you can either write a systemd unit file or simply install tmux and use that
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> tmux is like a tool you use to attach and detach consoles, so you can get into a tmux console, launch your server and it'll stay running in the background, you can then reattach the console using "tmux attach" or "tmux a" to get back to the console running your server
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> systemd unit files are just simple files that allows you to use "systemctl start yourunit.service" to start your server, with the possibility to replace start by stop/enable/disable, start and stop are obvious enable/disable are like run at boot
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i don't know which way appeals more to you, either are fine, unit files are more something you'd use in production, tmux is fine for testing and so on

02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You know whats up with this?
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> If you build the server that won't happen ^^
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> it's easy to do like it's a matter of 4 or 5 commands
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I have the source code how to build it
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> probably this cmake
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yeah first you need to have the required libraries installed
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> > sudo apt-get install cmake git libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpnglite-dev libsdl2-dev libwavpack-dev python
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you then get into the source directory
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you create a new directory "build" and get inside it
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you run "cmake .. -DCLIENT=OFF" and then "make" and you'll get the server binary in this build folder
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you need to have "build-essential" installed too i don't know if it is by default
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/521142419119407114/unknown.png
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> how did you get the source ?
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7604
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> oh but that's not ddnet
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> i know
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> i know, i dont want ddnet. But its the same no?
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> with compiling
02:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> no not at all, i mean it totally depends on the program
02:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> not at all? Its both based on teeworlds
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> And cmake worked too, or is it smth ddnet invented
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh ok a friends tells me i have to use bam
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i guess this is more based on teeworlds
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> so you'd need to try the teeworlds way
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything

03:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Do I miss libraries?
03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 
03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/521148597253963786/unknown.png
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yup
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> i think i have everything now but I still get "no such file or directory" errors ;/
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> that means you don't have everything ^^ you need sdl, the header files specifically something like "libsdl-dev" maybe
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/521151197617324047/unknown.png
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> idk what am I missing
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> these two with "no" ?
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i don't know what those are i knew you did not have sdl because the errors where about SDL.h, why are you launching bam like that according to  https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything for 0.6 you could run it with "server_release"
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ok now only http_parse.h fails
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ok now only http_parser.h fails
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> why is this so scuffed omg
03:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> no idea i don't know how bam works
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yea I gave up thats stupid
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> not even the build.py script works lmao
04:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i mean you're not supposed to run build.py at any point of the process
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I think it was made to do a 1 click installation
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> when i look into the code i see that it wants to download bam, vanilla tw, and doing compile stuff
04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but its useless if it doesnt work
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KiliJenkins> is there any way of compiling bam with visual sutdio 2017 ?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> No idea you're supposed to build it using a .bat script
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KiliJenkins> https://i.imgur.com/P9AksGS.png
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KiliJenkins> im not really sure whats failing here
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KiliJenkins> i thought it could be a wrong library linked but .. as i told im not sure
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> curl missing
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KiliJenkins> uff .. i was obviously being blind there, what the *** Thanks ðŸ˜„
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KiliJenkins> it compiled, finally ðŸ˜‚ thank you :))
