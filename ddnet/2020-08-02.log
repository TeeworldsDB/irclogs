10:35 <+ChillerDragon> but how Learath2 o.O if i run make doesnt that only do things that are in the Makefile? And how is this step in the makefile.
10:36 <+ChillerDragon> Well I guess I take a wrong debugging approach anyways its. The thing is when i do "make" i get build error on missing src/game/generated/server_data.cpp protocol is there tho and "make everything" also works
11:03 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: There is a target for *_generated, which is required before all others so when you make, generation happens
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> thanks @deen
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you're welcome
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> On the website do you cache the finished and unfinished maps of a player?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Because it does not update immediatly, just finished maps are still under unfinished
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its updated every 30min
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @NeXus yeah, it's a bit slow to calculate, so only recalculated every 60 min now (hoster complained about our resource usage when we had it at 30 min)
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if we recalculated it on every incoming request it would probably take a few seconds to load the page and would be easy to DoS
