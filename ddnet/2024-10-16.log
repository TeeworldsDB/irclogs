12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> disabling ublock
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend chrome users read this https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> chrome is enablign v3 manifest
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I switch as soon as I see ads
12:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> I recommend not to use chrome anymore
12:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's how google gets you
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I use chromium, and I switch to brave or vivaldi as soon as I see ads xd
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that simple
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Btw for all firefox enjoyers:

13:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they won't support mv2, probably
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well see, brave claims they try to keep the required extensions running
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We'll see, brave claims they try to keep the required extensions running
13:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, various options using external crates
13:33 < bridge> <teero777> does chromium still support ublock?
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
13:34 < bridge> <teero777> was this not just about chrome?
13:34 < bridge> <teero777> seems like i can still install it on chromium
13:34 < bridge> <teero777> seems like i can still install it on chromium. no idea if it works tho
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How should that work in a safe way?
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. https://docs.rs/yoke/0.7.4/yoke/
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that crate is on the more complicated side
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basically, the insight is that this isn't unsafe when the borrowed thing is behind a pointer
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```rs
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> struct A {
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     buf: String,
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     slice: &str,
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> }
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not a problem if the `slice` points into `buf` — moving it around causes no problems because the data `slice` points to is boxed
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But mutability sounds like a problem here
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea. these crates will not allow you to modify `buf` without also setting `slice` to a new value
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah ok, then it makes sense yeah
13:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also found https://docs.rs/ouroboros/0.18.4/ouroboros/ and https://docs.rs/self_cell/1.0.4/self_cell/
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> TIL, neat crate
14:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup 🙂
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/type-inference/
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> new blog post
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 I vaguely remember you asking me to ask you for the source of the finish server?
14:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's not in OCaml, les gooooooooo
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://darcs.net/
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> im getting into ocaml
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ocaml.org/
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use it for advent of code
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is a finish server?
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Something for ddnet?
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> stores (community, player name, map name) tuples so that communities can have the "finished" flag in the server browser
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ocaml partial application seems cool
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```ocaml
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> utop # let sum2 a b = a * b;;
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> val sum2 : int -> int -> int = <fun>
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ─( 14:31:39 )─< command 14 >────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> utop # let sum_with_2 = sum2 2;;
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> val sum_with_2 : int -> int = <fun>
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ─( 14:31:44 )─< command 15 >────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> utop # sum_with_2 4;;
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> - : int = 8
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> (tbh i guess this is my first dive into a functional lang that isnt erlang)
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> erlang synax is so ugly
14:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, looks similar to haskell
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess, havent rly tried haskell yet
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> im more interested in ocaml cuz it has llvm bindings and its used a lot in compile dev
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> im more interested in ocaml cuz it has  officialllvm bindings and its used a lot in compile dev
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> im more interested in ocaml cuz it has  officia lllvm bindings and its used a lot in compile dev
14:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah 🙂
14:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I only know the original rust compiler was written in ocaml
14:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anything else? 🙂

At first I just wanted to make a hashmap which would contain all functions from every library but that doesn't really work :justatest:
14:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you trying to do?
14:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have a vector of what?
14:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs421/case-for-ml.html
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is a article on why ocaml is good for the compiler dev use case
14:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Basically I need a function which would find a C function from all provided shared objects, if that makes sense xd
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know about 7, 11 and 12, but I think haskell ticks the rest of the boxes
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you want to open dynamic linked libraries from a list of file paths and check whether they have a specific symbol? what should the result be? a list of callable functions?
14:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it has to return only 1 function
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is the input and what is the output?
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> input is a list of file paths and a function name?
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> output is that function from one of these libraries?
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat if u want a rust solution u can use this https://crates.io/crates/libloading
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i used this lib its quite good
14:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we haven't even gotten to the problem statement yet ^^ @ryozuki
14:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I use it already :lol:
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> just wanted to mention it xd
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In my opinion, the only language that can rival OCaml is Haskell. But OCaml has better performance and it allows mutability in critical parts of your code where it can benefit the performance.
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 a reddit comment i found
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> seems like haskell and ocaml compete a bit
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @milkeeycat what are the inputs and outputs you want to have?
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there has to be a function `new` function takes an array of paths and returns Self, and I need a method which will find a function from paths provided in `new`
15:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/12e7f66a6594543b23f8d2b683941cb95e694e50/src/passes/macro_expansion.rs#L18-L25 here, it takes a vec of paths
15:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and that's how I look for a function by name
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to return the function, you'll have to also return the library and tie their lifetime together
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe it's easier to call the function instead of returning it?
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hey rust guyz:
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If I call clone on a Vec<u8>. Does rust make any assumption about the capacity of the new vector?
15:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust doesn't give you any guarantees about the capacity
15:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in this case
15:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess it's the minimum necessary, in practice
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So I should better do shrink_to_fit if storage is important?
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah that is kinda the question 😄
15:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you're going to freeze it from now on, maybe it'd be better to get a `Box<[u8]>` instead. that has minimum capacity
15:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you don't need to modify the old or the old one, then it should maybe be in a `Arc<[u8]>` so you don't have to keep two copies of it at all
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think the cloned is shrinked to fit but no guarantee
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nope, I move the vec over an external API. And they defs don't shrink it
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well I'll test it out anyway, but still interest to know
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> testing won't help if it's not guaranteed — a guaranteed version would be `Vec::from(Box::from(slice))`
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean a call to `shrink_to_fit` will most likely fit it or not
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's guaranteed
15:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looking at the source code, the current `Vec::clone` generates the minimum necessary capacity
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja did not help, so it didn't shrink it further at least on my PC D:
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I hate chinese fonts 😬
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d829780c4e4ef11f5e09c1c5ed9684c12aad7236/library/alloc/src/slice.rs#L136
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok thx, I'll continue my journey to lower memory consumption bcs of chinese fonts in different ways then xD
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 are u using tokio and any lock in the finish server?
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> remember that if u hold a lock across .awaits you should use the tokio locks otherwise u should use the std locks
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd recommend not holding locks accrros await
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd recommend not holding locks across await
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Btw rust warns about this anyway
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Even false positive xD
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it?
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yep
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You have to scope all locks with {}.
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else the warning doesn't go away
15:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you shouldn't hold a lock across an await, probably
15:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because `await` sounds like "takes a long time" but locks shouldn't be held for a long time
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=ce0226eb62e68487a8b13786c480599c
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> am i confusing things?=
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> no warnings
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, but just in case tokio provides async locks
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that future is no longer `Send`
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but tokio generally requires futures to be `Send`
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You aren't locking anything btw xd
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> true

21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no idea. first step would be to figure out how one checks the current rust toolchain (using rustup, probably) and how one checks the current C++ toolchain (in cmake, probably)
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you find the answers to this, you can comment them on the isuse
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a couple of problems:
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 1) this has slightly higher probability for 1 than 6
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 2) it can only generate new random numbers every second
21:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> Use \`\`\` code \`\`\`

21:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's what I'm repeating
22:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> but more visually with backtocks instead of 3x `
22:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> backticks
22:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can escape backticks with a backslash
22:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> there is an image that I did not look at, tho, which is also very visual :()
23:49 < bridge> <01000111g> Can someone add an alias for /grenade in /practice mode? /rocket would be good, as most people call it rocket

23:52 < bridge> <learath2> ```
23:55 < bridge> <learath2> or `std::minstd_rand` instead of `std::mt19937` doesn't really matter much honestly which generator you use
