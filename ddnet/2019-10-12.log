11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @disappointMEnt try activating the console and then look at the output
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``cl_show_console`` in your settings
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> OK
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> @ChillerDragon i dont find cl_show_console
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> use a text editor that has a search function and then search for ``cl_show_console`` or just append it at the end
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> i did
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> here
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/632517721262915646/unknown.png
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that looks liek vanilla settings
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do it in ddnet_settings.cfg
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> where do i have to look?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> got it
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ive got the console
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea then look for errors there
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> are errors red?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nope :/
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> so its just [error]
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just read through it it will probably say something liek error or fail idk about the exact strings
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or just paste the full log here
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> only 2000 characters
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ill send it per dm
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> use a paste service
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://pastebin.com/
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for exampel this
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> 
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/632518865234165770/TQjypGZ9.txt
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> [2019-10-12 12:00:35][socket]: Setting TOS on ipv6 failed: 0
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> never seens this
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you have ipv6 only?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> nope
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> the thing is ddnet worked 3-4 days ago
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not an expert at all maybe some1 else here has an idea but i assume since the only error is ipv6 related it has something todo with your connection
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe try connecting to another internet source
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> how would i do that?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no clue abut your setup
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would use my neighbours or parents wifi or my phone hotspot for example
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or go to a public wifi
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> well rip
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe even a vpn might be worth trying
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but dude i have no clue might be most useless advice im just guessing here i do not know more than u
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok thanks anyways c:
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> [2019-10-12 12:15:58][ddnet-info]: download failed @ChillerDragon
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that shouldnt cause a crash as far as i know
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ddnet doesnt crash if i dont click but i got like 1 frame in 3 seconds
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> or so
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ipv6 doesn't really have anything to do with this
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @disappointMEnt if you just let it be, does it launch?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> yes
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> @Learath2
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> but i have 1 frame per 3 seconds
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> show me your settings pls
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> v
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/632560157171122220/settings.cfg
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> should work
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats again ur vanilla settings if you want to debug ur ddet client u have to send ddnet_settings.cfg @disappointMEnt
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> 
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/632561496886607882/settings_ddnet.cfg
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> oops
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually before I start digging into this, can you rename that file to something else and see if the default config helps?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> witch one?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> first or seconds
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> first or second
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the second
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> ok
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> 
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/632567983386001458/settings_ddnet2.cfg
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> like this?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, starting ddnet again should create a new settings_ddnet with the default settings
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet7 got deleted?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> foko deleted it
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I missed that, he gave up?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> its working again tahnk ‚ù§
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <disappointMEnt> its working again thanks ‚ù§
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i guess because i banned him
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wait what why?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he wasnt nice
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hmmmm
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol how ironic
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah forgot we all in kindergarten
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure which one baffles me more, the fact that you banned him or the fact that he just deleted the project because he got banned
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <painn> explain ban @jao
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @painn [4:56 PM] jao: he wasnt nice
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing he was mocking someone or butting heads with @onby üòõ
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or being an ass to that guy a few pages up ^ who just wanted help
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what a pointless argument from both sides
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that guys inability to speak english didn't help either
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <painn> but still for calling someone stupid
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WsY[FU]?> pls ban @onby
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <painn> hows that a banreason
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> this guy was annoying imo, he already was with me
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> im not arguing i was just guessing a possible reason
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyone have the last state of ddnet7 repo for me to clone and recreate?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have a somewhat up to dat eone
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it might be a bit outdated
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet7
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen seems like hmh is somewhat more up to date but it also says behind Jason54 has a few custom fixes: https://github.com/Jason54/ddnet7
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this is probably most up to date public one: https://github.com/H-M-H/ddnet7
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon you have an up-to-date one but it is maybe outdated:tee_thinking: :lol:
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea weird at least my github tells me that all those repos forked from mine? Maybe cuz the original got deleted idk
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so my repo has the most commits besids Jason's repo which has fixes that were never merged into official ddnet/ddnet7
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea nvm hmh is one commit behind me: https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet7/network/members
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ehm maybe fokkonaut has something locally he is in vacation tho
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks @ChillerDragon
