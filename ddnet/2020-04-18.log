10:18 <+ChillerDragon> Learath2 so ddnet servers become bridge servers as well?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I can't get it to compile, so probably not
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> :/
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> rip ddnet7 i guess
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If someone gets the python part working for me, I'll keep going
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if not I don't feel like touching any more python
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just watch netflix for the next couple days
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, this approach will never work because python is being a smartass and caching the modules
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i still see a overall performance decrease by around 11% when using SDL 2.0.8 instead of 2.0.12
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not as much as the older versions
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but still quite a bit
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i still see a overall performance decrease by around 11% when not using SDL 2.0.8 instead of 2.0.12
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you try profiling it again?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe later, else i start to hate that lib xd
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems like we are making everyone frustrated, Learath2 frustrated by Python, Jupstar by SDL
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 tell me how to repro your problem and what you expect to happen and I'll give it a try
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/9ad0b700b31c40b8e3c2ffcf9f803c16e2468d06
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What I'm trying to do is in `datasrc/crosscompile.py`, It's a badly named file ik ðŸ˜›
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to import the 0.7 protocol and the 0.6 protocol and match the messages
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 enjoy: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/new/pr-07-python-fixed
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 enjoy: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/df730295eab3cfd6f01ce85d25b299d915876a6a
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \â—‹/
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks @deen
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you're welcome
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice ðŸ™‚
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> ye big hyper
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen you seem to have less OCD about code style than I have
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you tell me where this is coming from?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (it's still going to be quite ugly, I'm having trouble figuring out how to do `CGameContext::OnMessage`)
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> haha u mean the spaces in the import?
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> deen big messy coder
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not what I'm talking about
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> wat u talkin baut?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he seems to apply a different code style standard to PRs than I do
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> Kinda weird question, but i am missing out something like shop in ddnet, for example, you will get 5 points from novice map and 1 point in shop, and you can buy cool stuff like some particles to your tee or particles to your gun (when u shootin), is it possible to add something like that in ddnet srvs?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> i think that people would be lazy to do that but just askin
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> points are not something u spend
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it just shows how many maps u finished
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not as is but kinda
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> yeah but there could be 2 different points
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> shop points and race points
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> 5 race points=1 shop point (for example)
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> make shop with real $$$ and jao gets rich
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> make shop with real $$$ and admins get rich
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> yeah, no thanks lul
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> ðŸ‡´
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> make teeworlds player special indecation of a player who supports teeworlds ddnet + discord role supporter
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen did you change the players.msgpack format or something?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> $profile doesnt work anymore
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, the last object was removed.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't know $profile uses it, sorry
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where is it now?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/commit/5dd15b75f92e7a71912880be5e2c0769f5918b9a#diff-e9578ca92a23e2c578ca32c1f0d7df32
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See the playersCache here
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in players.py
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can that be public?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you have the script running on another server?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's a bit difficult because of the way the diskcache works, basically it's a huge directory
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can offer to run the script on ddnet.tw or packing it up as a zip every 30 min
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but yes, that data is all public, just an aggregated info calculated from the sql db
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> http://ddnet.tw/players-cache.ziphttp://ddnet.tw/players-cache.zip
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i download the players.msgpack on my server and convert it there
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> http://ddnet.tw/players-cache.zip
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> does that work for you? Are your scripts resource heavy? Why not run them on ddnet.tw?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i load the data in a db and then use that
