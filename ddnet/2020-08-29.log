18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Done, but they will probably keep reappeating

22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> You could use poeditor.com as a plarform to crowd-translate game strings. If you don't have real translators you can use builtit autotranslator too. I am using it to localize my mod-specifics string in the project.

22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> You could use poeditor.com as a platform to crowd-translate game strings. If you don't have real translators you can use builtin auto-translator too. I am using it to localise my mod-specifics string in the project. Also it's the only solution which has a nice free plan.
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> My project page on this platform looks like this: https://poeditor.com/join/project/yDI9rlxyfd
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This is a project-specific invite volunteers use to translate strings to their languages. I export and parse it to appropriate format later.
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tw uses https://www.transifex.com/
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But it is paid and very expensive right?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh looks like yes lmao
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If I recall this correctly one person paid could do any number of projects in his paid account. I think it works like that -- people just split the bill. But I like poeditor better, it's cheaper and freemium enough.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think there are is also a paid addon to make real people translate strings by paying them which is not very expensive too.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I am glad someone rich got you a transifex ðŸ˜„
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I am glad someone rich got you the transifex ðŸ˜„
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I am glad that someone rich got you the transifex ðŸ˜„ I hope his account is still active and you can continue use it.

22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If I recall this correctly one person that paid could do any number of projects in his paid account and to invite infinite amount of ppl there. I think it works like that -- people just split the bill. But I like poeditor better, it's cheaper and freemium enough.

23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pure_luck Tip for future: when you edit message in this channel, it gets re-sent to connected IRC etc. on every edit
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That's lame
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> That's why you can see messages as such in here instead:
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > s\/format/correctness/
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wish we could just disable edits and deletes in this channel
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Harder to use sed syntax on mobile
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen as a free bonus you will get perfectionists muted
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> A lot of people using Discord wishes so, but so far there's no solution to that from the devs
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Like me ðŸ˜”
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> from 3rd party bots neither
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu btw, got the entities pngs ready?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I just got back from work, will work on them in few mins max
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, thanks!
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will try not to send anything to this channel.
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just make errors like 99% in English on the first go
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just correct the mistakes in next message instead, if you really have to
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And have to reread and edit later. Dunno why I don't see it when typing
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It will be just as awful as 5x irc messages
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Just now for discord users too
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I ask you to block me on this channel please
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 5 messages correcting word or two are better than nearly same (whole) message sent 5 times
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will forget this 100%
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And will bother you
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'm quite sure they're used to it already xd
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Haven't seen anyone using sed syntax here
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did, like a couple mins ago ðŸ˜›
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Learath is a Huge oversized troll
23:44 <+Learath2> rude
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ping @everyone
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :troll:
