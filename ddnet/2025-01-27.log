00:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see it doesn’t need cmake and can then be moved anywhere.
00:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
00:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So there isn’t really the smooth solution I was hoping for. That builds it with the server using cmake.

07:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ohhhh this is really annoying
07:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> apperantly std::size() doesn't produce an int but instead a size_t
07:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> and now it wont compile because its rather having to compate an int to a size_t in the for loop, or in the segment right below it if I change `i` to a size_t
07:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> and chatgpt says to use static_cast<int> on the for loop part, which doesn't seem clean at all
07:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> how do i do this properly? for context: what's being compared is a `static const char s_apAutoMapReferenceButtonNames` array

07:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> fuck it im static_casting it and if github yells at me for it im gonna make myself 2 AM burritos
07:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> Why not define I as size_t tho?
07:28 < bridge> <totar> Casting is the correct solution
07:29 < bridge> <totar> or that
07:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> Why not define i as size_t tho?
07:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> because `(i - 1) == s_AutoMapReferenceCurrent` is also present, which, again, would be comparing an int to a size_t if i changed it
07:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> trust me i tried
07:31 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i'll take your word for it
07:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> Idk what's the type of s_... current
07:32 < bridge> <pioooooo> Idk what's the type of s_...current
07:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Cool bug facts! scroll up and re-read my original image
07:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh waitr
07:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> static int
07:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> dude idk why im torturing myself by trying to code this late at night
07:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> Then maybe change that as well but idk these types don't matter I think
07:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea
07:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sorry im
07:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> really out of the loop right now.
07:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think i might just try and rest
07:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> :zzzz:

08:03 < bridge> <zhn> use sizeof()
08:04 < bridge> <.inclosed> Yes, the ports are open, I tried to run a server from another provider with the same PC and everything works, then I talked to my provider, we checked that everything is open and there are no restrictions. I was told that the restrictions can only be on your side, and can you check my IP address?
08:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> isnt that just for vector types?
08:04 < bridge> <.inclosed> 194.28.194.157
08:05 < bridge> <zhn> vector? sizeof is for arrays and type sizes
08:05 < bridge> <zhn> i just see `a` in notation, has to be an array then
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait using chatgpt?
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> static_cast is ok
08:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its cleaner to do the cast inside the body
08:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and have i as size_t
08:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> imho
08:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yo, is this compiler open source?
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill dm u since its work i dont want to share too much xd
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://mort.coffee/home/wayland-input-latency/
08:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i hated doing it and i got a better answer by asking here anyways
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @patiga pls review this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9235
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> eh sizeof is more bug prone
09:12 < bridge> <patiga> thx, how did I miss that one o.o

10:28 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki dont forget this one before u rq :D https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9263
10:29 < ChillerDragon> merging @matodor pr was kinda ballsy i have the feeling we will regret bloating snaps as soon as 128 lands
10:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Aren’t we already at 19.0 ? Xd
10:32 < bridge> <Solly> is there any easy way of getting the next word in a string w/ quotes
10:32 < bridge> <matodor> why? this field does not change, it will not generate snap deltas data
10:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh true
10:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t remember if the max snap sizes are deltas or the unpacked ones
10:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: to me ddnet is 0.6 xD
10:34 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thank you @ryozuki !
10:34 < bridge> <0xdeen> I'm only getting more busy it seems, so I'm very happy with everyone reviewing and merging PRs
10:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol true
10:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I can also press merge button :santatrollet:
10:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Give merge rights and I’ll merge all my prs
10:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Haha catto same thought
10:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich panicing right now
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There is a difference in merging and thinking about the pr, reviewing it and then merging
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So I really dunno what you are celebrating chiller
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i looked at it but i need to test it before i merge smth like that
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks! :D
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u implying smth here <.<
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, that I don't want chiller to merge his chillerbot prs xD
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> himself
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah xD
11:03 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
11:03 < bridge> <Solly> if(!Error)
11:03 < bridge> <Solly> {
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>     *pDst = '\0';
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>     pStr++;
11:03 < bridge> <Solly> 
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>     for(Victim = 0; Victim < MAX_CLIENTS; Victim++)
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>     {
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>         if(Server()->ClientIngame(Victim) && str_comp(pName, Server()->ClientName(Victim)) == 0)
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>         {
11:03 < bridge> <Solly>             break;

11:03 < bridge> <Solly> }
11:03 < bridge> <Solly> ```
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller i merged ur pr about ur skin 0.7 thing
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if u noticed
11:03 < bridge> <Solly> what does this code do, it looks like nothing happens
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> greensward
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> such a chiller pr xD
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol, where is that from
11:04 < bridge> <Solly> gamecontext.cpp whisper
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i sets pDst to  a null char, increments pstr pointer,
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> for all clients if the clientt is ingame and their name is the same as pName stop the loop
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> it sets pDst to  a null char, increments pstr pointer,
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> for all clients if the clientt is ingame and their name is the same as pName stop the loop
11:04 < bridge> <Solly> get the first part
11:04 < bridge> <Solly> why the loop
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah im wondering
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:05 < bridge> <Solly> clientingame and clientname have no sideeffects
11:05 < bridge> <Solly> kinda makes it hard to move it to a function (cu zi wana use it)
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just casually wasting some CPU cycles
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> og
11:05 < bridge> <Solly> surely the compiler cna tell thats silly
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> Victim
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> is defined outside the loop
11:05 < bridge> <Solly> ohh
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its a loop t oget victim
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> victim id
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ryo best reviewer EU
11:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkalaugh:  Ryo purposely going to back to 88 - as all things should be alligned, fix it to be 666 issues ty
11:06 < bridge> <Solly> it happens only if !error and at the end
11:06 < bridge> <Solly> so
11:06 < bridge> <Solly> im gonna move it
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats robyt tbh his reviews are rly nice
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> but thats cuz he has all the codebase in his mind
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> so he knows those smol details
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its our senior dev
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller is the junior dev pushing all the weird features cuz it improves
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
11:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> `hey sorry but my NEW editor released in 2025 ships an AI LSP server, which tells me that THIS function should rather be a for loop :Clueless:
11:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> `hey sorry but my NEW editor released in 2025 ships an AI LSP server, which tells me that THIS function should rather be a for loop `
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc there is a word method in str_
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> it allows u to get n words
11:10 < bridge> <Solly> that doesnt od quotes does it?
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
11:11 < bridge> <Solly> and the bit in server doesnt use anything
11:11 < bridge> <Solly> so im stealing that so 1. segfaults cant be blamed on me for writing string manip in c 2. i dont have to write it 3. it acts the same
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> my little pr casually g etting 43 comments

11:11 < bridge> <Solly> me when
11:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> is that a feature discussion or actual code review tho - remember chillers 0.7 compatibility PR? <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 if u cna change ur changes requested review its fixed https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9567
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 if u can change ur changes requested review its fixed https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9567
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did notice! Thanks a lot
11:31 < bridge> <remakepower> I wondered why #9594 didn't be replied, then I viewed it. And my brain was going to burn
11:31 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9594
11:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am celebrating that stuff gets in I wanted in. And I was confident it’s good. Also I don’t think ryo just clicks merge without looking.
11:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah yes ofc that was troll. You should not merge your own prs. To at least have one other person looking at it. Reflecting as an outsider and have two responsible users.
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> review xd
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> it counts a single review comment as 1 comment
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> most prs were already reviewed by robyt too
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and yeah ofc i reviewed them and considered if they ok, i also closed some prs without merging
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if smth fails, thats why we have rc to test bugs
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i myself play using latest main commit
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> which imho every dev should do
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just gentoo makes it way easier
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> so all devs should migrate to gentoo
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now i feel guilty xed
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now i feel guilty xd
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i switch to gentoo if you precompile me every package
11:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: merge from your second github account

12:07 < bridge> <Solly> where do i put this theres no shared/chat and console does something else
12:21 < bridge> <robyt3> What for/where are you going to use it?
12:22 < bridge> <Solly> parsing the name infront of /whisper in client
12:22 < bridge> <Solly> parsing the name infront of /whisper in client, as well as in server
12:22 < bridge> <Solly> i want it to show up as `<tee picture> <name>: whisper content` when you type `/whisper bun bun hello world`
12:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Does that need console support or can it be implemented locally in chat.cpp?
12:38 < bridge> <Solly> console does names differently and you cant tab them
12:38 < bridge> <Solly> console does names differently and you cant tab names
12:38 < bridge> <Solly> i could just have the code copied in 2 files
12:39 < bridge> <Solly> bruh untabbale name
12:40 < bridge> <Solly> @kekomonter wats ur problem x-x
12:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> What you described looks strange
12:41 < bridge> <Solly> the name parsing of chat is strange
12:41 < bridge> <kekomonter> Parsing is strange, ye
12:41 < bridge> <Solly> you cant just pass back the name as a string since /w bun bun text acts differently if "bun" is a player
12:41 < bridge> <Solly> you cant just pass back the name as a string since /w bun bun text acts differently if "bun" is a player or otherwise if "bun bun" is a player
12:42 < bridge> <Solly> so you need a way of checking if a name is valid
12:42 < bridge> <Solly> and between server and client there isnt
12:42 < bridge> <Solly> and cuz captures cant be passed as fnc ptrs it needs to be templated
12:43 < bridge> <Solly> i dont *have* to use the same code for both srv/client but i dont like duplicating code
12:43 < bridge> <kekomonter> When rich text in ddnet?

12:43 < bridge> <Solly> pr it
12:43 < bridge> <kekomonter> nah
12:43 < bridge> <Solly> then until someone else does, never
12:44 < bridge> <kekomonter> Also gif support :P
12:45 < bridge> <learath2> The biggest problem you'll have with rich text is finding a format that'll make everyone happy
12:46 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'll recode chat xd
12:46 < bridge> <kekomonter> Also UM anticheat in client and AI/math for server-side xdd
12:46 < bridge> <kekomonter> Chromium in client
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> you could strip any styling on server for clients which dont support it
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> Heinrich will want something standard, I think last time this was discussed he did compromise to a derivative of xml. Most other people will want something easier to use that is stateful
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> xml is simple and plp know it
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> although its bulky
12:48 < bridge> <kekomonter> This working like minecraft color codes
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> coul just do like <r> all this text is red <b> now its blue (which if given correct css is valid html, cuz auto closing)
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Xml is also not easy to type and requires someone to code a parser since we wanted a less bulky derivative
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> coul just do like <r> all this text is red <b> now its blue (which if given correct css is corrected parsed html, cuz auto closing)
12:48 < bridge> <kekomonter> You can use short codes like &r, &g, &b, ... and <#FF00AA>
12:49 < bridge> <Solly> &#f0a?
12:49 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, if you do want to give it a go, know that you'll have 1000 comments on your PR about just the format
12:49 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'll never commit to ddnet :P
12:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> steal minecraft rich text xD
12:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> steal minecraft rich text xD
12:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> ah its been suggested already
12:55 < bridge> <learath2> I'd guess heinrich would prefer the newer raw json text minecraft has
12:56 < bridge> <Solly> bulkier than xml
12:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> honestly i think the ability to have bold/italic text is already huge
12:56 < bridge> <Solly> i dont think youll be able to fit rainbow (in rainbow) in the chr limit
12:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> and colors shouldn't be allowed to be sent by normal users
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> Trackmania also has a format I think. Anyway many were suggested. An xml derivative like unity rich text was the compromise we could come down to
12:57 < bridge> <Solly> well you can alraedy send ascii art of .... anything
12:57 < bridge> <Solly> and probably client feature flag aswell
12:58 < bridge> <Solly> md!!!
12:58 < bridge> <Solly> you can do that rn?
12:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> i meant to write "would" instead of "is"
12:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> sorry for disappointing xd
13:00 < bridge> <Solly> aw
13:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> colored text can be hard to read imo
13:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> like with rainbow patterns
13:00 < bridge> <Solly> if you are making ur text colored badly, i doubt its expected to be read
13:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> Your potential of becoming one of the best client side devs is well used somewhere else to be honest. I've seen your stuff and know what you're capable of - but the ddnet client isn't the right place, kinda makes me sad tho, IRC chat when :(
13:00 < bridge> <Solly> if its not already spam
13:01 < bridge> <learath2> It definitely needs to be disallowed to regular players. We experimented with giving color to normal people back in irc times and it was disgusting
13:03 < bridge> <kekomonter> Thx ❤️
13:03 < bridge> <kekomonter>  Thing that limits me from working is age xd
13:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> Age is a mother trucker rarely coming with brakes :feelsbadman:
13:04 < bridge> <kekomonter> Thats why I coding for ddnet
13:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> you can do some coding side hustles
13:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> age won't limit you
13:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> Trust me, it will
13:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
13:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> My dad is a tech nerd being a network technician in software for around 40 years now - he has so many projects he can't finish because of his age restriction, day to day tasks are barely manageable for him and he's "only" 60, my old man can't even stand up properly from sitting to much back then
13:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> You can see how sad he is, coding in Java with my brother and stuff isn't working because now that one thing got superseded by another and it has somewhat different syntax and he has to look at it etc
13:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
13:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> Being up to date is hard the older you get
13:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> But they managed to make a checkers game with fancy visuals, and game to learn European flags to help my brother learn em for school :gigachad:
13:28 < bridge> <zhn> hehe
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Java is a great language, but to complicated for me
13:46 < bridge> <learath2> With all due respect, I'd rather use punchcards than Java
13:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Indeed it is
13:49 < bridge> <avolicious> You have a lot of developers on the market available. Using modern frameworks like Spring Boot isnt that slow tho.
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is that? never heard about it xd
13:55 < bridge> <Solly> {"text":"text", "color":"red"}
13:55 < bridge> <Solly> <https://minecraft.tools/en/json_text.php>
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why even add colored text.. looks horrible
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like we have 1990 xD
13:56 < bridge> <Solly> for *highlighting* :D
13:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> i wanted to specify that young age won't limit you
13:56 < bridge> <Solly> bind a say &rIM REALLY FUICKING PISSED
13:56 < bridge> <Solly> `bind a say &rIM REALLY FUICKING PISSED`
13:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> old age is complicated
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
13:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> it would be useful for the server messages
13:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> links also would be nice
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> but thats another topic
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> clickable links also would be nice
14:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't see clickable links happening. Even if using `shell_execute` with user-defined input was possible without vulnerability, being able to immediately open links from  the client already sounds like a recipe for trouble.
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure but ironically solly put _highlighting_ into recursive. and i think formatting often looks better than coloring xd
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem i meant was also more about coloring individual words.
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> coloring lines can be ok. but when i look at these minecraft servers it often looks so cheap.
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In the end sending server messages is a workaround. if you'd have full access to the client would probably show it in some proper UI
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure but ironically solly put _highlighting_ into italic*. and i think formatting often looks better than coloring xd
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem i meant was also more about coloring individual words.
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> coloring lines can be ok. but when i look at these minecraft servers it often looks so cheap.
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In the end sending server messages is a workaround. if you'd have full access to the client would probably show it in some proper UI
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> once there is formatting in any variety then we can decide what is suitable or should be allowed and by whom
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> as a start i think bold and italic is without question (i hope)
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> i personally dont mind having colored text, if servers want to look "cheap" thats fine by me, alot of text in the chat is hard to read without highlighting at all, idk if bold will help with that
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> as for per word/per line i think that would be hard to implement and inforce (`ah_yes_look_at_my_big_word` (unicode probably has more ways to add spaces))
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> and infclass does something really janky to get ui but it works.. well perfectly (minus entities, but what did you expect), i dont think server msgs are that bad. im not sure what servers would want more complex ui or if id be okay with them having it (minus new gamemodes maybe)
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> ^ that is if you can do it with srv msgs i dont see why you shouldnt if it isnt too bad (eg zcatch round starting, block countdowns to the tournaments)
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> why?
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think colored text in chat from players is useful
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe for server messages
14:41 < bridge> <Solly> mins adertising of certain clients and spam (bad people) i dont see the problem as long as you cant do named links.
14:41 < bridge> <Solly> even if not, it would be nice if it could be in console with alt-click or ctrl-click like vscode
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvm i know why now
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> ```
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> expression must have pointer-to-class type but it has type "__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator<std::vector<CNamePlatePart *, std::allocator<CNamePlatePart *>>::pointer, std::vector<CNamePlatePart *, std::allocator<CNamePlatePart *>>>::pointer" (aka "CNamePlatePart **")C/C++(131)
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> ```
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> average cpp error
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> ```
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> std::vector<CNamePlatePart> m_aParts = {
14:43 < bridge> <Solly>         CNamePlatePartName()
14:43 < bridge> <Solly>     };
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> ```
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> how am i allowed to do this if CNamePlatePart is inherited from the inherited objects have a bigger size?
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> average cpp error
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @sollybunny r u a native speaker?
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> of cpp no
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> of english probably
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> why x-x
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> oh
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> lmao
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> it looks right if you dont read the words imbetween
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I just wondered if you'd call it NamePlate or Nameplate
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> i was ademant that it should be NamePlate
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> but now im not so sure
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> cant just be changing it back and forth everytime i rewrite the damn thing
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> which isnt something i should be doing anyway, cut once, measure twice sorta thing
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i think ddnet often uses it anyway
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but now that i saw it in your code snip, i thought it looks wrong
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> myr hates me because of the nameplate rewrite i did
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> yeah it does to me too
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> but old me was adement
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> im writing it so u can just add parts to the nameplate
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> maybe eventually youll be able to do move them around
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> then everyones happy
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> apart from heinrich cuz too many config variables
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds interesting
14:49 < bridge> <syrinok> Give me my IDs back :feelsbadman:
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> thats what im doing
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> having nameplates be more modular sounds cool too xd
14:50 < bridge> <syrinok> Thanks!
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> it will mean also after all extra client devs kill me for rewriting nameplates again
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> you should be able to just add it to the list and have it work
14:56 < bridge> <syrinok> I got something that I wanted from your update though :greenthing:
14:56 < bridge> <Solly> yay
14:57 < bridge> <Solly> and you can have all the knobs and bolts turned on without
14:57 < bridge> <Solly> not being able to see anything
14:57 < bridge> <Solly> which is why ids was merged down into the same line /: but
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> More than a decade of being here thought me that you will just never make everyone happy
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> The most benignest of changes have haters. Even proper freeze prediction has haters
15:00 < bridge> <Solly> how
15:00 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm not one of the freaks, right Lear? right?
15:01 < bridge> <Solly> freaks?
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> They miss the weird rubberbanding behaviour when you try to move
15:01 < bridge> <Solly> oh that is fun
15:01 < bridge> <Solly> except when its other people
15:01 < bridge> <syrinok> I only argue for what I think is best for the game! I swear!
15:01 < bridge> <Solly> could just like add that back client side only lmao
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> Usually the things you want are reasonable
15:02 < bridge> <syrinok> Name one unreasonable thing :pepesmug:
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Heinrich's distaste for config variables really makes things pretty hard. He does have a point but that stance pretty much guarantees someone will hate any given change
15:04 < bridge> <Solly> ):
15:04 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm a firm believer that hein needs to suck it up and make good choices on that matter
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If features would have tests and be less influencial in existing components, config vars would be less annoying to keep track of
15:05 < bridge> <Solly> but if you can do things w/o config variables i agree, i think its some vein of perfectionism (like me trying to make as close to json in cpp for no reason and complaing when cpp doesnt really like type inferencing nested init lists)

15:08 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> abuser
15:08 < bridge> <syrinok> no proof
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure there is one. You are a teeworlds player. One of the old guard even. You have to have had atleast one eccentric opinion
15:09 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya gotta name one, old man
15:09 < bridge> <syrinok> Until then, I'm HIM
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did you just call lea an old man
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He is in his golden ages
15:09 < bridge> <syrinok> I said it completely ironically, I'm older than that nerd
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ofc you are
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone is
15:10 < bridge> <syrinok> Stop bullying me
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> discord is 13+
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he made his acc illegally
15:10 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> skeith is old
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> I'm 80, it is old
15:10 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm only almost 30!
15:10 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> go back to bed grandpa
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't consider this old. It's more like history at this point
15:11 < bridge> <learath2> I was there when they released C
15:12 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya I'm not really old, I do feel old sometimes though, the weedies probably don't help. 🧠 📉
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think you didn't get my point. I'd not call dinos old
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are history
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:12 < bridge> <syrinok> :pepedepressed:
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly we both know i am close to your age
15:13 < bridge> <syrinok> I shall continue to assume you're 40
15:13 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh weedies
15:13 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i thought weenies
15:13 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> wtf
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> im no longer a zoomer
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sry to make you depressed even further, but i am still younger than you
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think most ppl want to be 21
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the perfect age
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> im 24 now and 25 in 4 months
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> < 25, >= 20
15:16 < bridge> <syrinok> I was young on this game once, time flies
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 4 months left until old
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> nooo
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust makes me younger
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> every metal in this world disagrees with you

16:12 < bridge> <Solly> i hate cpp so muich
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> @sollybunny welcome to the club, the rust book is here https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
16:12 < bridge> <Solly> i dont like rust any more
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> 🤡 🔫
16:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> damn... !mute Solly
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> and im dislking cpp for the same reason that i dont like rust
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> type shenangs
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> type shenanigans
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust errors are way better
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> i know the problem
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> but i dont know why its a problem
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> what problem
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> and i know 2 solutions, both of which are dirty and i find unwaranted
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to learn more then
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:13 < bridge> <Solly> /home/solly/Games/ddnet/src/game/client/components/nameplates.cpp:382:10: error: no member named 'Init' in 'std::unique_ptr<CNamePlatePart>'

16:13 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> Init isnt defined in the derived classes
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> CNamePlatePart has no init i guess
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> and it doesnt like that
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> it very much does
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> class CNamePlatePart
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> {
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> protected:
16:14 < bridge> <Solly>     float m_Width = 0.0f;
16:14 < bridge> <Solly>     float m_Height = 0.0f;
16:14 < bridge> <Solly>     float m_Padding = 5.0f;

16:14 < bridge> <Solly> public:
16:14 < bridge> <Solly>     virtual void Init(CGameClient &This) {};
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Having a init function is part of the design flaw
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> i can see it
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> RAII ftw
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> why virtual
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> i guess i can stick it in the constructor
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 omg why do i even ping u
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u overriding init somewhere in another class?
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
16:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does someone know if heinrich still uses discord?
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he is active in vanilla discord xxd
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> he reads it for sure to spy
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> part -> parttext, particon
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> parttext -> partname
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> some override init some dont
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but he doesnt write
16:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe i should ask him there
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> same applies for reset, same error
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> but not for render which is in every one
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> i can use a raw pointer but it means i have to change evry instance of Part to (*Part) and thats ugly
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm well i forgot the exact semantics of virtual and stuff sooo
16:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got ddnet repo access because i keep requesting labels. I was wondering if i should use my access only for labels or if i can use everything i can now do?
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> the class structure i think is fine
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> its bloody pointers
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> (minus i should turn init -> constructor)
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol you got ddnet repo access?
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time to merge bro
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> read only
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no merges
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> 😢
16:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571> - imagine chiller having merge access
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @sollybunny just to know, did u include <memory>
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i can close issues and reopen closed prs and add reviewers and shits
16:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> shii would turn into ddnet 2.0 in like a week
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> non, should i?
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u try Part.get()->Init()
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> try it
16:17 < bridge> <Solly> surely it would error w/o if needed
16:17 < bridge> <Solly> did nothing
16:17 < bridge> <Solly> ill try but it would seem weird that Render() works
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> is Render virtual?
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice chiller
16:17 < bridge> <Solly> yes
16:17 < bridge> <Solly> same as init
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask for merge rights too
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is cpp specific stuff so im not in a bit RUSTY about it
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gonna be funny days
16:17 < bridge> <Solly> bdum tch
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is cpp specific stuff so im  a bit RUSTY about it
16:18 < bridge> <Solly> `expression must have class type but it has type "std::__shared_ptr<CNamePlatePart, __gnu_cxx::_S_atomic>::element_type *" (aka "CNamePlatePart *")C/C++(153)`
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u try this
16:18 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
16:18 < bridge> <Solly> t this
16:18 < bridge> <Solly> Part rn is an iterator
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> which i thought u derefence like a ptr
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> wot
16:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> `(*Part).Init(This)`
16:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> yeah that should do the same thing
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its a iterator u call begind and end right
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its a iterator u call begin and end right
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> for(auto Part = m_aParts.begin(); Part != m_aParts.end(); ++Part)
16:19 < bridge> <Solly>     Part->get().Init(This);
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> for(auto Part = m_aParts.begin(); Part != m_aParts.end(); ++Part)
16:19 < bridge> <Solly>     Part->get().Init(This);
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> explain me in fortnite terms
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> ive never played fortnite ):
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> what iterator?
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> im confused now
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> good
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> m_aParts is a vector
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> Part is an iterator
16:20 < bridge> <Solly> std::vector<theclass>::iterator
16:20 < bridge> <Solly> `*(std::vector<theclass>::iterator*) = the class`

16:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> hot
16:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh shit my ddnet broke
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> that.. makes sense
16:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> cant run a local server
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> but i hate it so much
16:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333456859218313216/image.png?ex=6798f5f9&is=6797a479&hm=4bedc922774180abbd26b4a908fa3eb2c5780922993b87168c003f15f72440a7&
16:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> epic
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> not even ddnet doesnt get ignored job applications
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> even ddnet doesnt get ignored job applications
16:22 < bridge> <Solly> even ddnet gets ignored job applications
16:22 < bridge> <aegisub> `(*Part)->Init(This)` is more idiomatic imo
16:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> damn what happened to archimede!
16:22 < bridge> <aegisub> but also you could try to rework the loop
16:22 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but you realise i use Part like 100 times
16:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> he became an architect without us noticing
16:22 < bridge> <avolicious> Then I would hard fork for sure
16:22 < bridge> <Solly> its never null so can i just go like ah yes reference
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait they are the same person?
16:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Use a for-each loop to avoid the iterator. Variable should be named `m_vpParts`
16:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> that was a joke :p
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are so many arch*
16:23 < bridge> <aegisub> yeah this
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> need the iterator
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> since i need to loop between the start of a line (of namepalte parts) and wher ei am now
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> before moving onto the next line
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> could make a nested array but that means its harder to toggle on and off a newline (needed for id)
16:24 < bridge> <avolicious> @blaiszephyr Chiller would break backwards comp within a few days after he has merge perms :oele:
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> not here tho ill change it to a :
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whaat
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CHILLERDRAGON, PLEASE GET MERGE PERMISSIONS
16:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> sticky tiles inc!
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zoned tunes
16:26 < bridge> <avolicious> But then I want proper notification if he breaks server-side stuff
16:26 < bridge> <avolicious> because he did in the past
16:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> he'd create 3 more bots you could sub to no worries
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> written in bash
16:28 < bridge> <avolicious> with first-class-citizen support for archlinux
16:29 < bridge> <avolicious> i am still wondering how he managed to get internet access without proper drivers pre-installed
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> second-class degrading if you dont use a cli editor
16:29 < bridge> <avolicious> https://github.com/helix-editor/helix this is actually pretty insane
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> i used helix, i didnt like the way it superseded visual mode, also it's not hackable yet™️
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> but it's pretty good
16:30 < bridge> <aegisub> nvim clears
16:30 < bridge> <avolicious> it works pretty well on macos
16:30 < bridge> <avolicious> so it passed the vibe test for me
16:30 < bridge> <avolicious> and it doesnt drain your battery like vscode 😄
16:31 < bridge> <avolicious> zed is currently my fav. editor
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> was gonna say
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> have you tried the editor written in the nerdy ass programming language yet?!
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> i myself even have a merged PR there :gigachad:
16:31 < bridge> <avolicious> which one 😮
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> zed ofc
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> written in blazingly fast rust!
16:31 < bridge> <avolicious> i am using zed at work 😄
16:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> i love their LSP ecosystem, it just.. works
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333459815451594842/image.png?ex=6798f8ba&is=6797a73a&hm=216269cca778170ff533d8b4cb806806839bee27d49f699e52ac3fc85127d9b0&
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> that my friend.. is a vector not a function
16:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> damn someone sudo rm -rf'd your function :(
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> what function
16:33 < bridge> <avolicious> I like their architectural choice
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> is it complaining i dont have a deconstructor?
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> somehow
16:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> `It is a deleted function`
16:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> are my jokes really that bad...
16:34 < bridge> <avolicious> Ask CodeGeeX to fix
16:34 < bridge> <Solly> it cant even write fibbonacci in python
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> last time i tested it it felt super unfinished
16:34 < bridge> <Solly> ive tried it just spits out the same code as u put in
16:34 < bridge> <Solly> its good for single line autocomplete cuz its free :)
16:34 < bridge> <avolicious> What are you using? please no vim, neovim or anything related to vim
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> What are you using? please no vim, neovim or anything related to vi*
16:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> really? i enjoyed using it, tho it didnt work on NixOS because of binary LSP-Servers, and they dont yet have a proper way of defining your own
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use vscodium
16:35 < bridge> <Solly> super neo vi vim
16:35 < bridge> <Solly> super neo vi vim tm [gone sexual]
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i dislike the performance of it
16:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> i blame your 150K LoC project with rust-analyzer trying his best to understand what the hell you're doing
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i blame rust analyzer too
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i will install and try latest version
16:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> rustrover was scaringly good when i used it, but it's just to heavy for quick tasks
16:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> rustrover is a super heavy IDE similar to Visual Studio tho, so i dont blame them for it
16:37 < bridge> <avolicious> Do I smell a jetbrains ide fan?
16:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> i did start c++ coding in clion ^^
16:38 < bridge> <avolicious> so you are buying an apple-like ide 😄
16:38 < bridge> <avolicious> expensive but can do the same like vscode
16:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> i only paid like 2 months of it! - until i realised free editors are also existent and can do what i tell em to <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
16:38 < bridge> <avolicious> just kidding, jetbrains is pretty solid. Their work is pretty good tho
16:39 < bridge> <avolicious> They have solid products
16:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> agreed
16:39 < bridge> <avolicious> DataGrip is my fav. database explorer
16:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> but tbh i used like every editor there is until i was stuck within neovim/vsc
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah still feels unfinished after 10 seconds of using it
16:41 < bridge> <avolicious> well, editors arent built for your specific use-case only, the are built for general purpose. Best example, see Jupstar... all software feels unfinished after using it... you cant make everyone happy
16:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe that's why there are so many different editors
16:41 < bridge> <avolicious> exactly
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just that vscodium has so many QOL things
16:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> emacs was the most fun i had in an editor in a long time, ngl.
16:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> it was fun going away from hjkl
16:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i need 10 seconds to know zed is inferior then yeah
16:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I looked at their website recently and they felt kinda sus when the main thing that they seemed to advertise was the integration of AI assistance
16:42 < bridge> <avolicious> ah, there he is the AI hater
16:42 < bridge> <avolicious> i wondered why nobody stepped in earlier
16:43 < bridge> <avolicious> you can disable the ai btw
16:43 < bridge> <avolicious> you can disable the ai integration btw
16:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Look, I've been a grumpy old man since I was 10 years of age
16:44 < bridge> <avolicious> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333462527581093979/image.png?ex=6798fb41&is=6797a9c1&hm=ec98c7c9d10f8fcbe3942ba339254532adda0e05176d64a4b780c3e69f236593&
16:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> add another comma for swag
16:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Software that didn't exist before I was born is too new
16:44 < bridge> <aegisub> (based)
16:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> therefore Rust is the devil's work!
16:44 < bridge> <aegisub> real
16:44 < bridge> <avolicious> you cant 😄
16:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> may i ask your year of birth
16:44 < bridge> <aegisub> anything advertising ai as a selling point is a turn-off for me
16:44 < bridge> <avolicious> json auto linter removes it ^^
16:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> because IIRC rust is actually like.. 20 years old
16:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1999
16:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> chapeu young man
16:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wdym I was born last millennium
16:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that makes me a thousand years old
16:46 < bridge> <avolicious> i really enjoy yappers talking bad about ai, because the fear that ai is better at hallucination
16:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Tbh me having merge rights would be boring. I wouldn’t merge much. There isn’t a lot of prs where I can confidently say I fully reviewed them.
16:46 < bridge> <avolicious> i really enjoy yappers talking bad about ai, because they fear that ai is better at hallucination
16:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Honestly I basically haven't used anything AI ever
16:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot when
16:47 < bridge> <avolicious> ai is just a buzzword for the next 3 years, same like the term "cloud"
16:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yes I am all in for dropping 0.6
16:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at least not directly interfacing with it
16:47 < bridge> <avolicious> beforehand it was "serverless"
16:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> you and learath need to merge up for ddnet 0.7 ngl
16:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkalaugh:
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well the performance is defs insane
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i hate typescript
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> slow ass
16:48 < bridge> <avolicious> are you talking about zed?
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> feels quicker
16:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> this is a big big nope
16:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> came down directly from the council of bad ideas
16:48 < bridge> <avolicious> i do sell this stuff to multi billion dollar companies 😄
16:48 < bridge> <avolicious> there is no bad idea if someone pays for it
16:48 < bridge> <aegisub> blockchain
16:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> real :pepeW:
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but zed fells almost like lapce
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without debugger and shit i cannot work
16:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> never seen you use a debugger when we did shii together ngl <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
16:49 < bridge> <avolicious> in rust you dont need debugging 😏
16:49 < bridge> <avolicious> it just works
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont use it _very_ often, but i do use it
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes it's easier to follow the flow
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gotta admit often that's true 😂
16:50 < bridge> <avolicious> if you want to sell stuff to c-level, you better not come up with "self-hosted"
16:50 < bridge> <avolicious> cloud is the deal
16:51 < bridge> <avolicious> data privacy, pff to expensive
16:51 < bridge> <Solly> ah ik why i ddint use a constructor, since i needed cgameclient
16:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm all for not dealing with physical hardware yourself
16:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> as long as this isn't an issue of course
16:52 < bridge> <avolicious> it mostly is
16:52 < bridge> <avolicious> to effectively build software gdpr compliant, you need to rewrite
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> You need to say "enterprise grade, cloud native, web 5.0, serverless, lambda aws"
16:52 < bridge> <avolicious> software built 40 years ago isnt compliant
16:53 < bridge> <avolicious> i've seen this too often. but because the roi (return of investment) is too far, they just keep it until something happens 😄
16:53 < bridge> <learath2> DefAI Web 6.0 cryptocoin ddnet meme launch when?
16:53 < bridge> <avolicious> ask trump
16:53 < bridge> <avolicious> he can help with memecoins
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> i would invest 0.0000000000000000000001 btc
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> I earned 60~€ from the official trump coin. Making big strides in the crypto world
16:54 < bridge> <avolicious> early investor?
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> I'll be able to retire by 60 and become a burden to society
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, got it at 20€ a piece, sold it at 60€ a piece
16:55 < bridge> <avolicious> learath, today is a positive day
16:55 < bridge> <avolicious> jupstar agreed on zed is fast
16:55 < bridge> <avolicious> dont ruin it now
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> Well isn't zed written in Rust?
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's so special about it? xd
16:56 < bridge> <avolicious> yeah, but just because its in rust, doesnt mean its fast xD
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vscode is slow af xD
16:56 < bridge> <learath2> Jupstar is #2 biggest Rust fan
16:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> noone beats ryo in that regard
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just buy new processor
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i saw melons compile times
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even tho we both have 16 cores
16:57 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah ryo is on a league of his own. Jehova's Witnesses can't market their religion as good as ryo markets rust
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> disgusting
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my cpu looks like a clown against it
16:57 < bridge> <learath2> How fast can you compile firefox?
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why should i compile that xD
16:57 < bridge> <learath2> Benchmark
16:57 < bridge> <avolicious> is this the new benchmark?
16:57 < bridge> <avolicious> I thought linux kernel it is
16:58 < bridge> <learath2> Or node.js
16:58 < bridge> <avolicious> or google chrome
16:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> can confirm, jupsti had 3 tingly feelings back to back while watching me compile
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno but ryzen 9950x3d will be around twice as fast, single and multi core
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is some insane shit
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am bit hyped
16:59 < bridge> <learath2> I was about to get an upgrade to my ancient ass 4770k, but the guy who sold me the mobo shipped it without tightening all screws. Heatsink took off a tiny resistor
16:59 < bridge> <learath2> And I couldn't figure out wtf was wrong until after the refund window ended
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> :hide_the_pain_harry:
17:03 < bridge> <louis> glue itback on
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> I would have soldered it back on but sadly it ripped the pad when it got knocked off
17:23 < bridge> <Solly> `m_Visible = *(Member *)(&Data + offsetof(CNamePlateRenderData, Member));`
17:23 < bridge> <Solly> hmmm
17:23 < bridge> <Solly> i doubt that will fly
17:26 < bridge> <Solly> `'CNamePlatePart' is a private member of 'CNamePlatePart'` thats a bold statement
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> im amazed ppl call rust ugly but the mental overhead to parse cpp errors is insane
17:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> their use of underscores rly undermines readability
17:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the std
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> ive seen some wonderfully fucked up rust errors
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> i also have to fight with the borrow checker
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> and the mental overhead of that is much more
17:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> skill issue
17:36 < bridge> <Solly> i dont wana need a phd in the borrow checker
17:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was born in 2000 therefore im special
17:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> any good lsp just tells you "bro you have no access to this shii, it's consumed in `include function here`
17:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> doesnt get much better imo
17:38 < bridge> <Solly> ^ wow
17:39 < bridge> <Ewan> old mf
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not that hard
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> 6 mins iirc
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust errors tell u step by step what happens with code surrounding it in the snippet too
17:40 < bridge> <Solly> `&*&&*&**&*&*&**&*&**&**&**&*&`
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> reborrows ftw
17:41 < bridge> <Solly> it is
17:41 < bridge> <Ewan> even if there is no suggested fix it will still usually tell you the problem
17:41 < bridge> <louis> whats bad about underscores
17:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl who learn C++ literally have to go through the same thing with different rules
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @louis.place did u look at the c++ std implementation? its the reason errors look bad in part too
17:42 < bridge> <Solly> yep but the difference is im managing to get through it
17:42 < bridge> <Solly> ive gotten to the end of the ... messy bit i just gotta write shit ton of boiler plate
17:42 < bridge> <Solly> or well reput all the nameplate stuff into seperate classes
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> c++ moment
17:42 < bridge> <Solly> encapsulation baby
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```cpp

17:44 < bridge> <Solly> thats glibc
17:44 < bridge> <Solly> you could write it much mor readbaly
17:44 < bridge> <Solly> you could write it much more readably
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly remove the nasty __ and it's actually pretty understandable
17:44 < bridge> <louis> ah those underscores
17:44 < bridge> <Solly> that to
17:44 < bridge> <Ewan> those are just reserved
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i swear i have trouble finding the function name sometimes
17:45 < bridge> <Solly> not for local names
17:45 < bridge> <Solly> i guess you might shadow some other definition (or visa versa)
17:45 < bridge> <Solly> no different compilation units
17:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> Can someone spare some time look at this tiny fix?
17:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9582
17:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> :heartw:
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> why _ inside the function tho
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt it local scope already
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> its to not pick up symbols from outside
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> Very annoying
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> suprsigin you didnt get def insta merged
18:03 < bridge> <pioooooo> Def said he's been busy
18:04 < bridge> <pioooooo> :nouis:
18:04 < bridge> <pioooooo> Now we only have ryozuki's merge Monday
18:08 < bridge> <Solly> oh
18:08 < bridge> <Solly> lmao
18:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does anyone have any resources about generating assembly from ssa form ir? xd
18:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> First decide the operations
18:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> Then do some register assignment
18:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the most important question is what the hell to do with phies(phis?)?
18:15 < bridge> <pioooooo> Just add another block ahead of the original ones
18:15 < bridge> <pioooooo> Inside should be all phi assignments
18:15 < bridge> <pioooooo> Ah maybe not extra block
18:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> Or extra block is okay if you do optimization on asm
18:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> Add one block ahead of phis, and for each source add a new block
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> found another assembler amogst our people
18:19 < bridge> <animepdf> Is it possible to use multiple dnsbl services?
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> what was that compiler development reference for amateurs

18:32 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks

18:42 < bridge> <louis> anyone have an idea as to why a ddnet-server process spawned by trashmap is randomly closing a second after it opens?
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> called Graphics()->TextureSet within begin
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> darn
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> ```
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->TrianglesBegin();
18:56 < bridge> <Solly>                 This.Graphics()->TextureClear();
18:56 < bridge> <Solly> ```
18:59 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
18:59 < bridge> <Solly>                 This.Graphics()->QuadsBegin();
18:59 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
18:59 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->DrawCircle(X, Y, 5, 10);
18:59 < bridge> <Solly> // This.Graphics()->TextureClear();
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->QuadsEnd();
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> ```
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> how the fuck does this work
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> but not when i uncomment textureclear
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->QuadsBegin();
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->DrawCircle(X, Y, 5, 10);
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> // This.Graphics()->TextureClear();
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> This.Graphics()->QuadsEnd();
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> ```
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> draw circle also has a assert
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> if i remove the assert it works
19:00 < bridge> <Solly> :)
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> merge week i intend to do it from now on
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> phi doesnt rly translate to assembly its like a SSA graph thing, u just need it to verify all uses are dominated
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> and for register allocation look into register coloring algorithms or smth
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWp_-XCwN1A
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> the link u sent has stuff for this

19:13 < bridge> <0xdeen> @timakro ^
19:13 < bridge> <louis> i've already asked him 😅
19:13 < bridge> <0xdeen> I don't see an error, so no idea
19:13 < bridge> <0xdeen> is there a coredump?
19:18 < bridge> <louis> im not sure if its a trashmap or ddnet issue since i had it running just fine a while ago
19:19 < bridge> <louis> not sure how to get coredump
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it needs to know to dump its core
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like it’s being terminated
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it’s like 200 lines of rust u can look thru
19:19 < bridge> <louis> when i upload another map i get

19:20 < bridge> <louis> which is weird
19:20 < bridge> <timakro> >  Error in handler: deadline has elapsed
19:20 < bridge> <timakro> This means trashmap is reading stdout and waiting for `econ: bound to 127.0.0.1` but doesn't see it in time
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it cant match ``bound to localhost:8303`` ?
19:56 < bridge> <timakro> it doesn't right now, no
19:56 < bridge> <timakro> but port is not printed
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might be the issue then
19:57 < bridge> <timakro> if you've changed the econ binaddr from 127.0.0.1 to localhost that might be the issue
19:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in @louis screenshot it says localhost
19:58 < bridge> <Solly> `TextRender()->SetRenderFlags(ETextRenderFlags::TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_FIRST_CHARACTER_X_BEARING | ETextRenderFlags::TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_LAST_CHARACTER_ADVANCE);` what is this meant to do

19:58 < bridge> <louis> no, i was running the k2dd fork of trashmap, in there it checks for localhost not 127.0.0.1 i believe
19:59 < bridge> <louis> i've tested both versions, i think my vps is just fucked somehow, i'll figure it out
20:00 < bridge> <Solly> `TextRender()->SetRenderFlags(ETextRenderFlags::TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_FIRST_CHARACTER_X_BEARING | ETextRenderFlags::TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_LAST_CHARACTER_ADVANCE);` what is this meant to do (in rendering directions in nameplate, i just left it in last time)
20:00 < bridge> <Solly> 
20:00 < bridge> <Solly> Wait how the frug does `This.Graphics()->TextureSet(g_pData->m_aImages[m_ImageId].m_Id);` not assert fail

20:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Try to take screenshot with and without. Actually seems like those flags are only used for nameplates, so maybe we could get rid of them if they don't have a purpose anymore
20:03 < bridge> <Solly> okey

20:12 < bridge> <Solly> oh wait
20:12 < bridge> <Solly> its not related to directions at all
20:12 < bridge> <Solly> yeah it do nothing x-x
20:12 < bridge> <robyt3> It's only for text rendering
20:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably very small difference so you'd have to send two fullscreen screenshots to compare side-by-side

20:31 < bridge> <Solly> @robyt3
20:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you send them separately?
20:32 < bridge> <robyt3> That way you can compare the position by switching between two tabs
20:32 < bridge> <Solly> uhh ill cut it in h alf
20:32 < bridge> <Solly> my prnt screen tool cant take a screenshot of 1 of my monitors at a time

20:34 < bridge> <Solly> minus the aniamtion and my mouse pos
20:34 < bridge> <Solly> theyre the same image
20:34 < bridge> <Solly> the text doesnt flicker at all
20:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, maybe causes problems with specific names, see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1420
20:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, maybe causes problems only with specific names, see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1420

20:35 < bridge> <Solly> 😭
20:35 < bridge> <Solly> im using container width to center names
20:35 < bridge> <Solly> thats how ure meant to do it right
20:35 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that's the most efficient way
20:36 < bridge> <Solly> accurate?
20:36 < bridge> <Solly> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
20:36 < bridge> <robyt3> It only lays out the text once and gets the size from that, so it shouldn't add any more error like the alternative (TextWidth to get the width, then layout again)
20:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Except due to pixel alignment maybe because text containers are layed out at position (0,0) but then rendered at the correct position
20:38 < bridge> <Solly> does that make any difference
20:38 < bridge> <Solly> sometimes thers flickering with names when moving
20:38 < bridge> <Solly> theres flickering with names when moving
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that's the pixel alignment
20:39 < bridge> <robyt3> don't know if setting the flag for no pixel alignment would make it better or worse
20:39 < bridge> <Solly> would it be worth with antialiasing
20:39 < bridge> <Solly> mmk
20:39 < bridge> <robyt3> we need a different text rendering approach for that
20:39 < bridge> <Solly> it doesnt obther me unless i stare at it
20:39 < bridge> <Solly> why cant u disable pixel alignment always
20:40 < bridge> <Solly> or rather what benefit does it give
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> btw it's called `TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_PIXEL_ALIGMENT` :kek:
20:40 < bridge> <Solly> makes sense
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> except the last word 🙂
20:41 < bridge> <Solly> oh
20:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I wondered why I didn't find it with text search
20:41 < bridge> <Solly> if u dont have antialiasing on then ... what happens
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know, try it out. I suspect it will look off because letters have inconsistent spacing between each other
20:42 < bridge> <Solly> kerning go brr
20:42 < bridge> <Solly> antialising = nearest => 2x2 or more
20:42 < bridge> <Solly> that might flicker /shrug
20:42 < bridge> <Solly> wait why does ur name even change position
20:43 < bridge> <Solly> shouldnt it always be centered
20:43 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but it wants to be aligned with a full pixel I guess
20:43 < bridge> <Solly> but should it not pick the same one every time
20:44 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe for your own nameplate if it had special handling
20:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess it depends on the tee's position a bit
20:44 < bridge> <Solly> camera = tee position
20:44 < bridge> <Solly> floating pt error moving it about 0.5 mayb e
20:44 < bridge> <Solly> no a - a == 0 even in floating point
20:45 < bridge> <Solly> oh but (a - b) - a != -b
20:45 < bridge> <Solly> looks... normal but no flickering
20:46 < bridge> <Solly> no fsaa samples
20:46 < bridge> <Solly> turned on
20:46 < bridge> <Solly> but then why no flickering
20:46 < bridge> <Solly> unless texture lookups are always aliased
20:47 < bridge> <Solly> in which case you get no performance benefit from no pixel alignement or not
20:47 < bridge> <Solly> since you are doing 4 lookups per pixel anyway
20:47 < bridge> <Solly> or not idk how it works
20:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Pixel alignment is most useful on low resolutions as far as I understand it
20:47 < bridge> <Solly> `a*1 + b*0 + c*0d+ d*0`
20:47 < bridge> <Solly> `a*1 + b*0 + c*0d + d*0`
20:48 < bridge> <papotav> guys i finished a map twice cuz the rank didnt save
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> If you disable pixel alignment in general it looks really blurry
20:48 < bridge> <papotav> and again it didnt got saved
20:48 < bridge> <Solly> a full pixel flickering is worse than color flickering
20:48 < bridge> <Solly> and the text is already blurry
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Wait for 24 hours, open admin mail if it's still not added then
20:49 < bridge> <papotav> ok
20:49 < bridge> <papotav> ty
20:49 < bridge> <Solly> it apperas changing the resolution thru ddnet broke my monitor /:

20:52 < bridge> <Solly> no alignment in second one
20:52 < bridge> <Solly> the flickering is very noticeable
20:52 < bridge> <Solly> i say atleast for this keep it on
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
21:35 < bridge> <zhn> yeah it does sometimes xd
21:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> gosh my rustc is annoying - it builds fine, clippy doesnt find anything, it's included properly but yet this error doesnt go away.
21:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
21:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> @avolicious i blame zed editor for that btw

21:52 < bridge> <Solly> /:
21:52 < bridge> <Solly> idk
21:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> :deen_star:
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
21:53 < bridge> <Solly> yay
21:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> i dont get it :c
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i blame proc macros
21:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe that too
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try to restart the editor
21:53 < bridge> <oxyzo.> why dum dum red and bun bun blu
21:53 < bridge> <Solly> fng
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> proc macros is the best and the worst thing ever created
21:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571> - restart didnt help

21:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> what iiiz thiiiiiiiiiiz
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> but i hate writing them from scratch
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> proc macros are all i ever wanted in any lang
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> patch the compiler
21:54 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1333540686376599575/image.png?ex=6799440b&is=6797f28b&hm=c3d10b8f8d616e11e16419abccafde9672340c99447ccb7f85cbf53bc15208e0&
21:54 < bridge> <Solly> wait whats this icon
21:54 < bridge> <Solly> or is that text
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
21:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> the heart? text
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> proc macros are amazing but also ez abuse
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cargo clean
21:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> iirc
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and restart
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway proc macros made serde
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> serde is amazing magic
21:55 < bridge> <Solly> tsumagi is wanting heart icons, do i change it everywhere else?
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> proc macros made hiarc
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> amazing magic
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> github?
21:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> i still couldnt figure out how to integrate into my teeworlds protocol library
21:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> skill issue ikr
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs
21:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> not sure - any profit from that?
21:56 < bridge> <Solly> consistency
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> other than ig having it in .svg and having it look actually good
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> other than ig having it an .svg and having it look actually good
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont really have docs for it, but it allows to use Rc<RefCell<>> without panics
21:56 < bridge> <Solly> text heart is already svg
21:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> no hiarc  crate?=
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> o
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in lib
21:56 < bridge> <Solly> cuz fonts
21:56 < bridge> <Solly> but in game its rendered at low quality
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe some day xd
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> how tf did cargo clean `fix` that just now
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> gosh i cant with these language tweaks
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it simply cleans all build stuff and regenerates it
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u by chance change any proc macro code?
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes it breaks by that
21:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye
21:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah i guess it was that then.. weird
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vscodium has a rebuild proc macros thing
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from rust analyzer
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno if u can call that too
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that fixes it too
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok nvm they removed it
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
21:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> xd
22:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Has anyone successfully built and used the Discord integration with MSYS2 on Windows? It builds and initializes correctly for me but it doesn't show the activity in Discord. Using the Steam version works.
22:35 < bridge> <totar> Sometimes it's discord being weird
22:35 < bridge> <totar> Discord has special detection for steam games in the steam folder
22:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Thanks, looks like it works if I replace the exe in the Steam folder
23:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> seems like rus2 just crashed
23:07 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> like straight up crashed and got forced to another map
23:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> chiller level up
23:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> faith +1
