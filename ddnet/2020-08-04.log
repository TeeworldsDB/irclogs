11:25 <+ChillerDragon> meh finding duplicated mapres is much harder than i thought send ur fav image compare tools kthxbye
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is not easy to do but if you only want to match entire tilesets not tiles, there is a nice tool
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/knjcode/imgdupes
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> thanks a lot @Learath2 <3 that works so much better than all the other tools i tried :)
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can mess around with the hashing tolerance to get it to match more leniently after the first pass
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 seems to work :)
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/11139517273d831bfff9451f2fb17d99a5ff3167
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and you did it mostly on your own, very nice üôÇ
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> üòÑ
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks alot
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Hammerflying with dummy really annoying in latest client, every third hammer feels like Prediction bug and not working
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> use deep hf
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @redix regarding https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/293209e7227c81e92b99c89890ebfdc264374a4a
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> -> how to fix it?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> clients with that applied cant join my server/ddnet7 servers
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @gerdoe i am using deepfly
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you plead with oy
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if that commit goes out on a release the only way to fix it would be to not send extended items to 0.7 clients which would be absolutely detrimental to performance
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I can connect to 0.6 ddnet bridge servers
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just not to 0.7 Servers having the extended msg protocol
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well i can connect, but I dont see anything, just connecting to. But chat is there aswell as "delta unpack failed"
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> In case the type is >= 64 it should use 0 as size instead of failing.
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on a 0.6 ddnet bridge server, don't you get "delta unpack faileds"
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/s"/"s/
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iirc. I could join and play normally, but didnt check console for unpack fails
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's odd, I do send all the extended items to 0.7
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Same should be added for delta creation. Right now the extended packets read a zero from uninitialized memory I think
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do you have an idea why 0.6 to 0.7 bridge works and 0.7 servers dont?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have the feeling my version of the extended protocol is not up-to-date
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Nope, no idea without looking into that. Maybe it's only sending extended packets but no extended snap objects?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ohhh, yes!
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think thats it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That could also be why I couldnt fetch them with F-Client
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I tried to do the extended player the same way as ddnet does, but i couldnt receive any snapshots iirc
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @redix can you talk to Oy about this and tell him your idea with just zeroing the size?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the extended protocol system relies on this
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will try to reach him in #bridge
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I'll create a PR at the end of the week. Limiting the type to 64 isn't a good idea anyway.
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats that btw?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the limit
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Both client and server have a table of snap sizes, so the actual size does not need to be included in the snapshot itself. This table just had a fixed size of 64
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> has*
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Actually this table only contains items that were present in 0.7.0, otherwise old clients would fail to unpack the snapshot.
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> If the size is zero, the actual size of the snap item is included in the snapshot
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I remember this now
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually did remove the extended stuff from being sent to 0.7 clients
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This way my client cant receive your snaps
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember why I disabled them :/
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doesnt this prevent them from being sent?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah no, sorry
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> looks like it'll work. Now we need to wait for redix' pr on vanilla, because now vanilla 0.7 clients cant join anymore when built from master
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Just don't use master :D
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Even if Oy accepts such a PR,  it will probably take some time.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Trafalgar Law can you take a look at ^^
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Someone here uses Ubuntu?
20:40 <+ChillerDragon> i used to @Pepe
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> im looking the place where maps are placed, but i don't know how to find them
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> or what should be the name of it
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> ~/.teeworlds/maps ?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> üòÆ
20:43 <+ChillerDragon> open terminal and type "~/.teeworlds/maps"
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cd ~/.teeworlds/maps`
20:43 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea xd xd
20:43 <+ChillerDragon> cd
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> thanks üòÑ
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> it should have open something, right? in my case, it didnt
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> open a file browser and type `~/.teeworlds/maps`
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> open a file browser. does ctrl-L open a location chooser?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> yes
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> it worked, thx ‚ù§Ô∏è
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome üôÇ
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @Learath2 Don't have time next few days sry :/
