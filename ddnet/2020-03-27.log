01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Interesting, so 0.7 maps crash 0.6 clients and 0.6 maps are rendered incorrectly by 0.7 clients. Does somebody know how to fix the assets? Can you make maps that work in both versions?
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think @deen had a map conversion tool, can't find it
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok found it, it's part of the ddnet distribution. and the maps are indeed compatible with both versions. i guess the only thing this tool does it to embed the 0.6 mapres

04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @timakro as far as I know there is a new map compression method in 0.7 but the old one is still supported. So 0.7 clients can load old 0.6 compression but when saved with 0.7 compression the 0.6 clients can not load it anymore. And standard tiles changed a bit so in most cases they should be embedded. And deens tool does exactly that https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/tools/map_convert_07.cpp
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nori reminded me of why I gave up on the notification thing, I didn't want to pull in glib...
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's very surprising that no one coded a library to handle desktop notifications cross-platform
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you won't believe what happened, I finally finish a feature, backspace gets stuck deletes the entire file before I can save it
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> argh
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ctrl-z?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Anybody knows why a view new netobjs in 0.7 have \_DE_ in their name?

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> solved in the teeworlds discord; it means that they're not sent over the network and only appear in demos
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> these are german netobjects
