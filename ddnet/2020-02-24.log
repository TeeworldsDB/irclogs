11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon the invalid signature means that it isn't a valid map file
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it might got corrupted by something or it's a different file format
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try the `file` tool to tell you what kind of file you're looking at
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> hi guys.
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Why don't you plan to make authentication?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not again
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @3da are you really 3da?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/255191476315750401/681518446449524788
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > @3da are you really 3da?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Learath2 may be
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> depends on what you mean
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Centralized account system for teeworlds could help to make many cool mods
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> So I don't know why it doesn't exist yet
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean as in the 3da that contributed to DDRace
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> back when btk and greyfox was still around
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> yes, I was the first man who made mod called DDRace
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> in 2010-2011 years I send my source codes to another developer
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> do you have the "first" ddrace map saved somewhere
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Welcome back ðŸ˜›
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I was young and stupid when I made first ddrace
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> my code was bad
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did work on a couple prototypes for an account system, never really made one that I was content with
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but i had a lot of enthusiasm
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had one with asymmetric cryptography that I actually liked a lot, but making it user friendly enough was too much of a hassle
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> This morning I wanted to make another mod but I expected that DDNet already has accounts which I could use
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But it is sad to know that there is no accounts
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its sad
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and making a account system is nothing difficult
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u can just do it in ur mod
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> doesnt KoG have a account system?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> It would be cool to have single account system across the servers
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> every tw server?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, an account system is trivial, I also wanted one that we could use across all mods
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have one working with certificates to avoid centralisation but users would need to note down a mnemonic, not sure if that's the best ux
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I think it should work so:
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Player authenticates in his client. Then client send some data to every server.
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> And each server can check if the player is real. But simple servers may accept any usernames.
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that would be insecure
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you could host a server to grab accounts?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> server don't receive passwords
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently, the server sends a challenge, the user signs it with his private key, the server verifies the signature however it likes
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking ddnet could host a verification server other mods are free to either use our verification or implement their own account pool
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> sounds good
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No passwords no usernames, but the user would be responsible for not losing their private keys and if they do there is no good way to recover it
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> why not to use password as private key?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> too short to be secure
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a known plaintext attack would be feasible
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> May be it is possible to bind teeworlds accounts to some social network?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ugh
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That would be a little too centralised for a lot of the developers taste
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but combining what I have with oauth it is quite feasible to link a social account
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wouldn't help recover the private key though
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe ddnet could store peoples private keys in encrypted form, with their password for a recovery measure
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Given it's open source that does sound feasible
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, the current issue isn't that there is no good way, it's that I don't really have the time to code much anymore
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I am interested in authentication for teeworlds
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> probably i can make some code
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Currently I am good in .net core and JS
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I get back to italy I can share the code I have with you
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> You are Italian?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just live in italy for now
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> cool
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I think I can make whole certification center for ddnet except the integration with teeworlds (C++ part)
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we need to design a protocol where servers can safely authenticate
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/681543795200098344/unknown.png
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> What do you think about this simple diagram?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> token should be once-off
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> the protocol to connect Auth server can be HTTPS
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Make all those tokens one use and it should be safe enough
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I don't quite like the username+password setup
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But the users like it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> We want to make games for gamers but not for developers, right?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I already like the fact that you're back,  @3da xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Thanks guys. I don't know who you are but it is fine that we want to make cool teeworlds mods
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> (tbh I just hope for more & better changes to DDNet / TW community in general)
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With certificates you don't need to remember any password, authentication just works
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> the user can remember his password in client
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but what then it a person reinstalls client or even stitches to other OS? Won't that mean their acc is lost?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then we are storing plaintext credentials on the users computer
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> This is common case in real world ðŸ˜„
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just because something is not easy to figure out, doesn't mean we should just skimp out on quality
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway if you want to implement it like this, feel free to go ahead, it should take like 3-4 days at a decent pace, it should be secure enough
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I agreed that this is not 100% safe but it is better than account system which not exist at all
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Btw, how does KoG's acc system work then?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> you have to login only once
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> what is KoG?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and the server seems to remember the user by... no idea what
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and registration goes thru their website
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's probably security by obsecurity, relying solely on the fact that KoG is closed source
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> well, some parts of ddnet could also be tho
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> like the part of authentication server
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> hmm
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess it remembers some combination properties about the client at the point of login
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> why should we make auth server closed source?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Having literally everything accessible by everyone isn't always good idea
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Security through obsecurity is just an illusion, if it isn't secure when open source it isn't secure
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Guys let me tell you a story
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and there are a lot of ways to implement secure authentication with username and password
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just pick any and use it
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> <pointing at onby's bot detections>
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> First time DDRace was closed source
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u like jwt?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> And I made special built-in admin password in compiled EXE
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but this password was written as plain text in constant
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and some users watched this password
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I was so stupid
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki not for what everyone uses it for but it does have good uses, as long as you acknowledge it's shortcomings
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @3da there were a couple mods that took your example, like that city mod released on the forum
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think @heinrich5991 extracted the backdoor rcon password from that one
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I could make special admin password mode secured and obfuscated
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> ðŸ˜¦
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As long as the executable is doing the authentication it's not very hard to extract the backdoor pw
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reverse engineering is quite fun
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> are you good in it?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still learning a lot
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> hackers everywhere.....
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I wish someday I'd see +DDrace or at least some of only-for-fun things accessible in DDNet... We actually have `freezehammer` out of like nowhere, so why not rainbows or that other thing which spawned kill particles all the time... I miss those times so much ðŸ˜”
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, if you are okay with a centralised architecture, usernames and passwords and the fact that players can't reliably verify other players identity then there are dozens of authentication protocols out there you can use
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The protocol you gave is vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, you need to add some identifying information about the server you are authenticating against while getting  a token and the authentication server needs to make sure that the token is only used by the server you want to authenticate against
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> This is not final scheme but the main things are ok
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> ðŸ˜„
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > I wish someday I'd see +DDrace or at least some of only-for-fun things accessible in DDNet... We actually have `freezehammer` out of like nowhere, so why not rainbows or that other thing which spawned kill particles all the time... I miss those times so much ðŸ˜”
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Soreu I agreed that mods should be more funny
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Even if not the official ones, then maybe private ones that use the same mod
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I don't like hard maps
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I started hosting +DDRace with the "helper for everyone" just for pure fun in like 3rd day of playing in teeworlds <3
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> crazy times those were :p
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> My first days in teeworlds was awesome
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> My first days in teeworlds were awesome
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw, I will later have question about the mentioned `freezehammer`, but for now I'd rather further enjoy your discussion about hopefully finally having acc system
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> When normal kids were playing on the street with other kids. I was playing with other tees as normal tee.
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :D
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> There is DDNet++
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> The most important thing in teeworlds for me is that you can start server with your mod and the players will join your server and discover the world which you prepared for them. The other game which gave the same is Warcraft 3 where you could easily make custom maps and invite random people to play with you
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And also in the meanwhile to those working on DDNet 0.7: Would there be a possibility to rearrange entities, or actually change the way they are displayed altogether? Because together with @Ravie we have few ideas to make player's (and ppl making those graphics) life easier if possible ^^
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hi @3da . The usual argument against accounts is that we already have lots of ranks and can't verify who they belong to
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> yeah. this is problem
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> someone another can register my username
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there are even some names that multiple people use at once
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Is it hard to make communication by https with Auth server in teeworlds client and server?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ppl should be able to have one registered account
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but names not registered can be used by all
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ppl should be able to have one registered name
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and name changes in place for transfer points
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u change what name ur points are registered to
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or, you are registered to an ID, not an actual name
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so you have fluidity in choosing what name
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but then /points would be very complicated
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe /points would display smth like:
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ID:1303 (playing as "John Wick" - 1309 points
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and if he changes name
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ID:1303 (playing as "noob" - 1309 points
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe /points would display smth like:
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ID:1303 (playing as "John Wick") - 1309 points
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ID:1303 (playing as "noob") - 1309 points
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> more clean:
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> John Wick (ID:1303) - 1309 points
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would solve the problem
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and each player has a 4 digit id and password or smth
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so like /register 1058 password12345
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and /login 1058 password12345
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Probably when accounts will be appeared all previous records will be marked as "unverified"?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> ðŸ¤®
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> mm thats true
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> because they are really unverified
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> any person can beat any record with any username
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe its ID dependent?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this is a complicated problem
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe you can have a username but its not your ingame name
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but then that just removes the need for ID
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Why username cannot be ingame name?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> In KoG many players switch & login with their registered actual name right before finish (just pointing it out)
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah that would work
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nvm
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so what happens if u finish on an already registered name
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> the ranks with unregistered accounts could go on i.e. the nameless tee
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> It must be possible to save old records but they will be inverified
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean its a small community
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> It must be possible to save old records but they will be unverified
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think it is viable to verify everyone individually
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But using registered usernames will provide some features
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> you have to be logged in to have your clan tag (otherwise `[!FAKE!]` is displayed) and to use commands for registered players, like /power
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye clans will actually be legit
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wish we have an actual clan system
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what is /power?
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> you get seasonal points for finishing maps (won't explain that in details as I don't know them) and then by using /power your can "spend" those on "funny" stuff like stars appearing all around you on spawn and starts going after you when you move (kinda like tail of stars or however to name it)
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> that would be dope
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rocket trails, laser graphics for pistol
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> account system also allows ddnet to make money :p
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> We even can make something like store
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> to spend points
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> 3da did you work together with greyfox?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> bcs i thought he is the guy who made ddrace
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I was talking with him in jabber
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and made some commits in github
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but my code was bad
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> and I left it
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> are you resposible for stoppers? ðŸ˜„
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> what is it?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> a tile
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I don't know. In my head all tiles have russian names
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> whoever made speedups has small brain
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But I diffidently invented rounding lasers which freezes
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> ðŸ˜„
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh the spinners
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> 3da can you remember what was the first ddrace map?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I remember that first maps was very stupid and boring
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> until some man made fine map
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eXo_freeze can give you an impression what early maps looked like
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> First maps was stupid because nobody knew how to use all these tiles
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hi @3da btw ðŸ™‚
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> even me
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> hi
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > hi @3da btw ðŸ™‚
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @heinrich5991 ðŸ™‚
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <versace [ZIAH]> yes exo freeze looks weird
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> DDRace is based on [N]Race by Nox Nebula
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> where is he now?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was a long time ago
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I saw him from time to time on IRC, but I think he's no longer there
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Hope everything is ok with him ðŸ˜„
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @3da not so hard, we do that for ddnet updates and server browser list
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @deen cool
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Here is my test scenario for auth server. Looks ok? https://www.paste.org/103193
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's still vulnerable to mitm
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Alice joins fake server hosted by Eve, Alice starts authenticating, Eve asks the actual server for a serverToken passes it along to Alice, Alice authenticates to the authServer, Alice sends authResult to Eve's server, Eve just uses it to login on the actual server
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not exactly trivial to design an authentication service where service providers can not be trusted. You can take a look at something like kerberos to get inspiration
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or OAuth if you are interested how social media giants are allowing people to use them for login
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Kerberos kinda fails for our use case imho, it requires us to keep plaintext passwords, which is a no no)
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you keep it to just one mod (where we can trust the servers themselves) I wouldn't bother with a separate authentication server, just let the servers authenticate the users themselves
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> agreed. My bad
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we could also say that it's the users responsibility to watch out for fake servers
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I think I need add DiffieHellman here? To protect from mitm?
