22:32 < peter___> Hey
22:32 < peter___> is there someone tester here?
22:32 <@deen> peter___: probably not. what's up?
22:33 <@deen> peter___: probably not. what's up?
22:33 < peter____> where to post a map for a tournament
22:33 <@deen> you'd have to talk to a tester directly. ideally the one you trust most
22:33 <@deen> have you released any maps on DDNet already?
22:34 < peter____> deen i tried ... i am pixel and my map is called "newbee" ... nobody want test it after last fix ...
22:34 <@deen> The testers are listed here, but I'm not sure if any of them are active still: https://forum.ddnet.tw/memberlist.php?mode=group&g=25
22:35 < peter____> thank you :D
22:35 < peter____> other question ... how to get a official ddnet tester?
22:35 <@deen> by helping with map testing in ddnet forum, everyone can do it
22:35 <@deen> and after you've been active for some time and doing well, you should become an official tester
22:36 < peter____> yes i am testing maps sometimes with somepeople who ask me :D 
22:36 < peter____> THX =D ... PS: nice tournament yesterday
22:36 <@deen> generally the idea is only to use maps from well known mappers who have released popular maps on DDNet before
22:37 < peter____> ye, like Vasten's maps
22:37 <@deen> thanks
22:37 <@deen> I said "generally". Vasten had a cool idea so we made an exception
22:38 < peter____> but at the testing forum it is the same ... the maps from known testers get tested first, more and better ... much people don't like that
22:38 <@deen> well, it's not like the testers get paid or anything
22:38 <@deen> they just test whatever maps they like in their free time
22:39 <@deen> so of course if they have a favorite mapper they'll prefer testing their map
22:39 < peter____> :/
22:39 <@deen> and good mappers usually make fewer errors, so easier to test
22:39 < peter____> and faster aswell
22:39 < peter____> because they know what to do
22:39 <@deen> we've always had the problem that map testing can't keep up with mapping
22:40 <@deen> I don't think anyone has found a solution for it
22:40 <@deen> but if you have a solution, you can do it on the ddnet forum since map testing is open to everyone now
22:41 <@deen> or you could even start your own map testing group (like iMTG) and try out your system, as long as the quality of maps from the testing groups is fine
22:42 < peter____> i like it that ddnet offers the free "open testservers" it is easy to upload and you dont need a special browser for it like in timakro's project -.-
22:42 < peter____> if i start my own ... nobldy would join me, cuz they dont know me.
22:43 <@deen> write down your ideas in ddnet forum, motivate people to join you
22:43 <@deen> motivating people to test maps is the main problem i think
22:43 <@deen> because it's so time-intensive, boring and in the end it's your fault when the map is buggy
22:44 < peter____> and nobody want to spend free time to do this and in the end the map dont get released
22:44 <@deen> yeah, you first need to determine whether a map is good enough before fixing it
22:45 < peter____> like my first map didn't get released
22:46 <@deen> Some people say we release too many bad maps, others say we reject too many good maps. Difficult to strike a balance
22:46 < peter____> i have to say ... at my first map i saw the different from good and bad testers ..... like .... hi_leute said to me no the map is gay . start a new or never map again ........ and index said to me ...... yeah it is not a  bad map. maybe change the bg and we can talk again ....... 
22:47 <@deen> Don't listen to people like hi_leute, he's like that to everyone. Constructive criticism is more useful
22:47 < peter____> and often maps get a bad rating  the map Candyland by fnokurka and fikmesan is not novice 1â˜† ... i let my brother play and he didn't know hot to hammerfly
22:48 <@deen> most novice 1 maps are impossible for noobs
22:48 < peter____> its even hard to make a novice 1 map xD
22:51 < peter____> Can you name me a good tester I can trust??
22:51 <@deen> Lady Saavik was good and tested many tournament maps, no idea if she's still active
22:52 <@deen> Welf and hannibal should also be nice
22:52 <@deen> hi_leute_gll from iMTG is good at map testing if you can ignore his snarky comments
22:54 < peter____> Thank you! :)
22:58 < peter____> And , sry if I annoy you, how to join the website&forum team?? I talked to Soreu many times, I made testwebsites and let him watch them, I downloaded phpbb and learned a bit about it .... I know the programming languages like HTML(ok no real programming language) CSS  PHP JS .... what to do now?
22:59 <@deen> no idea if there are any website or forum changes even planned
23:00 <@deen> I guess the main problem is that you'd need full DDNet server access for interesting changes
23:00 <@deen> so you'd also have the capability to destroy a lot
23:00 < peter____> Yes if i have the access to ftp ... hmm
23:01 <@deen> what are you interested in doing?
23:01 <@deen> forum mostly needs moderation I think
23:01 <@deen> and website hasn't changed much
23:01 < peter____> and Soreu told me that he and ryozuki planned a new design and something he sent me a screenshot
23:01 <@deen> Yeah, they've been working on that, but I don't believe in that
23:01 < peter____> xDD
23:02 < peter____> maybe I can work on a new design? :P
23:02 <@deen> sure, but you don't need to be part of any team for that. ideally you'd get around with just changing the css, which you can test locally
23:04 < peter____> yes i just need maybe the html code for the classes and is's :P
23:04 <@deen> classes?
23:05 <@deen> you could just download the website, we also have a git repo: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web
23:05 < peter____> the html code like <div class="tet"></div> and then change the class .tet in the css
23:05 < peter____> ok thank you again
23:08 < peter____> good night i am offline :)
23:08 <@deen> good night
