00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Kinda obvious what I'm saying: It shouldn't even matter where the data is, right?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The recent ios14 tracking prevention features are my favourite, every app needs to ask you before tracking
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> My samsung does this by default or just change the permissions settings manually for each app. Things like instagram, etc I dont even allow background usage.

05:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> fixed by adding some padding from the sun on some backgrounds
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 apple denied that anything was wrong to essentially* send each app open over the network via HTTP
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> essentially, because it only happens every 5min, and because it's only the developer certificate that gets sent, but that is almost unique for every application. how much applications do the tor developers sign, mozilla, zoom, …
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Permission by app thing is nice and all but what apple did takes it even further. Advertisers use a unique string to identify you across apps that depends on the device. Apple no longer allows them to create or get such a string without permission
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, didn't know about this. That's so uncharacteristic of them in this context
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Big tech really needs a leash, they are like one of the biggest existensial threats to humanity. Can easily get us into a cyberpunk dystopia the amount of power they wield
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Zwelf:
11:15 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Дядя Женя: yes?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Zwelf: I'm trying to use your https://gitlab.com/zwelf/teehistorian in C++ console project. Does it work for C++ or only C?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> And I'm still having problems with .so file
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it says that it's corrupted
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a .so file is a linux library btw
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you are on windows it will never work
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is It?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah, tho u can build the rust project urself
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and probably get a .lib file
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is what u use on windows
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rustup.rs/
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I got a .lib file
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> even .dll file, but I still have troubles connecting it
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u have to link against that
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> yeah, I mean I don't know how to link it
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are using  visual studio right? well i havent used that in years i cant help much
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4445418/how-to-add-additional-libraries-to-visual-studio-project
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> that's much harder then I did before
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> no, it does not work
12:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> You managed to build the project for windows and have a teehistorian.dll or teehistorian.lib?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I asked a friend to build it, he managed to get the .lib, .h and .dll
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> [img] v : but it still does not work
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788724189858103317/unknown.png
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I tried to link it 3 different ways. nothing works
12:11 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> I'm not experienced with building on windows. But I guess you have to tell the linker where to find the .dll file (via an environment variable) or place it in a directory where the linker is already searching.
12:12 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Maybe this is helping: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769977/
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I've already added every single folder to a lot of properties
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> as Stack Overflow said or Microsoft docs
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Zwelf: Could you build windows library for me?
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> maybe I should use C instead of C++?
12:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Yeah, I'll try to cross compile.
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> does it work for c++?
12:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> C++ should work just as good (I tried to compile the example with g++)
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't know if Rusts auto deref is a blessing or a curse. I can write whole blocks of code without knowing if I'm dealing with a direct value, a reference or even a double reference. But probably still the right choice, constantly writing `(*var).function` would be really ugly
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Same goes for deref coercion. I didn't write explicit type annotations and never knew if I was dealing with a vector of `&String` or a vector of `&str`
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Дядя Женя are the `th_close` etc. functions in a `extern "C"` block?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I dont knoooooow
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> just nothing works...
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you include some header file, right?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> yes
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> as well as `.lib` file I guess
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cna you check whether in that header file, the functions are in an `extern "C"` block?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know who solved the ugly `(*x).y` yeeears ago? C \o/
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> which is in the folder of `Additional Include Dependencies` folder
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it is
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788737809930256394/unknown.png
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Deref coercion also means simply removing a type annotation can give strange type errors. You'd think removing a type annotation would mean either the compiler can't infer the type or it can infer the type, not that the compiler could infer a different type
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 Who did? :D
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> maybe I should define _cplusplus
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already said C. -> is such a natural sugar for any language with pointers
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And I thought this was a weird emoticon haha
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Дядя Женя it's already defined if you compile C++
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> bad
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah why didn't rust use ->
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/ was me celebrating how natural this is in C.
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably too convenient to use unsafe things that way
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. I wonder if extra steps are necessary like __declspec(dllimport) or so
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro I'd guess because only one of -> and . is ever possible, so the compiler might as well infer what it is
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and they do similar enough things that it's not confusing
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The designers of rust spend time on 2 things, first is adding more annoying safety features to the compiler and the second is making being unsafe annoying
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I doubt more safety features have been added since 1.0
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this is it, there is no implicit exporting for dlls under msvc
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'd guess at most rules were relaxed)
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788738904265982042/unknown.png
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it says that there is no definition for function
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I don't know if it's a mistake or not
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definition not being found is normal. It’s not part of your project
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the function is probably in the library
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for some reason your compiler can't find it
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it must be in the library
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, msvc does export by default
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You sure your friend compiled it correctly?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you open the dll in a text editor and check if you can find `th_open`?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, try putting `__declspec(dllimport)` in front of each function in the header file
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 seems that’s only an optimization but sure he can try
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm TIL
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so only dllexport is mandatory?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> does not help
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has been a while since I used garbage studio but, iirc you just need the lib and the dll next to your executable
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you open the dll in a text editor and check if you can find `th_open`?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> there is no th_open
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, can you make sure you're really linking to the .lib
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does, does not help mean? What is going on? Does it not link?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> how
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 are function names in plain text in the dll?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I don't know
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know that?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> seems like it does not link
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 50/50
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t remember the dll format. But you can use dependency walker to check what symbols a dll has
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know the dependency walker, need to check that out some time
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk-ish
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the only thing dllexport does is keeping the abi consistent so you don’t have to recompile too much
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> seems like I'd better go write my own library instead of using this
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not the libraries fault that you can’t link to it lol
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> idk my libraries always work
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I won’t go on speculating randomly. What is the error?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/788724191884476446 perhaps this
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If that’s it you are not linking the lib correctly
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> without all that "open configuration properties, go to X then Y then Z then add folder path, reopen, blah-blah-blah, now it is still not linked"
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't sound like the fault of the lib
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> more like the fault of the tooling
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> seems like it, but how could I possibly go wrong when I've already tried like 4 different methods one of which is from official Microsoft documentation for VS
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you added it to additional libraries that’s all you need
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Next thing to check is that the lib actually exports the functions you are trying to call
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> that doesn't, but writing my own lib will solve the problem for sure, no matter what caused it
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it just seems easier then link this
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems msvc has a tool for this. `dumpbin /exports whatever.lib`
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where did you get your library btw? I can't find a .lib in the what seems to be the official release page: https://gitlab.com/zwelf/teehistorian/-/releases
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He said his friend built it for him
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you should make sure that it really exports these symbols ^^
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788742435882270731/unknown.png
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope there is more to it than the summary 😛
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I hope not
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Because if so then it just don't work without any reason
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well is it or is it not exporting any symbols?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Zwelf:
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> build `.lib` pls
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fine, I’m out of time to waste. I’ll get back to studying
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> how do I build `.lib` in Rust? @heinrich5991 ?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cargo cbuild`, but you have to have `cargo cbuild` installed for that
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (according to the CI)
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> there is no `cbuild` in the docs
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ok, useless lib, just wasting time
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Дядя Женя please stop calling other people's work useless
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is not welcome here. you can say that it doesn't work for you. it's probably not useless in anyway, but calling it that is just hurtful
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> its useful since I'm using it to write my own)
15:51 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> I haven't tested it, so it might not work, but I added cross compiling to the CI and built the .lib files: https://gitlab.com/zwelf/teehistorian/-/jobs/915964786/artifacts/download
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides as I said before, your inability to link or build it doesn't reflect on the usefulness of the library much if at all
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Neither me or my friend cannot link it. Wasted whole day on that. Just pointing it out, not discussing
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Neither me or my friend could link it. Wasted whole day on that. Just pointing it out, not discussing
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Depressed:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bitcoin reached 20k$ today
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Wtf dang
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all time high
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if true but they expect it to reach 25k
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if this inflation is good
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does the value of bitcoin raising increase its use and spread? xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> On another note, Tesla stock is up above $600 per share (even after the 4-way stock split...) Some crazy stuff going on in the markets right now. Tesla has gone up 1300% in 5 years... ridiculous
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Bitcoin in particular seems like a shit value though. The (energy) cost of transactions alone is way too high.
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see spacex launching rockets everyday
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never really used bitcoin as an investment tool so don’t really follow it’s value. Since it has no intrinsic value and is not backed by anything of value it sounds like a great way to earn and lose money. A purely speculative market
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there are any half duplex ethernet networks still lying around
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Bubble
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that I think about it, one could value the network and the computations made and thus argue that bitcoins have intrinsic value. Which would make it not a bubble
