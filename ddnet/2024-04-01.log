00:03 < bridge> <neiky.> i want to give time using my bot just for simulate
00:11 < bridge> <furo321> As said, you can't do that from a client due to time/score being handled by the server.
00:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> i wonder if you could do this with something like this?
00:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
00:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> `m_pServer->SendMsg(&pMsg, MSGFLAG_VITAL, client_id);`
00:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> considering you hardcode it
00:25 < bridge> <neiky.> ?
00:25 < bridge> <meloÆž> that wasnt a suggestion or answer, more of a question to furo :P
00:32 < bridge> <teero777> yo why do i have dj when not hooking but i dont get dj when hooking up?

00:33 < bridge> <teero777> my position doesnt change
00:35 < bridge> <chairn> you need force downwards
00:37 < bridge> <teero777> only on stoppers?
07:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and does it give any perf?
07:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> true, saddest, directly heard all dragonball osts xd
07:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hap PI day
07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what no way. i 100% used that version
07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rip
07:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you can't be certain it's the real me
08:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks
08:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> epyc
08:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sometimes it crashes when it tries to decode big chunk of data but this is fine
08:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sometimes it crashes when it tries to decompress big chunk of data but this is fine
08:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> decompress triggers me rn
08:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
08:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wonder if i can somehow know if i am affected
08:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> by the xz-utils backdoor
08:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am pretty certain i used that backdoor version xD
08:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's joe over, ure hacked
08:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i dunno if it requires like a port to open
08:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or uses peer to peer or smth like that
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2: :poggers:
08:34 < bridge> <0xdeen> On a system with systemd journalling support linked into sshd?
08:35 < bridge> <0xdeen> It requires you to have an exposed sshd port
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah ok, also seems like i currently run no ssh service, good
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> as long as the client isn't also affected
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @ryozuki rust 2024 looks pretty useless :c
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> only stuff nobody needs
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont worry edlang is coming 2024
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> epyc
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> âœ¨
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> my hip hurts
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> jupstaaaar!
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> :brownbear:
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yo, what's up
11:34 < bridge> <learath2> Jupstar is back, say something about fps
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i still didnt manage to beat cpp version fps wise
11:51 < bridge> <patiga> ^ this is super annoying in parts where you drag another tee on stoppers
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did you forget to reply to a msg?
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or is my discord outdated? xd
11:58 < bridge> <patiga> the message above was deleted
11:59 < bridge> <patiga> not sure who posted it. it was a vid showing that while you have an active hook, you don't get dj back from stoppers
11:59 < bridge> <patiga> hm nvm
11:59 < bridge> <patiga> I was scrolled up I guess, it was a reply to https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1224124307383517307
12:01 < bridge> <patiga> I don't think this helps on stoppers. you can sit right on top of stoppers and hook a tee below you, and you won't get dj back
14:25 < bridge> <teero777> xDDD
14:25 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1224333731741962280/GKA5zn4XYAApLaM.png?ex=661d1ca4&is=660aa7a4&hm=c04ad14974dd29730be91de61782bfd601c2fe25073bc35b59701e67e5b57dbd&
14:55 < bridge> <privatekero> I received the warning when adding my tilesset. Can I ignore it now? Or should I try to make it somehow compatible with other clients?
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you should fix your tileset
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah wait
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tilesets inside maps are not stored as png
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u meant tileset of a map
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if you mean entities, you should fix it
15:27 < bridge> <privatekero> hmm thanks
16:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> any arch andies, do you know how to this dis. it happens when try to load from usb stick
16:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1224366106962296932/98d971c2-4d28-4203-9892-082f891705ae.png?ex=661d3acb&is=660ac5cb&hm=97d09155bf49061c518b91cd2f89c5a1466b5ca5dc57305f6797930835eab93c&
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> smells of a badly made usb
16:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my friend tried to install linux mint before
16:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and there was error "Failed to execute /init"
16:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no syncing: No working init found
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> Also smells of a bad usb
16:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and nothign changed after 5 times making a new usb
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> Are you sure you are formatting and flashing these things correctly?
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> Arch isos are hybrid, you can just dd them onto the usb without messing with anything
16:42 < bridge> <learath2> Another possibility is maybe you have too little ram?
16:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `gb
16:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 1gb
16:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, that's your issue
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> these modern distros come with massive ramdisks nowadays
16:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> bloated mfs
16:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what os is it possible to install on a monster with 1 gb ram
16:44 < bridge> <louis> use a flash drive with ram on it
16:45 < bridge> <louis> https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd?q=processor
16:45 < bridge> <louis> does anyone have one of these?
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> you can install arch but you'll need to use a smaller livecd and bootstrap from that
16:49 < bridge> <learath2> @milkeeycat you can probably try gparted livecd
16:49 < bridge> <learath2> it has a ram requirement of 384M ðŸ˜„
16:50 < bridge> <learath2> The kernel in it may not support your networking adapter though :/
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> maybe a very old arch install disk might work, slightly newer than the laptop should work
16:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> this laptop is from 2005
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> Well maybe the gparted livecd does have a driver for it, that's what I'd try, it's tiny and it has a lot of the tools needed
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux#From_a_host_running_another_Linux_distribution then you can do this
17:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> seems like buying more ram is much easier solution :justatest:
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> depends on what you prefer to tinker with more I guess
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> you can try freebsd, iirc that also has a tiny install image, but it's not linux
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> I found the goofiest thing ever, my bash session was somehow ending up with environment variables from `~/.zshenv` which made no sense, until I noticed on macOS alacritty uses `/bin/zsh` to start the login shell of the user ðŸ˜„
18:27 < bridge> <teero777> lol
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> yo does anyone have the bug that the client freezes for a lot of time after rendering a demo?
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> when inspecting with gdb it just sleeps at
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a9b254b0e262dd941bd1448fd97b54eac49cee71/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L3026
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> no other thread is doing anything (except the thread for networking)
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> everyone just sleeps for like 5 minutes when i try to render a 30 sec vid
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have u checked the value of sleeptimeinnanoseconds
21:27 < bridge> <teero777> ah no i havent
21:27 < bridge> <teero777> ill try
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but other than that, i dont have that bug
21:28 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
21:29 < bridge> <teero777> okay i redid the exact demo and now its instant
21:30 < bridge> <teero777> lemme try smth else
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok u also made the client inactive
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i didnt do that
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> still no
21:33 < bridge> <teero777> huh wtf
21:33 < bridge> <teero777> now it works?
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> seems that it only happens after a long session of having the client open
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> ive noticed this for ~1 year now
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> idk
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if it's souly based on the time the client is open you could easily fake the uptime of the client
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> anything else probably requires deeper analysis ðŸ˜„
22:05 < bridge> <teero777> ðŸ˜‚
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> i dont get the refrence but funny
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ?XD
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if it's solely based on the time the client is open you could easily fake the uptime of the client
23:00 < bridge> <zhn> windows xp
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> we installed puppy linux
23:00 < bridge> <zhn> im fine! wbu?
23:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have no fukcing clue what the hell is that
23:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but it works
23:01 < bridge> <zhn> use templeos
23:01 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
23:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there was windows 7 on it before btw
23:07 < bridge> <zhn> w7 with 1gb of ram is something like caracal in a cat cage
23:46 < bridge> <cyberFighter> what
23:59 < bridge> <bencie.> no idea :justatest:
