08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> An idea for fixing the weak hook issue would be to make strong hook on by default for everyone, but have a command to swap to weak. No idea if that's even possible or not.
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is possible, but not too great, will probably cause prediction errors for vanilla clients
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not sure if we should care about vanilla 0.6 since there is 0.7
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> strong hook by default means fixing the bug, after that it's very hard to make people weak
11:25 <+ZillyHuhn> Not sure if we should care about 0.6 since there is 0.7
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon but that means that we can also not implement 0.7 support, where @Learath2 put alot of work in
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 needs a whole lot more work and atleast I won't be behind a direct port
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just porting our spaghetti over is pointless
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Quote: "0.7 sux"
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you suck
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut no personal attacks please
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just annoying, he always trashtalks everything
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> no he doesnt trashtalk old ht
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :troll:
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut that's no excuse for personal attacks
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
13:45 <+ZillyHuhn> yes u all pls stop attacking 0.7 personally
13:45 <+ZillyHuhn> its good girl
13:46 <+ZillyHuhn> Yea @fokkonaut the bridge thing is a nice idea but if implemented like on kog it might do more harm than good by serving a poor 0.7 expirence and advertising 0.6 clients to omprove it
13:47 <+ZillyHuhn> improve*
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> KoG did it very bad, I offered my help to improve it but qshar rejected it. Then I told him whats wrong (made a list) and still no improvements
13:50 <+ZillyHuhn> same here :D
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I just quoted :feelsbadman:
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> myself :troll:
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly what I intend to do, I'll offer a decent experience on 0.7 and as with all other subpar clients, we'll broadcast that our own client offers the best experience
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If any of you have features in your clients you want supported we can get those in as long as we all decide on the common protocol, but I don't think we'll work on a 0.7 version of ddnet client until we have a 0.7 version of ddnet itself
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If any of you want to put in the work to port the client to 0.7 we could maybe host that
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> People are forgetting that for a lot of maps you need weak hook to pass it.
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already considered this, that's why we won't do anything before taking a look
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it breaks maps it's probably not happening
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How bad of an idea is it to put `CNetObj_CharacterCore`Â and `protocol7::CNetObj_CharacterCore`Â in a union? As long as vanilla doesn't touch the core "it should work(tm)" because of the common initial sequence rule
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or I can be a little more wasteful memorywise and just allocate an extra core
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 it definitely breaks maps. Except if you would turn weak hook on at the necessary parts etc
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b got an example?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I am bad in map names
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know of any except the 2 Konsti mentioned and those are speefly and shotgunrun, not certain those require weak
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> speedfly*
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But there is are a few parts that when you have endless and hold the tee when it goes in arrow you need weak
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++20 Concepts would be so great for this project
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Arrows =speedups
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah if you have strong the tee wont move?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could make the speeders weaker in those maps
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah or move to fast
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not sure how it was
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> And i know that there is a 3p map that need to hook one tee together with endless and get it through a maze. Not sure what you needed but this was also only possible with weak or strong. I guess strong tho
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know what's going on in `CCharacter::Snap` The reckoning thing looks like a NOP except for clearing the core
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I see nvm ðŸ˜„
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> 1way stoppers also have different physics with weak hook
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do stoppers and hook interact?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you hook someone against the stopper?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ I presume
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm I guess I'll ditch typesafety and use a template function in `CCharacterCore::Write`
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did the character core change between 0.6 and 0.7?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps you could just import it?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it didn't change but a cast between those is undefined behaviour
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could perhaps import the 0.6 one into the 0.7 one
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I'd have to mess with the generation though, do you think it's worth it?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was hoping to keep the protocol folder the same
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++20 has a really nice `std::is_layout_compatible`Â that would let me do a `std::bitcast`
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, you could memcpy it over
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I guess that's the same amount of unsafe and it's easier
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess memcpy between layout compatible types is not UB
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Layout compatibility is introduced in C++20 too iirc
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, but de facto you already have to have it
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because if you compile a header from two different source files, the struct layout must be the same
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721017905357127850/stoppers.mp4
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean no sane compiler would lay these out differently so I guess the implementation kinda guarantees it
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wow, that looks all kinds of broken ðŸ˜„
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks @ZombieToad
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are there any maps abusing this?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> idk ask @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would anyone use stoppers as knockoff speeders anyway? ðŸ˜„
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 are you sure the struct layout has to be the same even if the structs have different tags?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can also have no tag at all, when they're typedef'd
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd be interesting what the C standard has to say about this, but I can't imagine building a spec-compliant compiler trying to break that rule
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. you'd have to solve quite some issues before you're able to generate different struct layouts for structs with identical contents
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I asked the ##C people but they didn't know whether there was a guarantee for this in the standard
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they don't knowâ€¦ ^^
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might be a little too early for the standardese people to be around though
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ehm
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can put them into a union
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I put both in a union CIS covers it yeah
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so they have to have the same layout?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, and we also have that the fields are laid out in the order we type them
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well idk how the compiler could avoid it tbh
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With a straight cast it's a strict aliasing violation though
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because reinterpreting memory is not allowed
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think any sane compiler would optimize around that though
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's abused so frequently
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> llvm at least does it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I'll put it in a union just incase
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but special cases "obvious" cases
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that when you hit a bug concerning that, it's guaranteed that it's complicated
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> There is a map by Bixes Where one part requires weak
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> So stoppers and speeders are affected
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Everything is affected
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> U
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> What would you like actually. Change it or not @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> just change core physics and delete every rank that existed before the change
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> ez
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> dont change anything
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Weak is good
18:45 <+Delon> Hi , im trying to run my server in screen with directaly command not step by step , this is my command line 
18:45 <+Delon> screen -dmS DDNet-8313 /home/8313/DDNet-Server -f /home/8313/8313.cfg
18:46 <+Delon> But not work....
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-snd> try this
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-snd> ```
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-snd> cd /home/8313/
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-snd> screen -dmS DDNet-8313 bash -c "./DDNet-Server -f 8313.cfg"
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-snd> ```
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Red Avenue is the map where one Part requires weak
19:06 <+Delon> I know with `cd /home/8313` work fine but i didnt want to cd to folder as i said need to run directly
19:07 <+Delon> @deen @heinrich5991 @Learath2 any suggestion ?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Shotgunrun is used on a lot of maps especially oldschool as part or as a trick in speedruns for example LowPossibility 3.1, used it on Ray 2 and theres much more.
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Pirofly is used in some maps to skip kills/blocker/stopper as a cheat. Doubt u can figure out which is Which.
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Speedfly is connected to weak bouncing physics and ofc is used on like every map.
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> There isnt a way to fix the whole physic without breaking a lot. 
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The only way might be to give strong hook to everyone but an indicator to see who u have the real strong on for example through hookcolor if u hook a tee it shows wheather u have real strong on the tee you are hooking or not
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Wouldnt even be annoying cuz people already hook each other to figure out who have strong
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Requires latest DDNet then ofc.
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Maybe a command too like /strong <name>  to see if u have strong to this tee
19:37 <+Delon> Ok i try with -S instead -dmS and terminal show this error `could not open 'maps/Kobra 4.map'`
19:38 <+Delon> but in 8313.cfg sv_map Stronghold
19:39 <+Delon> Seem couldnt run server by 8313.cfg
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you run it without screen?
20:17 <+Delon> Seems from storag.cfg if current map in data/maps work fine but in maps folder in ddnet directory not work
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know of a pretty way to assign a subclass to a superclass?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no the other way around
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pointers?
21:05 <+ZillyHuhn> Delon any reason you do not want to cd into there? Btw you can always put the maps in ~/.teeworlds/maps/ and they are loaded without configuring storage.cfg
21:09 <+ZillyHuhn> Oh wait or is the issue that the config is not loaded at all? Hmm any errors about loading 8313.cfg in the log? Try fiddeling around without screen to see if you can see why it is not loading the correct config.
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I was thinking of assigning a `CNetObj_CharacterCore` to a `CNetObj_Character`. Decided against it

21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Means you are probably doing something very wrong
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> XD
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but my friend can compile this repository very nice
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i just clone it by git
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and open
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> not by git, sorry
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> by tool in msvc to synchonization of local repository and remote
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut do you have spec/pause working in 0.7?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you happen to know off the top of your head why the old way doesn't work?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also `((Server()->IsSixup(i) == !!(Flags & CHAT_SIXUP)) || (!Server()->IsSixup(i) == !!(Flags & CHAT_SIX)))`Â really looks like it should simplify, but it doesn't
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Whats that
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well as is spec doesn't work, if I spec I just cant move
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's to control where `CHAT_ALL` messages go
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Whats wrong with your pause?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you may not handle it the way for 0.6 vanilla clients
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, how any idea how it's supposed to be handled?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did it for ddnet7
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I'll take it from there
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And please, for 0.7 clients send the PLAYERFLAG_DEAD for players who are paused
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I made it that way in ddnet7, because in that way you can see who is spectating you
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is a flag for that too
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For a paused/specd client, spectator mode is always `SPEC_FREEVIEW` right?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (you can take all that from ddnet7 btw)
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you mean spectator mode always freeview?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It can also go to the other specmodes, aswell as the players of course
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't really take it all, I can't just break 0.6 ðŸ˜„
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You dont have to?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SpecMode doesn't really exist in 0.6
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's hacked together with the SpectatorID
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, need to send a teamchange in 0.7
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm timakro doesn't
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see where he hid it
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great I have a crash that's impossible to diagnose
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Run it with a debugger, it's gone. Allow core dumps it just freezes. Asan makes it disappear
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I know where it is. @heinrich5991 is it possible for real extended netobjs to be <= 0?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> <0*
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I'll just add a SnapNewItemRaw to be safe
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vanilla teeworlds has some confusion with type ids > 32768
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but ddnet fixed it
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (only for packing, not unpacking)
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be irrelevant for you
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I'm sending a netobj I was thinking of using negative types to indicate that type shouldn't be messed with
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you have a 
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```c++
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if(!(Type >= 0 && Type <= 0xffff))
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>         g_UuidManager.GetUuid(Type);
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which means my negative types go to the uuid manager which doesn't take too kindly to it
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could make that Type > 0xffff
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all these low level protocol details being decided by the highest level we have is really making me sad ðŸ˜¦
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> sorry

22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how does it keep getting worse?

22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Could type -9999 have something to do with what you mentioned before?

22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah it's spectatorinfo
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really should have checked whether the messages are compatible between the protocols in the python script

23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> the computer type of the module "64" conflicts with the type of the target computer x86
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> @Learath2
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wtf
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do a `bam -c all`
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then just a `bam configure` I think
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's been a while since I used bam
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm more comfortable with cmake
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i tried with cmake
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but i have some problems
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> show me the configure with bam, if that doesn't work out we can always go for cmake
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> maybe i just nned to delete configurre?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> maybe i just nned to delete configure file?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and reconfigure
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah reconfigure and show me what the output of the configuration is
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721107895923638272/unknown.png
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> you mean this?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, absolutely no idea why your linker wants to link as 32bit
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok maybe thats because i started with native tools x86
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and then continued at x64
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> sorry
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> lol
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> that's not a reason
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> the same

23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `bam -c all`Â to clean
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> you didnt delete build files
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> ???
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The PECOFF files have their target architecture embedded in them iirc
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> pecoff?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what is it
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the object file format of windows
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hm ok
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> all is ok?

23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> try building now I guess
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that seems to have nuked the sdl folder you found ðŸ˜„
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721108740547280947/unknown.png
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> it's clear sources
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah no idea, I don't use bam ever anymore
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i just downloaded from github by git clone recurse submodule
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok then i'll try by cmake
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you have cmake in the PATH?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what is PATH?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in that console if you type `cmake --version`Â does it work?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721109034186440734/unknown.png
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh great you can just use cmake on the console
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how to
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm wait my batch is a little rusty
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what is batch?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> windows' console
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ah ok
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay do a `rd build`
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how it can be rusty lol
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> folder not empty?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> folder not empty
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `rd /s build`?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rusty in this context means I haven't used it in a while and forgotten some of the commands
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if that worked, do a `mkdir build`Â and `cd build`
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> `build are you sure yes or no
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> `build are you sure yes or no`
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> yes?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> cannot find filer
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> cannot find file

23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> randomly got .bam folder
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> sorry
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesn't matter
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> @Soreu ok thanks
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and sorry
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just need to delete the build folder and create a new one

23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> done
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> done rd build
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then cd into build
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> it says nothing
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> wtf cannot find
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> wtf
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you just deleted it ðŸ˜„
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rd is remove directory
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ah
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> sorry
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> xD
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜›
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> that was a joke?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> it's a trap
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no I was trying to delete it on the console but it didn't want to delete for some reason
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ah xd
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok then
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i create it again?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then cd into it
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> don

23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ah
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> mkdir is make directory?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> now i'm at build
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721110704266149958/unknown.png
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what i need to do?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ok try `nmake`
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lets see if nmake is available
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721110765074907256/unknown.png
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if not we'll use the visual studio generator
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great we can use nmake
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> he said fatal error
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how we can use nmake
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> :D
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do `cmake -G "Nmake Makefiles" ..`
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> he listed generators
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh no nmake generator?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what are the options?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i think i need type "Nmake Makefiles" without ""
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah that shouldn't change anything
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually you need the " beacause there is a space in the middle
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> there is
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721111186174771260/unknown.png

23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah it's NMake
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not Nmake
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ah
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721111325316612146/unknown.png

23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you are forgetting the .. at the end
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> yes
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> sorry
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> oh rly
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> something is builded
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Show me the output
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721111635216826378/unknown.png
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I'm surprised, it didn't break
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> yep me too
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> xD
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you just need to do `nmake` now
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok i'll try
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> OH FUCK IT WORKS
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721111891186810880/unknown.png
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ohhh
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721112056589189220/unknown.png
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> man
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you want to build again you just need to do `nmake`, if things seem to break, just delete the build folder and do cmake again
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> you are wizard like heinrich5991
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't know nmake did the pretty colors like gmake
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what do yuo mean
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721112253033873409/unknown.png
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> just cmake ??
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> or nmake?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if things don't seem to work
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> then i 'rd build'
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just `nmake` is enough to build again
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ok i'll try rn
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but if things break, just delete the folder and do `cmake -G "Nmake Makefiles" ..` again
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ah
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (inside the new build folder)
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i need to remember this
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how to delete not empty folder by the cmd?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Basically, cmake generates instructions for nmake on how to build teeworlds, nmake does the actual building
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Ok, thank you very much for explaining
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `rmdir /S build`Â I think
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> make that `rmdir /Q /S build`Â so it doesn't ask you yes or no
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what is /S?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> make that `rd /Q /S build`Â that's shorter
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> md is like mkdir?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `/S Removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself. It is used to remove a directory tree.`
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> oh thanks
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk if there is a shortcut for mkdir
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep there is
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw, if you don't know what a command does and what options it has, you can always do `command /?`Â in cmd
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like `rmdir /?`
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> oh
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> thanks
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i want to ask you very much about git
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> may i?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> thanks
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> then
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> now i use git for cooperate with visual studio to work there
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> to download actual version of repos and upload my commits to github
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> can i use it without visual studio?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i mean see the branches, tags, upload my commits and download actual version
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> without visual studio
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and do i really need it
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you don't need visual studio
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but your compiler is in visual studio, if you want to remove visual studio you'll need a new compiler
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like mingw
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i mean maybe it's comfortable to use visual studio as editor of code and downloader\uploader reposs
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how do you upload commits to github?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> by visual studio?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use git on the command line
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> git bash?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> don't you play teeworlds on command line? xD
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm on macOS so I'm just using bash, but back when I was on windows yes git bash
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> git on command line takes a bit to learn but it's much more powerful then using a gui for it
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hmm
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> where can i learn git cmd?
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first 3 chapters are enough
