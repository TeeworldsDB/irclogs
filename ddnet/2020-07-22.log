01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have the feeling Sixup sounds are doubled for other players, just by looking at the code
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 handles sounds for Hook attaching to players/ground/nohook clientside, for all players
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so this PR should work for yourself, but if you are a 0.7 client and someone else hooks you or anybody close to you, I think you should hear 2 sounds
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check out vanilla/gameclient.cpp, ProcessTriggeredEvents and where its getting called (same file)
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, 0.7 vanilla doesnt send any hook sounds to the client, this is just a guess, I cant test it right now
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So we would need a NonSixupTeamMask, excluding all Sixup players for these hook sounds

01:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> events are only triggered for other players here:

11:15 <+bridge_> [11:02:13] [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen wtf why do u delete atlas skin?????
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:02:21] atlas by whis o.O
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:02:45] [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :zombietroll:
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:03:12] yo @Soreu or anyone else any idea how to better organize graphics? Currently working on mapres and skins collections and its so hard to find duplicates.
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:03:20] People use different names for same graphics
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:03:34] and even sha1sums dont match becuase they are resaved and exported differently etc
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:03:57] especially for skin names its hard to decide which skin name is the "real" one or who is the author
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:04:22] [ddnet] <Soreu> I kept some under categories of style, if it could be named that way. Like "mountains", "Asian style", "jungle", etc
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:04:49] All these things also gameskins fly around on discord get edited and everyone changes names and format there is no real source of trust
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:05:06] [ddnet] <Soreu> for skins I think best would be by author, though this one is hard to find out after longer time
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:05:12] ye
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:05:38] well mapres names are not too important but still annoying to find duplicates
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:05:45] [ddnet] <Soreu> same with gameskins, it's rather uncategorisable
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:05:50] yea
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:06:00] [ddnet] <Soreu> especially after someone changes just color of hook
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:06:00] I have my mapres somewhat organized https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:06:47] oh also @Soreu feel free to search dupes add credits rename mapres etc if you feel motivated contributing to this database
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:06:59] since you are also the author of many graphics there
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:08:19] [ddnet] <Soreu> ye, just found my `spikes_colored` though I remember that one under GSP-something name xd
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:09:00] yes you used a lot of GSP names idk what GSP stands for and i just ignored the mapres i already had under a diff name
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:09:19] i have no clue what names are best
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:09:47] [ddnet] <Soreu> tbh imo it would be better if all those graphics could be in more than one category, but for that there would be need of website, so you wouldn't have them duplicated in different directories
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:10:03] yes
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:10:36] there is https://teeskins.de/ currently
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:10:39] [ddnet] <Soreu> GSP stands for Get Some Popcorn (it will take a while) and was a 2-ppl clan xD weird and lovely times
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:11:47] [ddnet] <Soreu> ye, but kinda nobody checks whatever is uploaded to teeskins afaik, there have been a lot of crap & duplicates last time I browse thru it
11:15 <+bridge_> [11:11:53] [ddnet] <Soreu> maybe it changed since then
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> [11:12:48] Yea my system is kinda bad because its hard to decide where to put it. I try to bypass that issue by having a metadata txt containing tags.
11:15 < ***> Playback Complete.
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon you could try to do some similarity comparison between the tilesets to find out what is a duplicate and what is not
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Can we add a config that you see who spec you xD?
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Can we add a config that you can see who spec you xD?
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> who would enable this config? the person speccing or the person being specced?
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I want to know who spec me
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea actually planned that i didnt look into it but do you have a tool already that you can recommend for that?
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, don't know any
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> k
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Trafalgar Law but maybe the people speccing you don't want to announce it
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> just update to 0.7
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> it has this feature
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but there are a lot of results for similarity hashing if you search for it
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> Im also not sure what to do about automapper rules and working files
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> like i have all the mapres.pngs but sometimes there are also .svg and .xfc and .psd
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> feels like chaos what i do :D
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> attach them to the image I guess?
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> I have idea for new feature
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Cinematic mode
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got a license for almost 3/4 of ddnet skins already ðŸ™‚
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TortiLeq what is that?
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we don't use the l word anymore, please be mindful of our softer, more delicate tees
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Something like when you spectating person in ath. But it can be option in hud settings. Cinematic mode can be used in recoding speedruns etc.
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it a smoother camera?
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or what does it do?
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, now that we have bezier curves, a smooth camera shouldn't be too hard to implement ðŸ™‚
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Wait i can show you but first gotta download ath to record it
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you only implemented a 1d bezier curve though, right?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'd have one for x and y separately
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess we only need it to drive progress, the fact that tees move in small increments should make it look smooth enough even if we just go towards the tee in a line
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, but we do have teleports and tees can go very fast
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not really sure how one would avoid the sharp changes in direction
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except for teleports you don't really have sharp changes in directions, right?
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, and ninja
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> some way to limit how much the direction vector can change per tick?
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the smoothing or for the tees?
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> for the smoothing
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the direction vector of the cameras movement
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Something like that smooth movement: 
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJzAB-zjt59dkIRP6DOuChpb1DzasFZu/view?usp=sharing
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> For new option in hud settings
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, looks like simple smoothing
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> But for default its turned off
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, that doesn't look very smooth even ðŸ˜„
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could add that
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Oki
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should do better, ease in ease out looks better than linear interpolation
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that linear?
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It looks linear to me
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though the duration of the switch seems to be constant, so far away switches happen realquick
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The path looks linear though
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well both the path and the interpolation look linear ðŸ˜„
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the path being linear isn't too much of an issue except for the corner cases of ninja and teleport
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one would probably want to center the tee somehow
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't have an immediate on how to do that
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idea*
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The final position of the movement will be when the target tee is centered
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that would mean that it's always behind
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not if we make sure the camera is moving faster than the tee
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first derivative of the curve should be `target_v + default`
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm I wonder how hard that would be to solve for though
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 got an idea how I can go from 0-255 to -128-127
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> context python
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0 to 0, 127 to 127, 128 to -128, 255 to -1
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh?
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I could make a function, just a question if there's a nice formula
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> just subtract 128?
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that maps 0 to -128, not 0 to 0
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, hm
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 255 to -1 sounds like a weird transform
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's like reinterpreting an unsigned byte as a signed char
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, a twos complement signed char?
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't see a nice clean formula
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait, couldn't you do something like ~x + 1 ?
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not a nice transform but I think it should work
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would work for the negative case, but not the positive one
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah look, I might have it:
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (x + 128) % 256 - 128
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk, food
