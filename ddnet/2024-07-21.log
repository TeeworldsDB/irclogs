01:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 did something in newer ddnet version change regarding snap items or something? My ddnet gets quite high cpu & gpu when a lot of items are there
01:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> didnt happen before
01:57 < bridge> <archimede67> maybe #8588
01:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8588
02:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We need benchmarks in the CI hehe
02:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: I'm currently working on a translation layer that would allow the 0.7 compatibility (and all the other backward compatibility code) to live in a single place. I haven't looked at pull requests recently
02:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: be the change you want to see in the world
03:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> be the change hasnt been working out so well for me
03:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since my change is not merged :p 
03:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 so what does that mean for the 0.7 client pr?
03:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also the CI is slow enough I don't think its a good idea was more a joke thus the "hehe"
03:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think adding benchmarks has a quicker turn around time adding 0.7 support
03:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't need to always run in the CI. benchmarks for stuff like this just sounds like a net benefit
03:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oh like something that can be triggered manually ye that would be cool
03:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea im not doing it.
03:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.7 first
03:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So what about the pr now? Are you keeping it on hold until its replaced by your translation layer?
03:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Do you even need to have a look? You had 2 years time to have a look and robsti approved it.
03:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not taking a look at it currently, nor am I taking a look at most of the other PRs currently
03:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Do you need to take a look for it to be merged?
03:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if someone else merges it, then it'll be merged. I don't know if someone else will merge it
03:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen your time to shine. The merge machine!

09:51 < bridge> <hekkeyne> Hello! I have already graduated from university, got married and had 2 wonderful children. Maybe there is news about the android version now?
10:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow and you still can't afford a computer? poor guy
10:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> :KEKW:  good morning btw
10:46 < bridge> <robyt3> If it's happening consistently then you can use git bisect to identify the responsible commit
10:47 < bridge> <robyt3> You could first write a small benchmark of the code you think is slower now, then run that with git bisect
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @hekkeyne ye robsti is working on it. So there is news! But nothing finished yet as far as i know. May I ask what you need the android version for? Playing on a computer should be smoother.
11:37 < bridge> <hekkeyne> no, of course there is
11:38 < bridge> <hekkeyne> I don’t know, my question has already become a habit
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So you don't even need the android version? xd
11:38 < bridge> <hekkeyne> gm
11:39 < bridge> <hekkeyne> why, the android version would be a great thing for traveling (or for the toilet)
11:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> i really do want to play block on my phone while taking a dumpy
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea maybe for some.
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I personally don't even play on my laptop. If I don't have a good setup I just don't play at all.
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But yea different people have different taste. So you do play on the computer and would not mind to also play on the phone? That should be a huge skill decrease.
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What chillerdragon wants to say is:
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0.7 has more players than there are mobile players.
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He feels superior
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Does the current version of ddnet android run on your phone did you ever play it? @hekkeyne 
11:42 < bridge> <hekkeyne> which? 0.9.x?
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ I have 0.6 on my iPad lmao
11:42 < bridge> <hekkeyne> Nope
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how did u do that
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> used to be in the appstore
11:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> huuuh?
11:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> when :o
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didnt know someone compiled to ios
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> A few years ago
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Ye some madlad did a pretty solid ios port ran smooth on my phone and ipad and that dude even paid to get it into the official stores
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vanilla teeworlds not ddnet
11:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> so it was just removed because of ios's tos?
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> How would that be tos?
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it aint making money for apple
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I assume the author did not care enough to keep it in the store forever
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats against the tos xdd
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it tos to make money?
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rly? xd
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from apple i'd expect that
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its making apple money
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you gotta pay to have the app published
11:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh yeah there was this developer license thingy right
11:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> for 100$ :KEK:
11:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> for 100$ :kek:
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100 bucks are not enough for apple xd
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are destroying other paid apps with it
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
11:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> XCode also requires a license iirc?
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i assume who ever it was did not want to spend 100 a year forever
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @hekkeyne so you are asking for ddnet mobile so long that it became a habit and you also got 2 kids during that time of asking. And you never bothered to try the android version thats already there? xd
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trol
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are many ppl here asking all the time.. i bet it's all the alter egos of a single person
11:47 < bridge> <hekkeyne> I wrote that 0.9.x does not work (android 14)
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ downloading xcode is free and requires no account. Unlike vs :P so apple is smoother than microsoft in that regard. vs forced me to signup to compile at some point xd
11:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> huuuuuh really? XD
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah i see @hekkeyne i must have overseen that
11:49 < bridge> <hekkeyne> it's okay
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 do you have a branch on your gh for the touch controls or are they still too unfinished to be worth it?
12:50 < bridge> <robyt3> I still need to finish them up a bit, but they should be ready for a first draft PR tomorrow.
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah great to hear

19:02 < bridge> <APFFF> Im currently building like this (:justatest:):

19:03 < bridge> <APFFF> 7. mv .\steam_api.dll .\DDNet.exe ..```
19:03 < bridge> <APFFF> I think there is a lot of "unnecessary" stuff happening. someone told me a better way to build, although I forgot. Can someone maybe point out whats "unnecessary"?

19:07 < bridge> <APFFF> Was it not having to delete `/build` ?
19:07 < bridge> <texnonik> for moderators command /forceswap , that immediately swaps him with blocker and after he bans that person and saves tees that were blocked .
19:07 < bridge> <texnonik> would be helpful if that blocker is somewhere in middle or almost in finish of the map .
19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think moderators should be able to cheat
19:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> dont use msvc :P - if you type them one by one, consider adding a simple .ps script maybe
19:19 < bridge> <APFFF> Im not sure how `cmake --build . -j` works exactly. Does it overwrite changes making the `rm` unnecessary?
19:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `cmake --build` should only recompile necessary changes. `rm` shouldn't be necessary
19:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> you could also just add a `--clean-first` if you want a.. well.. clean rebuild
19:23 < bridge> <APFFF> what does clean mean
19:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> removing everything
19:25 < bridge> <APFFF> `cmake --clean-first --build . -j` or `cmake --clean-first,``cmake --build . -j`
19:26 < bridge> <APFFF> `cmake --clean-first --build . -j` or `cmake --clean-first`, `cmake --build . -j`
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> don't clean
19:26 < bridge> <APFFF> `cmake --clean-first --build . -j` 
19:26 < bridge> <APFFF> or
19:26 < bridge> <APFFF>  `cmake --clean-first`, `cmake --build . -j`
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that just makes the build take longer
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it re-does work that was already done
19:26 < bridge> <APFFF> yes, but just for curiousity
19:27 < bridge> <APFFF> yes, but just for curiosity
19:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> use clean-first if your cmakecache changed and it requires you to, otherwise just use `cmake ..` and `cmake --build . -j`
19:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `-j` shouldn't be necessary either btw
19:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> really?
19:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you use `ninja` for building?
19:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> always thought it fallsback to 1
19:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `ninja` does the correct thing
19:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (if you use `make`: switch to ninja. it's faster)
19:28 < bridge> <APFFF> is that an alternative to msvc?
19:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> no. (`cmake .. -GNinja`)
19:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. msvc is something different, sorry
19:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know about msvc and `-j`. maybe it's necessary there
19:29 < bridge> <APFFF> tbh, I have very little knowledge about the whole building process, especially with c++
19:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> i usually recommend using an IDE of choice with builtin cmake support, it really helps not having to care about it all that much
19:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> its mostly a "click here to run x" button in most modern IDE'S :P
19:32 < bridge> <APFFF> I do care, just not very knowledgeable yet
19:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1232683170969681931 can answer some of your questions? - i had a similar issue with msvc and chatted with ewan and roby about it
19:37 < bridge> <texnonik> only for banning blockers and helping blocked tees to be safe
19:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> mods shouldn't be able to interfere with that, this seems prone to be abused
19:39 < bridge> <APFFF> I love coding, though its not all I do. So I'm very welcome for any knowledge by people who are more knowledgeable
19:45 < bridge> <devinci24> If a mod abuses it then he shouldn't be a mod.
19:45 < bridge> <devinci24> Could be used to clean the mod team a bit ^^
19:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
19:50 < bridge> <APFFF> It would be the first mod feature which could potentially give yourself an advantage instead of only "punishing"  others
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but as soon as it is abused (e.g. to steal a r1) it cannot be undone
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rank can only be deleted
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not a huge fan of giving any rcon user including admins any ability to modify gameplay directly at all. There is a reason even the admins can't enable test commands in a release build after server start. (I know we technically can but it's the principle rather than the practical)

20:51 < bridge> <APFFF> tbf, thats all the code does :justatest: I didnt know until i looked in the code tho. maybe adding it to the command description would help some
20:53 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, would be useful to explain this in the description
20:54 < bridge> <APFFF> wb `spectate_recent`. When I spectate someone else, I often want to check out parts of the map in free view, then switch back to spectating that particular player
21:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure it's worth the added complexity, seems alright without saving and restoring Multi View

22:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> unwrap_or_else() is goated change my mind
22:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> unwrap's shorter change my mind
22:26 < bridge> <sedonya> Yes, we are being attacked by bots, I don't know who is doing it. But since I'm not at home, only ninekeem can help, and he already knows about the attack
22:27 < bridge> <sedonya> One of the players took a screenshot
22:27 < bridge> <sedonya> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1264680209844797440/image.png?ex=669ec0ba&is=669d6f3a&hm=76ac9a0d96656c8c26694fe36bf6657360d77dbb57a63ac4c4f3ec1d99dc7f75&
22:28 < bridge> <sedonya> "adogit" appears to be a bot creator, his nickname is similar to the others, but 99.9% it's not his main nickname
22:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> nice emojis btw
22:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's cursed about it?
22:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont really understand `<BTreeMap<String, Expr> as IntoIterator>::IntoIter` part, maybe it's bad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
22:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that's fine
22:33 < bridge> <ninekeem> Turkey bots ddosed us. I already ban them. I hope…
22:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could also use `btree_map::IntoIter<String, Expr>`
22:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> why are they doing this
22:34 < bridge> <ninekeem> I don't know. I already met this about half year ago, but bots were on all TeeSports servers.
22:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> weird people
22:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that actually looks much nicer 😄
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why dont u make fields public
22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> half of my structs have public fields but sometimes something snaps in my head and im like "public - bad" and use private fields xd
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure public _can_ be bad.. but getters and setters (and intoiter here is kinda a getter) can be annoying and _bad_ too i guess
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on your goal i guess, if u fear someone modifies fields without any reason then yeah
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's my code so noone will change it =]
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks did you read this? xd
22:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks did you see this? xd
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah that sucks 😄
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u use a hashmap or what
22:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yup :gigachad:
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> linked hash map best
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> keeps order
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> keeps O(1) in avg case
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> haters gonna hate
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
22:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> performance for nerds, my goal is to make code run :justatest:
22:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> python has a that data structure by default
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> insert is kinda slow tho, must be said 😄
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least the crate i was using.. and slow ofc doesnt mean 10 times slower
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but slower than the std hashmap
22:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the std hashmap is already said to be slow
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> indexmap is next best
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but only keeps order in certain cases
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> delete will swap
22:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fxhashmap is a faster hashmap than the default AFAIK
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://pastebin.com/Ck0ZwzwX
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ignore `#access` for vec, i need a very special case... access by index is ofc almost instant
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and ofc these benchmarks are rather simple and dont reflect a real world example
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i especially like is that iterating is so fast
22:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you do https://docs.rs/rustc-hash/2.0.0/rustc_hash/type.FxHashMap.html ?
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> quite impressive but suffers similar stuff like hashmaps 
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://pastebin.com/7f2GCU2U
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but for normal hashmaps good replacement
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clone and clone_from are insane
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> almost on pair with vec
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least for few elements
23:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool. ty ❤️
23:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the rust compiler uses it internally
