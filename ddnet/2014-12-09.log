00:34 <@deen> Ah shit, my backtrace of a segfault is too big for the lua mailing list^^
03:01 < eeeee> g df
03:01 < eeeee> oops wrong terminal
03:30 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
03:31 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
11:09 < eeeee> so how does the hall of fame work?
11:09 < eeeee> do you have some scripts to extract the metadata like who's racing, time, map
11:09 < eeeee> and what generates the map preview .png?
11:10 < laxadedi> what do you mean by how does the hall of fame work oO ?
11:10 < laxadedi> map preview is made by hand. deen makes it afaik
11:10 < eeeee> hmm i see
11:10 < laxadedi> and if you wanna be on hall of fame
11:10 < eeeee> i thought maybe there are scripts to do all of that automatically
11:11 < laxadedi> extract map data is automatic
11:11 < laxadedi> except the preview :)
11:11 < laxadedi> but hall of fame isn't automatic at all
11:11 < eeeee> what about the nicknames
11:11 < laxadedi> players need to send us the demo of their rank if rules are respected
11:12 < laxadedi> that's my job to take the demo and put it on youtube
11:12 < laxadedi> http://ddnet.tw/halloffame/upload/
11:12 < laxadedi> you can see the rules there
11:12 < laxadedi> then deen has a script to add new video on the website
11:13 < eeeee> nice
11:13 < laxadedi> but all the demo to youtube is completely manual
11:13 < laxadedi> I am doing really simple work
11:13 < laxadedi> I take demo / exec script to remove chat + hide HUD etc / fraps it at 60 fps / encode it as mpg-4 with virtual dub / then upload it :)
13:33 <@deen> The map previews are the same as on http://ddnet.tw/ranks/novice/ and http://ddnet.tw/releases/ . I do indeed take a screenshot of each map by hand.
13:34 <@EastByte> unforunatly we do not have a tw software renderer
13:35 <@deen> that's not really the problem
13:35 <@deen> the problem is rather finding the most interesting position to screenshot
13:36 <@deen> and since I often find bugs in the map when taking the screenshot, it may be good that I take a final look on the map before release^^
13:38 <@deen> Hi map, mapper Maple
13:38 <@EastByte> ^^
13:38 < map> yop
13:38 < map> xd
13:39 < laxadedi> map: I have to say to you, I'll probably get mad if you/someone else send a new demo of careless :D
13:40 < map> blame skeith and mikey for fighting against eachother
13:40 <@deen> laxadedi: next time just wait a month or 2 before uploading the video
13:40 < laxadedi> Maybe make a run that isn't awful to watch lol
13:40 < map> xD
13:40 < laxadedi> easiest shortcut ever
13:40 < laxadedi> take 1 hour to make nearly perfect time
13:43 < map> but no one did it in team before
13:45 <@deen> laxadedi: you should wait a few weeks after the rank is done, I guess
13:46 <@deen> to prevent this kind of thing
13:46 < laxadedi> yeah I guess
13:48 < map> well
13:48 < map> mikey wanted to beat the time with me because he swa the video
14:02 < Savander> hi
14:03 <@deen> hi
14:43 <@deen> hm, the ipv6 support in the master server is not that good, is it?
14:44 <@deen> a server can't have an ipv4 and ipv6 address both registered?
14:45 <@deen> (I just noticed I have native ipv6 now)
14:51 <@heinrich5991> deen: the problem is probably the game server
14:51 <@heinrich5991> which only registers as one of it
14:52 <@heinrich5991> the master server should be able to cope with both
14:52 <@deen> heinrich5991: but then the client would see each server twice, right?
14:52 <@heinrich5991> if it supports both, yes
14:52 <@deen> i think instead a game server should say "I have this ipv4 and this ipv6 address"
14:53 <@deen> and the client can then connect to either of them
14:53 <@deen> but they're shown as one server
14:53 <@heinrich5991> it could even be a unique identifier that the server sends with the server info packet
14:53 <@heinrich5991> so the client can detect that there are two servers which represent the same
14:54 <@heinrich5991> that would work in LAN too
14:54 <@deen> right, need a solution for LAN as well because you see every server twice there as well
14:54 <@heinrich5991> (would need to be generated with request IP and secret salt)
14:54 <@deen> hm, still bad that the client has to ping every server twice
14:54 <@heinrich5991> right
14:54 <@deen> the traffic of serverbrowser is already pretty high
14:55 <@heinrich5991> it is made worse that by the fact that it can only do full refreshs
14:55 <@heinrich5991> -that
14:56 <@deen> hm, don't even have an ipv6 address on GER i think =/
14:56 <@deen> wanted to test if my ping also jumps to 120 on ipv6
14:59 <@deen> also, favorites don't work in client with ipv6 addresses iirc
14:59 <@deen> may just be ddnet client, no idea
15:03 <@deen> oh nice, to ddnet RUS with ipv4: 90ms, ipv6: 70ms
15:04 <@deen> and more stable
15:06 <@deen> pretty sad that RUS is the only server where we have ipv6
15:20 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
15:21 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
16:55 <@deen> Hm, I have access to an HPC cluster and would really like to run fuzzing there :P
16:55 <@deen> would be so much faster with a few thousand modern cpus
16:56 <@deen> Some fuzzes took over a day to get any interesting results
17:04 < Nicos> deen are you in?
17:06 < Nicos> Is someone in ?
17:16 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
17:17 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
17:58 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
17:59 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
18:41 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
18:42 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
18:53 <@EastByte> awesome party gores sprinlobe
18:53 <@EastByte> springlobe*
19:55 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:55 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 496
19:55 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
20:22 < Nimda> Next Grey by Themix just released on Moderate at 2014-12-09 20:20
20:41 <@deen> Next segfault reported, this time in the rather popular libfreetype =)
20:42 <@EastByte> nice
20:42 <@deen> strange that no one found it before, has been fuzzed extensively
20:43 <@heinrich5991> isn't fuzzing random?
20:43 <@deen> it's not that easy to get fonts in all the 15 or so formats freetype speaks
20:43 <@deen> heinrich5991: depends on the fuzzer, afl-fuzz is deterministic I think
20:43 <@deen> (at least in the start)
20:44 <@deen> (ok, only in the start)
20:44 <@heinrich5991> well, if only then you probably only fouznd that by chance
20:44 <@deen> anyway, I found it after 15 min of fuzzing
20:44 <@deen> and after fuzzing for a few days you notice that no new paths in the program are traversed, so you're unlikely to find anything interesting
20:46 <@deen> ah, and starting out with interesting minimal examples is important for fuzzing
20:46 <@deen> took me quite some time to create small fonts in all formats
20:57 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
20:58 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
20:59 <@deen> Now logging pings to a few more servers: http://ddnet.tw/ping/
20:59 <@deen> also ping looks a bit more stable (switched TOS to LOWDELAY at 17:00)
21:00 <@deen> (at least on GER2 and EUR)
21:55 < eeeee> wow i didn't know TOS actually does something
21:56 < eeeee> thought everyone was just ignoring it
22:03 <@deen> eeeee: I think that's just my local fritzbox preferring TOS lowdelay
22:03 <@deen> (router)
22:12 < eeeee> not sure how would that work, you gotta have some traffic shaping in place to implement such priorities
22:13 <@deen> what would be the problem with that?
22:13 <@deen> I used to do that with my openbsd router a few years ago, so wouldn't wonder if commercial routers do this as well
22:14 < eeeee> but you'd have know exactly what is your uplink bandwidth and it better be stable
22:15 <@deen> never seen my bandwidth change by any bit
22:15 <@deen> totally stable
22:16 < eeeee> e.g. here some isps would sell you 10mbit bandwidth but then let you burst for like up to 20mbits for the first megabyte of http session
22:16 < eeeee> to make their internet appear faster
22:16 <@deen> wow
