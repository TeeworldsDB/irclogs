00:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> R u south or north
00:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am driving back north now. So I'm fleeing from u xD
01:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> Nurrr im southeast :feelsbadman:
01:12 < bridge> <zenyrelax> everyone come london
01:18 < bridge> <deathgood> not planning to get stabbed tonight
01:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> They need to renew their licenses for 2025 first so you're pretty safe at the moment

06:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> `itsabot` official soundpack!
06:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> You may use any of these sounds for your own client/skins, but it is reccomended that if you are to share any skins/clients you have, I should be credited somewhere. Thanks!
06:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1323887185149296650/itsabot.zip?ex=67762585&is=6774d405&hm=7a1adcd833b5f18b251c08e6a6cd041dcdea58a461808a1c1497be6b12ae2361&
06:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> (I changed the jumping sounds so they sound better)
07:53 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :brownbear:
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh wow voxel. Your rename confused me xd
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki happy new year.
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you generally plan to finish the CI pr or should I overtake. Because I guess I really need a CI so at least all features always compile üòÑ
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 can u give me access to ddnet-rs? can't change settings there xd
12:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like I don't have access either
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh
12:28 < bridge> <louis> @tsfreddie do you know if jetpack gun works on capture servers?
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @0xdeen when make robyte ddnet owner so he can give me access üòÑ
12:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> should be
12:28 < bridge> <louis> it doesnt seem to work
12:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkaStop:
12:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
12:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> let me check
12:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
12:28 < bridge> <robyt3> I can edit settings of the others repos though
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can too, for ddnet
12:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably must be granted for each individually
12:29 < bridge> <0xdeen> @gummibaer12345 Thanks!
12:29 < bridge> <gummibaer12345> ‚ù§Ô∏è
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> Oh right it's new years
12:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like you can't get it or it doesn't jetpack after you get it
12:30 < bridge> <louis> it won't jetpack, but it'll shoot fast
12:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok let me check
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon when copyright year update prs?
12:33 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Do you remember the reason that the "HID device manager" is manually disabled in the Android build?
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I remember I had trouble with it, but not which trouble.
12:34 < bridge> <robyt3> I see. Maybe that's what's causing issues with bluetooth mice for some players though
12:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> looks like i disabled a lot of weapon code. i'll uncomment those and check why i did that. hopefully i was just being too cautious
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Does it compile if you leave it active?
12:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Should probably upgrade to SDL3 at some point :justatest:
12:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll try if it works on my phone, should compile since we just commented out one line of code before
12:37 < bridge> <louis> ah okay
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon check this out https://github.com/louis-e/arnis
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Ok, it crashes with linkage error, we'd probably need to compile SDL with HID support or add another SDL library
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki stop ignore, i know u awake üòÇ
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> overtake xd
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt get the ping i think xd
13:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> pushed to https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/MomentCap
13:05 < bridge> <louis> tysm! @0xdeen  ^
13:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> also check this for reference https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/MomentCap/blob/main/build/autoexec_server.cfg
13:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> finally changed the 20:22 score
13:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks @tsfreddie ! @louis.place running
13:09 < bridge> <oxyzo.> where is louis running
13:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> away from all the haters„Éæ( -,-)„Çû
13:12 < bridge> <0xdeen> @tsfreddie MomentCap also doesn't support http registration, right?
13:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye it was too old
13:13 < bridge> <0xdeen> the old protocol doesn't work with ger1's dos protection :/
13:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
13:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> how do i add it
13:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i never figured out what changes need to be made for http reg
13:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> mostly this PR: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5064
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> I think that PR is fairly clean
13:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> We can also wait if Davide can help me, but no response so far
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> You may want to diff the register.cpp with the newest one, just to skim for any issues
13:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok
13:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> momentcap doesn't even have http
13:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> let's maybe wait for Davide, seems easier
14:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i said i was renaming in your server
14:04 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> nameless tee joined
14:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> brainless tee
14:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> @blaiszephyr Thanks!
14:40 < bridge> <oxyzo.> melon you are spared from being eaten!! for now
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki interesting. There is this huuge project where they build the entire world in MC by hand. Seems to be made almost irrelevant by this tool.
14:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> :heartw: :giftee:
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah, but in first moment I was like, who is that guy and why does he improve Voxels skin xD
15:05 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gm Ewan
15:07 < bridge> <Ewan> how's it going
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quite fine, how bout u? how was your start into the new year
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> stupid
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i woke up for some work thing that i thought i had to do today
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but i couldnt get into email inbox
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> so im just up for little reason
15:11 < bridge> <Ewan> how is ur new year so far
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in germany the 1st januar is a holiday so i am relaxed as can be
15:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yea nice
15:14 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
15:14 < bridge> <Ewan> it might not be today
15:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but i can't check my calendar cuz it's
15:14 < bridge> <Ewan> on that email
15:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i may have gotten up for nothing
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> cam
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> can't find helpdesk info
15:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i have been thinking of buying a monitor
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm still with only one, can't complain
15:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> Lol Louis so sassy, I'll donate 2 more when I'm home :xd:
15:21 < bridge> <Ewan> 1 is good
15:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> cant wait for ppl to make a better ddnet-rs skin than i ever will in my life
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who should do that?
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe louis bcs he is sound designer
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe insanity or ravie bcs they are good artists too xd
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or some random chinese that pops up and just delivers xDD
17:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> dude we should convince a sound designer somewhere to make new sounds for ddnet
17:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like an actual sound for picking up a laser gun
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ikr
18:14 < bridge> <itom6176> Is it hard to implement a Weapon tele to delay? Or a switch for weapon tele to? Would be a nice feature for some map concepts
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> protondb has come a far way
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> im playing gta 5 on gentoo and i have like 180 fps
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> on max
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i have vsync on idk
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> proton has come a far way
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also loads rly fast
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've better fps on linux than windows in gta xd
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess generally it's not hard, but doing it well enough that it does not have glitches is maybe
18:31 < bridge> <itom6176> Oki. Would love to see it sometime^^
21:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> add_sqlserver    s['r'|'w'] s[Database] s[Prefix] s[User] s[Password] s[IP] i[Port] ?i[SetUpDatabase ?]
21:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
21:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> guys how to use that pls
21:47 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like what is prefix and setupdatabase
22:02 < bridge> <zwelf2> prefix should always be "record". setup database should be 1 to create the tables on first use. Only relevant if you want to use mysql server. If you are hosting all servers on one computer sqlite is enough and easier. (As you need to configure mysql first).
22:03 < bridge> <zwelf2> prefix doesn't matter and is best set to "record". setup database should be 1 to create the tables on first use. Only relevant if you want to use mysql server. If you are hosting all servers on one computer sqlite is enough and easier. (As you need to configure mysql first).
22:03 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like i already used .sqlite file but now i wanna host server on different VPS
22:03 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
22:03 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and i don't know how it works, shall i send you mp my config line ?
22:04 < bridge> <zwelf2> multiple vps  or still one vps?
22:04 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> multiple
22:04 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> tomorrow it will be multiple but actually it's one
22:07 < bridge> <zwelf2> if it will be one in the future just moving the ddnet-server.sqlite file to the new location is best to move all ranks there.
22:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> it will be multiple in the futur
22:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> e
22:07 < bridge> <zwelf2> In case if multiple in future, this is how mysql is setup: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/658b13939515263d53d93792b188eae4c77579e7/.github/workflows/build.yml#L68-L71
22:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okk thx
22:07 < bridge> <zwelf2> In case if multiple in future, this is how mysql is setup mysql: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/658b13939515263d53d93792b188eae4c77579e7/.github/workflows/build.yml#L68-L71
22:11 < bridge> <zwelf2> The tool that extracts ranks from the failover sqlite database when mysql is not reachable contains some information on how to switch from sqlite to mysql: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/658b13939515263d53d93792b188eae4c77579e7/scripts/move_sqlite.py#L126-L128

22:13 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i did that actually but
22:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> the line looks like that when completed ?
22:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> add_sqlserver w ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303
22:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ```add_sqlserver w ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303```
22:14 < bridge> <zwelf2> looks good. also need the same line with `r`
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ohhh really ?
22:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> looks good. but also need the same line with `r`
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i didn't knew
22:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> ```
22:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> add_sqlserver r ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303
22:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> add_sqlserver w ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303
22:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> ```
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okeyyy thanks
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> sv_use_sql 1 
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i need this ?
22:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> yes
22:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ok
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> so to use sql
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i need 
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> add_sqlserver r ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> add_sqlserver w ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
22:16 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> sv_use_sql 1
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> ah, and also append 1 for crating the tables (on the first run)
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> 
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> ```
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> sv_use_sql 1
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> add_sqlserver r ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> add_sqlserver w ddnet_server record ddnet 'thebestpassword' 121.0.0.1 3303 1
22:17 < bridge> <zwelf2> ```
22:18 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but if i already had a .sqlite and i converted it
22:18 < bridge> <zwelf2> single quotes might not work. Need to use double quotes or just choose an alphanumerical password and not use quotes at all in the config
22:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> d'accord
22:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey*
22:19 < bridge> <zwelf2> ah, then should be fine. It's just for crating all tables if they don't exist yet.
22:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey they already exist then
22:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> thx
22:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i will try the double quotes
22:32 < bridge> <zwelf2> @nayzox_tw Btw if you manage to set it up, it would be really great if you could document the necessary steps somewhere, e.g. a new page on https://wiki.ddnet.org ("Setting up DDNet-Server with MySQL" or similar)
22:32 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> humm ok
22:34 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but rn i am still trying to make everything works
22:54 < bridge> <0xdeen> @destoros Thank you!
23:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i still havent figured out the issue, i got so fed up with it that im compiling teeworlds 0.6 now and checking if the client still sends the info packet twice xD
23:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> great now i have to debug why nothing is being printed to the console
23:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> ahh got it
23:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 2025-01-01 22:23:36 I server: can't add MySQL server: compiled without MySQL support
23:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 2025-01-01 22:23:36 I server: can't add MySQL server: compiled without MySQL support
23:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
23:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> this means that my server can't use mysql right ?
23:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes
23:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> you need to compile it yourself with -DMYSQL=ON
23:28 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> rahhhhh
23:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey thx
