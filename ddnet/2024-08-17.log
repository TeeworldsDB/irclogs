02:08 < bridge> <zhn> im visiting heinrich's archive quite often though
02:08 < bridge> <zhn> although it timeouts me everytime xd
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> timeout?
02:22 < bridge> <zhn> ye
02:22 < bridge> <zhn> > Connection timed out
02:22 < bridge> <zhn> everytime
02:22 < bridge> <zhn> i can't access it both from mobile and home network
02:22 < bridge> <zhn> using vpn for tis
02:22 < bridge> <zhn> using vpn for this
02:23 < bridge> <zhn> here
02:24 < bridge> <zhn> does it use cloudflare or anything that can filter me out huh

13:03 < bridge> <zhn> so how can it happen xd

14:03 < bridge> <zinssi> why is that  happening i get black screen and this error and the game close
14:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @jupeyy_keks
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn idk how the master works but yes i assume the master has the up to date version. But the client is not spam requesting the entire servers.json fast enough to see blinking colors
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you would have to manually reload the server list
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mid game or when?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> usually this means your GPU has not enough energy, or isn't properly put into the motherboard
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or it's caused outside of ddnet
14:07 < bridge> <zinssi> mid game yes
14:07 < bridge> <zinssi> but it only happens in chill
14:07 < bridge> <zinssi> if i play gores it doenst happen
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> any custom assets?
14:07 < bridge> <zinssi> and only in this game if i play apex or somethings else it doenst happen
14:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> can the entities be corrupted?
14:08 < bridge> <zinssi> idk just downloaded a few
14:08 < bridge> <zhn> it can be distracting anyway
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no i just want to make sure that it's not some hidden error bcs of out of memory  that windows just kills it or smth
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and does it always crash when you at that map?
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like 100%
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not random
14:09 < bridge> <zinssi> yes only at that map
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its fat map
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's not the question
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it always crash at the same spot
14:09 < bridge> <zinssi> not at the same spot jsut random
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh, if you want, try to use a clean ddnet, and see if it crashes there too
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also try to limit fps
14:11 < bridge> <zinssi> manchmal wenn mein game abstürtzt dann is so so krass das ich eine fehlermeldung von windowns bekomme wo dieser blaue bildschirm ist ich dneke du weißt was ich meine und dann startet sich mein pc neu
14:12 < bridge> <zinssi> Sometimes when my game crashes it's so bad that I get an error message from Windows where this blue screen is, I think you know what I mean and then my PC restarts
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok but that just confirms that it's a problem with your setup
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a game cannot crash windows to bluescreen
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (in theory)
14:13 < bridge> <zinssi> it happens on steam ddnet and ddnet in internet download
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try to open your pc, clean it from dust
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> unplug your GPU
14:13 < bridge> <zinssi> and only fokko map no other map no other game
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clean all contacts
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> put it in again
14:13 < bridge> <zinssi> it must be ddnet problem
14:14 < bridge> <zinssi> okay i do
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> again, a game cannot cause a bluescreen
14:14 < bridge> <itube.> he wont clean the contacts he will detroy them
14:14 < bridge> <avolicious> I tried to run ChillerDragons #8751 but I do get

14:15 < bridge> <patiga> did you install the python module today or yesterday?
14:15 < bridge> <avolicious> today
14:15 < bridge> <avolicious> 15 minutes ago
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no did i break it?
14:16 < bridge> <patiga> looks like the typing stuff broke it in some way
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> python infrastructure is so complicated
14:16 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> when is there gonna be .7 skin saving
14:17 < bridge> <patiga> @avolicious for a quick fix, you could download the twmap version 0.5.0 with pip
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or ``:>/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/twmap/__init__.py`` <:justatest:572499997178986510>
14:17 < bridge> <patiga> `pip install --force-reinstall -v "twmap==0.5.0"`
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it includes the types instead of the .so?
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723897219.png
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak is a abi3.so

14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @zinssi ping me if you tried and it didn't work, i am curious about it 😄
14:25 < bridge> <avolicious> Atleast with the current 0.6 maps

14:25 < bridge> <avolicious> I can run it against 0.7 maps too if you want

14:28 < bridge> <patiga> @avolicious once the 0.6.0 version is fixed, it will go through all maps much faster, you can expect a speedup between x2.5 and x3 :D
14:28 < bridge> <avolicious> But I guess its because we use an old version of convert_map?
14:28 < bridge> <patiga> some of those errors look cursed
14:29 < bridge> <patiga> I hope that is the issue 😅
14:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so the old working version had this https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723897734.png
14:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is now overwritten by https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-py/-/blob/master/twmap/__init__.py?ref_type=heads
14:29 < bridge> <patiga> that is only for windows I think, its a abstract interface for python version 3, which packages can use to be compatible with all 3.x versions
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i nuke the __init__.py in the old version it breaks for me on debian with a python3 venv
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or did you reply to abi3.so
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> abi3.so
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea not sure how to fully test this. How hard is it to setup the package thing you do?
14:33 < bridge> <patiga> I use maturin https://github.com/PyO3/maturin
14:34 < bridge> <patiga> @avolicious are you on windows or linux?
14:34 < bridge> <avolicious> linux
14:35 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: looks like `maturin develop` is what you want, or `maturin build`
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no tokens needed?
14:35 < bridge> <patiga> no, you can do it locally
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah nice
14:36 < bridge> <patiga> https://github.com/PyO3/maturin?#usage
14:37 < bridge> <patiga> maturin is in the arch package repos, you can also install it with pip
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea ``maturin develop`` just worked but the whole thing is so annoying to work with i will rq for now sorry
15:01 < bridge> <patiga> unlucky, what part of it is annoying tho? maturin or the typing stuff?
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe a external ``twmap-stubs`` package would be cleaner not sure
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga the python part xd
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its just so many options for everything
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fix one break the other
15:01 < bridge> <patiga> sounds hella annoying
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never know if it picks stuff from my system install or from the local maturin install or from the local folder because im in the twmap directory and the files are there
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my lsp picks up types different than mypy
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when the python runtime works the type hints dont
15:04 < bridge> <patiga> I typically ensure I have no system install of twmap, and in the twmap directory it can't take the local compiled thing unless you symlink it from the target directory
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had some setup that worked for everything by installing the .so and the .pyi files into python path manually xd and hoped if maturin packages it it will also just work
15:04 < bridge> <patiga> so that the twmap must be from the virtual env
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye so i gotta break the works for me setup which lets me run and get type hints globally currently
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too late for such stunts
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this will probably take me some time I would recommend deleting the twmap/ directory and doing a release that works
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If i had known that i dont need a token for maturin i would have tested it my self. Sorry everything broke :c 
15:08 < bridge> <patiga> np, I'll dabble a little as well before I revert the typing
15:08 < bridge> <patiga> coz proper type hints would really be amazing
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh boi they are
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it fully replaced the docs for me
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im 10x map scripter now
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga ever heard of https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/enum.BufferBindingType.html#variant.Storage
15:54 < bridge> <patiga> heard of yea, used it no
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aren't those simply shader buffer storages?
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aren't they the perfect use case for twgpu actually
15:54 < bridge> <patiga> how so?
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> I think they are in particular for writing stuff from the shader
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> for compute stuff
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> because you simply want 2 bytes in an array.
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and they have no limit like textures
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they can be used readonly
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> hm that does sound appealing
15:56 < bridge> <patiga> any downside? o.o
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i already thought about using them a while ago, but they are opengl 4.3 core:
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Shader_Storage_Buffer_Object
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am surprised wgpu has them
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i thought they are opengl 3.3 compatible 😄
15:56 < bridge> <patiga> sometimes with workarounds
16:00 < bridge> <patiga> the only other change which this requires it telling the shader the width of the tilemap, to get from x, y to the index
16:00 < bridge> <patiga> but that should ofc not be an issue

23:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u picked the one below
23:48 < bridge> <Bota> I picked those 2 files
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just pick the correct one
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://drivers.amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-24.7.1-win10-win11-july19-rdna.exe
23:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well doesnt work directly
23:49 < bridge> <Bota> i can try ig
23:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why do they even have that for customer gpus on their download page xD
23:50 < bridge> <Bota> Im almost certain that adrenalin will fix it. It says recommended bcs amd wants it
23:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, most likely
23:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> still weird design choice from amd
23:51 < bridge> <Bota> will not*
23:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ? xD
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1274485912688136243/image.png?ex=66c26d00&is=66c11b80&hm=3c44657895f96eeebbb481e5a7b76e560f5e93dc9eee77a6a8942447551f17f7&
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the pro drivers are ass old
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not even recommended
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply dont use them
23:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @alex0006 i dunno if you didnt notice, but you don't have adrenalin edition
23:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^
23:55 < bridge> <Bota> it helped. I didnt get it bcs i was scared to be forced to use their adrenalin software itself. i was able to just install drivers
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's the problem with adrenalin?
23:56 < bridge> <Bota> its pure bloat
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just wondering
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has an updater included
23:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah your choice
23:57 < bridge> <Bota> I can start the game again, thanks
