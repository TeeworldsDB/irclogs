07:42 <+Learath2> did we ever apply as a gsoc project? we could use some free engineering talent :P
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Learath2: I did a few gsoc applications for Nim, never with any success. So I guess there would be even less of a chance for DDNet
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> defs doesn't look worse XD

10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fuken nodejs
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª is that the current state?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that is the option to add an icon font
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the font manager is finished i think
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i have to select the text i want to buffer
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and since the current gui is really unbufferable i will only add this for things where alot of text is rendered
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/420513920697237514/unknown.png
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can't get a full resolution pic sadly
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that's pretty much scrolling thorugh the server browser and showall on the 2 fullest servers currently
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks like the matrix in red xD
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ™‚
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "the current gui is (really) unbufferable"
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well its always streamed
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like these vsplit and stuff
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pretty much i dont see a chance other than rewriting it
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i wont do it, because thats boring xD
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for the console, remote console, server browser and ingame chat it might not be too hard, dunno, i never looked into them, but i hope it's not too much work
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then 50% of the text is already buffered probably
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª would it be possible to put the currently displayed texts into a hashmap, and just use that as cache in case nothing changes?
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well probably, but the question might be if that doesnt waste even more cpu time
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also its hard to tell when to delete text then
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean nobody will ever get RAM issues by that bit of text
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's not rendered in a tick
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then throw it out
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or mark it for "potential deletion" or whatever
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if that'd work
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just me speaking with little experience
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but isn't currently the CPU the bottleneck already?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i just dunno if building the quads is more expensive than building and searching the hashes every tick
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hashmaps are supposed to be fast ðŸ™‚
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well 1. we would need a hashing algorithm with less conflicts, that hasing algorithm probably is already slow in converting the text into hash
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2. hashmaps are fast when the dataset is huge(like if you really are smth like a search engine)
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the font manager basically also just processes the characters and builds the quads
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah theoretically it might be a bit faster, hard to tell
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but there is another problem
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if we have 2 same strings, used at a different location in the program, it will blur one of them
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> because the orthographic matrix will only know the current size
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and the quads are build by that size
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so if it changes, it will scale the quads wrongly
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but ofc we could just save the current screen state
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the end it's just the question of how much arrays we get xD
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1. the font
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2. the font size
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3. the screen state
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 4. the hash
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> put all of that into the hash ðŸ˜‰
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well or allow multiple key entries for one hash
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh yeah could work xD
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the main goal defs is rewriting text rendering in the gui
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> because then no cpu time is wasted
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> What problem are you trying to solve?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> The main bottleneck for text rendering appears to be glyph rasterization, texture updates (possible GPU stalls) and/or switching atlases betweeen calls
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the main issue is that cpu time is wasted by building the quads, and additionally sometimes uploading new glyhps
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont solve issues, i already solved them
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let's just remove all the gui, render a chromium over the main window, and use react native to build the ui
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let's just remove all the gui, render a chromium over the main window, and use react native web to build the ui
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the end the gui performance doenst really matter tbh, only thing that is tragic is anything rendered ingame( the chat and statsboard or similar )
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if the rest performance at @deen 's 10 FPS GPU with 10FPS instead of 80FPS then idc xd
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if the rest performce at @deen 's 10 FPS GPU with 10FPS instead of 80FPS then idc xd
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually did want to investigate if it'd be feasible to build the ui in a similar way to the way modern web pages are built, only re-rendering on change and stuff
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just a ridiculous amount of work for no benefit at all tho
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes exactly that
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i did something similar for my game engine
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i spent like 2 weeks for simple shit
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant believe
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª does the approach you are currently working on help with the CJK rendering?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> currently cjk text in the gui really lags the client while it's rendering
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is something wrong with it?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh how? like the performance or what?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> choose japanese language, restart client, join server check serverinfo
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have a fast pc
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i can try
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even I notice it with my beast of a machine ðŸ˜›
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it takes a couple seconds to render the stuff in the scoreboard too with CJK languages
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but once its rendered its fine
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah ofc
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the scoreboard coming up with a 3 second delay looks funny
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs a freetype issue
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> was thinking of some async rendering, like pre-allocate some space to render out the text to and not block
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in CJK the concept of a "glyph" doesn't really make sense iirc
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> are you under windows?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also could work around it by maybe rendering out all the text used in the ui while loading the client
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm on linux
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my new renderer seems fine
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with that font
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or its cached from the other client
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs have to restart pc to test
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it even possible to have it cached from before a restart
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah all fine
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt it unless freetype had some black magic incorperated to talk to ogl
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> after restarting
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no delay at all
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is this on master or the font stuff you are working on?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my stuff
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you do have the delay with master right?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and i currently cant commit because i didnt change branch after making the pr on ddnet github
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes with master its extreme
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great \o/
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably this is what @cinaera said about the rasterazation
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since that doesnt exist anymore
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt need to wait for the gpu the whole time
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We might have to make some compromises to reproduce some of the old behaviour with opengl if we want to make it the default renderer sometime
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh no
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some maps really do look ridiculous with open gl
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it will also work with old gl
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i changed the text renderer to work with both
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah yeah didn't mean in that context
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant in the general context, if we want ogl3 to be the default renderer we'll need to make sure all maps look as they did or atleast acceptable
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> because of the border fix bug?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs was just a bad idea to stay at the old renderer, instead of the 0.7 vanilla one
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> because that fixed the things too
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there are a couple maps that can easily make me nauseaus
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just because of the mipmap level?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not really sure what is causing it but there was that one blue map someone reported, moving around it feels reaally off
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it also appears on old GL with 2k screen
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's just because the texture is really shitty
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you remember the map name?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the issue is probs still open
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Piranha
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah pretty sure on 2k screen it looks same glitchy
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and thats because on 2k the texel offsets are randomly luckly correct xD
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have a 1080p screen to look at it on
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i could imagine on 60hertz its even more horrible
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well that only leaves borders, I guess we could live with those, or maybe apply some batch processing to fix old maps assets
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but on ~144 it just looks like it was somehow downscalled to 60heartz
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think deens has 4k screen
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he can test at 1440p
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my screen is 1440p
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah thats what i mean with 2k
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its just easier to write then 1.4k xd
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> jk
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have a 144hz one tho
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but doesnt it look weird on old renderer then too?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for me it certainly does
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fokkunaut just tested it with his 720p monitor where the texel offsets are wrong causing bluring
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then the effect ist that huge
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then the effect isn't that huge
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it happens with the old renderer too yeah, you are right
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on some maps i have really low fps in entities with opengl
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that map is really a health hazard
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs of arrows probs
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> opengl 3 buffers the entity text
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or when there are many teleporters
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so try them with opengl3..
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> teleporters = low fps?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but opengl3 suffers under the current gui xD
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> teleporter text
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean the numbers on them
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1-255
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ˜¦
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they are rendered text
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> are you fixing that?
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and text is slow as u see in the disscussion above xD
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its fixed already
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the problem opengl3 isnt standard is a problem with streaming vertices
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and i am trying to fix that for all ingame components
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so weaker pcs can atleast run on a level as before and have the benefits of better zooming and entity text rendering
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª apparently @CrashtimeHD has the weird effect on piranha with ogl3 but doesn't without
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he tested it on a 1080p 144hz monitor
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah the texel offsets
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the caluclation that was used is random
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for some resolution it fits for tothjers it kills borders
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª is the border issue something you could easily make into a toggle?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not really tbh, it would require another shader using the same texel calculation as the old renderer, but performing that on the gpu is probably not as fast because GPU cores are pretty slow
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we could roll out ogl3 earlier and toggle the proper border behaviour when we have thought about fixing the old assets
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that should really only affect a few maps
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i play on 2k since along, and this Piranha is pretty much the only map that looks strange
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well huge blocks of freeze have "dots" in the middle now
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats intended
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> look in the entites
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's acutally on the texture
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/420547304102297601/unknown.png
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u never saw it because the texel calculation was so bad
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but actually its some kind of grid
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and pretty useful too xD
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh true, I forgot we already talked about this
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sry, way too early in the morning to be thinking
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> some other topic, when i look at client problems in the forum there were alot of "mouse is laggy" things, have they all fixed these problems
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my current pr i already mentioned that a friend had mouse laggs too because of the incorrect update times for cl_refresh_rate's default value
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wonder if some ppl might encountered exactly that issue, but they either stay with ddnet9 or it was the old mouse input appearently
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª never figured it out tbh, everyone feels different about the mouse

15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, show me (or another dev) how to make it run and we can run the client in debug build in a debugger and fix the issues
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut could you create an issue? ðŸ˜‰
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i thought only one blocker server has this feature o.O
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> FruchtiHD is working on some adventure stuff
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it would be cool. this way there could be *real* secret areas like in this case an adventure. if you see an adventure map now you can just spoinler yourself everything.

18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sry ðŸ˜¦
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no worries, just found it funny
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait wait
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> Adds the commands name_ban, name_unban and name_bans. Kicks
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> players who join using a banned name and doesn't allow ingame players to
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> change their names to the banned ones.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is the exact same shit i added to my server a couple weeks ago
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> even down to the names of the commands
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤”
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I pondered using `ban_name` but it didn't have a good equivalent of `bans`
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby also, I bet your shit is not as fancy as mine ðŸ˜›
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> correct
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does urs save in a file tho
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's supposed to be in the config file right now
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ‘Ž
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but good idea for the future
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we should keep it as a config file, I like that we just have one file format
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and we already have ways of deploying them easily like `exec`
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but then it will work like bans currently do and ull have to manually add them to the cfg if u want them to stay?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that sux
18:43 <+Learath2> it's a thousand times simpler then implementing a whole new file format, adding commands to load/reload it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How to debug windows?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on windows?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fokkonaut's client crash only happens on windows
18:50 <+Learath2> visual studio?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't have windows
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I have wine
18:50 <+Learath2> mingw gdb maybe?
18:51 <+Learath2> I used to use gdb for a while, it works decent enough
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How to set CXXFLAGS with cmake?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I need -gstabs
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> set it before the first cmake run

19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gfx_asyncrender_old 0 doesn't help
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, "this=(nil)"
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> does that mean CMapSounds object is nullptr or pLayer is?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> sure
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> (I would say CMapSounds)
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `CGameClient=0x6` sounds like a `nullptr+6`, too
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh.. but why `0x6`
19:23 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1069: Ignore another file generated in build directories (master...pr_ddnet_gitignore_cmake_add) https://git.io/vAdgl
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> any solutions?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut  you said only with ghost?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fruchti said the problem is the ghost. since he made a ddnet client edit and completely removed ghost out of it (bcs he said its always kind of active even when its off) and this client works
19:27 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1070: Fix build with `-DCLIENT=OFF` on macOS (master...pr_ddnet_cmake_mac_without_client) https://git.io/vAdg9
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh, i can't get gdb/winedbg working
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe because of multithreading
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gdb works with win32
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but both thisand pLayer look fine
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and still segfaults
20:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: you were talking about rewriting ddnet in rust?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will be like
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "unsafe" function here unsafe funtion there
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> classic rust
20:09 <@heinrich5991> nemo: all my teeworlds-related stuff is https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2
20:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> oh wow
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª the good thing is all the parts that can be in safe code ðŸ˜‰
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen what are u doin to crash the client
20:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: did you read kyren's AMA?
20:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> (her rust one)
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kyren? who's that?
20:11 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: oh. kyren is an awesome programmer who works for chucklefish which was a company created by tiyuri who did most of the hedgewars art
20:11 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: she mostly wrote starbound
20:11 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/78bowa/hey_this_is_kyren_from_chucklefish_we_make_and/
20:11 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: anyway. this was my fav comment of the AMA https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/78bowa/hey_this_is_kyren_from_chucklefish_we_make_and/dot6uxk/
20:12 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: mostly 'cause I had no idea that was the case either
20:12 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> also the sheer number of edits
20:14 <@heinrich5991> ah, I saw that one :D
20:14 <@heinrich5991> the comment
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª server switches map i think
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i tried with mingw but i cant crash it
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's only on one specific server
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> going through mapchange tele
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut can show you
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah nvm, its their closed source project xd
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i have it open in gdb now where it segfaulted, but everything looks good
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well maybe its the mingw version?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> jupeyy wanna test it yourself?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar âœª  wanna test it yourself?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> suddenly this is invalid pointer, this gdb/wine integration is driving me crazy
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well so or so heinrich has to be right it must have todo with the gameclient
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and that means very probably some buffer overflow
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vanilla works btw, dk if it helps ðŸ˜„
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably some use-after-free or so
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the question is if its on every compiler, then we could valgrind it probably
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if its just under mingw, dunno the tools for that
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well maybe u can valgrind over wine xD
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar âœª wanna try it?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i can give it a try
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the hour is over. have you started yet? ðŸ˜›
20:35 <@heinrich5991> nemo: very cool AMA
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so 10.8.5 is the one crashing appearently
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but 10.8.6 is working
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> according to fokkunaut
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and with ddnet 11.x i dont get any crashes neither vs nor mingw
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet 11 crashes for me on win
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh strange
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª everything self-compiled? or from ddnet.tw
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Both
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It just doesnt want to crash
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ooooooooooooooookay
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> valgrind --tool=memcheck doesn't report anything suspicious
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i managed it to crash ddnet 10.8.6 and another client by trying it 1000 times (xD) with pressing random stuff between the maps (so while the change). both client usually didnt crash but at one point they both crashed
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but those crashed 1 time from 1000 and ddnet 11.0.3 crashes like 999 of 1000
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there sth like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rr_(debugging) for windows?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Well vs provides dumps that can be loaded  at the crash point but dunno if it traces something
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What I figured out: The crash happens after loading the new map. this pointer on win32 was still fine, but CComponent part inside was broken, on win64 this pointer of CMapSounds was broken too
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i found a way (at leats for me) to reproduce the crash every time
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it may sound weird but you have to press "a, d, space, mouse1, mouse2 at the same time (just spam it)" and move your mouse in a circle
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it works for me xD
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> while going through the map-change?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the input is mem_copied over our data? ðŸ˜„
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Mhh probably just the input that can't be handled bcs of broken geclient
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Game*
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> guys try it out
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> spamming a, d space, mosue1, mosue2 + rotating mouse in a circle fast
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I do after the football match xd
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gl
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But would be strange if only mingw is affected
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not the first time to have win-only crashes
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen can you join?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what for?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> testi it, maybe it only affects me (which i dont think)
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, I can reproduce it already, no need
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but whats with 11.0.3? it crashes almost Always
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (havent tried that spam keys in vanilla Client)
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tried disabling ghost, race recorder, map sounds and playing around with controls input, nothing worked. I guess the next step would be to stop at the last state change and step through with the debugger to look if something suspicious is happening. But I give up for now
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give instructions on how to reproducibly crash the client, @deen ?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> @deen is there any other web to play teeworlds but not with just ddnet server?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> servers*
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, servers need support for that
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> aight
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compile with `-DWEBSOCKETS=ON`
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then ping someone with access to add you to teewebs
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> @heinrich5991 do you have any idea why it takes me so long to refresh the whole browser, for 10 minutes its stuck at 24%  and I have a good internet
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> AND the internet tab doesn't show servers at all, only Favorites
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> high packet loss?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me check
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> works fine for me
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> it works well for others but
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> I've had this for like 7 months lol
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> and HAD the same internet before too
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> + it worked pretty good, idk why it's shit now
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> it's annoying because I can't get to refresh all of the servers in a few minutes so I can follow anyone lol
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should get a https master server :/
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> that's why I asked if there's any web that shows all of the servers, so I can just check from there and then join
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> status in the ddnet page takes too long to refresh too
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> update* could be the right word
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there used to be a discord bot in the fng chat that pulled an updated master server list and posted it as pastebin so people could add them all to favorites and find servers even when the master was ddosed
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk what happened to it
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh that bot that spammed chat once a day xd
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ya great bot
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u should add it here
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> @jao
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <evil noby> videocall with me right now pussy
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :what:
