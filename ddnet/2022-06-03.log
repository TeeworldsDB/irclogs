00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> @Ryozuki is your vim ddnet setup on github? like linting and stuff
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nvim
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> okay i found a git repo
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use dyncam
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it is doomed on fng, i don't get why, you have more view range? so what
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it's considered to be cheating against professional players that don't use it
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragonwood> [suggestion] add a max ping filter for the server browser + hide servers with unresolved ping (CHN etc.). Reason: Ordering after ping and then players brings alot of useless/unplayable servers to the top of the list
06:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> there *used* to be a ping filter, but i don't know what happened with it
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Why does it say „ChillerDra…“ in the hud now and not „ChillerDragon“ -.-
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Your name is blacklisted
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> .\_.
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> its probably some unicode chopping off whatevery but i really feel like information gets lost
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654245299.png
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> ChillerDra!
10:41 <+MrGh0s7> yeah I agree. Clipping off names isn't/wasn't a good idea
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh well, we could revert it (again)
10:43 <+MrGh0s7> I'm curious though it should have occured to you what's the other side of the coin?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the max ping filter was removed because it caused servers to disappear entirely if you had a bad ping on them once
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the ping is only updated when you join the servers
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich when triangulate users ping to the tw server from the master server? By using maffs and ping from differnt masters to user and then from masters to the destinatin server :D
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> have a time and your name is fully displayed
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> we could not clipp names in mini score hud, if that would be prefered
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> we could not clip names in mini score hud, if that would be prefered
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they were probably displayed completely there before?
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> before the name overflowed to the lefft
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> before the name overflowed to the left
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> now we let the name begin to the left of the score box
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and clip it on the right side
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I think that overflow was intentional
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there wasn't a visible box that it overflowed, it just naturally extended to the left 🙂
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> It is still kind of strange that it overflows... does not fit to the score boxes... but yes we could revert the clipping for the mini score hud.
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean the box in the code? visually, there isn't really a box
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> visually it looks like it's supposed to extend to the left, for me
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I mean this box, since they are part of the same context... Even better would be to make the rounded rectangle around the name too.
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/982249095701876746/unknown.png
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes it is only a context box that is not drawn... but it is the same context
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I realize it's in the code
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the visuals look like it's intentional that there's no red box like you drew
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to me, at least
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that it's intended to overflow to the left
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @ChillerDragon  is this a team server with point counter?
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> there is vanilla score not ddrace but there are no teams as u can see by green instead of red dragon :)
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks Do I still need your patch? https://github.com/Jupeyy/drmingw/commit/08ab91c4897c04b5919d14fc2d7c21
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, tho currently we build without PIE
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the parser already relies on it xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could also extend it to print the client/server version 😄
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> /home/deen/isos/ddnet/win64/drmingw/tests/test_exchndl.h: In function ‘int main(int, char**)’:
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> /home/deen/isos/ddnet/win64/drmingw/tests/test_exchndl.h:90:16: error: too few arguments to function ‘void ExcHndlInit(void*)’
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>    90 |     ExcHndlInit();
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>       |     ~~~~~~~~~~~^~
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Doesn't build anymore
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there are 2 patches actually
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/Jupeyy/drmingw/commit/c04387280fa3c33e70cc083ff664edf07192278f
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/Jupeyy/drmingw/commit/e141208d915c3c107d037b06f28d307937121a49
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh ok
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> first is just disabling stuff
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now that i think about it @deen
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think LTO might have optimized the code lately
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> remember the issue with the "bad" function calls
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i assume LTO optmizes it too much
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, sounds plausible
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Like I said, everything breaks 😄
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> drmingw wasnt that helpful yet 😄
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> some kind of ubsan would probs be nicer, but dunno if the gcc ubsan trap has "big" runtime overhead
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be cool to test a crash with and without LTO, maybe we should disable it
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You are not supposed to ship/productively use asan/ubsan instrumented code
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well the gcc flag is added to not ship ubsan as a library
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html#:~:text=The%20%2Dfsanitize%2Dundefined%2Dtrap,usable%20even%20in%20freestanding%20environments
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if it doesnt have huge runtime overhead its just like some kind of assert i guess
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it generates an invalid instruction
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when you finish coding for ddnet

18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> git for map editor when
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> vanilla has already a editor history 😄 you could try to merge it with our editor
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought of it, because i read something here about colaborative map editing.
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> thats nice are the code bases far apart?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> they said they made it new from scratch so probably
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/tree/editor
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> the history feature or remade the whole editor?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> from scratch
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> see https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2486
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought before ddnet is kind of synced or based or whatever on newest teeworlds vanilla + ddnet code 😅 im funny
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCs3a3Uz8cw
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> On our facebook page... I would say our relationship is "complicated"
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i guess it's more apart than i thought. like the 0.7 what i dont knoebabout
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> anyway ill try out the vanilla editor.
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and ckeck out facebook
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> :bluekitty:
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I meant that with facebook as ajoke
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I meant that with facebook as a joke (I have not used facebook since ages)
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 🧐
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> for ddnet: ddnet insta when xd
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> 😅
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah it sad the dev time spend is not on the same client. It now tw vs ddnet and everyone does his own things.
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Was always wondering about clients based on ddnet with extra features. Why don't u just contribute to the original client
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ill keep my mouth shut about politics
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i mean i am a dev, but i am not contributing. 1 i am very unproductive, the only coding i did recently was projecteuler.net math problems xd
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> 2 i did this easy team colors feature, but wont just create a pr. but im just not getting into the other stuff. im not c++ savvy so refactoring or enhancing / expanding features is not an option.
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so ill just spam this channel 😅
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReZee.> we should be able to add time checkpoints by ourselves to optimise our speedruns ^^
