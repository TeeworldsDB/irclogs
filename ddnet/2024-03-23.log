00:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> robsti u wakey?
02:29 < bridge> <mazty> why u use spanish hahah
03:19 < bridge> <Ewan> because he’s spanish
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i just learned about gentoo profiles
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> apparently im at 17.1
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is some news about upgrading? isnt gentoo rolling
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> Profiles are for breaking changes that need manual intervention by the user to upgrade. Iirc 17.1 removed symlinking for lib64
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> im at 17.1
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> `eselect news` to read about it
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> im going to 23.0
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> Ah a new one
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye today
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> Well I haven't turned on my computer yet
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> the merged usr
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> but there is a unmerged one
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> also the bin packages
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> The news item will tell you how to upgrade
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo turning normie
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> jkjk
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah im doing it
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> rebuilding gcc
11:30 < bridge> <learath2> Looks like a boring update, just some new flags
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> for u?
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 why do i go from 17 to 23
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> what about 18 19 20 21 22
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> I don't remember how they were named
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it year based?
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> It might be the last 2 digits of the year when they were first created
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn profiles must be rare then
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i compiled gcc in 14 mins
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> holy moly
11:36 < bridge> <learath2> In a decade of using gentoo, I never had a mandatory profile upgrade
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> before i did 22
11:36 < bridge> <learath2> I only did one profile upgrade ever
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 but they say the deprecating old profiles
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 but they say they deprecating old profiles
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> In 2 years, but yeah just get it out of the way if you have some time
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> 1 year*
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> you know me
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i run on shiny new stuff
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> 😄
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw i discovered i cant run 4 dimm slots at 6000mhz
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if it runs at lower
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it wont boot
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can run with 2 dimm at 6000mhz
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its some limitation
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2x16gb
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it can work with 2x32gb
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> Idk anything at all about ddr past ddr3 😛
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> I'm stuck in the past
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> im at ddr5
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Ka9nt1tYU
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> I need to get a new laptop
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i gotta rebuild world
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
12:04 < bridge> <learath2> You don't HAVE to, but I can imagine it'd bother you forever 😄
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> well the steps mention it
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 16. Rebuild world:
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki>    emerge --ask --emptytree --getbinpkg @world
12:04 < bridge> <learath2> Oh damn, it's been a while since I saw a profile upgrade requiring a full rebuild
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz it moved lib folders probs
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1221052350064627762/image.png?ex=66112c9e&is=65feb79e&hm=14c4b57f73ed32a480ad1ea6af396749a8fb733507d2d42d822717a777f306b5&
12:06 < bridge> <learath2> I guess they want the new hardening flags in effect everywhere
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> Must be nice having a beast computer
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> I should get a new one sometime
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u get these new gen cpus
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> get just 2 ram sticks
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> at max u can
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why 4 sticks its a big problem and u need to tinker
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> with timings
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless u dont run the high speed
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> well idk its just my personal xp
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> apparently its not plug and play
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> its plug and pray
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> igot 6000mhz but the cpu theorically uses 5400 mhz iirc
12:10 < bridge> <learath2> Is it actually supported? I would be surprised if they said its supported but it isn't
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/159xoao/stable_128gb4x32gb_ddr56000_cl30_on_agesa_1007b/
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> look the work this guy did
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> to get this shit working
12:10 < bridge> <learath2> The problem is quite obvious. 6000MHz is an insane speed, I can imagine it's very very difficult to hit the timings at that speed
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye it hits some limits
12:11 < bridge> <learath2> However if they say it's supported, it's weird because those traces are laser tuned to be perfect
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > DDR5 6000 MT/s at dual channel = 96000 MiB/s or 93.75 GiB/s theoretical maximum memory bandwidth / speed. [ 3000 MHz DRAM clock speed * 2 (for double data rate or DDR) * 8 byte wide bus width (IMC to DRAM bus on x86-64 architecture) * 2 (if you're running dual channel) = 96000 MiB/s ]
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  Your DDR5-6000 setup brings read speed at ~83.45% and write at ~89.8% speed of the maximum possible bandwidth.
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Generally the effective (practical) speed should be close to around 92% to 98% of the 93.75 GiB/s, if not pretty close. But it isn't.
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Basically, the actual write speed of your setup is close to DDR5-5400 and read is close to DDR5-5000. It means there isn't any reason to run at DDR5-6000 if you're not getting any extra bandwidth over lower speed or significant latency improvement.
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I'm not familiar with Zen based systems, but it looks like there is bottleneck somewhere, either the IMC is not fast enough, or the cores of Zen 4 aren't fast enough for that DRAM speed, or may be the Aida64 has got some problem with Zen 4.
12:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Don't you get more throughput with 4 RAM sticks if CPU and MB support quad-channel?
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 4 DIMMs will always lose performance versus 2 on a dual channel system, it's a consequence of the IMC needing to handle multiple signals with different trace lengths (due to daisy chain). Particularly since these are 32gb DIMMs, ie dual-rank.
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never seen quad channel
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> Interesting
12:14 < bridge> <learath2> Oh it's 6000 MT/s not 6000 MHz clocked dram
12:14 < bridge> <learath2> I was a bit surprised at the insane speed 😄
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

12:15 < bridge> <learath2> High speed signaling is truly wizardry. The things that get important at those speeds are just so unintuitive
12:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got MSI X670E, 7900x3d and 2x16gb
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> the simple upgrade for me is to get 2x32
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont wanna bother with 4 sticks
12:16 < bridge> <learath2> Or run at 5600?
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk xd
12:17 < bridge> <robyt3> I got 2 sticks later than the others even though they are the same model, that probably explains why one stick sometimes doesn't get detected until I increase the voltage a bit :pepeW:
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never fiddled with voltages and stuff
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> im scared to break stuff xd

18:11 < bridge> <teero777> lol
18:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
18:12 < bridge> <teero777> i cant get the tunes to be correct for slowing down the game xd
18:13 < bridge> <teero777> some of them apparently scale linearly and some dont
18:13 < bridge> <teero777> also there is saturated add. i have no idea:pepeW:
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> gravity 0.25 for example doesnt make the jump last twice as long when calculating the jump impulse to be the same height as when gravity 0.5 (default)
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> i counted 28 ticks for 0.5 and 40 ticks for 0.25 (in the demo editor)
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> ```c++
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> Tuning()->Set("ground_jump_impulse", (g + std::sqrt(g * (g + 1341.12))) / 2);
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> Tuning()->Set("air_jump_impulse",(g + std::sqrt(g * (g + 1104.f))) / 2);
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> ```
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> this is my function to calculate the jump impulses resulting in the default jump height based on the gravity
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> this works.
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> but how does gravity relate to the server tick speed?
18:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Gravity is applied to the velocity every tick
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> Velocity then changes the position every tick, so the effect of gravity on position is quadratic

18:41 < bridge> <teero777> pos: 637.5
18:42 < bridge> <chairn> what if you invert vel += and pos += ?
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> i get 612.5
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> just as if id iterate one less
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> you mean switching the lines?
18:43 < bridge> <chairn> yes
18:43 < bridge> <teero777> ok
18:44 < bridge> <teero777> gpt isnt a help either
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> ok i just looked at what heinrich said yesterday seems like it should be 
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> `return 0.5f * GRAVITY * TICKS * (TICKS - 1.f)`
18:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> wouldnt you need to calculate gravity * ticks?
18:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye
18:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> but just doing `vel += GRAVITY * TICKS;` should do the trick
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> or +1 depending on the order
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> thats not what i want xd
18:49 < bridge> <chairn> should also be pos += vel * t
18:50 < bridge> <teero777> okay g = 1275/(t*(t+1))
18:50 < bridge> <teero777> this is the answr
18:50 < bridge> <teero777> cool
18:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> so you're not using the actual physical model of gravity, but your own? :D
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> the one of teeworlds xD
18:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh wait this is for teeworlds? why tf are you using std::cout
18:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> just a minimal example
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> chill
18:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> XD the moment i saw you using std::cout i thought this is for something else so i wondered, no worries lol
18:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> i wonder why teeworlds uses g = 1275 instead of g = 9.81, would it mess something up? why arent we using generalized things
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> has anyone played around with c++23 modules? asking for a friend :justatest:
18:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> thats like a math question where someone says "calculate with pi = 3"
18:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> i did try out the export module stuff a bit
18:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> did u use `import std;`
18:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye, worked like a charm
18:58 < bridge> <peter0x44> Which compiler?
18:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> MSVC
18:58 < bridge> <peter0x44> Okay, gcc and clang still don't support it afaik

18:58 < bridge> <peter0x44> `import std;` that is
18:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> Hopefully by gcc 15...
18:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> Not that I really like modules, I don't view headers as a problem to begin with
18:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> i use nixOS btw, ( in wsl2 that is, until i figure out how to single GPU passthrough correctly)
19:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i spent half of day triyng to make import std work and it doesn't work :feelsbadman:
19:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> well using "import std" removes unneccessary boilerplate in including every library on their own,  for example you dont need to import vector, and iostream, you can just include stdf

19:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> i just looked it up, it seems yet to be only functional using MSVC
19:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wanted to make my program in c++23 but doens't seem like a good idea :\
19:02 < bridge> <teero777> g = 0.5
19:02 < bridge> <teero777> 💀
19:02 < bridge> <teero777> 1275 is just a factor that came out while doin the math
19:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> just use c++21, c++23 is still not completly riped out, so i've read
19:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> :MonkaS:
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> any way i was stupid. that function cant work
19:04 < bridge> <chairn> trying to replicate real world physics would lead to a game not called teeworlds
19:04 < bridge> <chairn> non credible physics is what makes the game fun
19:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> when irl hammer fly :justatest:
19:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> come over we try
19:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> hookfly
19:56 < bridge> <pilonpl> where does the data for $points come from?
19:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://ddnet.org/players/?json2=melo%C6%9E
20:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> or so i thought, bot doesnt seem to display my points correctly..
20:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> no
20:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> this doesnt have historical data
20:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> `query = 'SELECT timestamp, points FROM stats_finishes WHERE name = $1 ORDER BY timestamp;'` this is what i found in code
20:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> but it doesnt explain anything
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> i found a weird mismatch:
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> the german translation translates Antiping = Anti-Ping, the entire segment uses Localize "AntiPing: predict *", why are weapons and grenade path not "translated" ?

20:44 < bridge> <bts._.> im guessing the translations were done at different times by different people
20:48 < bridge> <bts._.> the newer stuff without translations always ends up at the bottom of the file so its easy to lose context
20:48 < bridge> <bts._.> not very practical 🤷‍♀️
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> git blame doesnt even tell me for some god forsaken reason >:c
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> could we specify AntiPing to be a Proper name that we dont translate? or should we stick with Anti-Ping?
20:51 < bridge> <furo321> 🤷‍♂️
20:51 < bridge> <furo321> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1221184524851871754/image.png?ex=6611a7b7&is=65ff32b7&hm=dd7c5aea08b3d5f052133f65395bd57357560d1e36c5ebef26daeacfc36ed522&
20:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> "translating" it to Anti-Ping seems odd
20:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> nvim trolling gg
20:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> translating a game like ddnet feels weird
20:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> imagine saying kukła instead of dummy
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> i agree, lets keep it german.
20:52 < bridge> <bts._.> big improvements 🚀
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
20:58 < bridge> <Peakies> another improvement by Melon senpai  😍 😍 😍
20:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> :simp:
20:59 < bridge> <Peakies> 😄
21:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> Chiller i love how you got bombarded with "wrongs" on #8141 - scrolling to each requested change made me giggle a little more :kek:

22:44 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sorry but who thought formatting code with sed is a good idea?
22:45 < bridge> <learath2> especially c++
