00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't, the 2nd one optimizes the best from what I can see

01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 I suggested it just because it does the exact same thing as the first line but is the nicest to read imo

10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Okay that was really strange then
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is strange?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dunno how that happened but my server was registering using a wrong source port ??? and my server was still visible. Even by doing a tcpdump I couldn't see the port 8404 being registered, but was still in the list
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dunno how that happened but my server was registering using a wrong source port ???
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And my server was still visible. Even by doing a tcpdump I couldn't see the port 8404 trying to communicate with masters, but was still in the list
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I wasn't visible for status.tw, but for https masters yes
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you register by https or by the old-style master protocol?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> old-style
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, different stuff applies to that
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems to be 50 seconds for that
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's probably still too few?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well it was way more
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe there's a bug in there
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> probably yes, dunno what happened but if somehow it happens again I'll write again here
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Was the info updated tho?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or old info displayed
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> updated
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it's probably the fact that the backward compatibility won't stop scraping a server unless it stops responding
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even if it drops out of the masterserver list
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this could be considered a bug, I guess
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Exactly, sv_register 0 doesnt work for old registering
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 😄
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only with the server being down for ~a minute
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> btw was confused about the new rcon feature "username"
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wrote my password in :sue:
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "new" 😛
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> """new"""
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol rly
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> never seen it before, I always update my client
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its serverside
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> huh? how
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aswell
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it only shows if the server has rcon with usernames
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :justatest: we don't
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then something went wrong
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the feature is from 2017 😉
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtff
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if u connect to a server that tells the client to use usernames, and you then join a server that doesnt send this information at all, it will not fallback to anything, it will just go with what was set before
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why you saw username on ur server
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like a bug
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that reported already?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4170
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> hoo
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i definitely said it already before, not sure if i made an issue
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn I've never seen that before, that looks cool, 2017 :justatest:

11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It would be cool to find a a RCE using maps
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <thomas20> Thank me letter https://t.me/+FE01vMtarjEwOWM0
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Are you in my walls? I was literally talking to someone 10 minutes ago about an RCE they found in the map loader for a different game xd
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> the one he found was because the map saved its size in the file so if you changed it then the checksum would buffer overflow when looping over the map bytes but we probably don't do that
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does a buffer overread for a checksum turn into an RCE?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have lots of out of buffer reads during map loading (with fuzzing), but hopefully no more writes

12:45 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> forgot the name of it (the look)
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I knew u would show it chiller
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its minecraft

12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Today on hn
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no I mean the ===
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> shit
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Js
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you can enable/disable it for eg on vscode for some fonts
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ligatures
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes this
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this is horrible
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yea
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> hrhr im in such a mc hype these days
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> my github feed showed the repo :D
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki about the RCE probably our map expert @Patiga has some findings and i assume you know those CVEs already https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/created_by/mmmds
12:53 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki also send help to write mc hax
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> i fakin hate java
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> java sux
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Compared to rust yes
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> org.ddnet.server.Character
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:

13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ChillerDragon: haven't looked at out of bounds reads extensively, didn't manage to find an exploit. for fun I tried to create the smallest crashing map. I managed 48 bytes, maybe someone can golf it further ^^
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We need to write map loading tests
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> in general
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> java sucks
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> such a horrible app, language can be "sometimes" a bit fun to work with, but what a shit thing to have to install 36000 java versions for different apps cuz developers doesn't even maintain it
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> cursed js
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 1 error output in java has more lines than the linux kernel source code itself
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> imagine getting a keyboard which utilizes those fonts xd
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> gonna be longer, than my desk
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> m_VelX is an int   xD maybe type prefixes would not be to bad at all xD
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The fix looks fine
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel I just tested it, It looks really cute. But I do not get an afk emote for my dummy, is that normal?

13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel Also my main tee does not get afk at all
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel also if you pull an afk Tee, he moves is feets like if he would walk. Do we want that?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> There was a discussion about how round_to_int function is being used to ahm, make floats into int in the most simple way possible
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> with learath
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel also if you pull an afk Tee, he moves his feets like if he would walk. Do we want that?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and in air
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @c0d3d3v whole convo here
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I know about the rounding problem... I just saying that it is an int xD
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well yes xd
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> can't understand what's the issue
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Learath2 only explaind the options, and pointed out what would be good for floats. I only said it is an int.
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If you mean the rounding issue ... that was multiple times discussed here. Maybe I can link to one of my explanations xD wait...
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> rounding issue yes
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/963862774633611396

14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Mh I read a bit more on his thread, I guess he is talking about something different. But I thought it is about this because of the code I had refereed to.from Voxel
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh, then nvm my convos
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel   ... `if(g_Config.m_ClAfkEmote && m_pClient->m_aClients[ClientID].m_Afk && !(Client()->DummyConnected() && ClientID == m_pClient->m_aLocalIDs[!g_Config.m_ClDummy]))`
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see dummies never get afk emots

14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tbf the emote is too much
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Nah I'm sorry that I have not read your thread. But it looks like that is a thing of refactoring (with special care about keeping same physics)
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the eyes are way enough, emotes are big af, imagine you have so much people, get's ugly
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the eyes are way enough, emotes are big af, imagine you have so much people, gets ugly
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there is an option to turn it off. Could be added to the settings menu
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Cl_AfkEmote
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We need your lecture
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel 
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8dj5fz
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I tested your afk animation. I like it.
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But we have already an sit animation, if you sit on the edge of a block. I think the afk animation should overwrite this.
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> video is privated
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Mabe now with password 1234
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> u leaked private feature <a:zoozpepe:708147692370657301>
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the weapon holding looks weird, especially hammer
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5802>
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats the in air condition
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah true
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and that should not be overridden, i think its totally correct like this
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ik, was a joke
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh yes maybe starange if it would start sitting in air
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> exactly
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but good think is it adapts, if someone hooks you over
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thing*
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes but it shows the walk animation... thats also strang, but acceptable
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> haha, you wanna get dragged over the floor wiping your ass? :D
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes you are afk
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xdd
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah maybe it should check for direction, not velx
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh, but I think it is ok to show the walk animation. It was always like that
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe just the switching is actually ugly
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> swithcing from sitting & weapon on back to normal
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and back
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems a bit inconsitent
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD yes, but that also happens normaly only once
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> its just because I forced afk state
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, if someone does multiple short hooks on you
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> while ur afk on ground
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but the weapon stays on the back
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if he hooks you
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im not sure whether weapon stays on back, but definitely the feet toggle back and forth
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah ye
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> only feets change
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> feet*
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> weapon switches only if you have automatic weapon active wihle you are afk
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i suggested dat
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> weapon switches only if you have automatic weapon active while you are afk
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah well, actually i think its fine with the feet
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we will have to see how it is for a while probably
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe we could use the same for freeze btw, with weapons on back and sitting
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> right now the tee doesnt have any weapo
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Ravie you said something about the position of the feet, that it is kind of strange. Maybe you want to comment about that again...
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> good idea
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah yeah I think they're a little too far to the side
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u compared to 0.7?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cuz they fixed it
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iirc
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean the sitting animation
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what did they fix ?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the feet positions are a little bit wrong i think, either in 0.6 or 0.7
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also when facing to the left, the front foot is upside down xD, dunno a lot of things about this look weird to me
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> someone pointed out to me that in 0.6 the feet are shifted too, but the other way
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, then it might be that and we are all just used to it
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah it looks even more shifted because of that
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @fokkonaut I think we have general no transition animation. So also not from AFK to Aktiv and the other way around. But maybe in a far future xD someone implements transition animations xD
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @fokkonaut just for fun here's a 0.6 and 0.7 tee and below with mirrored foot offset
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017065370185629706/unknown.png
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a, so 0.6 was broken
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> right
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and we use top left?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and here both are perfectly centered
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017065849112244325/unknown.png
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> my favorite is the 0.7 tee with 0.6 foot offset
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> interesting
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bottom right looks nice
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yep
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD my eyes are to bad. I see so little diffrence
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but yes I think you are right. It looks the best
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cus of the feet outlines
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they are fixed
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I like more the one with more shadow
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (shadow I mean the black outline
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (shadow I mean the black outline)
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (shadow I mean the black outline, the bigger one)
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> wait the outline is fixed? I think it is part of the skin, you could change it. Could you not? @Ravie
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what do you mean?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 0.6 skins seem to have slightly fatter outlines
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but only because its in the skins right?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you want you could do one with small outlines
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't get what you mean
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I refer to what @louis  said. 
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> "cus of the feet outlines
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> they are fixed"
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I do not think they are fixed
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah yeah because the 0.6 tee is just my faithful remake but I fixed the wonky foot outline
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't have the official svg for 0.6 tees
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah eh means not fixed in the sense of it is not changeable, but it was repaired xD
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah he means not fixed in the sense of it is not changeable, but it was repaired xD I'm lost
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the difference is really subtle xD but somehow it upsets our eyes so much
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017069507883323514/unknown.png
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah that helps
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i swear it looked fine when i tested it
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh weird
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes ignore that xD ...
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Well, I think that would be fine, unless we have it where if you drag an afk tee it still sits. Then I think it would be only fair to start skidding when fast enough
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> @Voxel what do u think about this kind of events?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017089707886256128/unknown.png
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Very nice!
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think I collected the imported questions on github.
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think I collected the imported questions/statements on github.
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways I'll tweak the actual sitting parameters to make it better looking, though i dont know how to i would do weapon placememt
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also about the left foot being upside down thing, i dont think you can flip assets in contents.py
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I actually think the normal gun is so small, on just a little bigger skins you do not even see it.
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do the feet not flip if you change direction?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Mh they do not. Why should we start flipping them
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it never was like that in the code
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Ravie  do the feet flip in 0.7?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what do you mean flip?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just tested it, they do not
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ok
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> you mentioned when afk tee faces left the foot is upside down
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I do not even see what you mean by upside down @Ravie  for me it looks correctly mirrored (that falls a little bit out of teeworlds style since in all other states the feet do  not mirror, but I like it)
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the pointy end of the foot should be facing upwards
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> theres no way to flip the foots in animations :((
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wish there was
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> theres no way to flip the feet in animations :((
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wish there was
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you could add an option for it 😄

17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0Steve> What@c0d3d3v
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> #off-topic
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i could try, but it might take a while
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Is this really a question for developers? If not move to #questions
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Or we could always mirror the feet depending on the directions 😄 But that would change all animations
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But I still do not understand what is mirrored wrong. Is it so significant? For me it looks ok
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the animations in code are symmetrical, thankfully
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the animations in code are symmetrical, thankfully, meaning one left animation is a nice mirror to one right
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The tee could also just always sit to one side. That would also solve the problem
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea but that looks wrong when you're looking the other way
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah now I see what you mean...
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The underlying problem also contains that the tee itself never changes direction. I mean the skin does not flip its side.
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah, but its too late for that now. it would ruin a lot of skins if it was flipped
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you could add flip_x and flip_y to the CAnimKeyframe and make it default false, and then use it in render.cpp
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and also in python in AnimKeyframe
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or flip_h flip_v
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD flip_h and flip_v is also used in the editor ...
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah in code its FlipX and FlipY
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> That should be pretty simple. If it is really useful is an other question.
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If you do it, I would use H,V  instead of X,Y  that sounds more verbose to me
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Or better add it to the animation itself instead of the animKeyFrame :/ not sure. But I think the texture should not flip in an animation
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @c0d3d3v can you show how the sitting looks with the skin `Bub`?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> left and right
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Mh that would be a lot more complicated
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes wait
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it should be much more obvious what I mean with that skin
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> right is cute, left is yoga
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017101373663355000/unknown.png

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why not
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> skin dependent
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I'm not even sure if it would be better if the feet would flip. since the skin does not, the tail would be between the feet
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nevermind the tail
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> just to give you the idea that the toes are the wrong way
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> At least the feet would be better
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and not all skins have feet that will look "ok" even flipped
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> optics and design is so hard xD
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think I will make a short test video with just hard coding the flip...
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bizarre skin, is it part of the normal skin db?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yes, I made it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it doesn't look that stupid normally tho
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017106342311366706/unknown.png
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its one of the best skins
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the happy version at least
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I'd think this one should have been part of the community db ngl. It's cute and all but is it really tee-ish
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wait this is bubble bobble
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what do you mean "normally", I think the sitting dino is also not so stupid 😄
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I like it
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we are doing the new asymmetric animations we should start flipping skins I guess
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it won't look good
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> shadows flipping
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah there is that too :/
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we can try. Maybe its not that bad
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Probably for now we should just sit only to the right
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it could work with the 0.7 system, flip the feet and marking but keep shadow on the correct side
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or yeah sit in one direction
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tees dont face any direction anyway technically
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD we could add an 2D lighting system 😛 so you do not need to add shadows to the skin ^^ lel
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> jk
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> o.O what do they do with shadoes?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> o.O what do they do with shadows?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing but the skin is split into separate parts that you could treat individually
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if it's symmetric then you could flip only the body marking
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017108113138122784/fox.png
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the 0.7 system wont work with a skin database sadly
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also pls dont adapt the 0.7 eyes
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what if you have tees with different shape
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also if u use a skin with text on it, it would flip it, would probs be weird
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like non symetrical skins
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is a problem anyway
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so far all 0.7 skins are symmetric
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but I guess then you'd have a problem
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3797859/9839628/d0deae0e-5a34-11e5-947c-c7884a0498ab.gif

18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fng sucks
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel  @Ravie  the simplest solution I can think of would be in AFK state to always sit to the right and force the eyes to one nice position
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel I see also the same problem for your new running animation
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will make a short video with the Bub skin
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> nevermind
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> walking with feet that have tows is always strang not only with running
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> walking with feet that have tows is always strange not only with running
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Wait until you see tank skin :justatest:

19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> :justatest:
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel I do upload my code so you can copy it... I think it is way simpler and the better solution instead of adding it to every key frame
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> looks better but I don't like the feet flipping while running or in air
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also the feet position when sitting still looks odd to me, they seem too far from where they normally are, maybe because the feet go to the side but body angle doesn't change
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah yes I just did it general ... the easiest way possible 😄 we could just do it only in afk
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I wanted to test how it looks id you walk with flipped feet
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I wanted to test how it looks it you walk with flipped feet
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I wanted to test how it looks if you walk with flipped feet
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I forgot to show that in the video
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Ravie https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8dje3d pw 1234
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Here I tested a little bit walking with flipping. The flipping is only based on the cursor position. If that would be a real thing, I guess it would be better to base it on the walk direction.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will just upload it ... then you can test it yourself
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tbh, i think the hammer can actually stay exactly like it is, also when being afk
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it looks very wrong otherwise, and the hammer is already like in a good position to be held idel
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idle
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> <https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/tree/pr_5802> there you can test it as soon as the CI build is finished. I added a setting cl_force_afk to force afk on all players.
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Actually just flipping the feet on normal walk does not really work since the feet are not centered on the tee, so it looks little bit strange.
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> <https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/tree/pr_5802> there you can test it as soon as the CI build is finished. I added a setting cl_force_afk to force afk on all players.
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Actually just flipping the feet on normal walk does not work prefectly since the feet are not centered on the tee, so it looks little bit strange.
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But it does not look to bad
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> something like this looks more natural
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017131939246919770/unknown.png
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or like that, yea, but not how the hammer currently is being held xd
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> he lowers his hammer while sleeping but the hammer doesn't completely change sides
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> f3
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017133223387615332/unknown.png
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Yes I see... Its strange that the hammer changes its side

20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why is the laser so far back
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when add animated zzz for afkers
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess he uses the same position for all weapon. It is just bigger
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ```

20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> YOOOO
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Yep its the same position for all weapons
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> totally real niteri
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> noooo
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> they removed
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> wrong channel
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> lmao i was replying to scam message
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> oh
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> its on all channels
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it should only be in the scam channel
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 😛
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I actually liked the Zzz Ravie posted. But animated using particles is maybe also good
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that's what I had in mind when I made it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but it's just hypoethetical, I'm actually against too many visual changes
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> @Voxel that's my final version of main page. any thoughts?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017136309539721428/unknown.png
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so i do this pose?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> dunno do what you want, it's just my 2 cents
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I like that pose too. For me both looks good. But what about the other weapons?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> only one way to find out xD
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> CI build is btw finished 😄 if you want to test flipping feet 😄 https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/actions/runs/3009684803
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> i prefered the feet straight up the way you did it 🙂

20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> off*
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> announcing the iphone 69. what's new? absolutely nothing, but you'll still buy it
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> f3
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never bought a iphone
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> f3
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only interestng thing are the M2 processors
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to me
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I heared you have to wait for IPhone 70. Because they run out of chips
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> long range cannon ready to shoot

20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> uff pretty bad for what prices apple charges
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except the cpu
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always on display is already on any android
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But this is apple, it’s definitely much better than every other product out there. If you say otherwise you are stupid
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mobiles focus so much on pictures nowadays
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing i use less
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> depends on your definition of better
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this image feels from 2000s
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The satellite SOS sounds interesting
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the color palette is weird
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s better in every definition if you ask an appleboy
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the processor made in house or not?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apple processors are good
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> of course :monkalaugh:
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iirc TSMC fabs them but apple designed the architecture in house based on arm
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> indeed
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017140165875093534/unknown.png
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "from"
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> apple doing apple things
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing new
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw apple phones are arbitrarely more pricy in europe
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and laptops
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> is it not the Taiwan fab that now gets a new factory in USA only so that Taiwan is safe again against china?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @c0d3d3v taiwan fab is TSMC
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how they did the satellite sos. There is a reason sat phones have that stick antenna 😄
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> elon musk stuff?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> starlink
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I think the idea is the opposite. TSMC opens a fab in US funded with govt grants and in exchange if taiwan is ivaded by china the world still can have high density silicon
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah no
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is europe not doign the same?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! DüşüncesizAli> (Turkish) 35.000TL
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Starlink uses dish satellites, even harder to fit in a phone
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we rly should
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put the fab in catalonia
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This idk. I’m not aware of any funding for fabs in EU
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD prob you have to plug in a sat antenna in the non existing audio jack port
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the fuck is that apple park
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is always possible that I’m just out of loop in the tech required for sat transmission. They may have minified it by now
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> probably for an SOS you do not need a lot of bandwidth so you can use a small antenna
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem is getting through the atmosphere. If you had a directional antenna you could maybe punch through with lower energy but for something like a phone a directional antenna doesn’t work too well
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> >  If you don't have a cellular or WiFi connection, Apple essentially enables emergency connections to satellites. The iPhone 14 Plus uses a mix of a special satellite frequencies, an algorithm that shrinks a regular text message to make it 3 times smaller.
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also called compression
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, when apple makes it it’s an algorithm that shrinks
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> F3
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> :0
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> One thing I know is that some Satellites use 40 to 60GHz and WiFi 802.11ad uses 60GHz  ... so maybe that could be related...
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As far as I’m aware higher frequencies have an even worse time going through different media
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I know...
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can you explain me why "o the only difference is that the attacker can match the received data against expected data." is bad?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> <https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Satellite_frequency_bands> 
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Actually my information with 60GHz seems to be wrong...
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That’s what I’ve been brainstorming there. Say there is some site that gives out some very predictable page except for a couple chunks of small variable data. By forcing the client to make a get request and check the sha of the page you can generate a set of shas and keep forcing the client until he reports correct map for one
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s a very unlikely attack though. That’s why I asked for other ideas
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I can't reproduce #4170 like this; I tried not sending any `NETMSG_RCONTYPE` messages from one server but it still correctly detects that no username is required even when previously connected to another server that does use usernames
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4170
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe its fixed already
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ReiTW reproduced it yesterday
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you tell us what you did @ReiTW?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wifi uses 800MHz, 2GHz, 3GHz and 5Ghz, not 60GHz
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Europe has announced a 50 billion € plan to secure circuit fabrication in Europe
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 7B€ already invested in Germany for Intel fab
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 5B€ announced for GF and ST partnership in France (Grenoble)
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> But Europe still 20 years behind for chip fabrication
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> TSMC is already at 5nm while ST never went below 28nm (because it had no need for)
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> With the announced plan, they'll move to 22nm or maybe even 18nm in Grenoble
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I don't know about Intel fab in Germany
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Intel should be able to do 14nm to 10nm there i believe
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you are wrong, look here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ad
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there is also a mobile network standard on 40GHz
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Called 5G xD
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR_frequency_bands#Frequency_Range_2
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i got stuck on old standards 😄
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but the 60GHz doesn't go through walls, so not the best for indoor use
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Btw we should cancel 5g
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://youtu.be/UOvAZPHDogs
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @c0d3d3v Is this a good list for the AFK sit thing? Or does it need more?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017162533502726234/unknown.png
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I'm not sure if we want dummies going AFK. I guess it is that way so you do not get the Zzzz if you fly a long way with your dummy...
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think that is on purpose ...
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Alright, I'll remove that.
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> For foot flipping you can look in my commit... You can use a cleaned up version of it but only flip it if you are afk
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, I'll edit it so it's more suitable for if you need it or not.
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Also I'm still not sure if just one sit position would be better, and forcing eyes to the right.  Maybe you try out the new position first and then we talk with Ravie again about it. I think Ravie has a good eye for teeworlds design
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Sure; but at the same time, if you force eyes in one direction only and you're firing in the opposite... How would that look?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> guess guys what can be wrong here
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017165285620469862/4df2444e-9326-40dd-b859-3d08a8db8655.jpg
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Maybe do not sit in that case... 
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But Yeah first try out the new sit animation with flipped foot, maybe its good enough so we can sit in both directions
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> to less water
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> super cold
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> put it in the dish washer, then in the heater, then new heat sink and lets test it again xD
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> at this point
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017165791763906622/a242f899-edb7-4c07-a6cb-4380a7080842.jpg
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> see all those whit points on the cpu socket?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> see all those white points on the cpu socket?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> Good picture quality
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes ... its possible to clean
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> those are thermal paste
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you could clean it and sell it if you do not want to use it
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> here's the cpu now
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017166202054922250/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_85144a47-1331-4e8d-accb-70cd385f8e4d.jpg
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> On the pins you should not put on pressure, but you can clean it with water and soup
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> can i clean it up with pure alcohol tho?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can use alcohol (Spirit alcohol) too yes.
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But water works too... you just have to take care that you get it very dry after warts
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do not let it dry by itself
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Otherwise it oxidizes and becomes rusty and then you have a defect.
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But water works too... you just have to take care that you get it very dry afterwards
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I wont risk that, so alcohol it is
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But in general I wonder, did the motherboard still work? Because heat-conducting paste is actually not electrically conductive, so it shouldn't cause any damage.
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there are actually also videos on youtube about that topic. Especially after the last storm in germany, some channels started doing videos about cleaning up very dirty hardware...
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I just played normally
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and wanted to rcon
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it didn't get onto real sensitive parts, but because the cpu itself couldn't have cooled down, the bottom part of the motherboard is almost melted
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> probably joined another server before bombay
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> :justatest:
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so basically, the cpu survived, but the motherboard didn't
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see...
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and thats good, 80 bucks for a new motherboard is better, than 150+ on a cpu
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If the CPU got that hot... that could also not be good for the CPU. Do you overclock? Why did the PC not force shutdown, normally it must, as soon as the temperature is out of range for the CPU
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it was 60c on bios
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it didnt let me boot onto my os
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 😦 I wish you good luck
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Did you used a water cooler?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Did you use a water cooler?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well thx, this is the second time happening, the first time i thought that i did the pasting wrong
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Did you use a water cooling system?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but then on this one, i realized, that the screws on the cpu fan had no full grip onto the motherboard on the side, where it leaked
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so motherboard was faulty
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> So you used a normal fan?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> amd cpu cooler
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> interesting...
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> its not the coolers fault
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it works just as fine
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Was this your first custom build?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> interestingly, the os just freeze, cuz the bios got freezed too
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> dangerious stuff ngl
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> not this one for sure
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> @ eVery One
