00:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @lynn it really depends on the size of the map. 100 MB max, average is maybe 25 MB
00:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh interesting
00:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so super light
00:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i imagine cpu utilization is pretty low
00:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im getting an NFO server but i also plan on hosting an mc server now. i want to alloc 2gb for the mc server so 3gb should still be enough probably
00:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe ill do 4 anyway
00:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 1 gb should be enough from ddnet side definitely. We used to run RUS on 256 MB of RAM for a long time
00:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> alright, in that case i will do 3gb to save a bit
00:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thank you
00:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> swapping is actually not that bad, since most parts of the map are actually not played on
00:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> CPU usage can be high, depends on the cpu your server has. nfoservers is generally good, so should be fine
00:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah they seem really good so far for the price
00:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i bought a 2 core in GER like 5 days ago
00:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what does ddnet usa and can use?
00:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in terms of location + host
00:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think i will go with the premium chicago location for usa
00:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> plus it's super close to east can still
00:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have nfoservers dallas for ddnet usa, ovh for CAN
00:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thanks
00:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> are all of them VPS and not bare metal?
00:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i suppose it could depend on server load
00:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the ones we use or nfoservers offers?
00:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We mostly have vpses since dedicated servers are way too expensive
00:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nfoservers also has dedicated servers at ~100 $ / month
00:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i figured
00:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and the ones you use
00:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only GER and NLD are dedicated servers at the moment
00:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think most things are network-limited rather than any other factor anyway.
00:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not worth spending much on ram/cpu
07:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Do we need to be able to set hookline color?

07:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> That description label gotta go tho.
07:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hookcollision sounds aweful anyway
07:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everyone says hookline
07:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the config is called hook collision
07:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hook line should be fine
07:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> even collision is better than "coll" tho
07:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it gets too big then ðŸ˜„
07:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so line should be fine :kek:
07:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but there are 3 colors still ðŸ˜„
07:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Hookline no collision
07:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hookline hookable collision etc.
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or Hookline as header
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then the 3 things
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Hookline: miss / Hookline: hookable / Hookline: tee, why do we need collision
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but miss sounds weird
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah for the others it doesnt matter
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ it is technically missing hooks tho
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its technically also no collision xD
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i guess
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> coll
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/841549033722216468/unknown.png
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its shortened in the config
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Hook coal
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats why i named it coll
07:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "no hit
07:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no hit is good

07:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you don't
07:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can just read either, it doesn't matter that much
07:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok xD

13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie if a kog map has a tune zone(and you dont hit it) the jetpack bug still happens
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:

13:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I still don't have it
13:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Just like last time.. emm
13:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, as soon as i hit the zone its gone but when i join its there
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sounds fixable
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> funny thing is, it only happens sometimes apparetnly
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Might be kog that is sending weird tune 0

13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar âœª are you getting the jetpack thing semiconsistently?
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ba6759fe790fb27545cf47380abe910807fcbd6a/src/game/client/prediction/entities/character.cpp#L85
13:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm afraid of touching it. but 85~86 might be the reason you are getting that.
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> `m_LastJetpackStrength` is initialized with 400.0f too
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno it happened, then it didnt happen, then it happened for a few seconds
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe someone has to hit the tunezone or smth
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and it is only being updated if there is a tune that has jetpack strength over 0, so it isn't getting updated regularly...             m_LastJetpackStrength = Tuning()->m_JetpackStrength;
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and it is only being updated if there is a tune that has jetpack strength over 0, so it isn't getting updated regularly...             https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ba6759fe790fb27545cf47380abe910807fcbd6a/src/game/client/prediction/entities/character.cpp#L1156
13:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll check again in like an hour
14:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie dunno, i join 15 times, and then it happened again
14:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> random af
14:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> currently i have it again xd
14:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ can you try changing https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ba6759fe790fb27545cf47380abe910807fcbd6a/src/game/client/prediction/entities/character.cpp#L1022 to 0
14:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> Would be cool if it could be transparent too. So it only shows, when you can hook for example.
14:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can make it the same color as entities background
14:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> our color selector doesnt support transparency if im not incorrect
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, it doesnt happen currently, do you think it could be caused by smth the server sends, u said smth like that before, didnt ya?
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its really random, but im sure it does happen sometimes xD
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i did. but i'm not sure.
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can ofc try with valgrind or ubsan again
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~who doesn't love randomness~~
14:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> @Jupstar âœª Yeah, no big deal, but i have a map as background, so that wont work :justatest:
14:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nope, no chance, its either not client related or depends on the timing of some network packets or smth
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but demo does not show it
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so not sure about that
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¤”
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> have you tried initialize `m_LastJetpackStrength` with 0
14:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the problem is, in debug mode i dont get it at all
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast not yet
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its too random
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hmm
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe that's why i'm not getting it
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> tf is this then
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its not uninitliazed stuff
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tested with valgrind
14:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> must be either the server or some weird timing
14:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> `m_LastJetpackStrength` is initialized, but with 400.0f by default which i don't get. but i'm not sure what that member does
14:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when the server was full i had it like 10 times in a row xD
14:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe kog just send in tuning really late?
14:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, i indeed had it for like a millsecond when i joined a few tries ago
14:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can that packet be dropped or smth?
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i have no idea
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'll get resent
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now i have it in debug mode
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> finally xD
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> after like 40 resets
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what can i test to help u?
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> initialize `m_LastJetpackStrength` with 0
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can't get it on my end no matter how many time i tried
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> should i just change it in the debugger?
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk. maybe change it when you first join if you can
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or is it important that its initialized like that
14:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i have no idea. but i'm just suspecting that is making your client thinking it has jetpack.
14:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> because this thing
14:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/841657851944632370/unknown.png
14:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> changed it to 0 in run time and didnt change the behavior
14:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah
14:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its called
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the game just resets the value
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> apparaently
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it resets every time character is created
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah m_TuneZone is 0
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     if(GameWorld()->m_WorldConfig.m_PredictWeapons && Tuning()->m_JetpackStrength > 0)
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>         {
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>             m_LastJetpackStrength = Tuning()->m_JetpackStrength;
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>             m_Jetpack = true;
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>             m_aWeapons[WEAPON_GUN].m_Got = true;
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>             m_aWeapons[WEAPON_GUN].m_Ammo = -1;
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>             m_NinjaJetpack = pChar->m_Weapon == WEAPON_NINJA;
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>         }
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is always called
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and sets it
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and you still have jetpack pred?
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> interesting
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now i changed team, bcs someone dragged me around
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and its gone
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in t0 its there again
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
14:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ˜¢
14:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I still remain suspicion about what kog sends in tuning
14:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean Tuning()->m_JetpackStrength is > 0
14:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why doesnt it call there GetTuning btw?
14:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that yet another tuning?
14:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that is current tuning instead of tunezone
14:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so for character it uses what server sends you instead of gussing them based on tunezone
14:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also, this Tuning() one should be copied from CGameClient at all time. `gameclient.cpp:2239`
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/841659934646468608/unknown.png
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but shouldnt ppl with old client versions also get this then?
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean what changed that its visible now ðŸ˜„
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> brain hurts
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah funny
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when im the third person on the server it happens xD
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wdym third person
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah dunno it currently happens always
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe bcs i didnt restart game
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is that you btw
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
15:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> found it
15:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ez
15:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> jetpackstrength is getting overriden after the copy. so server does have 0 for jetpack
15:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but weirdly it is getting overriden in CGameWorld::Tick()
15:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh, and that happens only rarely? ðŸ˜„
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nope.
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> some predicted entity is changing the jetpack tuning
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not sure which one yet
15:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs one of these two nobos in the tune zone xd
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but nothing is changing jetpack tuning directly
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> found it
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/841664141622116382/unknown.png
15:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> should be checking whether this character is local before overwriting the entire world's tuning
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is what i'm guessing
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok, can we clamp the transparency setting for showothers
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> got asked why showothers isn't working
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Watercolours> add more skins to the database, take some from teeworlds data server
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> took awhile for me to realize that he turned it all the way up.
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Watercolours> who and what
15:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone need to setup the php code for the community skins option
15:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then we can do it
15:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Php :justatest: :pepeH:
15:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
15:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i can't setup the website locally
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what i do wrong
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the .sh scripts cannot be executed with my apache setup, but dunno what i need to install

15:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> php api is like c standard just more undefined xD
15:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i read somewhere a rant that %j doesnt give the day of the year in php
15:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or smth like that, but was funny
15:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lets copy c and make it more random
16:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> `/swap` is broken
16:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on purpose tho
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is a bug
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its "disabled"
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> kk good just letting u know
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> maybe could remove the command if you disable a feature
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> so people dont get confused
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but not that important
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that is planed if nobody fixes it
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but then I neeed to add another option and some devs are against me adding new options
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or I just remove it entirely, but that seems even more hacky
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can the console register not be disabled?
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the one line
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but then I can't reenable it again
16:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, needs a code fix anyway in this case
16:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah, but guess u need to recompile next time it gets fixed anyway ðŸ˜„
16:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah ðŸ˜„
16:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could remove these config options and add a simple flag to kill swaps: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ba6759fe790fb27545cf47380abe910807fcbd6a/src/engine/shared/config_variables.h#L232-L233
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what value to set them to though?
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, there are even 3 options
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the ones we currently use
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think they are too high, makes the feature annoying
16:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems that there's conflict about the purpose of the feature
16:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i still vote for simple swap like /timeout would do
16:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> instead of saving loading the characters
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was introduced as a way for not having to explain /save/load or the timeout trick to new players
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean implementation wise
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but after that, opinions diverge on whether we want to make it much more convenient than the old trick or not
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its implemented with save load, but that only works with real team saves
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its buggy rn
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and resets switches
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for the swapped tees
16:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo the feature is just implemented too complex
16:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its easier to switch names/clan etc. instead of the character
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even after hours of discussions we still managed to get swap wrong. Maybe let's just remove it?
