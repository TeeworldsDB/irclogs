07:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I prefer a full install
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i actually never knew you could do modifier binds previously lol
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
09:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe that's a bad thing
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NetrkTM1> @d]

13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really need to advertise new features better. Composite binds, editor brushes, practice mode all went largely unused
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there's no how-to for anything already, stems much deeper than just new features lol
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was working on an introduction sequence but I wanted to highlight UI elements, but with the way we have the ui rendering set up it's extremely ugly and tedious to do. I'll give it another go with stencil buffers when I have more time
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Probably after exams end)
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And a massive UI rework to bring some actual hierarchy to the UI
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> cool! that sounds like a great idea
15:09 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Learath with every feature you need to build in secret cheats. People will grab onto it much faster as they share it with their cheater friends.
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :monkalaugh:
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> yes build in more cheats instead of the dumbest idea ever to "fix" bugs by changing physics
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> ...what
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> do we know when $points will be updated?
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no time frame, someone has to fix it
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://wiki.alliedmods.net/SRCDS_Hardening#Current_Exploits
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> our security situation isn't even that bad ðŸ¤”

22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sounds scarry, that invite bug
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> Can someone make a modified client for me? Not many features and I will pay for it
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if they are useful features for others you can also pay someone to work on them and get them into ddnet
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> should be a private client only for me with some special features
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> I just need someone who makes that for me.
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i question your motivation to make it private ^^
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> i mean why should I make it public :3
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> because ddnet has and always will be an open source game? xD
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> kinda in the spirit of the game
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and plus, why do you need private features? only reason i see is those features being against the rules..
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> i mean maybe if it will get a bigger project. But first i wanna work on it before i upload it anywhere yk?????
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean sure but everyone says that lol
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> which features are against the rules?
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lots of stuff people say "will be open source" and never opens
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well, bot client features or helper features
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> I think it is none of your business if i share my god damn client is it?
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sry, i dont want to start a longer conversation about this, i was just confused
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean, no it's not my business, but at least let me defend one of the main values of ddnet lol
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> what are you defending? i just want a client in my style with my features. Everything should work like I want that. I do not have to share it. It is nothing big nobody will prefer that client to ddnet or sth because it is made the way I like and not the way others like it
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> entirely depends on the nature of the features, nothing more
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if they're "style" changes then sure
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> style, some improvement of features and some new feature ideas of mine. I dont know if thats possible so i need a coder
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sadly a lot of devs are already really busy lol
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> at least the ones i know
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> i can't develope clients so...
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i saw reo for like a split second ðŸ‘€
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> why are they busy?
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> doing cool shit for ddnet or making game modes
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> but i would pay them xD
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Can you tell the features?
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's my inclination that you likely won't see a response here
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or are they private too?
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xD
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> lmfao. If you are interested in making a client for me with payment you can dm me and we will discuss about the features
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> :think_bot:
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i really dont think anyone will dm you that way
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the problem is, if its about bots, idc anyway
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its waste of time
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> a lot of these people have full time jobs that probably pay way more than you would, no offense
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> myself included
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but if you at least said the features, maybe someone would take interest
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> Wth did i fucking ask who doesnt want to code a client for me? I asked who wants to help me and you are saying "i hAvE a FuLlTiMe JoB"
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> .-.
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its ok to ask
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> alright im done talking here
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> yes please then shut up finally
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> Settle down
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PerfeCtion> yeah sry it just makes me mad
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also use features that arent in official ddnet, like quake sounds for fng and new fng scoreboard
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i have them on my repo
