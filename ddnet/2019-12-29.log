06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> @Learath2  [4:10 AM] Learath2: what kinda problems do you get?
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> my cursor has a weird drift and feels like i have a very big sensitivity
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> @Learath2  [4:10 AM] Learath2: what kinda problems do you get?
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> my cursor has a weird drift and it feels like i have a very big sensitivity
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> nvm, i set sensitivity to 4 and turn off old mouse mode and it's feels pretty good
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> This bug isnt important, but if you write chat and send it to a similar time as your dummy connects, your message isnt in chat or f1. However other Players see it
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> faster than light
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe update to 0.7.4 first
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does ddnet use the race timer already?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> deen biggest :troll: 
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> asking if it should be 0.1 or 1.0 and gets two votes for 1.0 and then chooses 0.9 xxxD
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think that should go before release
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea good idea @Ryozuki
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could also use the command api
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think rn u cant use /team cuz its a vanilla command
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with the api u can tell client to remove it and add urs
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u can
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> using escape
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or zillywoods client :p
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its annoying and 0.7.4 provides a nice way to do it
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki pushing self added features :p
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> self added?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think they are vital
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and btw someone made a issue requesting that before
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, i mean because you made it ^^
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen what are all the changes in cmakelists for?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip shellcheck
14:25 <@deen> oops
14:28 <@deen> @fokkonaut to fix builds, only include Server, not Client in package, rename to DDNet7 to make it clear which is which
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there anything you would suggest me to apply to my mod aswell? I generally keep it up to date
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you also have no client so that makes sense for you too
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but you dont release packages so it doenst matter
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will keep the client stuff in, so it will be easier for me to merge vanilla
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wouldnt it be best to get vanilla updates through ddnet/ instead of merging two repos?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it better !#/usr/bin/env sh
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or bash
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> I hope its a joke
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /bin/sh is specified by posix
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's fine
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure where all the quotes went
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Hi , how can i compile DDNet Client with mingw ? what programs does it need
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qixm12W4CaM
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it says outdated by imo its still very helpful

16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> why i cant open project ?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk about cmake gui
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i find it less confusing to just execute cmake from commandline
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mkdir build
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cd build
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cmake ..
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cmake --build .
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> seems like you have some visual studio artifacts there try deleting all the old stuff
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> remove gtest check
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen did u restart servers already because rankteam still doesnt work :/
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> finished 10 sec ago
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TcTc try setting the `DOWNLOAD_GTEST` variable to false maybe
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @heinrich5991  didnt work
17:35 <@deen> @ChillerDragon Nope, didn't
17:35 <@deen> I'm trying to fix the map converter today
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> map converter should work now
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> awesome
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon  how to join a team on ddnet7?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, need a space at the start
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or /team<esc> 2
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can see why team ranks are not written, will try to fix
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon so i have to delete all existing ddnet7 ranks and saves because of cheats/bugs?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think only tune map settings maps are affected
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i made a few legit ranks :/
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so how to tell which maps?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think nobody else played anyways xd
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea thats the thing
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just give me a list of all ranks
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then i'll just ignore it for now
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shouldnt be too long
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but saves are harder to tell
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even less saves probably
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wait, is the save feature even working?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> MariaDB [teeworlds]> select * from record_saves where DDNet7=true order by Timestamp;
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Empty set (22.531 sec)
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> btw, better suggestions for default maps on ddnet7 servers?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> people seem to be mostly playing the default maps
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never tested save on official servers xd and i think the average 0.7 users doesnt even know that teeworlds has a chat
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen Multimap and AipGores are very popular nobo maps
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y just tested save works fine on solo srv
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen will there be a github rls as well? ðŸ™‚ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/releases
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats like the first place where i would search a rls
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Done
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i ment like with the binarys
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm too lazy to upload them
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet also doesn't have them
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet has ddnet.tw tho
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but still i think ddet should have them as well
