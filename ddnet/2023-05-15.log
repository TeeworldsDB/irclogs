01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> which is useless if the code has been heavily minified or obfuscated
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> this april fools thing is the closest you can probably get to obfuscation lol
07:42 < bridge> <kio> ClDummy indicate who is the ACTIVE player between you and the dummy right?
07:46 < bridge> <kio> A GitHub bot? ü§î

08:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> should be fixed
08:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 15 days till june, aka c++20 revolution :warning_icon:
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> XD
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> will c++20 get a borrow checker?
08:54 < bridge> <Voxel> the tele0 thing? or the map?
08:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tele0 works as expected
08:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> map is wrong
09:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No, u
09:54 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Yeah add random stuff and if u notice maps won't work anymore just remove them lol
10:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nothing random was added, just a fix
10:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> "lol"
10:25 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Other maps waiting for nice fixes too
10:25 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Shouldn't check it b4
10:27 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Inexplicable how you can fix something without checking the 2000 maps if you break something :kek:
10:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then go fix them
10:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this will help you https://en.cppreference.com/w/
10:33 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Why should I fix game features And break the best maps
10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this fix is pretty mild, if it was used bya apri fools joke even more
10:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway its done and wont be reverted, so the map should be fixed or just dont play it
10:34 < bridge> <C√∏ke> I don't care what was fixed, only should be checked before whether maps use these "bugs
10:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats impossible
10:35 < bridge> <C√∏ke> It's not like that 1000 maps use bugs
10:35 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Only a handful
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah, but u need to have the prior knowledge that this "bug" is used at all, or that it will affect something, you simply dont think about it
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and u coming here off with that attitude doesnth elp
10:36 < bridge> <C√∏ke> I mean it's teeworlds
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway idk why i even care talking here
10:37 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Bcs u talk all day here
10:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah, i care too much
10:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it sucks
10:37 < bridge> <C√∏ke> :justatest:
10:37 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Care too much or something different
10:38 < bridge> <C√∏ke> :monkaS:
10:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean when u work from home and can have discord open
10:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and u get bored
10:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why not talk here
10:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
10:38 < bridge> <Chairn> why not write rust instead ?
10:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im lazy too
10:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and since i write rust at work..
10:40 < bridge> <C√∏ke> ü¶ê
10:42 < bridge> <Robyt3> We could check if maps still work after patches. We would just need a complete input recording for every full run of every map and for every player of the team. Then we play back the input recording and see if the run still finishes with the code changes.
10:43 < bridge> <Voxel> WTF!!!
10:43 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1107588966389133392/image.png
10:43 < bridge> <Voxel> ddnet referen
10:44 < bridge> <bencie> LMAO
10:45 < bridge> <C√∏ke> sounds a bit complicated for only a handful of maps that use bugs
10:45 < bridge> <C√∏ke> I mean only important bugs btw
10:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> You can't know in advance which maps use bugs, if the bug is only know when it is fixed
10:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> How do you know what an important bug is?
10:46 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Who can't know? :justatest:
10:46 < bridge> <C√∏ke> When it's used to complete a map
10:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> A random person contributing code to ddnet can't know about all map bugs, including bugs that have never been published or known at all
10:47 < bridge> <C√∏ke> I think i can point out all of them
10:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> Why didn't you comment on the PR then? :bluekitty:
10:48 < bridge> <C√∏ke> What im not a PC guy
10:48 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Just askin
10:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> Well, I'm not a maps guy
10:48 < bridge> <C√∏ke> Alles gut Robert
10:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> XD
10:49 < bridge> <Voxel> I think you two should do a dragonball type fusion to create the ultimate bug-hunting form
10:49 < bridge> <C√∏ke> But I need soapy for it
10:49 < bridge> <C√∏ke> And Jimmy
10:49 < bridge> <Voxel> Skystrife, too
10:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> Supporting input recordings would allow TAS though :justatest:
10:50 < bridge> <Voxel> Duuude, DDNet TAS runs are so fun
10:50 < bridge> <Voxel> Duuude, DDNet TAS runs are so fun to watch
10:50 < bridge> <Voxel> Have you seen what Headshot does in his private server?
10:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> But TAS are probably banned on other servers, right?
10:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> So you can only use it on your own
10:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> And if it was added to official client, then we would need a flag to prevent using it on servers that don't allow it
10:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats a pc guy
10:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> npc
10:53 < bridge> <Voxel> Yeah, they're not connected to the leaderboard, or any official server

10:53 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684140800.png
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> nice edit
10:53 < bridge> <Voxel> :justatest: I didn't want to sound like I did them because I genuinely don't
10:54 < bridge> <C√∏ke> u
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> saved
10:56 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's definitely a suitable game for TAS
10:58 < bridge> <Voxel> Though the one main question about if we ever WERE to implement it is, how would we go by optimizing it if we were to share these runs around?
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> !ryo aaa
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki sos i think your py decompression code has bugs ._.
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never claimed otherwise
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Py... Makes sense
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragon we need a command to ping u
11:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks gh contributors still hasnt updated
11:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i feel lied
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> !jup tru
11:40 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ‚ú™
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> ryo watf ur huffman uses 100% cpu of one core since 7mins to decompress 20 bytes xd
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> jup what command u want to ping me?
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> !add_ping_pong c ChillerDragon
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> !c

11:45 <+ChillerDragon> !add_ping_pong c++ ChillerDragon++
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now !c 1+1 not working anymore btw
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> never planned to add c 
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> only js
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It was there
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> wat
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It said. Ub
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> ah true
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or segfault
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> ur right
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> was very funi
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> i really dc
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But who cares, now it's gone
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> pick watever cmd u want to ping me
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's ok like dis

11:46 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon++
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> it pings ffs
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epic enough
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> if rust pings ryo and c++ pings me we need !nim to ping deen axax
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> !vulkan i added !nim for deen now :)
11:50 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ‚ú™
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> True
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epic
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> !rust merge my py pr or riot
11:59 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> we gonna revive TeeAI pog
12:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I think we shouldn't hold back on fixing the obfuscation
12:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, it's not really useless nowadays; I can still use it to get unreadable text etc.
12:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: should I publish my libtw2 huffman for python?
12:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's pretty battle-tested
12:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @C√∏ke the potentially broken maps are here ^
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 oh yes please :)
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> would kill my nice zero depency package but its worth it i guess
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im a blogger https://edgarluque.com/blog/daily-gentoo/
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wanted to write something, even if its bad and short xd
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> size doesnt matter they say
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice, just a "it should use more rust tho is missing"
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> !c++
12:35 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon++
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i merged ur prs
12:55 <+ChillerDragon> pog pog
12:56 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/edg-l/TeeAI/graphs/contributors
12:56 <+ChillerDragon> i hijacked ur repo ez
12:57 <+ChillerDragon> did u ever get ur bot running and not crash? for me its full of python import errors and nonetype errors
13:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> read the project description
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> ye ye i red but i mean u changed ur email or whatever and now in the contributors tab its only me xd
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> also saw the comment about it not working but kinda assumed it would work more
13:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Ryozuki how far did you get (TeeAI). I (and some other friends) used StableBaselines3 and got somewhat respectibly far but then hit a wall where it just gets stuck :(
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never got into makign the actual ai
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oh xD makes sense
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 is your project public?
14:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ofc
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> send
14:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://github.com/Inateblig/KoGAI

14:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> u explained me alr and i forgot how it worked
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> u made some fifo adjustments right?
14:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah to the ddnet client so the python gets the input
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> chot
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> gigachad ryo rewrote whole tw in python
14:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye xD

16:43 <+ChillerDragon> ez hooman
16:44 < bridge> <Voxel> how many of these screenshots exist
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> out data engineering team collected a uncrackable amount of 22 images https://github.com/TeeCaptcha/data
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> with well obfuscated solutions https://github.com/TeeCaptcha/data/blob/master/22/solution.json
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> our*
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> google recaptcha team tried to buy us multiple times but we declined since we are confident we will exceed googles market share
16:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:49 < bridge> <Voxel> xd
16:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am now using libinput to find the /dev/input/eventX for the mouses and to interpret them so I can get each mouse's input separetely. I'm guessing this is a Linux-only solution though (maybe UNIX too idk).
16:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> In windows maybe you could run it with wsl.
16:50 < bridge> <Voxel> imagine if google actually bought ddnet, do you think it'll become closed source almost immediately
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> google does some open src too
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> but yea idk if there are big corpos that have open source games not that i am aware of
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> i guess the biggest opensourceish game is minecraft
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> publishing the source code is illegal but decompiling isnt and ms even shares the class and var name mappings these days so its legally closed src but technically open src
16:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> They'll abandon it the moment they see the source code :kek:
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> but i guess google would just offer roby a job and go closed src to better avoid botters
16:55 < bridge> <Voxel> imagine minecraft does go open source and people actually make it run faster
16:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> or make better hack clients
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> it is the case rn already @Voxel
16:56 < bridge> <Voxel> nah they'd make it closed source to extract people's info
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> the paper and spigot ppl get the mappings from ms as i said so they have the code and their performant patches get merged into the official game from time to time
16:56 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> making teeworlds p2w with the skins
16:56 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> oh no, that means google will buy teeskins db too
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> thats more valve buying it xd
16:56 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
16:57 < bridge> <Learath2> You sure? I remember them extracting the hooks from the jar
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> google will put ads and sell users data but keep everything free
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 they started doing that at some point
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they dont get mappings iirc
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> they did not use to
16:57 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> popping advertisements on MOTD
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> thats why there was yarn
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> the unofficial mappings

18:43 < bridge> <Voxel> do you think ddnet will become its own movie maker if TAS input handling is added
18:43 < bridge> <Voxel> ive talked about this too much but i cant code it for the life of me

19:51 <+ChillerDragon> its pure javascript actually
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> wait my irc client or !sh ? 
19:52 < bridge> <Voxel> ryoz is going to bully you

19:52 <+ChillerDragon> nah jk its just a terminal thingie
19:53 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah i thought so
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> https://weechat.org/
19:53 < bridge> <Voxel> what can you do in it that discord cant
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> use a terminal client
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> its against discord tos to use a terminal client actually
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> in general i have way more freedom what to do and not do
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> also its much more lightweight
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> and doesnt spy on me
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> free software
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> i sometimes regret deleting whatsapp but leaving discord and windows behind makes me happy every day
19:56 < bridge> <Voxel> when windows 10 support ends ill consider linux
19:56 < bridge> <Voxel> but then again i wouldnt know how to run it as a   casual computer user
19:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Trust me I am as casual as it gets just get some gnome it‚Äôs fool proof
20:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Installation is the hardest part usage is easy
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684175331.png
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> minecraft copyright expired in 2023
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> imma claim that
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> !jup lawyer juspti is that legal?
20:29 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ‚ú™
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> scroll to da bottom here https://www.minecraft.net/en-us
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly not ;/
20:30 <+ChillerDragon> fk
20:31 <+ChillerDragon> dont ask me why i browse minecraft hp
20:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't we all do from time to time
20:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> tru
21:30 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Ryozuki For some reason `rustup override` does not work with Visual Studio, so I needed to set the default toolchain to `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` so fix VS compilation
21:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ohh
21:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> document it xd
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !rust its your fault
21:32 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
21:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wat
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c nothing
21:43 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
21:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> The `rustup override` doesn't seem to work for the gnu toolchain either
21:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> well, at least I can switch that one MSVC bug and then go back to default gnu
21:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> well, at least I can fix that one MSVC bug and then go back to default gnu
22:12 < bridge> <Patiga> in case you haven't seen that yet, you can do `cargo +<toolchain> <command>` to run the cargo command with the specified toolchain
22:12 < bridge> <Patiga> (e.g. `cargo +nightly build`). I don't have the full context so I don't know if it is applicable
22:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> I never run cargo manually though when compiling ddnet. The issue is that both MSVC and GNU+make seem to ignore the rustup override and always use the default
22:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 there is a env var
22:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN (default: none) If set, will override the toolchain used for all rust tool invocations. A toolchain with this name should be installed, or invocations will fail.
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/environment-variables.html
22:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> but can I set different values for different build folders?
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm i wonder
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe with a .env
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk
22:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> I don't think that exists on Windows
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it doesnt exist on linux either
22:42 < bridge> <Robyt3> I'll just change the default when I need to, I don't need MSVC very often anyway
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> .env is a common file used to load envs
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i load them with the crate dotenvy
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk if they use it
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> probs not
22:44 <+ChillerDragon> there is environment management for windows
22:44 < bridge> <Patiga> I mean there is also the `rust-toolchain.toml` file, in the project directory https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> ah shit i can not find the tool again but there was something for env on windows i saw it when i spent one day just trying to make windows build setup speedrun
22:51 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Jupeyy_Keks Any idea how #6578 happens?
22:51 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6578
23:39 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> As a "casual user" myself, if you know where to get your drivers from, then any Ubuntu based OS Distro will work fine for you
23:40 < bridge> <Teero> bloatware
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Things you can do as a casual user:
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You get updates which won't bloat your system
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You get to choose which apps to update and when to update
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You get to delete whatever apps you don't like (if you know how to use apt)
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You don't need to worry about security as much, since most programs you run will always come off of your distro's webstore or from Flatpack, a famous and yet the best store for apps
23:42 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Things you cannot do as a casual user:
23:42 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Code, so unless you are interested in it, you'll have to figure out how to update your drivers
23:42 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> If you've upgraded your drivers, then that's all there is to it üòÑ
23:42 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ubuntu itself it, but it's open source
23:42 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ubuntu itself is, but it's open source
23:43 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> such as Linux Mint and PopOS are great options
23:43 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> PopOS is GNOME based, but it's even more customizable imo
23:43 < bridge> <Teero> arch linux and only arch my true love‚ù§Ô∏è
23:44 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I haven't tried it
23:58 < bridge> <Teero> arch and only arch, my true love ‚ù§Ô∏è
