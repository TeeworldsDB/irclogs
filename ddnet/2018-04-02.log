14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is jitter?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 hey i was wondering, sometimes i even have no time to vote_no because the vote passed already. i thought this was fixed, is this only for moderators or also for helpers?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If i remember correctly, votes last full length if a moderator is in "active moderator mode"
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vote_no is for helpers in ddnet yes
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If i remember correctly, votes last full length if a moderator is in "active moderator mode"

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is this good or bad?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well if I logged in on rcon the votes don't last the full length if there is voted enough.
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you have to do ``moderate`` first
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> ah damm
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> The struggle was real with a full server on back in time xd
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not my problems tho.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is there something we can do about dummy votes? my hammerfly partner got kicked on half map Back In Time because some1 kicked his dummy (No reason given) and he said he was afk
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> votes get passed in 10 sec there is no time as a helper to check who got voted why or as a dummy user to say something in chat during hammerfly
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> were u in /team
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you want to make dummies unbanable?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> could we announce in chat ``'playerx' called a vote to kick 'player2' and dummy 'player2' ``
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i uninstalled teams in my chillerbot @noby
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> try using official ddnet client instead of bot client i guess
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im using official ddnet client..
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i dont use bad commands like /spec or /team
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bad commands?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes they harm
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> everyone who is affected depends on command and situation
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i want to play in smaller teams i can play offline and start a lanparty
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats a multiplayer game thats why i want multiple players
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and then ur limited to only people close to u and cant save ur rank (??)
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why would i exclude others and stop helping and stop playing in teams
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so that u dont get funvoted :mmm:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> theres a reason they added these commands
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait whats wrong with /spec xdd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIQcoUXVgg
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its pretty much the same in ddrace
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nice voice
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi i have an idea for imrpoving the vanilla skins only system without having a client restart.
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what about doing it like with the kitty skins: setting every skin that is not one of the vanilla skins to default and just removing the ones from the list when the Vanilla skins only button is ticked.

20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats what she said
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> hi developers how are you?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b that was for map votes
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but leaving an AFK dummy in t0 can block a whole team
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't do that
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not done for kickvotes because trolls should be kicked fast, if possible
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not always have 35s to cause destruction even if the rest of the server agrees to kick them
