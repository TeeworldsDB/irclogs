00:00 <+nemo2> systems have more and more RAM - probably mattered back when we were trying to support really wimpy specs
00:00 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: collision trees or sth?
00:00 <@heinrich5991> like you have one big square
00:00 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: hm? all collision is pixel based â˜º
00:00 <+eeeee> agree, generally better to spend time adding new features for 95% of your users than making optimizations for the remaining 5%
00:01 <@heinrich5991> which splits into four more squares if the collision isn't the same over the whole square
00:01 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: oh. no
00:01 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: warmux experimented with that kind of model
00:01 <+nemo2> they never did get it to work properly w/ a fully destructible pixel world
00:01 <@heinrich5991> mhh
00:01 <@heinrich5991> okay
00:01 <+nemo2> don't see much benefit in it tbh
00:02 <+eeeee> heinrich5991: i see how that supports efficient point collision tests, but do you know how to do the line segment collision thing that tw needs?
00:02 <@heinrich5991> isn't that easily possible as well?
00:02 <@heinrich5991> you check the squares the line goes through
00:03 <@heinrich5991> which is better than the current: check after 1 "game-distance"
00:03 <+eeeee> yeah but how fast is it when your tree is dense
00:04 <+nemo2> https://hg.hedgewars.org/hedgewars/file/tip/hedgewars/uCollisions.pas  here's all the collision tests btw
00:04 <+nemo2> they are maskable by terrain type
00:04 <+nemo2> mostly used to pass through hogs and objects
00:04 <+nemo2> but occasionally other things
00:05 <+eeeee> uh tfw i just now realized you're coding in pascal.. haven't seen any pascal codez in a long time
00:06 <+nemo2> eeeee: Rust is on the todo ðŸ˜‰
00:07 <+eeeee> cool
00:07 <+nemo2> it's a pretty C-like pascal. no OOP
00:07 <+eeeee> why though?
00:07 <+nemo2> why rust?
00:07 <+eeeee> yeah
00:07 <+nemo2> ton of reasons
00:07 <+nemo2> freepascal has had many compiler bugs over time. optimises poorly, has no llvm support.
00:08 <+eeeee> well i mean, C+ kind of works fine for teeworlds for example
00:08 <+nemo2> we constantly get people complaining about syntax.  I have relatively little sympathy for folks who can't figure out that mapping but it is a minor issue
00:08 <+nemo2> rust though would free us from our occasional fails on things like failure to initialise or bad pointer math
00:08 <+eeeee> we're even migrating from C+ to C++ now
00:08 <+nemo2> wait. I thought that was a typo
00:08 <+nemo2> "C+" is what exactly
00:09 <+eeeee> haha, C+ is when your code isn't using stl or most modern C++ features but still isn't C either
00:09 <+nemo2> eeeee: https://hg.hedgewars.org/hedgewars/file/tip/gameServer2/src  BTW
00:09 <+nemo2> ah
00:09 <+nemo2> never seen that as a term before
00:10 <+nemo2> eeeee: buuut, yeah, I wouldn't wish C++ on anyone
00:10 <+nemo2> I understand if you're already using it tho
00:10 <+eeeee> biggest advantage of c++ is that many people know it. i think our community would've been even smaller if we used rust
00:11 <+nemo2> how many active devs do you have?
00:11 <+eeeee> idk like 1.5 or so
00:11 <+nemo2> lol
00:11 <+nemo2> yeah. I'm not gonna worry too much about that TBH
00:11 <+nemo2> rust has a decent community and I think any dev worth their salt can pick it up ok
00:12 <+eeeee> fstd: are thou worth your salt?
00:13 <+nemo2> eeeee: doubt community could get much smaller than 1.5 ðŸ˜‰
00:13 <+eeeee> vanilla community did
00:14 <+nemo2> well. even w/ pascal we still have like 4 people still touching engine
00:14 <+nemo2> so I think we'll be fine
00:15 <+nemo2> hm. correction 5
00:16 <+Learath2> I think on the most active periods of last year we even had 3 people working on code \o/
00:18 <+nemo2> eeeee: not to mention that most of the remaining devs are fans of rust anyway sooo
00:18 <+nemo2> transition will never happen w/o that anyway
00:39 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2
00:39 <@heinrich5991> wrt rust ;)
00:40 <+nemo2> cool â˜º
00:41 <+nemo2> eeeee: see. you'd still have one dev ðŸ˜ƒ
00:41 <@heinrich5991> it has a MVP server :)
00:41 <@heinrich5991> you can walk around
00:42 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: the kind of things that happen with c++ but not with rust btw: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/946
00:43 <+eeeee> true but i'd rather have more devs in community than easy concurrency :P
00:43 <+eeeee> most tw servers are not massively multiplayer anyway, work just fine with 1 thread
00:44 <@heinrich5991> :)
00:44 <+nemo2> we had a lot of memory problems w/ haskell in past when server had a lot of activity
00:44 <+eeeee> i'd probably feel more in favor of rust if i still cared about running 128 player blocker servers
00:45 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: memory problems with haskell? sounds wrong :P
00:45 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: uhhhh
00:45 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: seriously? â˜º
00:46 <@heinrich5991> oh, as in: out of memory?
00:46 <+nemo2> yes
00:46 <@heinrich5991> ah
00:46 <+nemo2> gigabytes worth
00:46 <@heinrich5991> I wondered how you'd get segfaults with haskell ^^
00:46 <+nemo2> haha
00:46 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: anyway. I really am skeptical that C++ would draw more devs than Rust â˜º
00:46 <+nemo2> personally I avoid C++ like the plague nowdays
00:47 <@heinrich5991> ask Learath2, fstd for their opinion about rust :)
00:47  * fstd fetches some WD40 just in case
00:47 <+fstd> also have to sleep :( nite
00:47 <+eeeee> and speaking of langs, i wish someone did rewrite gamecore in lua
00:49 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: what's their opinion of haskell? â˜º
00:50 <@heinrich5991> it's a fine language
00:50 <@heinrich5991> why do you ask? :)
00:51 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: dunno.  just wondering if dislike of rust extended
00:51 <+nemo2> there's similarities
00:51 <@heinrich5991> not really rust extended :)
00:52 <@heinrich5991> IMO
00:52 <@heinrich5991> different goals
00:52 <+nemo2> I mean
00:53 <+nemo2> if their dislike of rust extended to haskell
00:53 <+nemo2> due to similar features
00:53 <@heinrich5991> ohhh
00:53 <@heinrich5991> *their* opinion on haskell
00:53 <@heinrich5991> dunno
00:54 <@heinrich5991> probably sth like "some academic language"
00:54 <@heinrich5991> if I had to guess
02:21 <+Learath2> aha, memory problems with haskell, KNEW it not way a functional language works as well as heinrich5991 promised :D
02:22 <@heinrich5991> memory problems as in "too much memory used"
02:22 <+Learath2> s/not/no/
02:22 <@heinrich5991> (just to clarify)
02:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @HMH can you explain the `sqlstr::FuzzyString` function to me
02:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ?
02:43 <+nemo2> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7768536/space-leaks-in-haskell
02:44 <+nemo2> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10263964
02:44 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: rust doesn't do that kinda thing
02:45 <@heinrich5991> space leaks? no
02:46 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: up for a little ddrace? P
02:46 <@heinrich5991> :P
02:48 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: kid bedtime
02:48 <@heinrich5991> k
02:49 <+nemo2> should have asked any time in last couple of hours
02:49 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: think I screwed up hedgewars release â˜¹
02:49 <+nemo2> feeling pretty sad about that
02:49 <@heinrich5991> why?
02:49 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: see last 2 commits in channel
02:49 <+nemo2> think I did something dumb
02:50 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: I'd added basic script hashing. was intended to catch screwups on part of people writing scripts and not distributing 'em to all players
02:50 <+nemo2> but also to make life slightly harder for naughty people "augmenting" their scripts
02:50 <+nemo2> oddly enough. there are people who write lua cheats but can't be bothered to rebuild their engine to mask them
02:50 <@heinrich5991> oh, so you don't verify other people's physics?
02:51 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: well it is deterministic lockstep
02:51 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: the cheats were informational
02:51 <@heinrich5991> ah :)
02:51 <+nemo2> one of the things I didn't get around to doing was changing highlander to only deal out weapons on start of that player's turn
02:51 <+nemo2> that would have helped a little
02:52 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: anyway. I think I used an uninitialised RNG â˜¹
02:52 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: the screwed up script preview is bad on its own
02:52 <+nemo2> but if I did that, gotta rerelease since desyncs will just happen
02:59 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: uninitialized PRNG should just be initialized with a fixed seed
02:59 <@heinrich5991> at least that's how I've usually seen it in the C stdlib
03:01 <+eeeee> turbo pascal used fixed seed as well i think ^^
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> @HMH whats the problem with fake entities in maps for example Intercepter
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what do you mean, fake entities?
03:28 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Konsti ?
03:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: would you be against preloading hsts for ddnet.tw?
03:36 <@heinrich5991> also: if I may, I'd like to add Content-Security-Policy: block-all-mixed-content (or Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests), which blocks all non-https scripts, images, etc. (or upgrades them to https)
03:41 <+eeeee> and also X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-DNS-Prefetch-Control, X-XSS-Protection, X-Download-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options while you're at it? :D
03:43 <@heinrich5991> what are these? ^^
03:44 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: what's the time in your timezone?
03:44 <+eeeee> attempts to plug various holes in web
03:44 <+eeeee> 18:44
03:50 <+eeeee> e.g. X-Frame-Options is for the following case: imagine someone knows you have admin on ddnet forum and they want to make you ban fstd there. what attacker can do is lure you to some innocious website (say, freeclientteeworlds.com) and once you visit that site they open an iframe at forum.ddnet.tw/ban/fstd location but render it transparent and also render an opaque "download free client teeworlds no sms or 
03:50 <+eeeee> registration" button right in the same place as "ban fstd" button in the iframe
03:50 <@heinrich5991> ah
03:50 <+eeeee> so called "click jacking"
03:50 <@heinrich5991> so you can prevent iframing your page
03:50 <+eeeee> yea
03:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> @heinrich5991 Fake entities are what the name says, it looks like a block/kill/freeze/whatever in entities but its just a fake
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how does that work?
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> anyway
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I guess you can imagine yourself why that is undesirable ðŸ˜ƒ
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> No
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> I used it for design
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Looks better
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> In entities
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> entities aren't for design ðŸ˜ƒ
03:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> entities aren't for design ðŸ™‚
03:53 <+eeeee> this iframe h4x got popular after web coders learned to protect against CSRF
03:53 <@heinrich5991> I see
03:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Ofc they are cuz i allways play with entities :feelsbadman:
03:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> @heinrich5991  give me mod password i will clean funvoters and trols
03:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> there is no single mod password
03:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> what ya mean
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> @Roco  quo4on7A
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Konsti then design the main map in a way that satisfies you and play without entities
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> heinrich go channel 3
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> channel for 2
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> not right now
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> going to sleep
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> why
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> y
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> just some letters for the mod pw
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> so?
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> there is no single mod pw
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> was fÃ¼r single pw?
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> hat jeder ein eigenes?
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and I don't have one, as it stands ðŸ™‚
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> y
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> @heinrich5991 stop that xD, playing with design is shit, also my own ones.
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> And i dont use fake entities for cheating, just for make things looking cool and hide some secrets
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> so give me admin pw
03:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't have any pw for the servers
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Konsti well no
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Roco> But access to masterservers?
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Well yes
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> I showed testers before release
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Konsti don't even bother, that's the final answer
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> They didnt have problems
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> great, I'll talk to the testers if you want ðŸ™‚
03:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Roco I don't have access to the game servers
03:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Its released more than 4 month and no one died yet :feelsamazingman:
03:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so what, I don't care
03:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> OK end discussion :ddnet_icon:
03:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ™‚
03:57 <+ddnet-discord> <abcqwerty> :banhammer:
08:52 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @heinrich5991 no problem with hsts. if you can make sure all pictures still work, sure
08:53 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> nemo2: we have some kind of android version, but no one bothered to port it to sdl2 yet unfortunately
09:17  * fstd disapproves of the 'ban fstd button' technology
09:39 <@heinrich5991> fstd: 'ban fstd button'?
09:43 <+fstd> i know a couple people who'd happily adopt that new internet standard
09:43 <+fstd> we could sell them ban fstd button as a service
14:30 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: yeeeeah... unc0rr made his on PRNG long ago
14:30 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: I have no idea why
14:30 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: it's kinda nice to see the moving parts
14:30 <+nemo2> thankfully is not for encryption
14:30 <+nemo2> maybe freepascal didn't have a good RNG 11 years ago?
20:23 <+eeeee> don't need a completely new standard for the ban fstd button, could just add another flag to the widely adopted rfc3514
