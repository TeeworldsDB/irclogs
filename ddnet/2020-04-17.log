07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean without sql? It should create a record file and show that
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Yea its creating a file but you can see the ranks only when u use /top5
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> In the scoreboard is nothing after a reconnect
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Yea its creating a file but you can't see the ranks only when u use /top5
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Yea its creating a file but you can see the ranks only when u use /top5
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª your fng2 sends malformed server commands just so you know
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you don't seem to be maintaining it anymore though, so not sure
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the current source?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and server commands = rcon?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well is the source on your github the "current" one?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You register your commands with a `0x0`Â argument list instead of a `""`, which your libc happily translates to `(null)` while packing.
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The argument list of `/help` is also broken `<cmdlist>` isn't in a format that's recognized
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> furthermore it doesn't even compile ðŸ˜›
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Trafalgar Law ah yeah, that's intentional
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or well, not implemented
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> help allows both no argument or a cmd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for me it compiles fine
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah the argument should be null checked for 0.7 sent ðŸ˜„
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "<cmdlist> isn't in a format that's recognized" but 0.7 doesnt care about any format since it natively adds commands
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> think I'm bored of contributing to vanilla
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª master now cares about the argument list
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut, law and the others are caught up, fng2 is the only server I found that doesn't parse correctly
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki why did you name that field in the msg m_Arguments but send the entire command string?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > think I'm bored of contributing to vanilla
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now dune is going to make me revert it to sending the entire command string because @Jupstar âœª used it as the entire command string
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made it so the server would parse the arguments in his own way
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but why not strip the command before sending the rest?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i forgot
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜¦
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's going to be like that forever now because vanilla is unable to evolve
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because that one server still running 0.7.4 needs to work perfectly
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they don't like compatibility code either, so it'll get an issue with the tag 0.8 which will never happen
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 wtf is that guy mad? XD
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, well he isn't he just has different priorities
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i only used it bcs it worked like that
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can always change my code
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> idc ðŸ˜„
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what guy?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dune
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The vanilla attitude is "within the current major there should be no compatibility breakage at all" which is a good idea
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but combined with "major releases will only happen twice every decade" it really stops evolution
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i agree with u
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually I'm not even sure if 0.6 was in this decade
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is there something special with the environment cmake builds in?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't get relative imports working for the life of me
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check working dir though
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> working dir is the root
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it doesn't work from root either
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can get ninja to output the commands
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-v` I think
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have what ninja executed
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't get it to work myself either
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you know how relative imports are supposed to work? even with `__init__.py`Â files I can't get them to work
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> python packages are a mess
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well okay, I'll just use importlib and import with path
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I could code a library for python one day
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "libsaneimports"
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay the problem is that imports in functions don't work the the way I thought they worked
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> importing datatypes in one function means that the global scope now has datatypes
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which means when the seven version gets loaded it uses the 0.6 version of datatypes, which is missing NetFlag
18:35 <+ChillerDragun> what are you working on? o.O
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm adding the 0.7 protocol files into 0.6
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so we can refer to constants, use proper unpacking
