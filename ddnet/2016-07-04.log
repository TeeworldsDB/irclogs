01:39 < emprix> hallo
14:15 < ddnet-commits> dennis go dennis
14:15 <+xush_> who are you?
21:23 <+Mr_> I read the irc logs and Ryozuki seems to think my client "Someone" runs the servers "DickerDennisNet" i would just like to clarify that "Someone" does not run these servers and he is not affiliated with the group that runs "DickerDennisNet" or the "Illuminati Blocker" servers
21:23 <+xush_> so smart
21:24 <+Mr_> I would also like the list that a few members of this group are "Xush (meskalin), Henritees, Vali, Captain Teemo, Acension, FuroS"
21:25 <+Henningstone> cute
21:25 <+Mr_> Please do not confuse my client with any of these people
21:25 <+xush_> what the fuck :D
21:25 <+xush_> you are a real hero sir. thanks for bringing some light in that mystery
21:26 <+Mr_> I just dont want my client confused in any of this
21:26 <+xush_> what client dude
21:26 <+xush_> who are you even
21:26 <+Mr_> I represent "Someone"
21:27 <+Henningstone> loll he is a lawyer
21:27 <+xush_> and who would ever care about your client noone has ever heared of? D:
21:29 <+xush_> ah, its the troll, i totally forgot, sorry.
21:51 <+ochristi> uhm why does the game suddenly think the mousebutton I used for years, which was mouse7 is now mouse5? I updated to 10.2
21:55 <+ochristi> and some other binds are screwed up aswell, like something I had on "Ã¤" it was registered as "backslash", now if I bin that key it registers as "&228"
21:57 <+Ryozuki> what client
21:57 <+Ryozuki> wtf?
21:59 <+Ryozuki> @ochristi because client now uses sdl2
21:59 <+ochristi> I see
22:00 <+ochristi> so incompatible confs starting now :(
22:02 <+Ryozuki> ?
22:24 <+ochristi> I assume, if I want to use the conf with different clients
22:24 <+ochristi> hence versions with sdl1
22:24 <+ochristi> but I suppose I might have different confs anyway for those
22:32 <@deen> ochristi: other clients use settings.cfg, ddnet uses settings_ddnet.cfg
22:32 <+ochristi> ah right, thanks for the hint
