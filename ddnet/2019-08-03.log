11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> was too lazy to be honest but i just realized my worst case will overlap with the time xd so i have to fix it anyways
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> worst case? you mean WWWW...
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its filling the small scoreboard full
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and if u finished it will overlap
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or wait if there is a rank1 *
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and if the rank 1 is 1000 min?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then the map isnt WWWWWW xd
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u never know
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hue how long does it normally take to add a new apt repo?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> This afk emote stuff is bugging sometimes
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> doesnt disappear when player is active again
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> update to 12.6.1
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Shouldnâ€™t that work just fine if the server is updated? What does the client do?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MIPOLO> hi
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MIPOLO> chiller dragon?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon it was a client bug nobo
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check commit
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MIPOLO> IS YOU?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh ok bug sounds fine i thought the feature needed the client
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk how to explain it better xd
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but all seems fine
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was a client bug
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but for the feature to work, we need the client and the server
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the client just didnt reset m_Afk, so servers that dont use the new flags dont send anything, and some players stay afk on your client
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> resulting in still showing the emote
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh so u actually need an client update
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/607209771032117259
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i really have no clue about the ddnet obj stuff i only know emotes can be sent by server and there would be no need to overcomplicate it with client stuff
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is not an emote
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, not a normal one
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this emote is in the position of the chat bubble
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i see i guess to allow some client configuration etc
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or not?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or why is it special
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is special so that we dont have to resend a normal emote every 2sec
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be ugly
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this stays in its position
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You arent really into the new ddnet, arent you?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> back then we only had freeze
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> it is not an emote basically
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> but it uses the emoticons just like the chatbubble
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so client could also mark the afk tees differnetly
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> the server send the afk states to the client but m_Afk was never reset so when joining a server which didnt send the flag it just kept the old ones
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> yes before the afk emote it was a exclamationmark in the nameplate
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol i am wathcing a youtube video while uploading two videos and i can still play tw xd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lill better than rus servers
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> aslong as you have enough bandwith left you should be fine
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> if you have enough time to and care alot about your gaming experience you could setup an untangle firewall
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ImpactDevelopment/ImpactClient/wiki
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can someone please scroll down here
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> to the bottom and tell me what the footer reads?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> buy teeworlds for free at teeworlds.com xd
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wtf?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how am i able to edit that for all users? xd
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's a wiki?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only the footer as far as i understood
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i also cant go to wikipedia and just change stuff with it getting applied instantly?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you used to be able to do that
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> before 2008
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm old ðŸ˜„
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha crazy
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github ban incoming
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps undo the vandalism?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am really scared of getting github striked i have my life on github
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> before i edited the footer it said "poopopopo"
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and now it is advertising the best open source game ever
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i see no vandalism
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you see no vandalism in "buy teeworlds for free at teeworlds.com xd"
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxD
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and yet you're scared to be banned)
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fair point
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its tricky situation
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> restoring "pooopopop" also feels wrong tbh
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i really dont understand why it onlky lets me edit the footer
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then write something else there
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> preferably not something related to teeworlds
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya tried m best to fix it xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon write "you lost the game"
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no u
