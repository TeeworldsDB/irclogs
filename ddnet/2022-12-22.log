01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> do you guys know a way to locally delete a pr branch ? The branches are fetched using `fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*` in git config file. I wanna delete `remotes/origin/pr/5438` that completely messes up the log
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> But when i do `git branch -d (or -D) origin/pr/5438` i get `branch not found`
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i also tried `git branch -D remotes/origin/pr/5438`
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Looks like you might want to remove it remotely? `git push origin --delete pr/5438`? I've never used this kind of setup though
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, just on local, i cant remove it remotely
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> github doesn't allow
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> github doesn't allow that
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is why i want to delete it:

01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> thx @ChillerDragon ðŸ˜„
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the git config i use fetches all the prs from the remote, i wanna delete this specific pr and all its commits locally only
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe @ChillerDragon @ChillerDragon.* can empty the branch?
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> @Chairn stop hating on my pr i feel offended https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5438 is quality stuff you should enjoy watching at it
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> i deleted the branch for you UwU :3 not sure if that helps tho and what you even do to see those unmerged commits in your log
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> maybe you have to wipe your .git repo or ddnet has to file a support request with github to clean the cached data
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> or i do have to do that idk
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> when holding down a key and then also additionally holding down another key in any input field on my system first the first key is sent then one occurence of the 2nd then a short break and then the other keys of the 2nd
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> does this sentence make sense?
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> any idea how to get rid of the break or how this break is called?
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> for example when i hold down a and then ad while the ddnet chat is open it types "aaaaaaaaaaaad<shortbreak>ddddddddddd"
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> when the chat is closed i do not walk left, walk right 1 tick (short break) continue walking right
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> key repetition
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> it is walk left, walk right
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is what the concept is called
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you want to get rid of it?
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> browser game
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> when i listen for keyup in javascript it seems to do the same
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> i get stuck for a sec when i change direction
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like you need to process events differently
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not relying on key repetition
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> isnt repetition only holding down one key? thats not a problem its more adding a new key thats held
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> oh shit ur right
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> i thought i do not depend on repetition but i do 
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> thanks a lot :)
13:21 <+ChillerDragon> my game just became a shitload smoother thanks @heinrich5991 it works like a charm
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool ðŸ™‚ link?
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://ocp.zillyhuhn.com/
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> i think ima switch from the client sending move dir every tick to only sending move start and move stop. How does teeworlds do it? I assume similar thats why timeout causes stuck movements. And it reduces traffic by like a lot.
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it sends the the input when it changes or at least every 0.5s I think
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know the exact timeout
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> except for some direct inputs, like firing
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens for firing?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we send the input instantly, and only once. but mayber I misremember since jetpack and other weapons seem to work fine ðŸ˜„
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> yea that makes so much sense idk how i never thought about it. So far all my games i have been sending keys held and somehow thought teeworlds does the same haha
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no... you did the worst possible... You had to force push the branch to a single empty commit...
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> now, i think there's no way to get rid of all these ðŸ˜¢
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> what's the output of `git remote show origin`? does the PR ref show up there?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `refs/pull/5438/head tracked`
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> So you can you remove the remote? Or does it appear again when fetching?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if i remove the remote, i wont have new PRs show up
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> So this appears as a remote branch for the origin remote?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I think @ChillerDragon can restore the branch and force push a single empty commit to completely remove it
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might need to reopen the PR in the meantime
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```bash
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> $ git branch -a
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> remotes/origin/pr/5438
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```bash
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> $ git branch -a
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> * master
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>   remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>   remotes/origin/master
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>   remotes/origin/pr/10
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>   ## all the prs
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> google made this
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for anyone who wants to learn rust
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho the rust bbook is the best imho
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rust reference is best, bcs it doesnt annoy you with useless text ðŸ˜‰
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> hi, does anyone have a map tool to double a map, such that 1 tile turns into a 2x2 block?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ask patiga he's map pro
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can use twmap python library
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's no scaling method though, so i guess you're gonna need to implement it yourself
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Actually a nice idea for a project
