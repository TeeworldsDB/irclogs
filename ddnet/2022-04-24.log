00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Does putting a password on a server do anything to prevent ddos?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> NO
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> No

00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what you can simply do if you don't want anyone to know you're running out a private server : simply just do not register it & do give the IP of the server to trusted people
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Ok thats good to know, thanks
09:05 < xq> Hi, just wanted to say sending this query: https://ddnet.tw/maps/?query=%27 crashes the website. 
09:06 <+ChillerDragon> bobby tables entered the game ...
09:07 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki mr web dev go fix sql injection ^
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> Aaaa who wants to explain rust lifetimes to me :D I love how the compiler suggests to remove the scope .. duh https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/2m

10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Discord Mod
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thanks
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> @irc mod
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> there isnt even message deletion on irc is there?
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> omg im about to rq rust again
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yq: Thanks, let me take a look
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> xq*
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Fixed
10:28 <+xq> :)
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bruh nowhere does it talk about "removing" a scope
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u create a player
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then put a reference to it on ur vector
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but then the player gets out of scope so its destroyed
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should just pass the player to the vector without a reference
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and why do you put it in a Box?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of a vec of mutable references  `let mut players: Vec<&mut Player> = Vec::new();` , create a vec of owned players  `let mut players: Vec<Player> = Vec::new();`
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and put them
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fn add_player(players: &mut Vec<Player>) {
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     let player = Player { x: 0, y: 0 };
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     players.push(player);
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> one tip in rust
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only use mut when u really need it
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont start typing stuff with mut
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only put it when u rly require it
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> i use my gaming mouse macro to type mut
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> thanks a lot babe i love u
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a Box is like a smart pointer
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> it does say remove the scope in rustc --explain E0597 :D 
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for values on the heap
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> yea that i understood
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> i thought i need that
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> to heap alloc it and then pass the ownership into the vector
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the error is pretty clear
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> -.-
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> borrowed value does not live long enough
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> ok i guess i tis
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> but the fix wasnt for me
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why did you use Box?
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> ok lemme try
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> because without Box it didnt work :D 
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wow chillerdragon has his personal rust trainer
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no?
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u lucky one
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with box it doesnt work
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar as you can see i really need it :D 
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because ur vector is not a vec of boxed players
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if u trollin
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> XD
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> im not
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly hate ur low effort learning
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> :D 
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u always rely on askin here
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of googling
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> im just stupid
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ye ur smiley face makes me even more upset
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> i was googling all morning
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xDDD
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mad af
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> sorri senpai
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> UwU
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just one thing
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just because u have a  Vec<Player> and it doesnt say mut in the player
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u have a mut  Vec<Player>
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can still change the players
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow thats weird
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because the vector is mutable and the vector owns the players
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> so thats mutable by default!?
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> i mean what about a mutable vector that holds immutable players?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i just said to you?
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> i thought mutable vector only means i can push into the vector not the entrys are mutable
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ifi the vector is mutable and it contains owned data
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it can mutate the owned data
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> owned data = not a reference
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> awesome that compiles :3
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> i love u ryo <3
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=a85a9b736ed55e0adbc8c847bbfb3542
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check it
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the rust playground is awesome to share stuff btw
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if its simple
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> neat
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you made me stop mining in ff14
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pay for it
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> ff14?
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> final fantasy?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a mmo xd
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> cringe
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no u
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Just upgraded to 16,0,3 and FPS is spiking like crazy
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/967738643609432095/unknown.png
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> 1k+ FPS to 100 FPS spikes too often
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Just upgraded to 16,0,3 (from 15) and FPS is spiking like crazy
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/967738643609432095/unknown.png
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Before, I had stable 1k FPS
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what does gfx_gl_major say?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and what is ur OS
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and GPU
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Windows 10 AME, Nvidia P1000
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> `gfx_gl_major = 3`
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh, the config vars were resetted for the GFX stuff, you could try vulkan in settings -> graphics -> renderer
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on CPU side:
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what i heard is that discord(the app) causes laggs
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and anti virus does weird stuff
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Ok I will try without Discord, will report back soon
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I will see if changing OpenCL does anything also
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> brb
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> All same behaviour, unfortunately
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> latest drivers from nvidia directly?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nvidia.com
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also vulkan should at least push ur fps higher really weird
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Don't get me wrong, I love Vulkan
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I will try latest drivers
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> brb
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but i wonder if there is at least no difference 😄
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah frame drops can have many reasons
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Looks like I have the latest version
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u run anti virus software?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Nope
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Windows Defender is disabled also
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Or removed, not disabled but yeah
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh, can you PM me your config?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also did you try again on DDNet 15, after the upgrade
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to make sure its really DDNet
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> My config? DDNet config? Computer config?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> DDNet config
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> jupstar is after your rcon binds!
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> also good to know ur windows defnder is off :p
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i want to hack chinese community
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or japanese
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cant remember
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> isnt pathos europe?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> isnt he pathoslego smth on github
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> ye think so
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> imagine talking like he is not here
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i connect him with scoreboard laggs on japanese font 😄
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> o
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> #809
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/809
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> such an oldie goldy
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> wow >1000
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> how do u even remember that
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno xd
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u restart ur client after changing renderer
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always expect the worst
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan must give 5k fps with any nvidia card or RQ
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> Ryo pro techsupporter
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> have you tried turning it on and off again?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no for real
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah I'm using Windows AME :D
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> whats AME 
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Pathos can u try real fullscreen just to see if that fixes it, i know IME is broken then, but worth a try
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> African Methodist Episcopal Church
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yes, every time
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> ah neat unbloated windows
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use linux
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah lol
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Pathos u have `cl_refresh_rate 288`
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> set that to 0
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Ameliorated
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> No it was 0 before, I set it to 288 to see if it was due to auto throttling
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so if cl_refresh_rate is 0 and gfx_refresh_rate is 0 it still laggs?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in "real" fullscreen
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Tried fullscreen, no change -- interestingly, usual FPS didn't go up, even though it should... hmm
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Ok I will try this combination
13:12 <+ChillerDragon> Lmao AME is illegal? :D
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Hmm stranger FPS behaviour now -- I can't really take a screenshot of the graph
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Well, let me try multiple, one sex
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> sex
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> looks like AME is deprecated
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/967745232164777984/unknown.png

13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> It does this every few seconds, interestingly enough
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can u try ddnet 15
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> lmao Cylox
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> @Pathos could you ping Cylox in chat and say "raaaaaaaawr dinosaur" for me? :D
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I will have to try this another time
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Thanks
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> No Cylox in here
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I will come back with this issue probably another time, thanks
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> meh he was on screenshot
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> blue team on fng
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> restarting win10 also solved alot of problems xd
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else remeber, usually good config vars are:
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `gfx_backend "Vulkan";gfx_refresh_rate 1000;cl_refresh_rate 0;gfx_fullscreen 1;quit`
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for good stable fps xd
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should we try setting Vulkan as default at some point? After it's been tested a bit more
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could try it out yeah, only non solvable issue is one amd gen yet
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> other issues were issues in the code
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why not open gl 3.3.0=
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs intel opengl driver on windows suck
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Vulkan is a good way to avoid these various driver issues since it's lower level
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At least that was my understanding
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> most people i talked to disliked vulkan since it had multiple bugs
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what bugs does it have?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and opengl support is kind of not ideal everywhere, since only few games use it
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for example stuff like weirdness when two clients were opened or so
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They should report those bugs...
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i never heard any complain from anyone tbh
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> actually it was the opposite
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ppl with older AMD cards could finally run the game without laggs (rx 480)
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i'll stick to 3.3.0
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean do what u want
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but if there is a problem for you pls tell
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> remember vulkan is just next gen opengl
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe we can update PTS some day and check if lower end/older hardware profits from it or if it hurts or whatever
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when i see that they name their benchmarks as "low end gpus" and then list rx vega 56 or rx 590 xDD
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Works fine for me
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Dont know if related but sometimes when i open the minimized client its bad resolution and i have to minimize again then reopen
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can check if it only happens with Vulkan
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet its an sdl issue xdddd
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just tested the latest sdl2 code
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> everything broken xD
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2.0.22 gonna be fun
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they want to release in 1 week Xd
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/5572
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i linked ddnet, so we get some views from linux enthusiasts xd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Regarding vulkan as default: Idk why, i am playing tw since many years like that, but i cant play with vsync off. Everything feels so shaky and "too much responsive" when i turn vsync off. When i change the renderer to vulkan, its the same feeling. I dont know what vsync does and i am too lazy to google it, my fps are capped at 60fps when its turned on. But thats the reason i dont like to switch to vulkan.
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan also supports vsync
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> never could play with vsync
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> gameplay becomes sooo smooth and soo unresponsive
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> its the other way around for me :D
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what about your card?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> graphic?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u turn on vulkan and vsync is your FPS set to 60fps or unlimited?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> graphic?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Radeon RX 570 Series
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Its set to 60fps
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then vsync is on
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also with amd cards make sure to use drivers from march 2022 or newer
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so newest drivers from amd directly
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but anyway not like we drop opengl, if u need it for some weird reason to have more input delay xD
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i guess most ppl prefer lower input delay tho, so you are kinda an edge case
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Yea i guess vulkan is too good and fast for me, it changes my timing a bit and i cant adapt after 10 years of playing 😢
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u probs can adapt
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just dont give it enough time
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> usually 1 week is enough
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> human brain
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> yes i guess, havent tried longer than 30min
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when yoc(a gores player) switched from vsync to non vsync he suddenly got insane player xD
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true story
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> dont give me hope :monkaS:
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still an issue? channel not receiving data, ChillerDragon?
