06:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> same xd
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh shoot, my root partition is full xd
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/891924200456069160/unknown.png
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Vacuuming done, freed 2.1G of archived journals from /var/log/journal/a503a8916b0c464887abc56e8a5782a1
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to add SystemMaxUse=100M to systemd
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok what was taking most of my root partition was pacman cache
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> freed 30gb xd
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be more useful if the pacman cache were located in my home partition which is way bigger tho
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im 2 lazy to do anything rn :monkalaugh:
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Jupstar ✪ i have `*** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so'` error on linux after adding ur fng scoreoard : (
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> and i have no clue how to deal with libs errors
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Delete build directory and try again
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who do you think will take the german chancellory? I don't see a clear lead for either CDU or SPD from outside. Greens would probably prefer SPD but I don't see FDP backing SPD. Nor do I see Greens backing CDU
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> spd
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spd probs
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/892020939775176734/i93z82ponyp71.png
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You think FDP will change their stance?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why u look at German politics xd
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well germany has an extreme amount of influence in the eu
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> SPD and CDU dont wanna work together, they will take a third one
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probs greens
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways its shit that cdu got so much again
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho I'm a bit of a politics person, so I follow a lot of different countries politics
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fucking 60+ age people
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol everywhere its 60+ age ppl
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well SPD got great results in the older demographics. Afaik they actually lost a fair bit of young peoples votes (probably shifted to the greens)
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki germany has too many of them, + we got 24% not voting at all
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The issue also is, the old cdu voters dont care whats good, they are voting cdu because its always been like that
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SPD can take the Greens but is that enough? I think they need the FDP aswell to have the votes
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If they completely wanna work without cdu, yes
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how it works here too
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only 76% of all voters voted
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like of people who are allowed to
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a lot
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah you think they will take CDU too, hmm. How would they ever agree tho. I doubt CDU wants to give up the chancellory
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd no
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ye, I think they will work with cdu tho, cdu got a lot of votes
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But:
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for reference here last elections only 66% ppl voted
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 76 is a lot
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they wont work together just as cdu and SPD, they will take another one if that will happen
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probs smaller country?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know how percentages work?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but still
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's always above 70% in turkey because compulsory voting :P
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But even in turkey with punishment for not voting we couldnt get above 90%
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 76% is rly good lets not be retardeds xd
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's fairly decent, especially with how desensitized people are from voting nowadays
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see it especially in younger people. Older generation seems to appreciate their right to vote much more. Which is partly why conservative ideas are so overrepresented
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can feel why younger ppl dont want to vote, u simply dont find anyone good enough
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i felt that last elections
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but still voted a meh one
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what i will do in the future
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if you dont vote at all you get situations like the US. Where the 25% christian evangelists control a whopping 35% of the congress
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when the elections basically get reduced to "lets vote this so this racist far-right doesnt get it"
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 10% overrepresented
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know things are fucked up
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not because most of the non voters are young people
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or in the UK, where ukip votes just went to the trash
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the us voting is hardere
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there are statistics about non-voters demographics
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to do some tax thing or smth
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> harder*
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Afaik you just need to register and not be puerto rican
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine being a us citizen and not being allowed to vote on president lmao
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/892024875462578216/combine_images-4.png
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Democracy gang
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if CDU goes into the government, all 3 parties, CDU, FDP and green will loose alot of votes
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs nobody likes laschet xD
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is laschet like
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even CDU doesnt want him xD
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka what he wants to do
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/b20b7e7b7c0e41b0a1370fa6f53a9a49/400.jpeg
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did laschet even get to be their candidate. Stupidest decision I've seen in years
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that says everything xD
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the moment he lost the election
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> laughing like a clown when ppl died bcs of the water catastrohpy
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ i found this, is it funny?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/892025295832514570/ff8piw2shzp71.png
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what it means
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They so should have picked söder, he was the much better candidate imo
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah he never was the most famous, but also as bad as he is now
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he fucked up the campaign xD
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not as bad*
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u know merkel has been in charge longer than putin
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im not that sure tbh, söder is bayern first, germany second
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now all that remains is for SPD to go a little back to it's roots and embrace workers and trade unions. Then we can finally have a major world power with a robust labour force
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SPD is not what you think
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its CDU just with minimum wage
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast Scholz represents that
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok putin was older
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm aware that they aren't really much of a difference. That's why I said they need to go back to their roots :P
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i c
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well idc who is in the might, my ideology is simple, replace humans with robots xd
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shame to see die linke losing almost 3 points
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> slavery will never stop, so slave the robots
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> instead of the humans xd
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> almost 5% actually
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2021-09-26-BT-DE/charts/index/chart_918159.jpg
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really want to take a look at the demographics of these moves when I have some time. It's really interesting to see how these happen
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its simple 40% of all voters in germany are 60+ years
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if they dont like CDU, they vote SPD and vice versa xD
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same here
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its PP and PSOE
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, interesting to have 2 parties that are essentially the same
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In turkey it's so wack. If you don't like your party, sucks to suck because it's either far right or far right or far right or center left
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And all the flavours of far right are different. One is religious, one is racist, another is a neolib in disguise
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well CDU and SPD were the leaders since 2013
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the biggest problem is that such long periods increase courrption
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw what do you think will happen? What do you predict the final coalition will be?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if FDP and green go with CDU(and CDU will probably just give FDP and green whatever they want, bcs they only care about might)
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then FDP and green will probably loose alot of their voters
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So its risky, SPD is more likely
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Soo, SPD, Green, FDP?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> depends, also possible that none of that comes, bcs FDP blocks, like in 2017
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> FDP is always a bet
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> their program and their political style
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i might work or not xD
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, FDP doesnt look very warm to the idea, that's why I was asking around
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think CDU + SPD is possible? Sounds very unlikely to me as both want the chancellory
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, not very likely, they might even prefer to trigger reelection instead
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs all younger ppl would hate this xD
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that's what I figured too, fokko made me re-think
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never say never, 2017 exactly this happened
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and SPD lost most of their voters
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if green and CDU didnt fuck up their campaign SPD wouldnt be so strong
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without the FDP though there is no way out. AfD is insane, die linke doesn't have the votes.
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could the Greens swing to CDU you thinkm
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it can work, but i'll tell you then green looses around 7-10% of their voters
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2021-09-26-BT-DE/charts/index/chart_918206.jpg
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats how much ppl want the representant to be the leader of our country
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not even CDU voters like laschet xD
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2021-09-26-BT-DE/charts/index/chart_918222.jpg
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is why green will loose most voters
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Which party has the best answers to future questions"
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> CDU = do nothing
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Scholz is a moderate tho, no? He will do nothing aswell :D
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but the SPD base is mid-left i'd say
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SPD is really green without as good climate concepts
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if you know how these parties come together
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its not like they can just decide without their base
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean they can, if they don't mind the fallout. Happens at the end of political viability. E.g. MHP in turkey aligned with the AKP because they lost 10% and they were projected to lose more.
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah for your question why die linke is so weak:
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2021-09-26-BT-DE/charts/index/chart_918244.jpg
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "I fear, that i cannot hold my life standard"
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the base doesnt like you anymore you dont need to concern yourself with their thoughts :P
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats something where die linke was strong in the past, for the worker class
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does this graph work? How many percent of that parties voters agree with the statement?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a question that is asked to the voter, and he says what party he elects
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so most ppl vote for AfD fear this
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see. Not very surprised that AfD performs so well in that metric
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So die linke used to perform better here, but they dont anymore? I wonder where these voters moved to
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where do you get these graphs? I'd like to take a look at them too
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Afd is very aggressive and simple in their language
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> E.g. just blame immigrants
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So yeah that's probably the main reason
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2021-09-26-BT-DE/index.shtml
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a very simple idea actually. Less immigrants = more for us. There is a reason it's so popular all around the world :D
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as hard as it sounds most ppl dont really think alot
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so this is an easy answer to a complex topic
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if you know the original meme, but homer says "your worst day until NOW", here he says the worst voters count until NOW
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> <@&293541515781996568> would be nice to have a couple more hands on deck
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for what
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if that role is even highlightable 😛
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Help me look for the exploit?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> troll
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the exploit
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 doubt there is a real exploit
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> vali or someone flooding servers with connecting
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was playing doto
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he's probbaly just spamming with random ips
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He shouldn't be able to get a slot allocated with random packets
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Both the ddnet and the vanilla layer require a handshake before giving a slot
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> all i can say is, that its not happening on my servers, maybe because its a 0.7 server and they have even handshakes for connecting packets and all
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he just ddosed my server today
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I think only DDNet's servers were targeted
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> KoG is gone too
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> :0
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and my server was targeted too
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Time to add a username/password login feature to play the game xD
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> another mikrotik botnet with needed scripts targeted for teeworlds :monkalaugh:
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> to*
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> CAPTCHA to join servers xD
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe it's fixed now (@Learath2)
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> KoG is gone again
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ger too
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see 200 servers now only
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye its not fixed xd
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is vanilla affected?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, it's a standard vanilla connect flood
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it causes a crash?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just ddos
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it's a dos, it will fill your server and other players won't be able to connect as a result
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it won't crash
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it does seem to cause some internal issue though, should simulate that attack and profile it sometime to see what is going wrong
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> but it does spit out a decent amount of packets according to #bot-cmds
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the missing servers are probably due to the massive reflection causing hosters to block us
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :/
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> they aren't null routed on CHN tho, which is kinda weird
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks more like a master server issue?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can conenct to qshar.com in server browser
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i can't connect to chn's ip directly as well
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The master server also uses serverinfo requests at this time, so if the hoster is dropping them that won't work either
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant the http list try to connect to the servers
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Soon(tm) we'll have the servers contact the master over http too so this will be less of an issue
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and only drop them if they dont respond for a certain time
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (the tool for it ofc)
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well we only drop them after they fail to respond to 10 serverinfo requests
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not time based?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or is there a delay
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> http list grab servers from masters tho
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the connect packet wouldn't be any more immune to hosters "smart" filters
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well the requests are sent periodically, so it is technically time based
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> they might found out exactly how much bandwidth chn servers have, and they are just keep it at threshold.
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you checked that connections can still get through from outside the great firewall?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i have no idea
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn't connect to chn6 a couple minutes ago
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i can't even connect within the wall
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> but dashboard still shows pretty high bandwidth usage
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> and it is draining data limit 🤔
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw the great firewall seems pissed

16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> that's good i suppose lol
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ any insights on bad m1 performance? https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=7282&p=69670#p69670
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say apple gives a shit about opengl xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs software renderer or smth
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://forum.ddnet.tw/download/file.php?id=40383&sid=d24a5d0c7732899b1b504082e2d48fcd
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it says 2.1 Metal
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt metal the fancy apple thing
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan just for apple fans xd
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i guess its some software renderer that uses metal, or a really bad translation layer
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ when port to vulkan
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can do that yeah
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but will probs cause like 5k lines of code, vs 1.5k for opengl 3.3
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan is really verbose
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I am sorry, I missed the point of the problem
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > it's not about fps, it's about a little delay of keyboard and mouse (like vsync)
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > actually fps on m1 looks like ok
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ i know its verbose
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but more control
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u ever try it?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not about fps, got that wrong
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got tired of setting up code to draw a triangle and never finished it
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/SuperSDL/blob/master/src/graphics/renderer.cpp>
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan is alot about, you know what your program uses
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here my old attempt
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its like writing a driver for ddnet xd
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you have fixed size memory pools
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. descriptor pools
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a rly good project btw
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a higher level api
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that can run dx 11 12 opengl vulkan
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made in rust
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i write vulkan i want full contrl xD
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else i can also use opengl
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you have to remember opengl 4.5 is really similar to dx 11
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since these two were competetors
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dota 2 will soon remove the opengl support and keep only vulkan on linux
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> opengl 3.3 is easier, but also has alot of API calls you probs wouldn't do in GL 4.5, binding stuff to units, instead of just using the objects id and stuff like that
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/892073440109031444/unknown.png
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sad we have around 1% of players only having opengl 1.x support
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Moving DDNet Technology Forward" "Remove support for everything except VK"
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that would be great
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Moving DDNet Technology Forward"  "Rewrite it in Rust"
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what they use on macOS if they are removing GL, do they support Metal already?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would indeed be easier to write vulkan only, instead of supporting opengl too 😄
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just bcs its so different
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a fairly robust VK -> Metal translation layer, but still I wonder what valve ended up doing
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probably supporting opengl makes some optimizations harder for them
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or idk
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, e.g. you could have specific sets where you need the gl scissor preallocated
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the high level program knows when it uses them, so it can also tell the backend how many it needs
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in opengl you just switch as you want
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the driver has to care about it 😄
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never trust drivers
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you could say, vulkan can reduce the amount of pipeline switching allocating alot
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and has awesome memory control
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that makes a huge impact even if you go single threaded with vulkan
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was supposed to do something right before that dos attack, now I can't remember what it was
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its about input delay i cant help, maybe it buffers the images too much, e.g. it doesnt actually turn off vsync, even if it says so, depending on how reliable the translation layer is :/
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> [2021-09-27 18:00:07][chat]: *** : Your team has 1 player that has not started yet, they need to touch the start before this team can finish: Sorah
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> i get this message after i activate super on testing servers
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> and ofc i touched start before
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah create an issue on github and tag version 15.6
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> ```[2021-09-27 18:00:07][chat]: *** : Your team has 1 player that has not started yet, they need to touch the start before this team can finish: Sorah```
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> many ppl are annoyed by that i think
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> don't have  github account :tear:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> don't have a github account :tear:
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> pathetic
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman:
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What are the exact steps to reproduce @Sorah ?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> join a team with atleast 2 tees > go over start with both > rcon super with one of them
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> funny enough after i kill one of them now i can rejoin the team now lol
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-koans/2408?u=michael-f-bryan>
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where are checkpoint times stored?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Chairn record_race, but not in the sqlite export
23:43 <+eeeee> regarding the ddos problem, have you considered having running reverse proxies in front of the real server? like get some vpses or servers in the same datacenter to do the packet filtering and forwarding
23:45 <@deen> considered yes, implemented no. What do we do if the reverse proxy gets overloaded? Move the existing players to other reverse proxies that get fired up on demand?
23:46 <+eeeee> those reverse proxies would have different IPs and you could try to distribute the players between those to limit the impact of one IP getting ddosed. and if most players are using the ddnet client, it could be updated to send the controls input data to multiple IPs 
23:47 <+eeeee> fired up on demand is of course very operationally complex, but maybe at least for tournaments you could have a large pool ready to tank the attacks for a few hours

23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did u guys also get ddos today? -.-
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, thus the post
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow u fast at popsting
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I wasn't sure about "my online game", but too late now 😄

23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea
23:59 <+eeeee> if only communism could solve ddos
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also the good old ddnet is a own game discussion
