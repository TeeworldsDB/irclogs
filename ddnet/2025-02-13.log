05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> "oh boy i cant wait to check my email inbox today!"
06:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I made a UI concept for an automapper editor inside of DDNet, made in Figma.
06:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> There's a lot that I could change in this, but I feel like the general function of this would sort of look like this.
06:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea im sorry ive been so hyperfixed on this LMAO
06:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 
06:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @jupeyy_keks @essigautomat you guys might like

06:09 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
06:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a shitton figmas that i could never make good on
06:10 < bridge> <Ewan> designing UIs is one of my favorite activities
06:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> A closer look at the tile menu. Forgot to add something too so here's the updated segment:
06:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339463807558225930/image.png?ex=67aed061&is=67ad7ee1&hm=a5986151688972ba182d79d8e39e8401ae026657c08109393de82d6257100851&
06:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I know, it's so fun. A lot easier than coding it, honestly.
06:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> But at the same time, you lose the interactibility from actually coding it
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> better for the process to draft it out first
06:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> True
06:12 < bridge> <Ewan> if anyone saw that status bar feature that was added in tater client recently i did that in figma first
06:12 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339464186081710153/image.png?ex=67aed0bc&is=67ad7f3c&hm=1f8ca514289480be61f422a9a7216db49d9d97845507525fe00a93cc52d8fe12&
06:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Oooh!
06:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it works a little differently in his implementation
06:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 4 new icons
06:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339464364297682974/image.png?ex=67aed0e6&is=67ad7f66&hm=8d7c5edaca2ff3653998338fc99ab2f011a01119c5dc7fe2ff62b1349b76c924&
06:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yes it's very interesting. A simple to use rule generator is defs something I want to see how well it works out
07:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> How would the bones that has 4 tiles be mapped using your method?
07:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The teelike bones thing in grass main
07:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Third option of the new for icon maybe?
07:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> tldr?
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> someone went on a random repo and called an issue some bad words then pinged a shitton of people
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> repo truth/truth post authored by user truth
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> just stupid
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> and then codeberg went and issued an apology to users in email and super LLM response blog form
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> where they share no details but manage to take >15 paragraphs
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess i can say the words but they are really stupid
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> and i would have to spoiler them
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> and automod might kill me and it'll be visible on the irc
08:34 < bridge> <kekomonter> Looks cool
09:18 < bridge> <Assa> this left menu looks very familiar to me, looks great!
09:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> .\_.
10:13 < bridge> <Assa> I want to add more tiles to the speedup layer, I have some new feature ideas based on it. Should I do this now or should I wait for the one I already created? I am just need some coordination
10:13 < bridge> <Assa> I want to add more tiles to the speedup layer, I have some new feature ideas based on it. Should I do this now or should I wait for the one I already created? I  just need some coordination
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> just checked your solofng server @chillerdragon it's full of bots
10:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> honeypot
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Better discuss them on GH in an issue
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The new tile could also fix other issues of speed tiles ig
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> I am aware of 3 bugs so far (only with max_speed) excluding the ramp issue
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> I am aware of 3 bugs so far (only with max_speed) excluding the ramp issue, which are all fixed with this
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Fixing the ramp issue sounds good too. What would the Max velocity be then?
11:42 < bridge> <Assa> hmm I honestly have no idea. Was ramp only affecting x-direction? can't remember
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I think so
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But anyway. If we add a new tile anyway, might as well fix all the things we know
11:43 < bridge> <Assa> I don't think this is an issue of the speedtiles, as this is doable with grenades or other measures of gaining speed as well
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But the new tile could not accelerate more than possible without breaking physics
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I don't see this as bad just bcs other stuff is broken
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> This has some major implications, you still have the speed, in terms of your speedvector is HUGE, it's just that the ramp slows you down so much. If you decelerate, your ramp goes down again so you'll be faster again
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yes but we don't need to even accelerate to that point. We had some graph a while ago. Simply accelerate to the maximum of the graph
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I mean would a new mapper expect such weird physics breaking things if he adds maybe speed up
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> I mean we could do this, easily so, clamping the x speed after speedups to the maximum of the graph
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I mean would a new mapper expect such weird physics breaking things if he adds many speed up
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Or simply not add more speed then the threshold
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Then it didn't break if u already so far
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Fast
11:49 < bridge> <Assa> its not that simple, because speed is also applied to the y direction
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Or simply not add more speed than the threshold
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I thought valramp is x direction only
11:49 < bridge> <Assa> yes but the speedtiles aren't
11:50 < bridge> <Assa> yes but the speedtiles aren't, they can even be diagonal
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah but the velocity they add is still two dimensional ig xd
11:51 < bridge> <Assa> yes, that's what I mean by clipping the x direction ðŸ˜„ My current implementation only uses vector math, I never split x and y component
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah my point was just that we shouldn't clip the player velocity but simply not add further velocity if either component hit the maximum a speed tile can add
13:25 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:25 < bridge> <Assa> velramp(x) = 1 / (Curvature ^ ((x - Start) / Range))
13:25 < bridge> <Assa>            = 1 / 1.4^((x - 550) / 2000)
13:25 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:25 < bridge> <Assa> So I put `maximize y = (1 / 1.4^((x - 550) / 2000)) * x, x > 550` into wolfram alpha, and it says x ~ 5994, so this _should_ be the maximum speed in x direction. There might be an error somewhere in my calculation, somewhere I read it was a bit more then 6000
13:26 < bridge> <totar> Its tune based right?
13:26 < bridge> <Assa> yes, Curvate, Start and Range are tunes, these are all the velramp tunes
13:26 < bridge> <Assa> so mappers already have control over this
13:29 < bridge> <Assa> it's hard to tell, since other things also affect speed, like friction for example
13:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> simply set curvature = 1 and suddenly the game makes sense
13:30 < bridge> <Assa> or set velramp_start to 99999 and you don't have that issue anymore
13:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah but it feels weird because it's not really perfectly constant
13:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess you should just set both so you get both the simple computation and the perfect identity ramp
15:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> the grid part of the concept was very similar to yours, tho honestly i feel like having the tile picker feels more intuitive
15:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 
15:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> as for big structures, the layout of the runs part mimics the layout of a .rules file, so it should just copy every rule from that
15:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I know itâ€™s insane. Too lazy and nob to code antibot xd
15:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: pls implement https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7436 while you are at it
15:53 < bridge> <kebscs> can merge <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9092>? :owo:
17:46 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon: hmm this is a candidate which should be moved into move box and check for is_grounded. I guess we could add it like this
17:47 < bridge> <Assa> for the ground you can archive Something like this with a tune zone and ground_control_accell and ground_control_speed
19:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Assa no not isgrounded i want it on walls too
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> what if you'd place a speedtile in the wall, and if you touch the wall, then it works on you? ðŸ¤”
22:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why is my prediction margin goes crazy when entities are off :feelsbadman:

22:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wtf, yes
22:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> glad u like it! will improve later on
