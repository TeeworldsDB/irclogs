06:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh hi @Ryozuki https://tshock.co/xf/index.php?threads/guide-how-to-host-tshock-on-linux.4798/
07:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hi
07:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 do you think requesting the 2 best master servers instead of only the best is reasonable?
07:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> E.g. cloudflare has better ping for me, but sometimes it has these weird delays, and it would only switch the master after restart
07:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
07:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or does that create too much overhead /and or just shifts the problem(the 2nd master server could be ddosed too for example)

08:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as far as i see it does request new master as soon as refresh is called twice?
08:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as far as i see it does request new master as soon as refresh is called twice? (but i cannot get the code path to execute, maybe it just requires a `m_State == STATE_REFRESHING` too)
08:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> tencent cdn sometimes does the same thing. Like if it is cached it goes instantly, but if the cache misses, it ranges from tens of ms or 5 whole seconds. It's disgusting.
08:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> and apparently my hk vps that has a 1gb data bandwidth cap isn't enough for serving master lol. We're running about 40gigs daily.
08:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
08:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> s/1gb/1tb per month/
08:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> hello, brain. please work. ok thanks
08:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I can afford a better one if I actually get payed for my new job tho.
08:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> paid*
08:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rich man
08:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ddnet could also buy it i guess
08:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> A 2tb hongkong vps from tencent is like 600cny for a year (with deals). So it's not that bad.
08:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> (so less than €80
08:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I wish mainland server was this cheap tho
08:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iisnt hongkong mainland
08:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
08:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
08:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> don't stop tsfreddies revolution
08:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> If you Google hongkong it is Chinese special administrative region
08:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Alongwith Macau
08:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ik i was joking cuz the situation
08:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
08:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It's like china, but special
08:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its ok tsfreddie, in future we can show the iirc logs and say, it all started here
08:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I can already feel cancelled
08:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <nori> wait, is client choose best server everytime when i open it?
08:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But like for real tho, we could've try hosting a hongkong server because we do have some, but we really don't want to because the "situation". It'll be a warzone in the hk server and we probably don't know how to label them anyway.
08:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It choose the best server for fetching serverlist
08:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> situation :monkalaugh:
08:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> You used it first
08:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i love it
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Btw was it still going on
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Haven't heard about anything lately
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china probs won whathever they were doing
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Prob
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats prob good for china
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
08:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont hear about it better

08:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
08:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think hongkong was a strategic place for muricans
08:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think murica actually manipulate basically any place around mainland china.
08:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> What's the most peaceful country in the world if there's any.
08:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably somewhere in eu if I were to take a guess
08:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs denmark
08:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something like that
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Iceland
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> According to the Global Peace Index 2020, Iceland was the most peaceful country in the world with an index value of 1.078."
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ez when ur just 200k ppl
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its cold outside
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just stay at h ome
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no riot
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
08:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :poggers:
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> cold > warm
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think in the future coast cities will be flooded
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i have to go somewhere else
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and more cold
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> prepare for the disaster
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> where are you
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> barcelona
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> that's a place that sounds really cool in Chinese
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you dont know F.C Barcelona?
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Anything country name that has 4 or more syllables are cool
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how do u write it
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in chinese symbols
08:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 巴塞罗那
08:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
08:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Taiwan calls it 巴賽隆納
08:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
08:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Hongkong calls it 巴塞隆納
08:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably
08:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[8] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[9] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).
08:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we are beta +
08:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poggers
08:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Actually even Spain is three characters
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that short for a name
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Chinese is like one syllable per char
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So we have three syllables for Spain
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wouldnt it be spa-in
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> s-pain
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
08:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But the word Spain is one right?
08:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> S pa in
08:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 西班牙
08:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
08:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Was it as fun for you guys as I feel about being involved in such a global community?
08:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm assuming you guys are pretty used to it. Well Asians are usually only involved within their own country.
08:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I already feels pretty cool just by chatting with you guys.
08:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
08:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its pretty normal to see ppl from lot of places
08:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw lot of asians come here for tourism
08:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I can imagine
08:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean you can't rid of Chinese people anywhere. Even if you go to a college that is supposed to have the least Chinese students. You still get at least a dozen of Chinese students hanging out together.
08:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> We have the number 😂
08:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
08:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my college was pretty diverse
08:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> most diverse in my state
08:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe it had 1 chinese = diverse
08:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok
08:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
08:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> How was University of Oregon btw
08:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It's like I just gave them money and they let me in.
08:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> That doesn't sound like how university should work
08:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean with money u can enter any private uni
08:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i think in murica all are private
08:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Capitalism
08:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless it is a rly presitigious uni
08:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz they dont need ur mony probs
08:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or there are too many ppl wanting to give their mony
08:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
08:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> /randomteam
08:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what r u doing with tshock btw
08:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> setting up a server?
08:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly sad they closed down the servers and went for discord/gh discussions
08:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forums*
08:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm losing track of the conversation
08:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock
08:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> anticheat
08:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh look
08:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have chinese docs https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/blob/general-devel/README_cn.md
08:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Chinese doc is actually pretty common I think?
08:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
08:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast what i frequent
08:55 <@deen> it's common in chinese companies
08:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I like that Chinese docs usually have a QQ group listed
09:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i was setting up a tshock server and ur name came up in the forums (what i posted)
09:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 do you think requesting the 2 best master servers and taking the first result, instead of only the best is reasonable?

10:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if smbdy wants to test
10:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for me this improves the situation quite a bit, cloudflare is really random from fetch times
10:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> thanks for putting more bandwidth pressure on master2
10:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~I'm kidding~~
10:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i was writing the the code i accedentially DoS'ed the masters xd
10:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast it started alot of jobs

12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found a rly funny crate description
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/857202451877593108/unknown.png
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
13:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ada has always been great for critical applications
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If anyone is familiar with significant figures, what do you do if you have no significant figures remaining in your result?
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does that mean I have to use actual uncertainties now?
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> my 2nd try of asking on how to reproduce the ddnet macOS builds. My github actions build does not run on one users mac who can use ddnet just fine \:(
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um, can he run our github actions build just fine or can he run our official release just fine
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they are built VERY differently
19:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> he can run official release just fine but not my github build so i want to build the very different official build so my mac users can use the best haxbot client
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> maybe this is stil up to date who knows https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/6d2e4cc0c47203d993a0f046e77af958a2c53091/release/build.sh#L48-L58
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i remember having trouble with cross compile \:/
19:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\:  u mind sharing the macOS SDK?
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why does SDL_main not handle all the mac specific stuff?
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt that the whole sense of it
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or is the macsdk even needed for libc?
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea the github actions build and also my manual build seem to link `/usr/local/opt/freetype/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib` which is put there by brew i think and non dev macs will not find it. I know this issue but i forgot the fix. Wasnt it something like cmake .. -DPREFER\_BUNDLED\_LIBS=ON but that did not help.
20:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im just impressed how hard to is apparently, just static link all libs problems solved xd
20:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes they are shipped in the app folder but idk how to properly link
20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple doesn't like people sharing the SDK, if you have a mac you can get it from there, or you can google around for other *sources*
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I think I broke my mac it’s Stuck downloading xcode since hours
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've achieved peak rust: `for<'f> fn(&'f ctx, &'f msg, &'f args) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output=CommandResult + Send + 'f>>>`
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've achieved peak rust: `for<'f> fn(&'f ctx, &'f msg, &'f args) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output=CommandResult> + Send + 'f>>`
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now I just need to figure out a proc macro to take my function `async fn name(ctx, msg, args) -> CommandResult` to `fn name(ctx, msg, args) -> pinboxwhatevermess`
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> any admin here ?
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Async rust is almost as ugly as C++ 😄
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> o/
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> your admin or mod friends are banning me just because some people saying i'm using a something called krx
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's not an admin concern, but a mod concern
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> krx is cheat client
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i think that admin is higher ranked than mods so he can know when game can't be managed good
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in the future, can you please not mention bot clients by name?
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No advertising bot clients by name ^^
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> slow
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> okay but that's literally what they saying in the chat mentioning me 3 players that hate me and are my enemies i did nothing
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they trying to block me
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can detect said bot with very high accuracy, sucks to get caught but you should just wait out your ban and never use it again
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and then i left i go to another server
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i got banned 7 days
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @EarthQuake murpi said to dm them, let's not discuss it here
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it was probably murpi that banned you anyway, so ask him
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anyways this is not the channel for it regardless

20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> future look of github issues
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wtf i didn't advertised cheat client, just mentioned
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> are rules such
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> "don't promote" ...
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wtf i didn't advertise cheat client, just mentioned
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @louis\: best teeworlds tutor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWYNSsgDa8k
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are rethinking how to do async btw https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/welcome.html
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses lot of emojis but i think its a good webpage
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they list all the issues people have
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as stories
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is something u wouldnt be able to change in c++
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This document is a collaborative effort to build a shared vision for Async Rust. Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination: how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a joyful one?
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What a weird way to write a technical document, why does it have to make me feel like I'm reading a kindergarten meeting log?
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i thought that too
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but well
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they list the status quo
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so know the current problems
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its a bad way
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> is your anti cheat works manually guys ? do a mod have to join and ban me ?
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> or i would get automatically if i used a cheat ?
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Learath2 needs concrete future types so he doesn't have to pin box everything
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some things are automatic some things are manual
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u are barbara
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision/status_quo/barbara_plays_with_async.html
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision/status_quo/barbara_tries_async_streams.html
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Streams were not too bad. Boxing futures were by far the most annoying thing I've done
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> how to proof i'm cheating what if your anti cheat has  a false positive
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> would that be my problem
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Give me your ip in a DM, I'll check what was detected
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> your mod just banned me because he says that i'm cheating >> proof i log out while he was joining the server 
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> 
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> reality : 3 players blocking me for 15 - 20 minutes  i can't play on the server
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and i go to another map
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> and he banned me for 7 days for just leaving and going to another server
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> nice anti cheat guys that works manually by judging on things can happen by luck
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> almost this tho
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> yeah that what i mean
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> 
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> i mean if i was cheating i would get banned by your anticheat
21:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> but a mod bans me manually
21:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> means that the check are 50%
21:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i guess krx have banned version
21:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or not xd
21:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> dk
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <EarthQuake> they need to develop more ways for finding a cheater  for now i will just remove my messages because this is not going anywhere for someone thinks it's safer for the community to not have me
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes i know the wording should change, and i advocated for this in the past
22:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> requesting for monofont in votemenus
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/0393ac0f88e937ced03e123a72aede089c06deca/src/engine/server/register.cpp#L151
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ^
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this line breaks logs on windows
22:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if we would change it to `dbg_msg(m_pName, "refreshing ip addresses");` it stops breaking it
22:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/857360422541459496/logs_now.txt
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> `dbg_msg` makes it weird
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont think this is a bug is it, its just some flushing that isnt atomic under windows
23:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the log a console log, or logfile?
23:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> console log
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> interesting that if i use `refershing ip` instead `refreshing ip addresses` it becomes fine
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> interesting that if i use `refreshing ip` instead `refreshing ip addresses` it becomes fine
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also, also
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there is console-> print in `m_pMasterServer->RefreshAddresses(Nettype);`
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah dunno if thats random, but if its a bug it should be debugable
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so i think this line really useless
23:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no its not random
23:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> on my machine xd
23:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also i have question about `dbg_msg` in `CConsole::Print(...)`
23:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is it really necessary?
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why not
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ```cpp
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> void CConsole::Print(int Level, const char *pFrom, const char *pStr, ColorRGBA PrintColor)
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> {
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     dbg_msg(pFrom, "%s", pStr);
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     char aBuf[1024];
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     Format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), pFrom, pStr);
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     for(int i = 0; i < m_NumPrintCB; ++i)
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     {
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>         if(Level <= m_aPrintCB[i].m_OutputLevel && m_aPrintCB[i].m_pfnPrintCallback)
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>         {
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>             m_aPrintCB[i].m_pfnPrintCallback(aBuf, m_aPrintCB[i].m_pPrintCallbackUserdata, PrintColor);
23:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>         }
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     }
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> }
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ```
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> logging on all levels -> OUTPUT_LEVEL_DEBUG
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but dbg_msg is just dbg_msg xd
23:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> console is also used by client
23:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where it makes more sense
23:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. f1 console
23:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> doesn't client register it's own callback for logging
23:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> `m_PrintCBIndex = Console()->RegisterPrintCallback(g_Config.m_ConsoleOutputLevel, SendRconLineAuthed, this);`
23:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> server does this
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but dbg_msg is always there
23:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey xd
23:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> after deleting this line there is no mess
