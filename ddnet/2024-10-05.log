00:30 < bridge> <totar> why did we do this instead of removing team interaction from super?
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz the implementor can call it a new feature
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> x)
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i actually dont know
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> im happy that timakro is contributing again tho
00:33 < bridge> <totar> idk I guess they just didn't think it would be allowed to remove the team interaction so added a new mode instead
00:33 < bridge> <kebscs> so if it doesnt interact with other teams, why does it need a particile effect?
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean super might definitely still be wanted on test ddr servers
00:34 < bridge> <kebscs> looks nice tho but idk if its neccessary
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> the way it behaves as is
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> so it doesn
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> so it doesn't make all that much sense to change it w/o adding an option
00:35 < bridge> <totar> is there a legitimate use case for having super affect all teams?
00:35 < bridge> <totar> I thought it was just trolling
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> fuckin around
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it's necessary
00:35 < bridge> <totar> idk
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> how do u rly control that substate within super tho
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> easier to just add new mode
00:35 < bridge> <totar> this mode is pretty annoying to maintain
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> no
00:35 < bridge> <totar> yes?
00:36 < bridge> <totar> super itself is annoying to maintain
00:36 < bridge> <totar> this kinda doubles it
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> change is super calls to is invincible calls which will also return true for super
00:36 < bridge> <totar> that's not what they did
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> well
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> that sucks
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i didnt look at the code
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> ahh it all makes sense now
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1291891946041901096/image.png?ex=6701bfa2&is=67006e22&hm=3412461d853840ee9816b28a26571cf9634f61f95161b8fe3919b6587d991b29&
00:37 < bridge> <totar> you could add that to super
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps
00:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i like the sparkling tee a lot
00:39 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe it should be more opaque & less geometric tho
00:39 < bridge> <Ewan> or uh
00:39 < bridge> <Ewan> just have fewer particles tbh
00:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> super mario 64 star effect
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
00:51 < bridge> <totar> I left a comment on GH but we could also have another mode that only does the cross team thing
00:52 < bridge> <totar> which would even let you play cross team without the other super effects
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> where did you comment
00:56 < bridge> <zhn> ask testers lol
00:58 < bridge> <totar> I think actually it's better to just keep that functionality in a separate mode, which would still be less maintenance than super+ invincible
00:58 < bridge> <totar> I'll work on it later today
00:59 < bridge> <Ewan> so u mean super + cross team super?
00:59 < bridge> <Ewan> no invincible?
00:59 < bridge> <Ewan> so u mean super + cross team (non mutually-exclusive w/ super)?
01:00 < bridge> <teero777> Make a shader!
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i think that is kind of a tough sell. this pr could be refactored to work like that, plus he did all the cosmetics
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> or a pr can be made to refactor

11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> hello from france
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bonjour
12:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> how exactly is rust used in ddnet?
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cxx bridge
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it has no real use yet xd
12:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> ty
14:06 < bridge> <animepdf> B-bbut you can use `rust_version` in F1 ü§ì ü§ì ü§ì  This is very useful and rust should remain in client
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I joined the rust side now. Order 66 against cpp
14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> now im become rust
14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> destroyer of unsafe code
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's the spirit
14:27 < bridge> <pioooooo> im actually surprised ddnet being built so smoothly on my pc and got no environment issues at all
14:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> win 11
14:33 < bridge> <zhn> why it should not be smooth xd
14:34 < bridge> <zhn> if you want it to be rough try to build with bam
15:06 < bridge> <pioooooo> idk like windows doesnt have a universal package manager like apt or brew and usually you have to mess around with libs
15:07 < bridge> <pioooooo> or it's just i didn't code enough and my only experiences were bad
15:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> compiled ~70gb libs to build a 30mb exe
15:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> maybe i got it wrong but anyway
15:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> glad ddnet is not like that
15:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> it is
15:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> :justatest:
15:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Apparently, 30 is not an intiger
15:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1292120393011957782/screenshot_2024-10-05_15-44-44.png?ex=67029464&is=670142e4&hm=fc79e08a5c05763c628176c997a56a573c856a5bfdc5b95f2ee0e90c90214e44&
15:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> wanted to use a bind
15:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> `bind f say /team 30, /practice, rcon teleport`
15:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> am I doing it wrong or is it a bug?
15:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 30,
15:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you probably mean ;
15:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> "/team 30" should work, but it ain't xd
15:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> great
15:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> bind f "say /team 30; say /practice; rcon teleport"
15:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @cellegenrih try this
15:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, works fine
15:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> dunno why can't we just separate it with a column
15:49 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> wdym column
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he means comma
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can't do that bcs the console parser follows a specific logic. ; signals that a new command begins
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with a `,` if would not be clear if /team and /practice are both for say, bcs then `rcon` should be for say too
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then
15:55 < bridge> <learath2> You can also do a multi chat command, iirc something like `say /mc;team 30;practice;`
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, nvm that got nuked
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/80ea4c859093da2e578bf38c22817bf290842320
16:06 < bridge> <learath2> Actually no, nvm it just got moved around, so I gues s yeah you can use it üòÑ
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> Pausing and unpausing a youtube video creates a new audio source which makes pipewire lose my audio settings for it :pepeW:
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah super annoying
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> I might write a script for it sometime, just memorize source names
16:22 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> /points pls;kill me
16:22 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> or something like that
16:22 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> sp someone did that
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> > 18:21 <@heinrich5991> [12:24:03] <@heinrich5991> /allowsemicolons;<cmd>;<cmd2>
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> > 18:21 <@heinrich5991> [12:24:10] <@heinrich5991> that way, nicks can't do it, because it's too long
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> > 18:21 <@heinrich5991> [12:24:37] <@heinrich5991> only works if it appears directly after the /
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> We discussed this, then heinrich implemented `mc` instead, which is short enough that you can name yourself `/mc;kill;`
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pass ping
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder what happened there, did we ban `/` in names?
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> Also hilarious that discord actually pings for things in a quote lol
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> Also
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> > 2017-02-02 21:01 <@Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> 10x the players now, imagine
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> > 10:23 <@d--n> the concern is that people can use it as their name
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> > 10:23 <@d--n> but since / is forbidden at start already and ; doesn't work until after the "mc" command, that would work fine
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> Ah the day after explains why we ended up with just mc
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mass ping
17:04 < bridge> <zhn> server puts (1) before any /hadoop nick
18:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How is it possible to be 5 days on github and to have that much activity? https://github.com/seniordev1012 is it a scam account, it had 450 ppl following and now only 7
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can fake your history
18:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also all projects have the same stargazers
18:47 < bridge> <prizrouk> Hello, what should I do if I was banned for cheats but I play without them and have never played?
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #‚úâ-create-a-ticket -> ban appeal
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and next time pls use #questions not #developer ^^
18:52 < bridge> <prizrouk> thank you
18:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I actually love this feature
19:46 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> thx for very cool anti block update üòç

19:47 < bridge> <imcutekitten> :brownbear: :brownbear: :brownbear:
19:48 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> why do I need this? what if I want to play normally with randoms like before? why don't the creators ask the players' wishes? and they only make it worse, if there were blockers here before, the moderator would quickly kick them, but now the moderator can't do anything
19:49 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> Previously, all the newcomers could simply be thrown down and you could go to that place to help them, but now they will simply crowd and interfere and the moderator will not be able to do anything here
19:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> so whats the update
20:00 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> .
20:00 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> map
20:09 < bridge> <syrinok> @murpi Would this not be a cleaner solution?
