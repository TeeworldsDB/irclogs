03:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> when bring back 2007 cursor?
03:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1213671609932447784/image.png?ex=65f652c4&is=65e3ddc4&hm=0652fac7425df681e5f760fb04f39e936c0ad54e81f137f7c585e667212ce3f3&
03:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> (nvm i also just saw the current cursor is from 2007 aswell)
06:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is this a good idea to make a table everything as text in sqlite3 ?
06:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
06:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```sql
06:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> create table Accounts(Name text not null, Password text not null, Money text not null, xp text not null, Creation text not null, LastUsed text not null)
06:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
06:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is this a good idea to make  everything as text in a table in sqlite3 ?
06:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
06:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```sql
06:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> create table Accounts(Name text not null, Password text not null, Money text not null, xp text not null, Creation text not null, LastUsed text not null)
06:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
07:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> No
08:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> why would you want xp, creation, and lastused to be text?
08:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> why not use `INTEGER` for Money and XP, and `DATETIME` for LastUsed and Creation ?
08:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> be more helpful next time! <a:OMEGAWHEELCHAIR:1106630445073965137>
08:35 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'm not google to be helpful :gigachad:
08:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
09:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it doesn't really matter in sqlite, but you'd usually use integer for most of these
09:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was looking for RenderTools()->MapScreenToGroup :kek:
10:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> cus i don't know how to work with them, but i can easily convert any text from sqlite to anything i need in c, what is the downsides ?
10:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> a lot of downsides actually - data integrity, type safety, storage efficiency
10:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ok i will change it
10:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is blob datatype more storage efficient than others ?
10:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> storage efficiency is critical for me
10:37 < bridge> <Peakies> Hello, looking for best way or tools to convert mp3 file to wv file for DDNet
10:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> BLOB is efficient when you're working with binary data (images, audio files)
10:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i made a whole soundpack back in the days https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=7472
10:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> i wouldnt use BLOB if you're just working with plain text data
10:40 < bridge> <Peakies> tnx ‚ù§Ô∏è
10:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> another thing
10:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think all these don't apply to sqlite. all fields can store all data types. the data type is just a hint
10:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there anyway to change the map dynamically ? like making a terraria like server based on it ?
10:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> people break and create blocks on the server's map
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, currently not possible
10:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see some crazy stuff in infclass mod/maps
10:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> i remember chiller posting something that does what you described, cant find it tho
10:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> they change tiles based on player input/ or hide and showing the tiles
10:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats what i had in mind, just double-checked - MB - you're right, it "could" be an issue using text since it saves it as a variable-length instead of a fixed-length, but doesnt seem like you'd bother on something as small as a timestamp
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> minecraft mod for teeworlds

13:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I started ricing my tty. I am seriously considering to move away from gnome after all these years of being a try hard fan.
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> xDD can you play tw in tty?
13:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I guess I‚Äôll still use gnome for gaming and work. But for developing tty is pure focus
13:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you use online docs?
13:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes term-ux has a visual mode to see the map and controls but it‚Äôs a bit bugged. The server browser and chat is smooth tho.
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tty browser
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yayaya
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice cheat
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so actually u dont want tty. you just lie to yourself
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs carbonyl
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> why not use smth like bspwm instead of gnome? xD
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs chromes render engine ported to text
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I like tty somehow
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt need much more
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller played too much minecraft
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he likes blocks
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
13:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you read vulkan spec over your tty browser?
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Should be smooth
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mostly stackoverflow
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you should, it's really worth a read

18:20 < bridge> <yekrm> That's faster but I don't have permissions so I had to delete every message
18:45 < bridge> <matodor> oh ok, thx
19:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ehem
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why you need to bind stuff to the string you want to pass to sqlite ? why don't format it with str_format ?
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char aBuf[2400];
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>

19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     "SELECT l.ID, Name, Time, Ranking, PercentRank "
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     "FROM (" // teamrank score board

19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> pSqlServer->BindString(3, pData->m_aName);
19:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
19:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to serialize data maybe
19:07 < bridge> <furo321> Using `Bindstring` prevents SQL injection.
19:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in this code it's does not matter right ?
19:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's gonna directly get the information from player's name an currently playing map
19:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's gonna directly get the information from player's name and currently playing map
19:13 < bridge> <bts._.> exactly
19:17 < bridge> <furo321> If you were to do same query using `str_format`, you would run into problems if the input data contains characters used for the SQL syntax, e.g. `'`. Let's say some guys player name is `hi'`, you would get an invalid query because you have an unmatched quotation mark.
19:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> then you mean bindstring and others, prevent input that has meaning to sqlite ?
19:21 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> then how it's gonna keep track of names like these
19:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> its called escaping

20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so everyone that times out uses windows?
20:52 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, it's a windows only assertion
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice meta information
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's basically telemetry
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
20:52 < bridge> <robyt3> :monkaS:
20:55 < bridge> <cyberFighter> wtf xdddd
20:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 and u fixed it by making the server side buffer same as client?
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> :monkaS:
21:01 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, it's more a hotfix until I add more validation to `StrToInts` and `IntsToStr` though
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok nice
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if that guy read this chat

23:15 < bridge> <teero777> also crashes on lnx
23:17 < bridge> <robyt3> How that? Do you have stack trace?
23:18 < bridge> <teero777> nop. it only crashed once on a kog server. where are crashlogs stored?
23:18 < bridge> <teero777> can't reproduce it either
23:18 < bridge> <robyt3> there are no crash logs on linux :pepeW:
23:18 < bridge> <robyt3> unless you were using a debugger
23:19 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
23:19 < bridge> <robyt3> if it was an assertion error then you should have a log in the dumps folder in your config dir
23:19 < bridge> <teero777> was playing on release with debug info but didn't attach a debugger
23:19 < bridge> <robyt3> but the assertion for this current crash only exists on windows
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> well ig ill just wait till i crash again
23:21 < bridge> <robyt3> are there just-in-time debuggers for linux?
23:33 < bridge> <learath2> linux can do it natively if you have coredumps enabled
23:34 < bridge> <robyt3> would be cool if we could integrate it into the client for Linux and macOS though (#3070)
23:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3070
23:35 < bridge> <learath2> would be nice if we had something like crashpad or sth
23:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Cliptee: Would you like to upload your crash report?
23:37 < bridge> <zhn> ChillerDragon: am i nobo or zinsta just refuses to register on master1.*
23:37 < bridge> <zhn> compiled fresh from master
23:37 < bridge> <zhn> ping and curl master1.ddnet.org works though from the same host
