02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Dev which server does ddnet use for sv_dnsbl_host
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby ask @heinrich5991 he was the last one to change it
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Kero tried enabling/disabling opengl3?
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Kero alternatively you could use borderless instead of fullscreen

10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok i see dnsbl lists are lists of evil ip adresses. And i guess sv_dnsbl_host is a path or link to such an list? And the teeworlds server filters these ips automatically for anti flood/votebot etc attacks?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah cool
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm is it okay that i use a system() call to execute a python script in the /modhelp command?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fak
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can do it this way and we can find a better way in the PR
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so i have to get the discord api running in c++? o.O
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so it still helps if i provide a running system even if u wont use it and have to refactor everything?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why do all dislike the best c function .-.
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> system() rocks :p
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's really hard to use in a secure, cross-platform fashion
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh yea cross platform..
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does this stuff really has to be cross platform?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean im hughe cross platfrom fan too... but i guess only offical ddnet servers will use that feature on the linux servers because connecting the server to discord is a special thing
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i could even provide a working cross platform solution with ``system()`` i think
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just add a os check and two system calls ... not too hard i think
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> since all unix stuff works pretty much the same we just have to find a way for win to work
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client links to curl already, could make the server link curl too for accessing discord api
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you just need curl yeah
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks to GPDR my private data isn't listed on whois queries anymore
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > In response to the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the European Union (EU), starting
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> from April 25 of 2018, the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC) may make certain necessary adjustments to the
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> results of the WHOIS inquiries regarding EU registrants.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëå
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I bought some domains with ovh and they have a antispam protection by hiding mail, address, etc i think
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Same with gandhi.net i think
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, some cheap registrars asked for money to protect your data, which I'm way too cheap for
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon doing it in an external program sounds good though
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we'll just adjust how you call it
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that way, we can develop other bridges without having to modify the source code
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen cool that they dont show ur private data anymore c: but what is this GDPR ? Is it some nice data privacy for all europeans?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and what is curl? u mean the bash command curl?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> GDPR is the general data protection regulation by the EU, it indeed defines how personal data is to be handled for residents of the EU
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDPR
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> taking effect on may 25th
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only 16 days left
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> @deen  Turned that on and off a couple of times. It didn't work out. But I don't have the problem in window mode. Thank you
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon libcurl, it's a transfer library
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&p=64769#p64769
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon i think with curl u can make http requests and maybe the websocket needed to communicate to the discord api
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u dont need websockets, since u dont need to know user messages from discord
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :saddo:
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&p=64769#p64769 sounds related to the highdpi stuff
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> discord has a http api
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. I think it would be better to deal with the discord API outside of the ddnet server, like e.g. in a python script
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah we should add some framework to have have commands handled by an external application
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or we could make a HTTP post request
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not to the discord API
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but to our own
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> nice skyrim language
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it'd be nicer if we could keep the ddnet code non official ddnet specific
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but making a HTTP POST request doesn't sound too bad, does it?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can just have any server listening on the other side
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at that point we could POST to discord api it's just a little less bound
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess yeah
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why are sha512 hashes so fucking long? üò¶
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i heared sha65536 is very short
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ so the only solution is to ship a DDNet.exe and DDNet-intel.exe?

22:07 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 121c3b8 def: 11.1.7
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well the wiki from Microsoft said use manifest and not win32api for downward comparability... So it would still be possible to either request if os is win8 or higher or remove win 7 or less support
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> windows 7 sits at 37% of the surveyed machines using steam
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> removing win7 support is not an option
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> \o/ more machines using linux than winxp
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although it's not clear if that's the case for ddnet as well
