00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> whats the tile id for hookthru tile
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> welll
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> either 5 or 66
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> both 5 and 66
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you are talking about new hookthrough
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we get the fix in already ðŸ˜¦
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> Thx and wym new? @Patiga
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well there is the old hookthrough tile (blue in entities), which make the adjacent surfaces of blocks hookthrough
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and the new one, that simply make the block it is placed on hookthrough
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> Oo
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> Okk
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you should only find the new one on recent maps
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> Ty
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 because binds use say, there is no f1 command to execute commands yet.
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and using a bind with say doesnt convert a char[0] == / to a command to send to the server (which would be good i think)
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then fix the client, not the server, I'd say @fokkonaut
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 its fixed in master
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 no?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 could you take a look why my dummy hammer isnt working properly?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could but I doubt I'd find anything
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut as soon as oy merges my pr commands will be fine for new clients
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
