00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> this is the same for deep freeze if im interpreting the report correctlyt
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> maybe texnonik was talking about the `undeep` f2 command
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Hey guys I'm working on a skin renderer with colors(thanks to Nagi01 for helping me) and I think I've found a problem with teeworlds' way of converting hsl to rgb and hex
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> I don't think that this is game breaking it's just that when I write `player_color_body` in tw console i get this:
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> ```
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Value: 13149440
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> H: 282°, S: 64%, L: 50%
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> R: 161, G: 44, B: 210, #A12CD2
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> ```
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> and when I use my script I get this:
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> ```
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Value: 13149440
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> H: 282°, S: 64%, L: 50%
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> R: 160, G: 46, B: 209, #A02ED1
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> ```
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> At first I thought that this was a problem with my code but when I used another website for converting hsl to rgb and hex i got the results from my script
06:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It smells like a rounding error somewhere. Maybe due to the way we quantize the hsl hexcone
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Either that or a problem with converting hsl to rgb and hex
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feel free to give it a check. I think I got the algorithm from wikipedia but it is possible I made a mistake somewhere
