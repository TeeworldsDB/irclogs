00:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa merge which
07:48 < bridge> <Assa> 70 PRs :justatest:  fast open new ones so chiller must merge them
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: go merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7729 or I will break your spine! Letting giga chad dev wait 2 years for his perfect pr is absolute disrespect. After all this time he is still super responsive and instantly rebases when asked. All the concerns are made up and stunts like these is why scrumpli works on Minecraft not on ddnet!!!!!
08:37 < bridge> <learath2> Just the title of it sounds like it'd create cheats
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Please take 10 seconds and think about it
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The same behavior already exists when not doing /lock
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So no new exploit gets added
08:39 < bridge> <learath2> We have had plenty of PRs adding "trivially obviously safe" stuff
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omagagwd
08:39 < bridge> <learath2> If you are so sure you merge it
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And because of that no such pr will be merged ever again?
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay will do
08:39 < bridge> <bumm.> No
08:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What no?
08:40 < bridge> <learath2> !remindme in one week when some pink rat finds the flaw with it
08:40 < chillerbot> Helo learath2 I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.
08:40 < bridge> <bumm.> I think there was a pr to remove joining t0 after finish to prevent cheats
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well then we remove both together ez
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With 100 open prs there is a pr for everything.
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nobody knows what gold is rotting in there
08:42 < bridge> <bumm.> And why would anyone want to switch team after finish anyway
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And which mental breakdowns have been caused
08:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @bumm.: to help failed t0
08:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Vibe in finish room
08:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Run around the map
08:43 < bridge> <bumm.> Ye t0 but why would you want to join other teams
08:44 < bridge> <learath2> Iirc (this changed a couple times so idk if I'm still up to date) people from unlocked teams get sent to t0, from there they are able to change to other teams too. So I guess this makes it equal for everyone
08:49 < bridge> <learath2> Actually the pr was changed to only allow joining t0. So the title is just out of date
08:49 < bridge> <bumm.> Ahh okay
