16:24 < Hamid_Jigool> hello evry body
16:24 < Hamid_Jigool> eny one here?
16:25 < Hamid_Jigool> i have a question...
16:26 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna create a server that people can connect to it just by one Client... and if have other client show to him error
16:26 < Hamid_Jigool> how can i?
16:29 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: what's that useful for, if i may ask?
16:29 <@deen> you could change the GAME_NETVERSIOn in src/game/version.h
16:30 < Hamid_Jigool> its for some tournoment like Block that may some players use bot Client!
16:30 <@deen> they can modify their bot client to fake any identification your client can do
16:30 <@deen> but i guess you're aware of that and it's just a quick fix for people who can't modify their bot client
16:31 < Hamid_Jigool> if i compile the client with version: 232302 like this ... can they fine this version and make fake client?
16:31 <@deen> yes
16:31 < Hamid_Jigool> how?
16:31 <@deen> if they connect to the server it says "invalid version, server has version 232302" 
16:32 <@deen> then they edit their own src/game/version.h, set that value, recompile and they can connect
16:32 < Hamid_Jigool> can we change this massage server?
16:32 <@deen> no, the client makes this message (i believe)
16:32 <@deen> andthe server version is public
16:33 <@deen> anyway, there is no way to prevent bots or enforce a specific client. there are always ways around
16:34 <@deen> and usually it's much easier to circumvent the protection than to create the protection
16:34 < Hamid_Jigool> but all people dont have Bot Source
16:34 < Hamid_Jigool> maybe 1 or 2
16:34 < Hamid_Jigool> its better than all use bot :D
16:35 < Hamid_Jigool> anyway thank you to your help my friend :x
18:41 < Trax> Jemand von DDNet online?

19:03 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: BlockZ is not available
19:03 <@deen> the author (coffee) doesn't want the source code shared, ask him
19:03 < Hamid_Jigool> oomm .. its great mod ... 
19:23 < Ameb> :O
19:37 <@deen> Ameb: what's up?
19:38 < Ameb> The irc should be more visible on the web, imho
19:39 < Ameb> took some time to find it
19:42 < Ameb> Im trying to find when jetpack feature was added to ddnet
19:43 <@deen> Ameb: you can make a PR and add it somewhere more visible: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web
19:43 <@deen> Ameb: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/0b305471d2140201ea1bb34a504aa56f3587f140
19:44 < Ameb> github search didnt gave any useful result >.<
19:44 < Ameb> thank you
19:44 <@deen> if you have linux, you can just use "git log" and search with /, works well enough
19:45 < Ameb> darwin :p
19:45 <@deen> should work as well
19:47 < Ameb> I have read somewhere about ddnet webpage expiring soon. And there is no money for renew. Its true? 
19:48 <@deen> kind of. the main problem is rather that there is no one to run ddnet, we could get money if we collected donations I guess
19:49 < Ameb> I'd gladly donate so the forum can keep running
19:50 <@deen> I would shut down the ddnet forum even if ddnet keeps running^^
19:50 <@deen> people just fight there all day
19:51 < Ameb> o.o
20:27 < Ameb> gtg
