21:04 < eeeee> !wtf pizdets
21:04 < Nimda> 1. Describes a kaput situation, one at which fubar is nothing compared to how the situation really is. Can also describe situations of otter stupidity expressed by someone, as well as an obviously bad mental state. 2. Derived from the russian word "pizda", which means the female reproductive organ (i.e. "pussy"), this word can refer to a really big and/or good one.
21:04 < Nimda> Example: 1. That dude just threw that stuff up, and it fell down on his head with a huge chunk of the ceiling, cracking his skull in two. Pizdets. | 2. - She has a huuuuuuge pizdets down there! | - Can we both fit in..?
