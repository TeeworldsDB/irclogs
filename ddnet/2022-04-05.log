02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> I'm not sure how it works currently, but when new players get sent to tutorial server when trying the game for the first time it should send them to their lowest ping available
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> i'm from north america but it send me to an EU server, small issue but it should be fixed if possible
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> Even better if it showed how the filters work within the server browser and let people pick
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, it should work that way, except if I did something wrong. When you start the game with a fresh profile and skip the tutorial are the EU servers shown with lowest ping?
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> I did update my client and use Vulkan rn. But now I get some client lags all 5 mins. Like my hooks are lagging, connection problems and timeouts.. Some1 can help me?

10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Are you sure this is related to Vulkan? Sounds more like network problems, wifi or internet

10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> updoot
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a bit sad that they linked to the old trailer
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> I use wifi. With the Old version from ddnet I had never problems..
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the new is much more edited
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might just be coincidence that your wifi is unstable right now
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> Speedtest days 20 ping with 89mbits
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> Speedtest days 20 ping with 89mbits
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> Speedtest says 20 ping with 89mbits
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Itube / Mustafa instead use WinMTR
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And precise the IP of the srv
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> It'll be more precise
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> You can then send it to deen probably if you don't understand it
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> Which srv
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> The one u lag in
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> Every srv
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Ah well
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube / Mustafa> ...

17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> S
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I see ddnet version is still 16.0.2 in `src/game/version.h` from master branch, but 16.0.3 was released. Should its value be updated?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah some day xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> who knows how many quick patches we'll still have ^^
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> @deen eu servers might have been the only ping showing up as numbers
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> i remember seeing most regions as letters, but it would make sense since i only joined GER3 (from  tutorial)
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but without the number is it shown as lower ping?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or higher?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> by color
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> @ReiTW aa pls send verify
