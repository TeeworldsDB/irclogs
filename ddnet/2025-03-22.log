01:04 < bridge> <avmedov> dude go to sleep
01:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no you
01:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> my lip gloss is not made from crushed beatles, im so glad i ahve this infomration
01:04 < bridge> <avmedov> wwhat are you talking about dude
01:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it says so on the thing
01:07 < bridge> <avmedov> hey buddy wanna know something?
01:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no i dont
01:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> good night
01:07 < bridge> <avmedov> idgaf
01:15 < bridge> <Property of Souly> the kerning of the clock symbol and the actual timer is too close
01:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i agree
01:15 < bridge> <avmedov> what?
01:15 < bridge> <avmedov> kerning?
01:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sadly dwm just uses the 2nd x attempt at fonts
01:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which doesnt handle unicode very well
01:16 < bridge> <avmedov> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??
01:16 < bridge> <avmedov> i can't understand anything
01:17 < bridge> <Property of Souly> maybe like this? edited the base image
01:17 < bridge> <Property of Souly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352798218869801044/image.png?ex=67df5305&is=67de0185&hm=3a307e08bb2b184bf90b9c2fb754f9b7664a87999d2158f2842f6a559990fdb9&
01:17 < bridge> <avmedov> what about it
01:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ik what it should look like, but its been a while since i had riced
01:17 < bridge> <Property of Souly> right sorry
01:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in the past year ive only made changes based on software breaking n such, and functionality
01:17 < bridge> <avmedov> yup im out peace
01:18 < bridge> <Property of Souly> solly is presumably adding a clock symbol next to the in-game time
01:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i should rice again
01:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is dwm
01:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352798499795767376/image.png?ex=67df5348&is=67de01c8&hm=09ad6a16de101ec98429f9331ea5d7f44a4307730304b0b8167590475cb23b57&
01:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doom scrolling at 00:18
01:18 < bridge> <Property of Souly> 💀
01:18 < bridge> <Property of Souly> it had dejavu sans
01:18 < bridge> <Property of Souly> thats probably why
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if fonts were handled correctly then it wouldnt matter
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but currently that clock symbol has the width of an `x`
01:19 < bridge> <Property of Souly> did you code the entire top bar?
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres actually a space imbetween there
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean its forked from dwm, but i rewrote... most of it
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so yeah
01:20 < bridge> <Property of Souly> are these like, groups of tabs?
01:20 < bridge> <Property of Souly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352799011051933747/image.png?ex=67df53c2&is=67de0242&hm=eebe5e292fa448ecb1622a0bb55797307ff3090a0f1ee60d542867a3aeff22de&
01:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> those are desktops or as dwm called them tags
01:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> each window can be in 1 to 9 tags, then i can show 1 to 9 tags
01:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i use them mainly as desktops
01:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the dots are just a count of windows
01:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would switch to hyprland
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but software and wayland dont get along (idc what you say, every application needs a random env var, just check if xdg session type)
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and i got a ton of config in dwm which i cant transfer
02:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> i switched to hyprland, yes you need alternative software if your current software isn't compatible, but other than that i had no software that didnt run (apart from some games, but thats a linux issue, not a wayland issue IMO)
02:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
02:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> wayland does have their issues yeah, but tbh if you want a tiling window manager just use i3 for X11, or sway for Wayland if you dont want fancy visuals

02:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> what do I do if I think i3 or sway is too boring but I'm too lazy to configure nerd software?
02:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> look through github and look for other people's configs
02:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ewwww
02:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> also too much eyecandy is just disstrackting imo
02:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> when i go full focus i just have either vim or vscode in fullscreen with no borders or whatever and music on the other xD
02:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's like borrowing a stranger's spoon without washing it
02:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> when i enable fullscreen transparency is turned off aswell, i love my background but its disstracking me while i code
03:25 < bridge> <remakepower> I found that

07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> works pretty well if you set the envvars
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> if you’re on nvidia i can give you a heaping list
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> hyprland workspaces work basically identically to how you’ve set it up if you use waybar
07:31 < bridge> <Ewan> but why

09:41 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> @robyt3 would you like me to test all of my crashing maps on this commit? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/master...Robyt3:ddnet:Datafile-Validation
10:28 < bridge> <teero777> is there a vector image of game.png?
10:37 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/blob/main/game.svg this maybe ?
10:38 < bridge> <teero777> yes thanks
10:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Sure, if you want to. This only fixes crash in `CDataFileReader` though, not in `CMap` or in the server/client/tools in general yet. You can quickly test with the new `map_test` tool from the PR if any of your fuzzed maps crash `CDataFileReader`.

11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it new that the cursor stays screen size on zoom out?
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant see shit xd
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> ya mean that? XD
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i assume it was one of Freddies PR's for Cursor
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352947730179166278/image.png?ex=67dfde43&is=67de8cc3&hm=5bbd9291963d1a0eaed9b4c12d0f959a8c38eb5971b9af5cd74f60b82a032d71&
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we make it small?
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> didnt find an option under `spec` `cursor` or `size`
11:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i dont think so
11:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> @.piggy.9 was that one of your changes?
11:14 < bridge> <robyt3> The cursor was always the same size, this has been the case since at least version 16.9
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm somehow i never noticed it covers the entire view port now
11:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> really? - maybe i just never noticed because i usually zoom out that far when i'm specced, which hides the cursor
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i do when im at home all the time
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> guess the cursor stuff was introduced when i was on laptop
11:15 < bridge> <teero777> cursor always stays same size
11:15 < bridge> <teero777> that was like since forever no?
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks like it
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it hides entire tees now tho xd
11:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Not every mode is DDNet based

12:08 < bridge> <kebscs> #announcements erm spectator count was already added in 19.0
12:09 < bridge> <oxyzo.> 2 spectator counts now
12:51 < bridge> <oxyzo.> heres the russian.txt translation for 19.1
12:51 < bridge> <oxyzo.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352973000726679594/russian.txt?ex=67dff5cc&is=67dea44c&hm=332bbdc9e0fe0abc97dba8fd8dfda092c84758f1a2df5e76034673f9e10de566&
13:11 < bridge> <Sans> how does one get context for a given translation?
13:12 < bridge> <Sans> @0xdeen ^^
13:12 < bridge> <kebscs> look for the text in code
13:13 < bridge> <teero777> search for Localize("English Text");
13:13 < bridge> <teero777> search for `Localize("English Text");`
13:13 < bridge> <Sans> thought there's an easier way, since the localize method has a second argument for exactly that
13:14 < bridge> <kebscs> its to distinguish translations because they can have same meaning, not to help the translators
13:14 < bridge> <Sans> wdym
13:14 < bridge> <kebscs> "allowed" with "Team status" context can mean something different than just "allowed"
13:14 < bridge> <Sans> ahh
13:14 < bridge> <robyt3> For example #8434 (which is not fixed yet)
13:14 < bridge> <Sans> i get it
13:14 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8434
13:15 < bridge> <teero777> -# a method is a function that is part of a class. everything else is called a function
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ive seen xwayland do magical things (setxkbmap works under wayland which is extremley cursed), so im not worried about software *not* running, im concerned about software running in containers in containers in containers
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a huge benefit of wayland is that there is no latency from compositing which means fancy effects for only the cost of fancy effects but if its running in a containers then that goes out the window and now its just as much latency as xorg with picom
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not about just tiling, ive modded dwm to the point where i cringe at calling it a fork, ive tried to configure hyprland to be similar, but its really hard since i cant just edit the c code behind it. i love fancy visuals, i dont use them on xorg due to latency
13:16 < bridge> <Sans> :shut:
13:16 < bridge> <Sans> before i start calling everything a subroutine
13:16 < bridge> <Sans> :mad:
13:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (and they have a different calling convention which means you have to do weird function ptr shenangns slightly differently, i dont know why cpp doesnt just treat them as functions with an extra arg)
13:17 < bridge> <teero777> vtable? xd or wdym
13:17 < bridge> <Sans> methods are functions with access to the class instance they're a part of
13:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (vtable is static per class, the function can encapsulate that data)
13:18 < bridge> <teero777> [a](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/142024/difference-between-function-method-routine-procedure-subprogram-subroutine)
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah its just got a "self"
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or "this"
13:18 < bridge> <Sans> Teero istg I will take you on a date and leave you with the bill
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its treated differently than an argument for whatever reason
13:19 < bridge> <Sans> i mean
13:19 < bridge> <Sans> in typescript its really not that complicated
13:19 < bridge> <teero777> i will leash you
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> js and ts always have a "this" variable per function scope
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not really an argument
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its really weird in js
13:20 < bridge> <Sans> you're weird
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but other people dont have to program in me
13:22 < bridge> <Sans> that can change :heh:
13:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nooooo!
13:23 < bridge> <Sans> I will make an esoteric lang out of everything you've ever written in this server
13:23 < bridge> <Sans> best lang ever
13:23 < bridge> <Sans> trust
13:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> rust but with more t
13:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> trust
13:24 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> just say if you need help with the swedish translation
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> `97% swedish`
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> they do
13:25 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> :) didnt see that
13:25 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> furo one step ahead again:wtf:
13:25 < bridge> <Sans> I will roll over dead in a grave 10 feet deep beneath 2 slabs of concrete and a tap dancing pad above that before I even dare think about r*st

13:55 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Is it normal that the rect added to ScrollRegion has negative height?
13:56 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> It killed many other elements😅
13:56 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352989198189068428/Screenshot_2025-03-22-20-26-03-882_org.ddnet.clienu.jpg?ex=67e004e2&is=67deb362&hm=36af3857a8b07ea0c21ebb5b67c97cb5b51c716c73ea693d96739ef2f6d594db&
14:00 < bridge> <robyt3> No, did you split the rect incorrectly before calling `AddRect`?
14:01 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> HSplitTop(30.0f, &Content, &Start);
14:01 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Like this?
14:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Try to add `dbg_msg`s at different steps to print the sizes of UI elements
14:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Depends on which object you are calling it on
14:02 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> AddRect(Content);
14:02 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> .AddRect(Content);
14:02 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> But I placed these two in a cycle
14:03 < bridge> <robyt3> `MouseSettings.HSplitTop(80.0f, &MouseSettings, &JoystickSettings);`
14:03 < bridge> <robyt3> This splits 80 height from the mouse settings and the remainder for the joystick settings
14:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Then `if(s_ScrollRegion.AddRect(MouseSettings))`
14:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait you can already disable dummy?
14:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Compare with existing usages of `CScrollRegion` and check the usage example in `ui_scrollregion.h`
14:03 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok
14:04 < bridge> <robyt3> The server can disable dummy, the touch controls can change visibility when dummy is allowed or not (to hide the button to connect dummy)
14:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i didnt know that
14:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does it also stop just f1 command
14:05 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, `Client()->DummyAllowed()` is also checked then
14:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :)

17:35 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> Legendary stream fr.
17:35 < bridge> <Property of Souly> what is chiller coding
17:36 < bridge> <Property of Souly> dunno
17:36 < bridge> <Property of Souly> fuck i cant watch stream, twitch put a giant popup in front of the screen and i have to click the "lets go" button like a sheep
17:37 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> Title : "teeworlds antibot development"
17:37 < bridge> <Property of Souly> me taking notes of this to make an anti-antibot
17:37 < bridge> <Property of Souly> omw to break rule 7 once again
17:37 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/antibob
17:38 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> This is his project rn from the stream I suppose
17:42 < bridge> <ayuayuayuayuayuayu> This is his project rn from the stream I suppose (not sure tho.)
17:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes it is
17:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good progress 0 commits since 2 hours
17:59 < bridge> <louis> make supervised learning classifier for tas chotters
18:03 < bridge> <alw5> it cant be that hard to detect that 2 runs are the exact same
18:06 < bridge> <louis> no, i mean for people who only rank their tas once on ddnet servers
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can some ddnet admin leak how the antibot send callback works?
18:06 < bridge> <louis> im sure its pretty easy to tell just with heuristics though, i doubt they carefully tas their mouse to look legit
18:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried this https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/4x
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> I'm glad you think so, we'd appreciate it very much if you put it together. All the tooling is there, you can parse teehistorian files with libtw2 or with the teehistorian crate, you can simulate the game using twgame. I'm sure Zwelf would give you a hand in their usage
18:12 < bridge> <learath2> Feel free to ask any admin for teehistorian files containing TAS'd runs
18:12 < bridge> <alw5> uhm
18:12 < bridge> <alw5> i think its hard
18:12 < bridge> <alw5> to detect 2 runs that are the same
18:14 < bridge> <louis> can i have 🥺
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller that looks about right, what breaks?
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> If you DM me tomorrow, sure
18:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i dont see a chat message
18:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also tried from the server side directly not from antibot i can not get the ``SendMsgRaw`` to work
18:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> passing the same packer to ``SendMsg`` works
18:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and there is no example of SendMsgRaw sadly somewhere
18:15 < bridge> <learath2> Ah
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> Give me one sec
18:20 < bridge> <learath2> `SendMsgRaw` does not include the msg id or the system flag
18:20 < bridge> <learath2> You need to pack by hand when doing that and you need to handle sixup clients by hand too
18:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wtf is this clang format
18:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353056761405505626/image.png?ex=67e043ce&is=67def24e&hm=ffdb10a58b56205c28dff783ae70cc2397c9d92cf7d547b635d872695a834dee&
18:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 can u send a example usage?
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> ```cpp
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> CNetMsg_Sv_Chat Msg;
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> Msg.m_Team = 0;
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> Msg.m_ClientId = 0;
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> Msg.m_pMessage = "Test message";
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> 
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> CMsgPacker MsgPacker(CNetMsg_Sv_Chat::ms_MsgId, false, false);
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> Msg.Pack(&MsgPacker);
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> 
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> CPacker Packer;
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> Packer.AddInt((pMsg->m_MsgId << 1) | (pMsg->m_System ? 1 : 0));
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> Packer.AddRaw(pMsg->Data(), pMsg->Size());
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> 
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> pData->m_pfnSend(ClientId, Packer.Data(), Packer.Size(), 0, pData->m_pUser);
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh i see thanks
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> You might want to define a helper function in your antibot, you can mostly steal `RepackMsg` from `ddnet/src/engine/server/server.cpp`
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
18:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 you dont doing ``Packer.Reset()`` trolled me a bit but got it working now thanks!
18:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> finest english
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> Hey I wrote it by hand looking at the code on another computer
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> Cut me some slack 😛
18:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :p 
18:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pretty sad that antibot can not add snap items
18:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> would be useful for zoom detection
18:46 < bridge> <Ewan> why?
18:46 < bridge> <Property of Souly> hi chat
18:46 < bridge> <Ewan> compare everything but the server time
18:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if players aim at fake tees that should not be visible
18:47 < bridge> <Ewan> hi property of souly
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> lot of tas runs are ran multiple times on diffrent names
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> filling the rank 1 with the same rank
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> multiple times
18:48 < bridge> <Ewan> but you’re comparing the run itself
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> which would be the same
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> because its the same time
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> for example stronghold
18:48 < bridge> <alw5> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353062896749248532/waterfox_GJXFCkiOvP.png?ex=67e04985&is=67def805&hm=24033356a126d38c977486e81f2d66c134068bf7075ea71e61cb37a3ef7d6dc8&
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you’re comparing the tee’s actions
18:49 < furo> @ChillerDragon You can probably detect badly coded zooz. By checking if `Cl_ShowDistance` and `Cl_CameraInfo` go outside the vanilla zoom.
18:49 < bridge> <alw5> im not sure what your point is or what your asking me
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> within some margin of error for lag
18:49 < bridge> <ramirok_> barren, ravilion, aimbot, drags maps
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought u were looking for duplicate/TASed runs
18:50 < bridge> <alw5> yes
18:50 < bridge> <alw5> correct
18:50 < bridge> <Ewan> if you have the teehistorian data, you can see where the tees are & when
18:50 < bridge> <Ewan> so you don’t need race time to compare the runs
18:50 < bridge> <alw5> maybe u could even compare time cps
18:50 < bridge> <alw5> tbc
18:50 < bridge> <ramirok_> Or they all passed it at the same time by pure luck.🤓☝🏻
18:50 < bridge> <alw5> tbh
18:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @furo yes ofc but thats easy to bypass
19:18 < bridge> <chairn> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFmxPMdBqmU

20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i really forgot what it was like to have slow internet
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm back where i was last summer trying to update gentoo on terrible wifi in the middle of nowhere
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm basicalyl back where i was last summer trying to update gentoo on terrible wifi in the middle of nowhere
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm basically back where i was last summer trying to update gentoo on terrible wifi in the middle of nowhere
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> some network configuration issue above my head means my computer can't connect to the wifi directly and i have to use my phone's hotspot :feelsbadman:
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> though i changed something in the config to allow wifi tethering over the cable & that means the phone can use the wifi and work directly thru the cable instead of having to use the wifi antenna for the computer and working off cell service
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> so it should be way better..
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> looooooool

20:37 < bridge> <ramirok_> Buy starlink

20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i forgot i even had this limit i've never run into it before
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i have exactly enough left to finish this upgrade, assuming it does finish
20:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> eh acsualy ill just let you fix that yourself too
20:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> jesus christ, i have 1gbps up and down for... not that much
20:46 < bridge> <iamhardliner> Cause I'm awesome
20:46 < bridge> <iamhardliner> 😄
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> rural
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> before i had xfinity's 2Gbps
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> for not that much
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> though it's nowhere near 2 up it's more about 350Mbps max
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it's called a high split but there's some DSP fundamental which makes it so that they can prioritize bandwidth each direction over coaxial
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but they did that bcs ppl in zoom meetings (most of the demand for internet during covid, especially the govt subsidy that was around for a while) are usually receiving many more video streams than they're sending
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> things of that nature
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but you basically can't buy cable internet with good upload speed here lol
21:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> 125 times 125 mbit seems wild to me.
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i just assumed that was a shady advertising thing for upload x download
21:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> get it, them sue them for not delivering 125 times 125mbit :kek:
21:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> then
21:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean someone tech illiteratre would assume that
21:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> given that the default interpretation of that is definatley multiplication
21:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and people can do internet speed tests without being literate (although a shitty corporate lawyer will argue that)
21:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> would probably go for the 500x500 variant. getting data center speeds for cheap.
21:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 250gbps :)
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> true
21:42 < bridge> <Property of Souly> this is a real _corner case\_!
21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> now i'm being throttled but i'm on the home stretch
21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353108834973122641/image.png?ex=67e0744d&is=67df22cd&hm=57cea7ec16663f67995516f9a284bf4cbd833f8175eaa3e512e6435918341e68&
21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> all i need is this system upgrade then i don't need the cell service hotspot 😭
21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> but now it's limiting me to 125*Kb*ps
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hmm thats alot of versions

22:58 < bridge> <chairn> wtf, that's so expensive
22:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @sollybunny: how do you have tclient and inf?
22:58 < bridge> <chairn> In France, it's around 20 to 30€ per month
23:07 < bridge> <robyt3> These indices are used in menu theme maps to position the camera, so they should stays the same for individual settings pages. I guess in retrospective it would have been easier to do a +100 to have a bunch of reserved indices if more settings pages are added.

23:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> merged em :)
23:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont feel like they *need* to stay the same
23:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be better if they were hashed strings so order didnt matter
23:12 < bridge> <robyt3> They are placed by putting specific tiles on the map though IIRC
23:12 < bridge> <robyt3> So they need to be integers
23:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh i see, i thought it was just randomly generated from the number
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> merged em :) @chillerdragon
23:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s cool! I wanted to do that in forever. @sollybunny how much work was it? And merged into where? Into your client or is it also in tater?
23:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> uhmm im not sure
23:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how much work it was
23:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the aproximate order is
23:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet, tater, ddnet-insta, inf
23:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t understand what you are ordering haha
23:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> order of merging
23:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How did you merge ddnet-insta into the client xd
23:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because the client happens to also have the server in the same codebase
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they like fighting about autoupdate, versions and config
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so i kinda just ignored autoupdates existance, versions wasnt that hard
23:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> config was a bit eeeeeh so i made a system for it

23:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or what "water" is
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and `Moving Tiles` which is pretty scary since ddnet might be adding that
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> at some point probbaly before accounts
23:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Let’s see how long you can keep this up
23:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are you planning to keep merging it?
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> similar to how im a bit iffy if you merge that accounts system
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> infclass has client prediction for lazer jump
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Laser jump (from a random instagib mod)`
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wonder if
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> okay but when do you merge ath for lua support?
23:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> never because i dont want to be blacklisted ):
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ath is legit
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> server side lua support?
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Client side
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how is that not hackz
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Trust me bro
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s legit client
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doesnt that stand for all the hax
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Common misconception
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes it does
23:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> <https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx>
23:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But it’s still legit
23:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im reading the feature list
23:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `SDL2 - smoother gameplay, copy-paste and immediate window resizing (platform dependend)`
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how old is this
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i could do the same with sdl3
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but im currently stuck... with it so
23:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It also says it’s up to date with ddnet
23:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `
23:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fc41bd1
23:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>  · 
23:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 4 years ago`
23:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s why you need to merge it
23:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> uhh
23:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Enter console commands right into the black console window` i want this
23:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but idk how it works with a srv and client running
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess we have auto auth so that doesnt matter
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is there like an `rcon` client side command
23:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes
23:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but annoying if you wanna do only server stuff
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then u can run server and have that also accept stdin
23:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dont you already have that
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in a client ive  seen things about
23:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Have what?
23:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> accept commands from stdin
23:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have a full curses client
23:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With proper input prompt
23:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I assume they just mix the stdin and stdout
23:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not too hard to make a good prompt with pure console
23:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> every repl ever has done it
23:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to varying success
23:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s not a repl
23:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Repls don’t log without input
23:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But go merge in chillerbot-ux into your pile haha
23:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353134043893465168/image.png?ex=67e08bc8&is=67df3a48&hm=d917959b94e2e13f0d9071252b725d3a6cb0575dcce10d792a3e8df26c951079&
23:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And you have it too
23:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> JavaScript
23:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sadly too many conflicting things with taterclient
23:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It looks cursed as if you typed hi
23:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah if i add console input ill be ... fixing that
23:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ill be stealing this for tclient or mine `cl_run_on_vote_start say "/save secret_save_code"`
23:33 < bridge> <Property of Souly> hiiiii people of the internet
23:34 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i got my physics to work
23:34 < bridge> <Property of Souly> im very proud
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/refs/heads/chillerbot/other/term-ux_rcon.png
23:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the ncurses mode is cool but would be nice if it could be a arg instead of compile opt
23:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also would be hard to merge your changes to it without getting everything else
23:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im sure theres some fancy way to do it
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds like a good change you can do after merging it in
23:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do you not want that on urs
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not really
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Either I use gui or I don’t
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I use the log for reading a lot
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But never have the urge to input there
23:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but having to recompile or keep 2 exes is a bit eeee
23:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have a package manager for that
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 👀
23:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes save on vote start is op
23:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you afk on solo maps
23:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you  didnt use the modular nameplates for the image above tee, is shame
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> probably for the best i might rewrite it again 🧌
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :trollet:
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I added name coloring before you were born and never changed it again
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh you mean the image thing that’s old too
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tclient has the name coloring thing with warlist too now
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wana change it to be tags
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so you have "novice" next to the name
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> such that it supports multiple things at the same time
23:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
23:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only thing I need is one war reason
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz moderator and teamcolors already want to change the name
23:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i use my warlist to set players skills, it would be nice if i could set someone to be a blocker and a novice
23:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to distinguish them from blockers i have to be scared about
23:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
23:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i also want to replace all the name"tags" with the same thing for consistency
23:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rn the friend icon, id, name and moderator/war/team/friend status are all rendered differently everywhere
23:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Road to 10 fps
23:44 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i sleep, gn
23:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You not gonna shared physics?
23:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon actually not really since alot of the places names are rendered generate the text container every time 
23:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> new nameplates are more performant (by a tiny margin) since ids used to be generated every time
23:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i get frame drops opening scoreboard or statboard, and on debug build... its bad
