00:18 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> does sv_max_clients not respond at runtime or sth?
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> stupid
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> dont' think so
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe should be enabled after reload
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or smth
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> most games require restart to change that
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but not while playing
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, reload doesn't work as well
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> sv_max_clients in rcon shows changed value
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> knowing the structure of the code i dont see any reason why it cant be changed on the run
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but server still use that at runtime
00:21 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> do we have a way of sending a whisper from console or a targeted server msG?
00:21 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nope
00:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> targeted server msg?
00:22 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> really wanted to talk to im corneum but apparently even having access to the server itself won't get me in that server ðŸ˜›
00:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh you mean, via console
00:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> right
00:22 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> he asked me if i told to remove his mod :/
00:23 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i think he got things totally wrong
00:23 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> he asked me if i removed it
00:23 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i said no he left
00:24 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> interestingly enough from the code it seems you should be able to change max clients on the run
00:25 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh nvm
11:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Booed?
11:33 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> who is booed?
11:33 < ddnet-discord> <snail> me
11:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh
11:33 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> he pushed directly
11:33 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ah
11:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> You hadn't another acc?
11:34 < ddnet-discord> <snail> nope
11:34 < ddnet-discord> <snail> ill change my username
11:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> thought so ðŸ˜›
11:55 < Logo> Hey guys. I wonder if somebody is here who can help me with the ddnet source code. 
17:16 < ddnet-discord> <Tezcan> hey, why does my ddnet-server closes itself, when i try to open it?
17:17 <@deen> Tezcan: Read the output on console or log file
17:17 <@deen> maybe it doesn't find the map file or can't write a log because of fs permissions
17:21 < ddnet-discord> <Tezcan> Ups, thank you deen! i deleted the mapfile
