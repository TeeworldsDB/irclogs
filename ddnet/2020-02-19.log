11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why? @ChillerDragon
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It’s a mess to put Config() there because it’s a interface
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Anyways big guru Heinrich said it’s bad code.
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> If we get the new 0.7 Config system to ddnet6 we can also add starting servers from client
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I don't see a good reason for this one
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> For what @Learath2 ? My refactor? Ox’s refactor? Server from client?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oy*
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your PR
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Well it’s a Config in a Interface that will be ugly with the new config system
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But there is probably a better way of doing that. If you know one pls feel free to fix or explain it and I can try
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We probably will never migrate to the new config system on ddnet6 anyway
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 yea I was afraight someone will say that there won’t be the new cfg sys in ddnet. Will make copying code more annoying then :/
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Well but this has to be solved somehow for the 0.7 client because currently I am not able to use my dummy •.•

14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby here?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> +
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you help me get old versions of ddnet compiling on macOS?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what is the error
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is no `-lGl` on new macOS and our cmakefile doesn't do frameworks
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I need to use bam
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes i use bam to compile
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but with bam I get issues with "CarbonSound/CarbonSound.h"
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon ?? it is the same as before, why shouldnt dummy worj
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems new macOS deprecated some of the carbon framework
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> mm
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> dont remember if i fixed anything in here
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/679677798067339304/bam.lua
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> other/sdl/sdl.lua not found
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> other/sdl
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/679678109582360620/sdl.zip
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm missing a lot of things in other/
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which version is this bam.lua from?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 1062
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what else r u missing
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you rip parts of the newer bam?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont think so
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if its changed at all then its just to fix dependencies
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm only missing -lcrypto now after messing around with the carbon include
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> sounds like something else that i mightve fixed in that bam.lua? or its not installed
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it definitely is installed, hmm
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ye no this isn't working, I can't be assed with fixing an ancient build system
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :thonkery:
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> which parts are still missing
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> already nuked it
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rq
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 why compile old version ?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> trying to find a performance issue
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you remember how you compiled ddnet10 on macOS?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut well since Oy introduced the new config system I had to comment out the config in client.h to get it working
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Compiling* but that killed the dummy
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Did you set the environment variables for crypto @Learath2 ?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do I need to set?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Brew should tell you
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> After installing it
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR set I think
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's it
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Try reinstalling OpenSSL or what ever it was and maybe brew will give you a hint
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Or what is your current error message?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I stopped trying
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rq
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe tomorrow I'll give it another go
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it was first complaining about the SDL includes, which end up being wrong when you are using the framework
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ye classic
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> after fixing those it gave issue with deprecated carbon interfaces
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is there a macOS performance issue ?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon no?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> after fixing those it gave issue with -lcrypto
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What why
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> comment out
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> after fixing that it gave issue with -lopusfile and I just rq
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Because I do not have access to a Config there @fokkonaut :/
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need a config instance now
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you dont need it there chiller
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> In a Interface?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wouldn’t that be ugly
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just place the { return } stuff in the cpp file
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't have a config instance there
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and use Config() there
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah you need it in the implementation
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Well
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fixed
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/679687807576702996
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But wouldn’t moving that to a class that implements the interface and exposing all the variables defeat the purpose of a interface?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [7:56 AM]  ChillerDragon: Is there a macOS performance issue ?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> kindof
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet 10.6 gives about 400fps and doesnt make my fans spin at all
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet 11.9 gives about half the fps and also makes the fans spin
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> not that 200fps is bad but the fact that it decreased by 200% seems concerning
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @ChillerDragon this ^+ i dont like to hear the fans spin for hours
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> seems bad for it
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Did you try 0.7 ? :troll:
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ye fanspin Sound is the worst
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> gtfo with ur 0.7
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :p
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i think sorting alphabetically is better for Commands
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or maybe a NetBool to pass on every command that says whether to sort this one in alphabetically or not
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like this you could make seperated blocks of commands, where all cmds from a block would be sorted, but the rest wouldnt
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe
