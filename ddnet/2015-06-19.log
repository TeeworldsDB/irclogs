00:19 < Savander_> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1637#p16864 he's right in my opinion, moderators can do too much, and they are friends, you should have control of them.
00:20 <@deen> then report misbehaviour to another mod or to me directly
00:20 < Savander_> as is said, they are friends
00:20 <@deen> friends to whom?
00:21 < Savander_> they together
00:21 <@deen> then report to me
00:21 <@deen> I'm not friends with any of the mods
00:21 < Savander_> btw. they all have same permissons
00:22 < Savander_> so another mod can't do anything in my opinion
00:22 <@deen> another mod can review the situation
00:22 <@deen> and in case the reporter is right, talk to the respective mod
00:22 <@deen> or to me, if that mod doesn't see his fault
00:22 <@deen> and I can surely remove a mod
00:26 < Savander_> Okay, trust you
00:26 < Savander_> :)
00:26 < Savander_> I can't others
00:26 < Savander_> they sthey change their minds very often :)
00:27 < Savander_> good night then
00:27 <@deen> good night, Savander_ 
11:30 < Savander> hi
11:30 <@EastByte> hi
11:30 <@EastByte> Already rescued your family?
11:31 < Savander> o.O?
11:31 <@EastByte> join oldschooladventure (solomap) :D
11:31 < Savander> oh, this map!
11:32 < Savander> I remember this map, haha
12:48 <@deen> Hm, so people are saying that the code of conduct is just there to censor other opinions
12:49 < Savander> which point
12:49 <@deen> i don't know, all of it?
12:50 < Savander> If people are not cultured, they should not write too much.
13:18 <@deen> Sigh, this is really annoying
13:18 <@EastByte> :/
13:19 <@deen> I'm being insulted now, but they call me "dien" instead of "deen" so that they can say they're not really talking about me^^
13:19 <@deen> It's just ridiculous
13:19 <@deen> Also that my Code of Conduct is against the european human rights

13:33 < laxadedi> deen: I think you should a private mailing list or a comitee to make decisions like that about ddnet
13:33 < laxadedi> *make
13:33 < laxadedi> rules are nice, but after reading them, you forgot that teeworlds community is really young, I think more general rules and not using the word 'law' would be better
13:34 < laxadedi> kids won't understand them or care about them anyway...
13:34 < laxadedi> and people will always complain more than to say it's a good decision
13:45 <@deen> the most people who make problems are not young
13:49 <@EastByte> indeed
13:50 <@deen> the young players of ddnet are mostly quiet and nicely playing
13:50 <@deen> some of them insult people, you just tell them to stop and that it's not nice and they stop
13:51 <@deen> no big problems there imo
13:53 < laxadedi> well, anyway, they'll never be happy then...
15:22 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/compare/Savander/Savander/Savander/Savander/

15:51 <@deen> ^^

16:20 < bigman> Hi
16:20 < Savander> hi
16:21 < bigman> I have a function that returns an array of integers how i can store its result in another array ?
16:22 <@deen> in C/C++?
16:22 < bigman> c
16:22 <@deen> in TW?
16:22 < bigman> yes
16:22 <@deen> mem_copy(destArray, sourceArray, size);
16:23 < bigman> sourceArray is my function call ?
16:24 <@deen> I don't think you can easily return an array in C, so I'm not sure what you actually get back
16:24 <@deen> i thought you pass the address of the array to your function and it gets filled
16:25 < bigman> if i do that then i can not loop through the array
16:25 < bigman> or i dont know how to do that
16:25 < bigman> :D
16:31 < laxadedi> while (array[index]) ?
16:32 < laxadedi> you wanna merge 2 arrays of integer right ?
16:40 < bigman> hmm
16:40 < bigman> no
16:42 < bigman> im converted characters from utf8 to unicode and stored then into an integer array
16:43 < bigman> now i want replace them with their equalant in another function
16:44 < bigman> but if i send the array to a function i dont know how to receive the result

19:01 < Savander> can someone explain me, how it works?
19:01 < Savander> it's on zcatch ofc
19:01 < Savander> bot detection
19:01 < Savander> but, what exactly it does?
19:02 < Savander> and probably, need to change one thing https://github.com/savander/zCatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L552-L554
19:03 < Savander> because, it'll check only one time,
19:03 < Savander> meh

19:11 < Savander> ;)
19:11 < Learath2> Savander: looks like its well commented
19:12 < Savander> yes, but sometimes it detect 
19:12 < Savander> clear people
19:12 < Savander> and i don't know hyw :D
19:12 < Savander> why*
19:12 < Savander> it's not my code
19:13 < Learath2> prolly because proper bot detection can not look like that
19:14 < Learath2> there is some console output you should check that to find out what was wrong by that particular player
19:15 < Savander> only once, message is sent
19:15 < Savander> when this "detect" something
21:05 < o_be_one> hi all :)
