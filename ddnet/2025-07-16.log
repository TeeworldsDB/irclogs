11:12 < bridge> <carmine1985> Hello everyone,
11:12 < bridge> <carmine1985> Do you know if there exists a ready made configured docker image for hosting the server ?
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @carmine1985 https://github.com/BanBansNet/ddnet-docker/
11:22 < bridge> <carmine1985> I read the dokerfile but I am not sure if it is possible to add a service that restarts the server in case it crash
11:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> the service is called docker
11:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> and it restarts containers
11:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-compose-restart-policies
11:27 < bridge> <carmine1985> I would try to deploy the image on koyeb.com
11:27 < bridge> <carmine1985> Do you think it automatically detects if the CMD isn't running and restarts it?
11:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> dunno that website
11:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> gotta read their docs
11:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> rough guess: probably yes
11:30 < bridge> <carmine1985> It has a generous free tier, capable enough for small things like DDNet/Teeworlds servers

11:38 < bridge> <Assa> if it's a bash script, you may want to put `set -e` in it so it actually stops running even if some command fails

12:28 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks is it possible to obtain max and min position of an envelope? I am not too familiar on how it's implemented
12:28 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks is it possible to obtain max and min position of an envelope? I am not too familiar on how it's implemented, I mean for x and y
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> except for the splines i have seen in ddnet rs, I believe it must always be one of the envelope points
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> today I learned the default client also has spline support :3
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> this makes me happy, but destroys my plan
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> actually it doesn't, in case of a spline point, it has to be below the "triangle"

13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You plan to chunk
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Quads
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
13:19 < bridge> <Assa> I plan to clip quads (for now)
13:19 < bridge> <Assa> like automatically clip the full quad layer, so it can be early skipped. I already have maps where clipping quad layers greatly improves fps
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> you just need to compute the clip region on map load and then early skip if it applies
13:22 < bridge> <Assa> the way i am implementing it you could easily chunk it as well, I want the CQuadRenderGroup, which already does grouping, to handle it

13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is implementing a balanced binary tree a hard question
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess its not something companies ask
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> Too long to ask on a coding interview IMO
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was preparing a bit my algo skills
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> for a upcoming interview
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk how i ended trying to do that myself
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i thought, wait, this looks a bit longer than i expected
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz i heard about the popular invert a binary tree
13:27 < bridge> <learath2> Looking to change jobs?
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ive already talked about this iirc
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ye im in talks with some
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> 150k$ or more if it works out
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had one interview now second
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i could say they interested i guess
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> also full remote, so i can travel europe while working
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:29 < bridge> <learath2> I hear reversing a linked list is still common-ish. Some dynamic programming is common, like basic memoization
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean, they said its not leet code style
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> but some code writing
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> the current one i am, asked me to reverse words in a string
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder why not looking at my projects is not enough assesment of skills
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u need to put me under pressure while nervous
13:30 < bridge> <learath2> That's a nice one, not too hard, not too easy. State machine?
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can fail stupid questions when nervous
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah just some basic loops
13:31 < bridge> <learath2> This I'll never understand either. Like when during my work am I not allowed to look up an algorithm and just write it at my own pace?
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer take homes
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe nowadays they want to asses if i can code without vibe coding
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i never used ai)
14:10 < bridge> <Assa> why does the bezier envelope has 4 channels for delta x?

15:17 < bridge> <robyt3> Which triangle do you mean? To determine the rough minimum and maximum you'd have to evaluate the envelope function at different times like the editor does.
15:17 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1395031621450727504/image.png?ex=6878f7f0&is=6877a670&hm=c936780f2e5148c3f76d48746410d3bac502faf5ada8dd2f73b2ccb6c4a65465&
15:17 < bridge> <Assa> oh wait I am not rendering the lamp ü§î
15:18 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 how do you reorder in <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10520>
15:18 < bridge> <kebscs> right click and type in order?
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> to get it perfect, yes, but I can just guess the maximum and minimum offset by taking the position of the triangle in your graphic. Overall I am basically working on a better culling
15:20 < bridge> <robyt3> In one step, so either using text input or drag the value from 0 to 2 immediately without creating a history entry for 1. But it seems somewhat inconsistent to reproduce. If you try to reorder, delete and undo/redo you should enventually reveal some buggy behavior.
15:20 < bridge> <kebscs> i tried for a while and couldnt reproduce
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> I mean the top right and top left point, which are indicated as a triangle
15:20 < bridge> <kebscs> but i see the bug in your screenshots
15:20 < bridge> <kebscs> last screenshot there is `Edit layer 0 in group 1`
15:21 < bridge> <kebscs> shoudl have been layer 2, after move
15:21 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean saved index in history is should be one after moving it
15:21 < bridge> <kebscs> so its incorrectly 0 and when you undo it applies to diff layer
15:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe try to restart the client after a few tries, it might somehow only be reproduced on certain runs
15:22 < bridge> <robyt3> I think the message as correct, it was the game layer that I moved, which was layer 0 before the action was performed
15:22 < bridge> <robyt3> I think the message was correct, it was the game layer that I moved, which was layer 0 before the action was performed
15:22 < bridge> <robyt3> But it would also be helpful if those messages would say "game layer" instead of "layer 0"
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> is it possible to create a bezier configuration, where the line goes over both triangles and both stationary points?
15:23 < bridge> <kebscs> yes but the saved index into history is the index after moving
15:25 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not sure, there were some edge cases if tangents have X=0 but I can't seem to reproduce it anymore
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> i can reproduce by chaning order and quickly pressing escape to close popup
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> the reroder wont be registered in history
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> but ig thats a differnt bug
15:35 < bridge> <kebscs> i can reproduce by chaning order and pressing escape before letting go to close popup
15:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Possible, might be a way to reproduce #8816
15:39 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8816
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i didnt know it but today i discovered that if u have a dataset of <1k (maybe works with a few more), and specially for read heavy, a btreemap is faster than a hashmap
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> hashing is a bit expensive it seems xD
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it also depends on the specific hash algorithm and the way the hashmap is structured, but I can imagine it being faster yeah
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah rust default hash is a bit slow
16:05 < bridge> <Assa> does anyone know how to convert quad points (not the center one) into map points? The coordinates are different, a CQuad contains an int, while the map obviously allows sub-tile quad point positions
16:05 < bridge> <Assa> it's not done with `/ 32`, tried that already
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> `typedef ivec2 CPoint; // 22.10 fixed point`
16:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Use `f2fx` and `fx2f` for conversion
16:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> fixed point holy based

17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u know for random input, specially if its a bit lengthy, picking the median as pivot makes the worst case better
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > choosing the median of the first, middle and last element of the partition for the pivot (as recommended by Sedgewick).[17] This "median-of-three" rule counters the case of sorted (or reverse-sorted) input, and gives a better estimate of the optimal pivot (the true median) than selecting any single element, when no information about the ordering of the input is known.
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Specifically, the expected number of comparisons needed to sort n elements (see ¬ß Average-case analysis) with random pivot selection is 1.386 n log n. Median-of-three pivoting brings this down to Cn, 2 ‚âà 1.188 n log n, at the expense of a three-percent increase in the expected number of swaps
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Selecting a pivot element is also complicated by the existence of integer overflow. If the boundary indices of the subarray being sorted are sufficiently large, the na√Øve expression for the middle index, (lo + hi)/2, will cause overflow and provide an invalid pivot index. This can be overcome by using, for example, lo + (hi‚àílo)/2 to index the middle element, at the cost of more complex arithmetic. Similar issues arise in some other methods of 
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> gotta remember this too
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> the true median is optimal, they are talking about median of three, however the worst case is still the same
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> It brings down the average case
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah ye
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> wish me luck its in 5 mins
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> im rly nervous xd
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What?
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> You can improve the worst case by picking the median of medians as the pivot, but that is more expensive to pick the pivot, really hard to say without much deeper analysis and benchmarking to say whether it's good for the average case
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Whatever, uninstall nervous
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Useless emotion
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> they said its not leet code so it probs its not smth hard ig
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> brb
17:57 < bridge> <robyt3> See the `CRenderTools::RenderEvalEnvelope` function, the values are relative to the points
17:58 < bridge> <Assa> only question, is the anchor of the InTangentDeltaY the next or the current point
17:58 < bridge> <robyt3> See code
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> now I understand the problem, I need to also check the point before the current one, if it's also of type bezier, so I add it's min/max
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> this was not really straight forward
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> it doesn't crash or cause undefined behavior so I don't consider it missing safety checks. It logs `Error unpacking snapshot delta. DataSize=-302` seemingly because the snapshot being unpacked is full.
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> In particular, the check `m_NumItems >= CSnapshot::MAX_ITEMS` fails for this demo
18:19 < bridge> <teero777> ah okay
18:19 < bridge> <teero777> seems weird tho since the state is somehow not dependent on the timeline no?
18:19 < bridge> <robyt3> If I increase `MAX_ITEMS` to `2048` it plays without error message, but it indeed works weirdly when skipping through the demo
18:20 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know how the demo was recorded, but maybe it misses some snapshots and only has deltas
18:35 < bridge> <Assa> bezier is not perfekt, but I guess this culling region is good enough

18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So what was it about now?
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> mean of 2 unsigned integers, which has the problem of what i sent before lmao, but i was so nervous its different, but ended up doing that.
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> then finding pairs of distinct  integers in an array, looks easier than it seems, more so while coding in a google docs and nervous af, i dont remember if there was another exercise cuz my memory went blank now
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess it didn go bad

19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was more so walking from a initial impl that probs has errors to the correct one
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not a bad style i guess
19:25 < bridge> <louis> howd it go lol
19:25 < bridge> <louis> i also had an inteeview this morning xd
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What interview even xd
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Leak
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah this, nice
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would this like triple your salary lol
19:43 < bridge> <melon> @learath2 is ddnet.org's server dying?
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> does it just start dying when I think of going out for food?
19:44 < bridge> <melon> `2025-07-16 17:42:41.233 - ERROR - Exception during http post: AxiosError: Request failed with status code 504`
19:44 < bridge> <melon> 
19:44 < bridge> <melon> post requests to "REDACTED" dont work.
19:44 < bridge> <melon> and "REDACTED" in #REDACTED dont work
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> The funding page opens btw, it's a php issue
19:44 < bridge> <melon> rip
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> there goes my dinner plans :pepeW:
19:45 < bridge> <melon> NOO
19:45 < bridge> <melon> i can ping murp
19:45 < bridge> <melon> XD
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> seems the server is very busy doing something with mariadb for whatever reason
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1395099735542595624/image.png?ex=68793760&is=6877e5e0&hm=9cbd6a94b48a4026247da421b39178f515c0e6a97ad7a8e1414060f23311d694&
19:49 < bridge> <learath2> Ah I know what it is
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> someone must have done /points 
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> Hopefully that should have fixed it, we should just get rid of the stupid forum, such a large attack surface
20:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg forum works
20:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> forum has a lot of valuable info about teeworlds and ddnet in general
20:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> why close it
20:08 < bridge> <louis> what happened
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> it's an unmaintained old piece of software that no one uses but is killing the server every other month
20:08 < bridge> <melon> can we just archive some of the funniest forum threads and call it a day
20:08 < bridge> <melon> i dont want to loose the love letter from Colo Colo
20:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> yesss
20:08 < bridge> <melon> or the thread about n9
20:08 < bridge> <kebscs> Archive a copy and close it
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> If we do get rid of it it'll become read-only
20:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> just wayback machine the whole forum
20:09 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea
20:09 < bridge> <kebscs> Or like actual archive and host somewhere
20:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> isnt it read only already?
20:09 < bridge> <melon> nah, if you have an account you can do stuff on it
20:10 < bridge> <melon> its just that approximately 9 people still have an account
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> of the 17.4k requests made to the forum only 4 were real people
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1395105226264150237/image.png?ex=68793c7d&is=6877eafd&hm=1d05e7aa03d116673c6c826783bf0d2ac478298b7c2fa73285fd91cd4bef0aa6&
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> thanks forum
20:10 < bridge> <melon> probably me
20:10 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
20:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> watahel
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> 1 is me testing the challenge
20:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> is someone ddosing it or what
20:10 < bridge> <melon> every service on this god forsaken planet is getting pinged atleast once every 10 minutes tbh
20:11 < bridge> <melon> i once had my home manager run on port 8080 to test something, took them 3 minutes until the first http auth request came in
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> Thank god to cloudflare making this fairly easy to handle
20:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> how do they even know what ip address you have
20:12 < bridge> <melon> for ip in ip_range where ip_range is 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255
20:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea as i thought xd
20:12 < bridge> <melon> and then they do a portscan randomly, wait for a response
20:13 < bridge> <melon> if they get any response, they take it one step further and vice versa
20:13 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, seems handled, I'll go have food now
20:13 < bridge> <melon> they then send basic generic auths to those services, like
20:13 < bridge> <melon> user: root
20:13 < bridge> <melon> pass: root
20:13 < bridge> <learath2> something is bound to break the second I leave
20:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have been trying to open a local port recently
20:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> well no more
20:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> im scared now
20:13 < bridge> <melon> i'll let you know dont worry
20:13 < bridge> <melon> :3
20:13 < bridge> <melon> enjoy your food! and thank you
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> Good thing you caught me right before I left
20:30 < bridge> <kebscs> good idea splitting it into smaller
20:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
22:27 < bridge> <chairn> so you need to sort to get median to get better sorting performance, hmm, ourobouros ?
22:29 < bridge> <chairn> ddos on forum ?
22:30 < bridge> <chairn> could it be ai crawler ?
22:45 < bridge> <totar> Shouldn't this be a multiple of max clients so we don't need to do that again?
22:45 < bridge> <totar> Im not logged into gh on my phone to comment
22:59 < bridge> <louis> you dont use github mobile authentication?
22:59 < bridge> <totar> no?
23:00 < bridge> <totar> You mean through the app?
23:00 < bridge> <kebscs> probably
23:17 < bridge> <louis> yeah the github 2fa codes thru the github app
23:18 < bridge> <louis> i guess its probably easier to use a dedicated 2fa app now that i think abt it
