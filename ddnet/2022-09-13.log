01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the second looks a bit annoying to read due to spelling mistakes. still worth it despite this?

08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> controllers on mac don't work?
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> For me controller only worked in steam when i disable steam input for some reason xD xbox360
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> oh so never worked without steam?
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But maybe it's related to sdl version
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Currently use a custom version bcs the official was broken
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But yeah only steam and only with that workaround
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Funny thing is that on many games i have to enable steam input to have controller working on ddnet it's opposite for some reason
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> eh for some reasons it's just not detecting it
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and I'm 100% sure it's connected since I can use it elsewhere

10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Robyt3 I guess they should work with your recent addition
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/news/LPC-2022-Rust-Linux
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> why wouldn't they be as fast?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Some arguments would be the constraints rust imposes
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But its always good to prove its as fast

11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this sucks for aya 😦
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whats that
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Compile Once : Run Everywhere
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> basically it uses vmlinux
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I use that for kernelspace

12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Took an oral exam for computer architecture, the guy structured it like a russian roulette. 1 mandatory question, 2 optional questions. Any wrong answers and regardless of your score in the written exam you fail. If he asks any of the optional ones there is no take backs
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wat
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> any wrong answers and you fail the course. a) bad bad bad b) has he thought about the psychological impact that has?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's devastating. I knew the entire course curriculum and more and even I was concerned when I took the 2 optionals
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To be fair. The questions arent that difficult if you know the content. But the way he structures the exam makes it so scary
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's a bad teacher
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you wanna change school, you can study where i now works 🙂
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn do you teach rust?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And congratz on the work
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I keep seeing that learning lisp will change your view on many things
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is it true?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I rly should learn it
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is like a big lisp cult
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "cult"
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> learning some basic haskell taught me a bit about functional programming patterns many years ago. maybe lisp is similar 🙂
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> gameshow exam, "Would you like to go double or nothing on your grade with the final bonus question?"
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I was joking xD, but ive seen more comments on saying how lisp changed more their way of thinking and not the same for haskell
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe its a bias hn has
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just see it there a lot
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i teach digital electronics and processor architecture and design
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i could also teach c/c++
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sounds interesting
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn could you work, say, as a cpu designer for intel/amd?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i could
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there was ARM where i live, but they left 2 or 3 years ago
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i could also work for NVidia, and any company that does CPU or alikes designs
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Would you say the years you spent learning this were efficiently spent?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> define "efficiently spent"
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Could have you learnt what you needed in a smaller time span
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And where most of the things you learnt relevant
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably yes. But what matters imo, is to be able to stand back, get some time to look at the bigger picture in a complete system rather than just the circuit you're supposed to work
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably yes. But what matters imo, is to be able to stand back, get some time to look at the bigger picture in a complete system rather than just the circuit you're supposed to work on
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess from experience during my phd. My master 2 was not that interesting, but it gave me a quite broad picture of all the different things that exist
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I think the most important stuffs i learnt are from my internships as well. My first one was on cache design and replacement policy
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> my second one was on processor design in C++ language using High Level Synthesis (HLS)
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Since you understand how processors work in high detail, would you say it helps you optimize code? Or do you need to know more about compiler intrinsics/codegen etc
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sry for the questions xd im just curious
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can optimize the algorithm, but fine tuning the code requires to know the internal design of cpu
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> anyway, you shouldn't need to do that as compiler does it way better than you except in some cases like some very used function that you can fine tune
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sometimes i wish i still continued uni but i sometimes also think i did well, i didnt work back then and it was a high cost (even if its a public uni) and i knew i would take more than the 4 years, which means i would spend even more money (well, my parents)
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Although i do like learning more by myself, at my pace, without anxiousness from exams
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just need more time
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> For instance, one important design aspect in CPU that has a large impact on code performance is cache. And im still baffled at how many developpers don't know about cache while it can easily hinder their code performance
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Many ppl in c
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Teach linked lists
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Load Store Queue is rather linked list friendly 🙂
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Doctor Chairn
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> soon
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> defense will be held in december normally
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn will you teach ur students about the aclaimed open source game made in c++ that is ddnet?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably not as the class i give are not software oriented but hardware oriented
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeye was joking
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc do you think this level of radical restructuring of the code is worth it?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tldw he starts with the usual entities with properties model but ends up with arrays of properties indexed by the entity and transformation functions that work on groups of properties that fit into the cache entirely
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I imagine it'd be a huge improvement as you could also utilize vectorization much easier this way, but I was never quite sure whether this would have a significant enough improvement that it's worth making the code less intuitive
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sounds like the good old array of structures vs structures of arrays 🙂
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the dude is my type tho
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/xd0y6b/slow_progress_is_stil_a_progress/
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, that's the gist of it indeed
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it all depends on the access patterns
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just realized this is #developer oops
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the only way we are slowly cleaning up ddnet 😄
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't have time to watch it right now, im procrastinating too hard on reddit 😄
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Modules that are new are coded cleanly with nice interfaces, good encapsulation
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Outside those it's a proper mess
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> spaghetti code remains me of my grandma cuisine ❤️
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> spaghetti code reminds me of my grandma cuisine ❤️
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a fun watch if you can handle some C++ slander. He is a good talker. Though his ideas aren't extremely new indeed
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I hate messy code but I can't code anything clean so that's a problem.
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This was my concern with the idea aswell. The way you code intuitively with array of structs you do end up with properties relevant to the entity within the cache. If your next values rely on anything except the old value of the property, it is possible that the other way is actually more cache efficient
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I've been doing some interviews lately as well, and they keep asking about THE design pattern of our overall project and I don't even know how to answer, everytime.
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I watched this talk before
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gotta re-watch a little to make sure
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just say entity component system
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Over and over again
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what does it even mean
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't really get design patterns in general tbh
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We achieve a high kernel hit ratio by utilizing a pub sub component system model
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ECS is what unity does. Each entity gets many components, like a script component, a physics component, an animation component etcetc
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> isn't unity trying to move from GameObjects into a ECS structure?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and there's a package call ECS which is still in preview
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I know some of them, but there is no way to nail single one into a unity project when you have so many third-party code that scaffold it.
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.51/manual/index.html
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly dont know how unity works. I know you can use it as ECS pretty much though
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure if it's the default or something they are working towards
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe both and they just redefined what ecs really means to them
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Unity has too many unfinished system at this point
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ECS is basically a pattern that helps with achieving the design that guy was talking about in the talk without the code looking completely insane 😄
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i might watch it later in bed
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is a decent talker, you might enjoy it
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> There's a new UILayout system that is meant to replace the UnityUI system that replaced UnityGUI system with a new TextLayout system that replace the TextMeshPro layout system which they bought to replace their own old UnityUI text system.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, so much iteration
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Unity has three different text layout system in-engine right now and none of them has a complete features set. Unity was updating the TextMeshPro thing they bought and just dropped it and leave it in preview forever and started working on their new UI system which is also in preview
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wrong
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw i think i'm not good at interviews nor looking for jobs
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unity ECS is not like the ECS that bevy uses
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont have  "systems"
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless you mean the new experimental thing
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's ok, just never leave your job
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i forgot where i saw this on hn
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was well explained
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what if the jobs leave him?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's what i thought so I was a bit confused
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, so only a little wrong 😄
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no, its completly different
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz in ECS the entity is just a id
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ECS is like SQL for games
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't think unity calls their default structure ECS
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> systems are the queries
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It uses a very core idea to ECS. Just didn't take it to it's logical conclusion. I think it's closer to what an ECS is supposed to be rather than the traditional OOP structure

17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Based on many of the comments here, it seems like there’s a lot of misunderstanding of what an ECS is - unfortunately the name does this no favors as it should probably be written as entity/component/system paradigm or renamed entirely. It’s not just a system that contains entities and components (that’s not what “system” refers to in the ECS name).
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > ECS is a paradigm where entities are the data-free IDs, components contain data associated with entities, and the systems operate on entities and components in batch, usually with database-like queries.
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I have yet to find a good ECS reference, but Unity’s intro[0] gives some decent flavor for it. Note that only the DOTS subset of Unity (part of it anyways) uses an ECS. The default GameObject/MonoBehavior way of writing code in Unity isn’t part of an ECS.

17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> every interview I went to make me question my abilities. I currently have one year of lead developer experience with no previous work experience. I tried to look for junior position and they think they couldn't pay me as I expected before I even tell them, and senior position just don't like how I got no professional trainings and I don't use chinese terms because I was "self-taught"
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ECS is the future paradigm for games, allows the usage of full cpu resources
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rn games paralelize horribly
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> they might think me as a wildcard with too much asterisks and risk to brought in.
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unity gameobjects are very light containers for components. I don't quite care what this random on hn says. It's nothing close to the OOP approach in Unreal e.g.
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Still
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Gameobjects are not part of ecs
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can't imagine every game working with ECS tbh
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I can
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Also unity just call their old system the GameObject stack I believe
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> GO vs ECS
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> which is a bit stupid
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just try to use bevy
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Their ecs is some magick
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can't learn rust to save my life
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Life cant be saved
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also no one will hire a guy with niche engine experiences
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I even tried to look for godot positions
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats such a bad mentality
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> none in beijing
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Then stop gamedev and learn web dev with bloat js
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Learning is for urself
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> a few in shanghai but all of them are looking for stripping godot out of godot
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't mind learning
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> be a hacker (in the real sense)
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but I really want money at this stage
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not part of what unity calls an ECS. What they are in reality is very close to what you might call an entity in a proper ECS system. But I'll just stop arguing because this is just a very pedantic argument at this point
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Gamedev is not the way inho
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They just abuse u
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> From what i heard
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If i want money
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You*
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Become indie dev. Live on instant noodles
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I was going to and this random guy found me to make ddnet rip-off. and now i feel ripped off
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> if you can find a job working on gamedev tools you can usually avoid the bad part of gavedev
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But yeah, i would never motivate my learnings based on possible income, best way to become a boring drone
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw the guy is pretty nice but the company is dying obviously
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He took you out to hotpot
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Be respectful to bossman
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If you enjoy programming
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Honestly you just have to market urself
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I enjoy programming off work when i'm paid
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And find another job
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I know it sucks
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk how to do it well myself
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek: honestly
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the entire game industry is kinda weird lately
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> in china
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is in China though. I can see their job market being much different to the wide array of jobs in the eu market
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i always think how stupid they are for not hiring me, and im sure they got a stupid guy with 0 open source work to prove their worth
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and just some exp
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where they did nothing relevant
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i laugh and cry internally
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek: I'm just secretly hoping our money problem goes away soon at this point tbh
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i don't need to find a job
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but fake ppl get better salaries
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, I can pass technical interview just fine
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless the technical interview guy is stupid
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> even tho they are like: bro, you got no supervisor do you
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know when u know there are way too many nuances in a question asked
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they dont know about them
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ignorance is a bliss
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> usually it's just HR person don't like me
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Today a random friend of mine asked me if I'd help a friend of his with a work project. It's literally some c# application pulling data from a db and doing some stat calculations on it. It's actually quite sad to see the level recent graduates are at
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cuz they had to make it risk free or something
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see it at my work
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I should just lie if I really need to find a job
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> for now I'm still trying to be honest
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> HR people think that if you dont know a language asked you will never learn it and skip you entirely
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sometimes dont wanna call myself a java expert
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im sure i know a fair share more than some devs they have
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What would you need to lie about?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just dont feel confident saying that
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> That I'm a junior developer with no supervisor
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I think the lead developer thing
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is holding people off
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lmao
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that'll match the 1 year work experience
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you need to say you are a junior dev or you need to say you are a lead dev?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lead dev with intern pay
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I need to say i'm a junior dev
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i was at my first job
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> While looking for junior positions ofc
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Good idea. 1 year and lead dev probably short circuits sth in hr peoples mind
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> (but I listed all the gamejam projects)
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> most of them are complete finished game
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> work experience is such a weird thing
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no one cares
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u can be rly good and have 0 real work exp
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lmao
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl simply dont know how to value you
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the tech interview guy sometime got impressed
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but it never passes the HR guy
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> be fake with the HR
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> say buzzwords
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> large companies?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In todays job market your best bet is just knowing someone honestly
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how i got my current job rn
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i skipped entirely the HR part
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I once had the interviewer cry cuz he thinks he's bad at his job for some reason...
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did 1 interview
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and done
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> which is a bizzard experience
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 😅
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if he is crying at a interview he is bad
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> smaller companies where you can talk more directly with people might make it easier to skip HR, but not sure
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> having connections in the company
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you may not skip hr but they will accept you anyway
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, but smaller companies doesn't throw their position listing everywhere so it's a bit hard to find tbh
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, true, need to be a little more lucky to find those
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even getting a friend inside to put your resume on top of the stack is very helpful
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I'm currently in a small company
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there's just  that one small problem of me not getting my salaries for five month lmao
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh god
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also how companies get lot of incompetent people too
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and nepotism
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean boss is still a nice guy, and we are helping him get fund as much as we could as well.
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough they get fucked either way. Hire boss' son, fucked. Hire HRman's friend, fucked. Hire recent graduate from prestigious university, fucked
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proper interviews are hard to do
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we just got tencent's first party content provider signed so we might have some one-off projects that could feed us some money for the long term.
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Glad i live in the eu
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🇪🇺
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but we really need a quick investor on our mobile projects cuz the original investor cut their budget and left us.
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this might be a problem in the EU too, for a company that's about to go bankrupt
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Payrolls are always the first thing to start failing
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh believe me I can sue him easily and get my pays. but we are trying to keep the project alive.
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I would sue
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And go find smth better
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A company that cant pay you is a failure
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what if the company is literally three guys
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you pay me? If not you're a failure :troll:
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Got a 30/30 from computer architecture :Celebrate:
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its good to not see companies or employeers as friends
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They are the first to lay you off
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nah, they can't lay me off
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The guy is living in communist china, he really might be in one of the few countries that has better worker protections than the EU 😄
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But he is not getting paid!!
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Congratz xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye but i'm willing to not get paid
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> otherwise i wouldn't stay here for five month
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If he and his fellow employees wanted to create an issue about it I'm pretty sure that company instantly disappears
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean this in general
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> in reality this is just a small team of 7 people
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well this is how i think
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not getting pay, i sue, bye
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :poggers:
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I still want to finish the project to get my 20% cut
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's a mobile game afterall
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I find some people in smaller companies especially do think more in a "we are a family" sort of way
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So as long as things will be better in the future, they will try their best to stick on the ship
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I was in a small company
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> With less than 8
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They paid like shit
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> did you sue them
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a nice cut
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lots of freedom tho
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But they are not ur family
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ur working to make aliving
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no contract was signed so I might get screwed
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Here if u work and havent signed
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You obviously never worked anywhere east of vienna 😄
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You are still a worker
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Under an indefinite contract
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Iirc
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its covered
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No contracts, word of mouth, work because you like boss and coworkers all very common stuff
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean the cut wasn't written on any paper.
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The law covers this
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And you still have rights
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In spain and probs eu
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but given we literally have less than 5 people working on the project, so it's probably about that much.
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes within the EU you are fine. Outside though especially in smaller companies there is this very lax vibe about stuff
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, 5 ppl 20% cuts mean the bossman gets nothing. How does that work? 😄
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Suing is not always worth it, it might cost you more than it will earn you
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i believe the new hires are paid salaries.
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> instead of cuts
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if we can get more fund we would hire a entire team for sure.
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the US it definitely will. I heard it's much more affordable in most places in EU
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> by cuts i mean after we paid off everything, employees, investors, platform fees (which is 50/50 instead of 70/30 in china btw lmao) and whatever left we might share across the lead dev designer artist and boss.
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> at least that's what I think they told me
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe i'm getting it wrong. but I don't really care if the game can go live, and survive for a year. it's probably gonna be fine regardless what percentage was the cut
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~and i'm gonna snatch everyone off this company and make my own indie game~~
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you survive with no salary btw?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I got paid enough to live off saving
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> got new phones and steam decks and stuff as well.
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can live for maybe two more months before I run dry
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your poor savings :AnyaSob:. Hopefully your gamble pays off and you get it back in the form of a cut
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't need to pay rent that helps a lot
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's not that much, but we started living off colleague guys cooking instead of deliveries once we are low on money
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that bring the food cost down like 4 times per months.
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so really it was quite ok
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cheap food, no rent, free internet.
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> more than enough for me to live
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, deliveries are expensive in china too. That's intersting
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is in beijing
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do deliveries work there btw? Do you have the gig economy there aswell?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's not that expensive
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I eat about 3k cny per month with deliveries i think
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> WTF
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u clearly too rich
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that's a fair bit. I spend half that on deliveries, but I only order food once every 3 days
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm paid with 15k cny per month with no rent to pay so it's pretty ok
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its still 1/5 of your earnings
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> how much it translates to Euro?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a pretty good wage too. Especially on no rent
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> around 2k
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> then it's decent
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and >400 for food
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but no rent tho
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i pay around 200 € for food xD
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> If i'm renting i would probably cook
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i mostly buy organic xd
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats already the "more expensive" variantion
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is beijing after all
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yeah, getting advantage on having no rent, food, etc while getting 2k is massive
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing you eat a lot at home though
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats already the "more expensive" variation
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> in my hometown i can live of 1k per month
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yeah, getting advantage on having no rent, food, etc payment while getting 2k is massive
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> in my hometown i can live off 1k per month
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes i am cooking myself, thats cheap sure
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spend about 200 on groceries, another 200 on deliveries. Though I honestly dont ever hold back on my food spending
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I pay around 400€ for food, including cat food / dog food
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd cut from everything else to keep eating like this
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> currently with a guy voluntarily cooking, it's like 700 per month. poor cooking guy doesn't ask for labor costs tho
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rip xD
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ik
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I can't help it, it's a lot
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good i dont have pets
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> one might be ok, but I have 4!
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> 4
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they make work, and costs money xD
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet u could just eat the pets food
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its cheaper
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and still good quality xD
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is your city maybe cheaper than the avg? 200 is pretty great, none of the many friends I have around europe achieved such efficiency
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> if you want to puke every day, go for it
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> how holds back on food
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Except that one guy living in czechia. That place is so cheap it's insane
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as said its even organic food
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> who holds back on food
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with "normal" food i can easily go to 100€
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and no thats normal in germany
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> LIDL, Aldi
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> exists everywhere in germany
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i dont eat meat
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so, it's inflation based, now on the east europe, hungary too has insane amounts of inflation
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Living in a world superpower that cares about its citizens sounds so nice
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh right our groceries are delivered too
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no one wants to go outside
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So you made things automated, not bad idea if you pay for a fair amount
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and somebody's home at all times
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Same, gotta enjoy that food after soulless hours of working
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have many friends that'd eat cardboard to save up for a night out drinking
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 our boss can't even drink a can of beer
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> a nice cold beer would make our days better
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't get the pub culture
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If you have friends it can be fun
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and in beijing every covid outbreak starts with pub it seems.
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> or any public place
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh so that's why i don't get it
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'd love the pub culture. Sit at a bar, drink some cold beer, shoot the shit with some miserable bastards like myself
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I gotta try this
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess we just have different friends xD
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we just cook ourself ;D
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Never went to a bar alone
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> no, don't give him ideas
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kek:
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at least if we at someones place
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: also there aren't many pubs in china as well i believe
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There are shitloads in barcelona
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do it every once in a blue moon. You usually just end up drinking alone, but it's more fun with friends tbf
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You walk 5 meters
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Bam
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Home tradition to drink with family along with dinner right? or something like that
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw what's the difference between pub and club
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need friends that are abject failures in life like myself though. My usual friends are not good pub partners, they talk about all their accomplishments and shit
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye we just drink at home if we get the chance
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess at a pub ppl are sitting
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pub, calmer music, sometimes food, people sitting, mostly beer being drunk
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> pub is more of a closed place to drink, eat and meet
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok then we have zero pubs. they are all clubs.
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bar, less calm music, harder drinks, people on foot
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I once went to a club where they serve 6 shots for 6€, i overspend that night
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> people drinks in street food restaurants
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i guess  that's out pub
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Club, insane music that will break your brain, very hard drinks, only drunk people
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but it is usually outside
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> nuts
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i guess  that's our pub
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:danceFrog:962471550152495154>
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, that emoji is a club
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 once u are also drunk its fun too
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but it's more about chinese barbecuing than drinking
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And can meet some peeps
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I saw some french
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i guess.. we really don't have pubs
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> people just don't drink without constantly eating stuff
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Not like it's a problem tho
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Here its the other way around
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but many people prefer drinking with company, rather than alone
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I ever make my way to china I want to try so many street establishments. I saw some very cool places on youtube
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Welcome to #finances
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :poggers: where room
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> dude you don't even need youtube
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Welcome
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At clubs? I can't even hear myself thinking at clubs. So not my thing honestly
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can just bring you anywhere normal and you would probably lose your mind of it
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pubs, bars ok. Clubs just no
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> break every rule Chine states publicly :trollagent:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Germany is known to be super cheap for groceries, with discounters being so popular and driving prices down.
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> please call me when you do come tho.
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I come from an opressive country. I know how to behave
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :trollge:
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> not for long
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is possible, I am a weeb for food
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i would probably make you eat fried cricket tho
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We should make a china meeting
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tourists are not allowed to enter China since Covid started
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh rip
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: it'll open up eventually
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i hope
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Come to barceona then
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Barcelona*
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Teeworlds community travels to CHINA! YOU WOULDN'T GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> 1m views.
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That I might not be able to do unless we go drinking first.  Bugs and me, we dont get along too well
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no worries I don't eat them as well
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Also, when teecon
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can order one and watch other people eat them lol
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds nice. Groceries in italy aren't that cheap. We have lidl and stuff but you need to always go a long way before getting to a discounter
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I hope so too, but with the current Zero Covid strategy it's impossible
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I ate frog heart before, so no problem
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> right
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Frog heart. I tried legs, didnt know their hearts were even being eaten
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> How much costs the cheapest can beer in ur country? Iirc here its 55 cents
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> tastes like liver, but kind of dry
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually i never thought what would happen if the strategy keeps going in china
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 75 cents if I buy local beer bulk
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like wouldn't every foreigner becomes a threat eventually?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> We shall look up for what is, you know legal for travelers
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can = 330ml?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think in ger u get 0.5 for 50 cents if u lukcy
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can = 330ml?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think in ger u get 0.5 for 50 cents if u lucky
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or even 1l for 0.5 sometimes
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the cheap ones?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for *50cents
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I know a 1L for 80 cents
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> you can buy a single can for 50 cents?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually if I go all the way out to tesco I can get cans for 55 cents
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> If it's cheap, in some grocery stores, yeah you can... but don't recommend it
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it's so far. I'll gladly pay an extra 20~ cents just so I dont have to go the distance 😄
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also northern countries tax alcohol way higher
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 4 cny at supermarket, probably 5 at restaurants
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I would pay 2+ Euroes for a quality beer ffs
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> if it's beer, make it good
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never drank bear xD
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wait that size of a can are you talking about
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I never drank a bear
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> .5 l
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A beer yes
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> beer
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you ever had Snow? Heard its the most sold beer on earth
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> R u rly german
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I haven't drank a bear as well
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kekw:
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks is a russian spy
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it smeels like piss
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why would somebody drink it
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we have local beer at my hometown so we just drink the local ones i believe
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> don't judge the taste by smelling it
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't enjoy beer either but it goes well with chronic depression
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> people usually drink 330ml cans in china
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> some beers have really good flavored versions, like lemon / lime is already better
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't drink beer usually
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but I works well when I don't want my boss to talk
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Flavoured beer is haram ngl
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie do u have the asian anti alcohol genetics?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> sure.
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wdym
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> asians often cant drink lot of alc
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you mean the red?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> missing enzymes
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> What, so you say beer sucks cuz the vanilla has bad taste?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm fine with alcohol
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly cant drink flavoured beer. It just tastes wrong
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> people says i'm pretty good at alcohol every time I drink. But I actively avoid getting into situations where I need to drink.
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I did threw up once tho
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Well I'm not a fan of 85% of all beers here in Germany, still found some that have that especially rich flavor to it
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Lucky you, I haven't got a black out ever in my life, regardless of how much I drank at the age of 18. I'm 21 right now
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The beer i like has 7.5% alc xD
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't get black outs as well
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe I would just threw everything up
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You just havent drank enough
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> probably
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> probably
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you enjoy high alcohol beers, baltika has some great ones. Tho idk if it's possible to find now that russia is at war
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I only got one blackout once with friends
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Tequila
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Never again tho
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Duvel is pretty great too
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:NOTED:827627404293963777>
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #alcoholism now
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I got close on a black out once, but it was home made ah "brandy" I guess? Kind of Vodka
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #developer -> #finances -> #labourlaw -> #finances -> #alcoholism
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should wrap it up before the Discord Mods catch us
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, #alcoholists
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kek:
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> what ,we are not under 18
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats some nice discussion "development"
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the time i threw up it was like two bottles of beer, 2 glass of reds and 4 shots of whites. and I carried my dad back home then projectile vomit off our bathroom floor then texted my mom that I threw up everywhere and too weak to clean it up and i'm sorry
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> we are developing our relationships guys
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> cmon
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Developing your financial senses and tastebuds are also important
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mixing alcohol is a bad idea honestly
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> developing our interests with a fellow chinese is also important
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I was told that afterwards
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> in my experience: don't do any sugary juice stuff, that'll ruin the taste. Do something like carbonated stuff, energy drinks or cola works fine
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> juices tend to make the drink go down harder
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't think he's talking about tastes
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just drink water, it has no taste
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> hm yeah
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> problem solved
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> 5head
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I was more talking about the alcohols
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not soul numbing juice
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I hate water
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> water is best
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sparkling water >>> Water
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: water is ok if you force yourself to drink it
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I actually kind of like the taste of absolut, but i hear original quality vodka from russia is rly good
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but we all know that flavored water / tea / juice will top it
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You like plain vodka? Maybe you are the russian spy amogus
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Absolut? Ye
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :hdkonsti: sus
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> An acquired taste from when i ran out of mix
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u need to drink soft water: (no sparkling)
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> volvic, saskia cheap af, vio is also ok
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just drink tap water. In germany tap water is highly controlled and has high quality 😄
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> not in old homes, don't forget it
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> are you totaku
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rUMRWaPdNM
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wat is that
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Potato vodkas have an enjoyable taste in small amounts, obviously only to be enjoyed with zakuski
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Hm yeah, she was ehm tempted
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sparkling water is absolutely mid
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> in absolute vodka, one of the worst vodkas out there
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> how is it 0:48 already
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> For us, the night's only starting
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it was like 9 last time I saw the clock
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess u mean water with H₂CO₃ ?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hate it xD
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> with w h a t
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm so sleepy today for whatever reason. I think the architecture teacher scared the energy out of me in that exam
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hi Ravie
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> a real water connoisseur can tell subtle differences in the water's molecular structure and tell if it's good water or not
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, another drinker among us
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, i can too 😄
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> :banhammer:
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i really dislike some water flavors
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hello
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why would you add gas to water?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What u on about
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's so fucking pointless
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its also not really healthy
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> russian vodka is best in quality
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> no denying on that
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd suggest to drink to drinks with H₂CO₃
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> our bottled water out of our water dispenser is just plain bitterness
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm picky with my water too. But non gaseous water is only for quenching thirst. It'a absolutely mid for pairing with food
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Take some sugar
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but that absolute vodka made me have a headache for 3 days, unlike any other alcohol
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, i've never heard this, i don't think it has much impact as it's just co2 that is eliminated through burps
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u burp out stomage gases
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lot of gas can affect stomach
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds like anti sparkling water propaganda
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ulcers? Idk
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> H₂O₂ master race for thirst and breathing altogether
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it generally affects ur stomache
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I'm that guy who only drinks sodas
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: does carbonated drinks affect that stomache problem?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that is really unhealthy though
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i know
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: does carbonated drink affect that stomache problem?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can't stop tho
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope you dont drink peroxide
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, DOWN WITH SPARKLING DRINKS
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hi all
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: 💦
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> not the sparklink drinks
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sometime i sub it out for MONSTER ENERGY (not sponsored)
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if i was, i would not be here to tell you about it 😄
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> tea flavor monster let's gooo
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> *tee
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Chairn drinks O³
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is actually a nutjob faction that drink very dilute peroxide thinking it purifies their guts
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I think the most healthy liquid I regularly drinks are bottled lemonade teas
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where do you think all those kill tiles lead to?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> otherwise it would just be sodas and energy drinks
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> uh, you cannot drink a gas?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :nooooo: gas killed tees
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I stopped drinking energy drinks tho, cuz I was having heart problems I think
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or just panic attacks, i can't tell
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/PG5_structure.png
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what i drink
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> meth
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what was very cool in japan? They serve some cold or hot tea for free at almost every restaurant. Had a very nice cold barley tea at one. Very good alternative to water
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well if you are already on drinking coffee or energy drinks, the opposite can affect you, not drinking them would lead to heart pain
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "PG5 molecule is the largest stable synthetic molecule ever made"
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in France, you got free tap water and bread at the restaurant
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> addiction at it's finest when's about drinking coffee or energy drinks
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't drink coffee, and i don't chug energy drinks constantly.
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> quality
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If they served sparkling water it'd be the greatest thing ever
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok our cat are becoming active, i need to leave before it eats me alive
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh, just get teeworlds addicted so hard that you forget about anything else
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also works for diets
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> we have that in germany too, go to a toilet station, you have free tap water and instead of bread, you drink
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since when are u even german
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> true, seems like 10 years of teeworlds addiction works well
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thought u hungarian
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> people keep saying that you shouldn't raise cat in a work environment and they are right
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the cat is so bored it started to attack people
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I fuckin am, but I moved to germany 3 or so years ago
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> epic gamer moment
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> best cat ever
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway. It's time for making of food
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nice chat
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you need cat when you got rat invasion 😄
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> finally, about food

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but I would've had the opportunity to do so
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> blood cakes / blood tofus are really good if you know how to prepare them
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and stomachs just works like other proteins, you can make them however you like
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @TsFreddie are you a vampire?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> hm, looks ok
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> looked up on internet how it's served, it's nice

19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> love em
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh but here, instead of preparing one special meal, you throw everything into a dish, then make a brand out of it.
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that's what you call Kebab
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> are you tatar :troll:

19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and haram means life xd
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> not in hungary
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> tatar chicken heart?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chicken feet > chicken heart

19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I love chicken heart more probably
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> god i wish you can come to china so I can change your mind lol
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> We grew up eating all kinds of meats, chicken leg is one of them
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I think other than eyes, brains, tongues, tails, I can eat everything from a pig 😅
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I would prefer only eat the strong parts of the pig
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pig tongue, never tried it. Cows tongue yes, pig no
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> then the rest can be either sausage or something else
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> separately from chicken body it seems :justatest:
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i don't like intestines
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yes.
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can eat them. don't love em
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> haram
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> many people love pig brains tho
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i tried it once
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> My best, when it comes to meat, I would say leg of a lamb
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it was not pleasant for me
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh yeah
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> well done lamb leg
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Yeah, any good restaurant can make it super good
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm done with exams of this session. I have an entire year full of non stop studying ahead of me. Do you think I should try to sneak in a small vacation before I start grinding?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> exactly
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Ofc, we should do a meeting together
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we have lamb entrails soup which is pretty good.
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> meeteeng
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh goodie, now I'm hungry for soup
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just diced intestines, livers and stomachs in a broth
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been thinking Czechia for a while. Maybe a weekend in Prague
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeeeeee beer week
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh, it's close to where I am
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> "close"
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkish cuisine excels at this. We have many soups based on the internal organs of lamb and cow.
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :poggers:
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> fellow organ eaters
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah organs are a big thing in turkland
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> man I should start preparing a list for foreigners to try just in case someone do come
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> anime.pdf firstly
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I was hungry but all this talk about organ soup and blood cake made it go away, thanks
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i wish he will be able to study in china
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me see if accomodation will cost me a fortune
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Glad to be of service
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I watched too many videos about century eggs and pig bloods and none of them knows how to properly eat them.
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I really want someone who really hated those thing to try our versions
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek: I might even cook for you
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> make your own youtube account for food
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://youtu.be/eHLMEH8oMzg I need you to find me this. I did recreate this thing but I'm no tofu master, I can't nail it
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok first of all. no idea what that is.
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i can see where it might happen
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Good start
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but I don't think you would go wrong with things this simple tho
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Maybe you nailed it and you just don't know
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 😅
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, the problem is I dont have access to the proper coagulant for the silken tofu
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> let me google what skilen tofu is
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nigari gets you a more crumbly tofu
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> do  you mean this
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019294847758237727/unknown.png
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I hate this kind of tofu btw
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't know why, but my mom say my grandma always have them in her pocket and feed me whenever she likes.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm silken tofu usually looks more "glossy" but honestly what do I know from all the way in europe 😄
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's supposed to have a "silky" texture
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you might get by with just japanese tofus
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> chinese raw tofu are crumbly
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In italy you only get tofu in tetrapak
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very sad tofu
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> tbh i have no idea what's the difference between tofu, tofuhua and tofunao these days
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What sort do you enjoy? The block kind with not much moisture?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't enjoy tofu, but I can eat japanese tofu without gaging
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good morning
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how was the sleep
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Waiting for water to boil
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might aswell chat about tofu
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I always thought tofu are crumbly, tofuhua are silky and tofunao is just a dish, then some places have those terms switched up so it's really weird
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> But if you are looking for chillied tofu, you would get this type at home
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> usually only restaurants use the silky kind
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also chili sauces are vastly different from place to place as well. 😅
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> heck, it's different from people to people
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the sort of texture I'm looking for. Which doesnt really happen with magnesium chloride. I require the calcium sulfate
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019297089588572310/Screenshot_20220913-192048_YouTube.jpg
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> says the man who says he ain't a tofu master
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't even know how tofus are made lol
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we just buy them
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, there is a bit of an art to making a good chili sauce
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm a food weeb. Is my job
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :kek:
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw if you are to come to china, which cuisine would you start with
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cuz you really need to travel all of china to get all eight of them
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sichuan probably, I have a thing for spicy food
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> figured
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> most people are more familiar with sichuan and cantonese i think
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lu cuisine also looks very interesting, if I manage to make my way all the way up north 😄
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's ours
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lu just means home cooking to us tbh
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also lu is just too huge of a category than sichuan as well. sichuan cuisine is very well established. but lu is just anywhere north
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had some fujian food in new york. That was also a very intersting flavour profile. Apparently a lot of immigrant chinese from fuzhou in america
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> even my hometown's food is different from beijing's, and it's like two hours of driving
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> And I hate the traditional beijing breakfast :kek:
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think new generations of locals hate them too
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have no idea what people eat for breakfast over there. Congee? 😄
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> at my home it's usually noodles or tufonao
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm honestly always disappointed with other countries breakfasts after turkey. It always feels wrong to me
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's very local flavored tho, we eat north korean cold noodles in hot broth which nobody outside of my town do.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> tufonao is pretty much universal tho
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> these lol
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019300201967669308/unknown.png
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> minus the rice and add chilly then it's basically the thing you asked for
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We've hogged the #developer channel long enough. Let's talk about food in #off-topic instead
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> OMG
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my dream
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019303398933270628/unknown.png
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nais
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mine is already at the custom
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> still need to wait to them to pass and tax it tho.
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> still need to wait for them to pass and tax it tho.
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china kek
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how long it will take
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for mine
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> probably a week
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mine was shipped aug 27th
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to tinker with it
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arch linux pog
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> + ddnet
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Put windows on it
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> run ddnet
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the driver was really bad I've heard
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blasphemy
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Does someone know how to fix this annoying error? (Followed every step from the "README.md" and compiled it on win11)

22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is discord awfully slow rn?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is githubawfully slow rn?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github^*
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looks normal to me
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to learn guidra
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> disasembling ff14
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why did they use java instead of c++ gtk?
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> java sux
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> watcha doing? sounds interesting
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 there is a modding scene in final fantasy
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and sometimes you need to reverse engineer to understand
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, do you have the 64 bit version of wireshark?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and find "signal codes"
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for events or smth
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know shit so im trying to learn
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/development#q-how-do-i-get-started-with-reverse-engineering-the-game-so-that-i-can-do-things-dalamud-doesnt-expose
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> literally all i know about final fantasy mods are the mods that uhhh, dont involve clothes :monkalaugh:
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so you know
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> classic teenage move
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> one of my friends if a ff14 addict...
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> one of my friends if an ff14 addict...
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> one of my friends is an ff14 addict...
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds pretty cool 🙂
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> write a blog post about that 😛
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll read it ^^
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope i learn this
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reverse engineering is a useful skill
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but looks like its rly time consuming
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> once you know how to mod can you make your character have a pet tee in the game
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> once you know how to mod ff can you make your character have a pet tee in the game
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh boi
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do more than that
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> hm?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, it's always harder to guess out of the blue
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i remember doing this to cheat some saves in pokemon and heroes of might and magic 😄
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Yes I do
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I also reinstalled it a couple of times, rebooted my pc and tried to recompile everything
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I'm actually not entirely sure if I've tested it on windows before
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you send me the built dll via DM?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Yes I can tomorrow if that's okay for you
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure 🙂 I'm interested in getting it to run on your computer
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll see if I can find a VM where I can run it myself
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wine maybe?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess if I don't try capturing, wireshark might actually work in wine
