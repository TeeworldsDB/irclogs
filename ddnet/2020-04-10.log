06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <»Slayer.> is it possible to add /urndmap command for unfinished random  map vote?
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why do you need it with /, why not just use the vote?
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Avoiding the mouse 🙂
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Also for binds maybe
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can bind votes too, but maybe we need to have a unified name for the random map vote across all server types then
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> I want command /so (/showothets) and /st (/specteam) .
11:35 < corneum> one the map joyride the mapinfo says the worst time is 225 minutes but it actually is 170 minutes.  didnt check any other maps.
11:39 <@heinrich5991> hm https://ddnet.tw/players/Starkiller/ 504 gateway timeout
11:40 <@deen> I guess I'll have to redesign the way the players site works, you keep complaining that it times out
11:41 <@heinrich5991> do I always hit the time when it refreshes?
11:41 <@heinrich5991> (it works now)
11:41 <@deen> it refreshes for longer and longer since the db keeeps growing
11:41 <@deen> but yes
11:42 <@deen> 5-10 minutes after the update-everything script runs the players page hangs
11:42 <@deen> in the beginning it was just a few seconds so not even a timeout
11:42 <@deen> not sure yet how to fix this
11:42 <@deen> too much data to just load it into memory twice, might want to put the data in mariadb instead and then update that
11:43 <@heinrich5991> ah, it's not on-disk so far
11:43 <@deen> yep, and loading the whole huge data structure into memory to swap out the old one takes too long
11:43 <@deen> because it kept growing and we're out of main memory anyway
11:44 <@deen> corneum: thanks, let me take a look
11:48 <@deen> corneum: ok, solved the mystery
11:48 <@deen> the worst time counts the actual worst time someone finished on the map
11:48 <@deen> but top5 shows the person's best time
11:48 <@deen> in this case laxa has a time of 225 min, but also a time of 2 min
11:49 <@deen> I would argue the info shown is correct, even if it's confusing
11:55 <@deen> heinrich5991: i'll give it a try to put the data on-disk soon
11:55 <@deen> will have to experiment, I think a small sqlite db with sqlitedict from python would be enough
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <»Slayer.> ye i mean a command to bind for a unfinished map vote, sometimes we have to vote 20times if we find a map that no one has xD
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a command that accepts more names as parameters would probably be nice
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or something like /unfinished team
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <»Slayer.> oh yea, sounds good
16:23 <+corneum> @deen ah yes that makes sense. didnt think about that
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @»Slayer. Let the one with the most map finishes in ur team vote
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <»Slayer.> @NeXus thats what we do, but when we play with 4 people it needs 20 votes xD
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕹𝖚𝖇|𝕄𝕣𝕏𝕒𝕟𝕕𝕣𝕦777> i need help whit the DDNet client please
19:14 < ChillerDragun> what exactly?
20:04 < NeXus> test
20:05 <+NeXus> lol
20:05 <@deen> NeXus: test worked
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Can you use quakenet via bash?
20:11 <@deen> What do you mean by bash?
20:11 <@deen> irc is so simple that you can just use telnet to connect to a server and talk to it
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> terminal
20:11 <@deen> yes, my irc client is in terminal
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah ok
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weechat
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @»Slayer. we now support this: `callvote option "Random Map"`. Works on all DDNet servers, enjoy
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in f1, but you can also bind it
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2132
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can we fix the issue where you tab to ddnet from a video you crash the client?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its fucked me over so many times
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis if no one else has that it's hard to find out what's wrong
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well i think some other people mentioned they had the same problem
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it's on windows, when you tab to fullscreened ddnet from a tab with a video open (pause or play) ddnet just crashes, the screen turns this solid color (brownish for me) with a bunch of glitchy lines kinda, and takes long to tab out and lags the computer
22:31 <@Learath2> they announced a quarantine for the weekend, so everyone went out to buy food, right this second, hundreds of people crammed into markets...
22:31 <@deen> sounds like a good way to spread a virus
22:32 <@Learath2> it's like people don't even listen
22:33 <@deen> what kind of quarantine, you can't leave the city?
22:35 <@Learath2> can't leave home for the weekend
22:37 <@Learath2> like at all, unless it's an emergency or you are in a small subset of the population that are working essential infrastructure, drinking water distribution, healthcare workers
22:37 <@Learath2> oh or working at the parliament
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 should we maybe add `-Wno-nullability-completeness` like Go?
22:40 <@deen> Is it just to prevent easter family gatherings or is the situation getting worse?
22:41 <@deen> Learath2: i think I tried that already and it didn't fix all of the issues, but you can try again
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 go ahead if you want. please open an issue to revert it once it's no longer necessary
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: well we don't celebrate easter in turkey, the situation is just getting worse
22:41 <@deen> oh, you're in turkey now, I thought in italy
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I had no more exams left in the winter session so I thought I'd visit family. A week after they cancelled all flights to/from italy
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, situation in italy kinda exploded
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italy is stabilizing now, the new cases are no longer proportional to total cases
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkey is still very much at the beginning of the curve AND we have a population that is very lax
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "they announced a quarantine for the weekend"
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sounds like u are actually rly delayed
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only weekend sounds weird
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they can't afford to have a quarantine on workdays, if they do that they need to pay everyone atleast minimum wage by law
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> turns out if you spend all the tax collected on building palaces and buying your son yachts, you don't have any at hand for a real emergency (or any infrastructure work at all)
