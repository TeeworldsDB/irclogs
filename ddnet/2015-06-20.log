00:18 <@deen> Learath2: want a fun crash with http map downlaoding?
00:18 <@deen> http://pastebin.com/vJFetMkK
00:19 <@deen> on Debian 64bit
00:30 < Learath2> added to my todo list on tomorrow deen
00:30 < Learath2> if i sleep at 3 am once more ill need some medical attention
00:30 <@heinrich5991> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2273870/Steve%20Jobs%20RIP%20Hacker%20News.pdf
00:31 < Learath2> also deen is it even reproducible ?
00:32 <@deen> yes, happens to him all the time
00:32 <@deen> but not on my systems
00:32 <@deen> it's on Debian Sid
00:33 <@deen> heinrich5991: i looked at the same 5 min ago
00:33 < Learath2> does it ever work or is it always ?
00:33 <@deen> Learath2: always crashes
00:34 <@deen> i guess it's because of some library version, no idea
00:34 <@deen> it worked with an old client version, so he's trying to bisect now
00:34 < Learath2> we didnt change anything in the map downloader code tho did we ?
00:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: it seems a bit strange to me how he's worshipped
00:35 <@deen> Learath2: i think it isn't our fault, but we'll see
00:35 < Learath2> ill check it tomorrow and see if I can learn what a stack smash is 
00:36 < Learath2> [15-06-19 19:08:53][fetcher]: Task failed. libcurl error: name lookup timed out
00:36 < Learath2> it shouldnt crash after that line tho
00:36 <@deen> stack smash should just mean stack overflow caught by gcc inserted stuff
00:36 <@deen> Learath2: medical attention?
00:37 <@deen> ah, now i understand, i think^^
00:37 < Learath2> will prolly die from lack of sleep :D
00:37 < Learath2> good nite :)
00:37 <@deen> good night
00:42 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you have a windows machine?
00:42 <@heinrich5991> or a mac?
00:43 <@deen> linux
00:52 <@heinrich5991> deen: (I didn't ask for your main machine, but rather if you also have a win/mac box)
00:55 <@deen> i only have 1 machine
00:55 <@deen> never had more
01:20 <@deen> "Enable timeouts and low speed limits fot HTTP downloads" is the causing commit
01:32 <@deen> which is weird, why does that system not like timeout limits?
01:33 < Savander> Debian "It's a trap!"
01:33 < Savander> "they want to kill us!"
02:07 <@deen> Hmmm, scary
02:07 <@deen> A few files on my laptop's ssd just disappeared and I have no idea why
02:08 <@deen> all I did was run fstrim
02:09 <@deen> Samsung SD 840 PRO, sounds exactly like this issue: https://blog.algolia.com/when-solid-state-drives-are-not-that-solid/
02:11 <@deen> Well, at least it's being fixed in the kernel: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/10/642
03:18 <@deen> Livestream on ddnet.tw
03:18 <@deen> in German
03:18 <@deen> at 3 am
03:19 <@deen> playing the hardest map we have
03:19 <@deen> with 360 min gametime
03:38 < eeeee> oh noes
03:38  * eeeee also has that drive
03:45 <@deen> better not run any trim until kernel update =/
03:46 <@deen> funnily i lost my binary to suspend laptop to sleep, so it was sitting here running for a few hours until i noticed
10:53 < Nimda> Troj by El Futuro just released on Novice at 2015-06-20 10:50
11:43 <@deen> and now rereleased on Oldschool because that cleary wasn't Novice^^
11:50 <@deen> Good morning, BeaR__ =)
11:50 < BeaR__> hey (:
14:12  * Alirezakaj slaps eeeee around a bit with a large fishbot
14:13 <@EastByte> no slapping
14:14 <@deen> Alirezakaj: yeah, no violence please!
14:15 < Savander> lol
14:17 < BeaR__> heh
15:01 < Learath2> deen: even if it times out why would it stack smash ?
15:02 <@heinrich5991> one option would be because it uncovers a different bug
15:02 <@deen> Learath2: i don't know
15:03 <@deen> but i can guess that it might actually time out for him, he always has ping 300 to GER
15:06 < Learath2> timeouts and drops back to gameserver on windows
15:06 <@deen> huh, always times out?
15:07 < Learath2> no i set the timeouts really low to test
15:08 <@deen> ok
15:08 <@deen> so works fine, same for me on gentoo and archlinux
15:09 <@deen> afk
15:46 <@EastByte> deen: does this look like a proper way to define net messages? https://gist.github.com/east/97ec9bb59a2a829bb9e3
15:47 <@heinrich5991> that looks very nice :)
15:47 <@heinrich5991> I assume it's nim?
15:47 <@EastByte> yep
15:47 <@EastByte> netmsg will be a macro executed at compiletime
16:05 < laxa> Are you making teeworlds in nim oO ?
16:09 < Savander> xD
16:09 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/nimtw - "Parts of Teeworlds implemented in nim"
16:10 <@EastByte> basically I want to implement teeworlds networking
16:40 < ochristi> deen: some weird unicode thingy is breaking the list here: http://ddnet.tw/ranks/ (last finishes at 1600)
17:41 <@deen> EastByte: yep, that's about what i would do. but maybe instead of Int(-2..3) you could just use the builting range[-2..3]: http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-subrange-types
17:42 <@deen> and team shouldn't be an int, but instead an enum
17:42 <@deen> Actually not sure why you use Bool instead of bool and Str instead of string either
17:44 <@deen> ochristi: remember what characters that were?
17:44 < ochristi> might be some arabic thing
17:44 < ochristi> LTR probs
17:45 <@deen> ok, i'll look what I see
17:45 < ochristi> "keks" written in shitty letters
17:45 <@deen> oh yeah, ltr, sigh
17:45 <@deen> rtl rather
17:45 < ochristi> 16:00: Troj by ʞﻉkﮐ(24:38)
17:46 <@deen> indeed, there's an rtl in there
17:46 < ochristi> right rtl doh
17:46 <@deen> seems not to hurt in other parts of the website
17:48 <@deen> ochristi: did it look like this? See 17:18 in Last Finishes: http://ddnet.tw/ranks/index2.html
17:48 < ochristi> yep
17:49 < ochristi> I still have the page cached so I could paste the html
17:49 < ochristi> but that's it
17:49 <@deen> nah, it's ok
17:49 <@deen> Maybe I forgot to escape it
17:49 <@deen> I just can't type quickly right now, was walking for a few hours in the rain^^
17:50 <@EastByte> deen: so you think I should use inbuild types instead of these custom type descriptors?
17:50 <@deen> EastByte: yes
17:50 <@deen> i think the builtin types are expressive enough
17:50 <@deen> and then you can build your netmsg into an object containing those
17:51 <@deen> and from the netmsg macro you can also define encode and decode procs for these objects into/from bytestrings
17:51 <@EastByte> okay right, but I still need parameters like SANITIZE_CC
17:51 <@EastByte> how would you pass the,?
17:51 <@EastByte> them*
17:52 <@deen> not sure, something simple that's syntactically valid, like your int(sanitizeCC)
17:52 <@deen> or alternatively you could have a type SanitizedInt = distict int, but i'm not sure if that's a good idea
17:53 <@EastByte> well I prefer int(...)
17:53 <@EastByte> but it would only be the case for string actually
17:53 <@EastByte> for ranges there is range[...]
17:54 <@deen> if it's only for string it might make sense to have a SanitizedString actually
17:54 <@deen> just a new type so you know what you're dealing with
17:54 <@deen> then you can also define other procs to only accept SanitizedStrings and get some type safety
17:54 <@EastByte> ah right :)
18:17  * EastByte is wondering why we have the -2..3 team range in ddnet
18:17 <@EastByte> 5 teams?
18:18 <@EastByte> 6*
18:49 <@EastByte> deen: I probably will end up writing a datasrc -> nim exporter in python
18:50 <@deen> some special values encoded i guess
18:58 < Nimda> Caldera 2 by »Rogue. just released on Brutal at 2015-06-20 18:53
20:09 < Savander> linux irc client, which?
20:23 <@EastByte> deen: https://gist.github.com/east/2a510a14d06a99bb4228
20:24 <@EastByte> converting all uppercase to PascalCase isn't that easy
20:25 <@EastByte> I quickly wrote an algorythm which is able to identify words created by humans^^
21:25 < Savander> hi
21:25 < Savander> .
21:36 < Savander> :)
21:41 <@EastByte> hi
21:47 < Savander> EastByte, how to minimalize teeworlds on linux?
21:47 < Savander> from fullscreen?
21:48 < Savander> it's possible?
21:53 <@EastByte> no idea
21:53 <@EastByte> I think you shouldn't use fullscreen
21:53 < Savander> in borderless 
21:53 <@EastByte> put it on another workspace
21:53 < Savander> but game in borderless just have lags?
21:54 < Savander> screen have freezes
21:54 <@EastByte> I never saw a difference between fullscreen and windowed
21:54 < Savander> i see
21:54 < Savander> very big difference
21:54 < Savander> screen shaking
21:54 < Savander> vs
21:54 < Savander> no shaking
21:54 < Savander> hmm, weird :/
21:54 < Savander> but i found a command
21:54 < Savander> "minimalize"
21:54 < Savander> in teeworlds
21:55 < Savander> works similar to this from windows
21:55 < Savander> but back is much longer
21:55 < Savander> :p
22:48 <@deen> strange, i guess compositing causes the screen shaking without fullscreen
22:49 <@deen> and I've always used irssi as irc client
22:49 <@deen> no idea if others are better
22:49 < Savander> im using xchat now
22:49 <@deen> ok
22:49 < Savander> same as windows
22:49 < Savander> ;0
22:49 < Savander> :)
22:50 < Savander> i'll use bind "bind f12 minimize"
22:50 < Savander> work perfectly :p.
22:50 < Savander> works*
23:02 < Savander> [Linking]/usr/bin/ld: cannot open output file /root/programming/Nim/nimble/nimble: It's directory
23:03 < Savander> after nim c -r src/nimble install
23:04 < Savander> you had problem too?
23:16 <@deen> no
23:17 <@deen> so there is already a directory called "nimble" while it wants to create a file with the same name
23:17 <@deen> you could check what's in the directory and maybe delete it
23:17 < Savander> okay i'll try
23:19 < Savander> still same
23:19 < Savander> i deleted whole directory, then cloned again it.
23:19 < Savander> meh
23:20 <@deen> works for me, weird
23:20 <@deen> can you compile simple Hello World?
23:21 < Savander> wait
23:21 < Savander> yes
23:22 < Savander> without complications
23:24 <@deen> and your full instructions are this? https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#unix
23:24 < Savander> generally this
23:24 < Savander> https://github.com/def-/howistart/blob/master/nim/1/index.md
23:24 < Savander> but it's the same
23:24 <@deen> ehm, why did you put nimble inside the Nim directory
23:24 <@deen> maybe try another directory
23:26 < Savander> woah, its weird
23:26 < Savander> work
23:26 < Savander> but still, NIm is just a directiory
23:26 <@deen> maybe it's a special directory
23:26 < Savander> for nim things, but in another works
23:27 < Savander> Now compiled, thanks deen :)
