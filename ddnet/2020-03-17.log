12:43 <@Learath2> @fokkonaut ?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 are you giving #2087 a go?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 ?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you apparently deleted the messages, they stay in irc
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because it was my error
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, I hadn't noticed the fact that you deleted it before I sent that "?"
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 how does save_dry work?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it says you have to be in a team but im in a team
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i guess because i used super
14:15 <@deen> super puts you in team 64
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to recreate the situation you want, then save_dry
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you have to be out of super when you do save tho
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> after unsuper it still doesnt work
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I think when you use super, it resets your time to the time of the server
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> So that might be why saves doesn't work
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> That has happened to me in my server
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nah then the error message would be you havent started yet or something
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> True
14:50 <@deen> weird, unsuper should put you back in your old team
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll try debug it later
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes
