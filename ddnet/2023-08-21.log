00:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm interested in reviewing. cool stuff btw 🙂 which zip file library do you use?
00:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like you need to follow the steps mentioned in the screenshot
00:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> where's python used for game modding? I'm interested
00:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (also sounds like a nice bug bounty :p )
00:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> I literally took my folder full of images and folders and converted it into a zip file with winrar (i dont know how to do that with 7zip yet)
00:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> Zwelf: can you ban Dev7z btw? they're evading moderation on discord @zwelf2
00:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> @heinrich5991 do i send zip file here or in your dms?
00:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> let's say DM
01:37 < bridge_> <sedonya> The problem was a bit different, already fixed, thanks
01:37 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> The tags are still there https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/KRVClientV0.1, and now in virtually all my repos for no reason. 😕
01:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> well, your repos sounds like your own doing ^^
02:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> removed the tags from the main ddnet repo
02:28 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I mean I have some local fork repositories (client repo, server repo, "another" repo) and all have ddnet origin to sync. Makes no sense to remove the tags locally if they'd be fetched on the next pull.

02:29 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> 
02:29 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Thank you for clearing the stuff.
04:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> bumping #6727 again. awaiting guidance/wisdom
04:24 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6727
06:47 < bridge_> <totar> how does ddnet handle rcon logins? does each mod get their own login or is it one login for all users of the same permission level?
06:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> p sure it’s unique to the mod
06:58 < bridge_> <totar> can you set multiple logins during the server config?
08:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Civ5 and Mount&Blade come to mind
08:19 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes
09:49 < bridge_> <teero777> this would be beautiful. every time i go to the assets menu or accidently click it i have to wait like 5 seconds for 100 assets to load. pretty annoying if you ask me
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in gores mostly nameless tee or variants of that name xd
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if you oldschool player you might know him..
10:37 < bridge_> <teero777> the original nameless tee :O
10:37 < bridge_> <teero777> the original nameless tee? :O
10:37 < bridge_> <teero777> the original nameless tee? :o

14:38 < bridge_> <teero777> i would just use skins that come with the ddnet download. if someone doesnt have them or has only vanilla skins enabled then ig they should download them. i would just put the requirements in the motd.

14:39 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> The banks are struggling while

14:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> And then you (me) hear: "hey, I've played for many years, I like vanilla skins and hate to see all those cringe, why the mod now asking me to change my preferences (which affects all servers, not only this one)?" At least six players from the mod humble playersbase has checked "vanilla skins only" — I've already tried to use the skins if ddnet version detected, and got a bug report immediately.
14:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> And then you (me) hear: "hey, I've played for many years, I like vanilla skins and hate to see all those cringe customs, why the mod now asking me to change my preferences (which affects all servers, not only this one)?" At least six players from the mod humble playersbase has checked "vanilla skins only" — I've already tried to use the skins if ddnet version detected, and got a bug report immediately.
14:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you could also make it a serverside option to fall back to vanilla skins
14:55 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I need the client to use the proposed skins instead of falling back to vanilla. Also, having serverside skins support would be 100x better. I already have a few more special skins used by a custom client; the mod would have much better UX if we could use our own skins for classes.
14:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what I meant was "use the custom skins" unless the user opts out with a chat command
15:13 < bridge_> <teero777> any tune zone enjoyers here?
15:15 < bridge_> <teero777> i want to speed up / slow down the game from the serverside but i want it to be compatible with the client prediction. is there any way for this to work?
15:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think someone did this in some map
15:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> perhaps #mapping is the better resource for this? ^^
15:17 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm okay valid argument. i guess with the update for the 0.7 skin system in 0.6 could help.
15:17 < bridge_> <teero777> chillerdragon:
16:00 < bridge_> <Zwelf> chillerdragon\: I'm trying out a new matrix bridge for all ddnet text rooms. It's currently only experimental. You can find all the bridged channels in the matrix space description of [#ddnet\:ddnet.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ddnet:ddnet.org) that you are already in. For whatever reason the channels aren't listed as recommended yet.

17:02 < bridge_> <gyro3630> Thx
17:11 < bridge_> <peace5905> can i add it to a trashmap server?
17:24 < bridge_> <bencie.> Yo guys, anyone good at building pcs here? I switched both my ram sticks for new ones (also removed gpu for easier access), and now none of my ports work on boot, meaning my monitor doesn't work either so I can't even see if it boots into bios. I've tried replugging both my GPU and ram sticks, and removing cmos battery, but nothing worked. Would be grateful for some advice cuz I've been trying for a while now :D
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> replugged old ram sticks?
17:25 < bridge_> <bencie.> no, I switched the new ones places
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what's important: motherboard must be compatible to RAM
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes they get by an mb update
17:27 < bridge_> <peace5905> hey, can someone tell me if i add this to a trashmap server
17:27 < bridge_> <peace5905> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP
17:27 < bridge_> <peace5905> if i can't, can someone tell me how to host a server locally 24/7 and how to add the mod to it
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also make sure the motherboard manual says that you should use exactly these slots
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u only have 2 sticks it's often not slots u expect
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no u cant add it to trashmap
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to host it 24/7 locally, you have to run your PC 24/7
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that simple
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the link u posted is already the mod btw
17:29 < bridge_> <bencie.> I have 2 slots
17:29 < bridge_> <bencie.> Old motherboard
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess u dont get any beep sound or have another indicator?
17:29 < bridge_> <bencie.> Nope
17:29 < bridge_> <peace5905> ikr, but how to add it to a server
17:29 < bridge_> <peace5905> but how to host a public server
17:29 < bridge_> <bencie.> It sounds and looks like it boots, but none of the ports work
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i'd try the old ram, and try to see if u have a motherboard update
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i guess it fails to set a working memory profile then
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> like the memory speed, latency etc.
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> buy a VPS
17:30 < bridge_> <peace5905> what is vps
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a virtual private server
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a server that is hosted by some company
17:31 < bridge_> <peace5905> how much does it cost
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if you are < 18.. you probably can't do it tho
17:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> depends.. a weak one for ~16-32 players probably costs around 3-4€ / month
17:32 < bridge_> <peace5905> can't i host a public server for free?
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nothing is free in this world 😉
17:33 < bridge_> <peace5905> i mean without i need to give any money
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes, nothing is for free
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u either pay with your personal data, or money, or time or whatever
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and i only know VPS that take money
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno what you need the server for, but i guess chillerdragon already hosts that mod
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe just play on his server
17:35 < bridge_> <bencie.> I just put old ram sticks back and ports still don't  work 😬 for the record this only started when I first put the new ram in
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> have u waited 3 boot cycles?
17:35 < bridge_> <peace5905> but i want my own server
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i told you everything u need to know
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what you do with your new knowledge is up to u
17:36 < bridge_> <peace5905> so i can't host a server without vps?
17:36 < bridge_> <bencie.> it doesn't bootloop, do I need to  restart?
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> usually not
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are u 100% sure the power cables are in correctly
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did everything to a *click*
17:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i've often seen ppl doing it with too few force
17:37 < bridge_> <bencie.> I'm pretty sure, ive replugged it a few times to click but I'll try again to make sure lol
17:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think there's oracle cloud which gives out servers for free
17:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> might need a credit card though, not sure
17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> have you grounded yourself before touching any components?
17:39 < bridge_> <bencie.> Yes
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can run your PC 24/7.. But that will cost more in the end probably xD
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you could try with only one RAM stick
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe one is now brocken
17:40 < bridge_> <peace5905> what i mean, i can't host a public server without money?
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well u can, but 24/7 is the hard part
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and it depends on your ISP
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and you need your router password
17:40 < bridge_> <peace5905> then how pls
17:41 < bridge_> <peace5905> i will not do 24 7, i will open it 10:00 - 21:00
17:41 < bridge_> <peace5905> i think
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/LAN_Server#Setting_Up_Your_LAN_Server_for_Online_Play
17:41 < bridge_> <peace5905> but lan is solo
17:41 < bridge_> <peace5905> right?
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "Setting_Up_Your_LAN_Server_for_Online_Play"
17:42 < bridge_> <peace5905> sorry i didn't even read
17:42 < bridge_> <peace5905> can i add https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP to a lan server?
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well if u have the compiled version of it yes
17:43 < bridge_> <peace5905> what is compile version
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/releases
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is a version from 2019
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> windows_DDNetPP.exe
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess u put it into a ddnet 9 directory
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i guess a current version should also work
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or maybe just download the source
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and copy the data directory
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> probably better
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (Source code (zip) from same URL)
17:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i have no idea what libs u need
17:46 < bridge_> <peace5905> what is port forward
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Search the Internet, basically: open a door to your computer for the Public
17:50 < bridge_> <peace5905> i don't find
17:51 < bridge_> <peace5905> but am i really obligated to do that to host a public server?
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
17:51 < bridge_> <peace5905> isn't that dangerous
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
17:51 < bridge_> <peace5905> ??
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What do you expect
17:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You allow the Internet to connect to your computer
17:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ofc it's dangerous
17:53 < bridge_> <peace5905> like they can do what they want?
17:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No
17:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But if the game has a verlnarable bug. They can maybe abuse that
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> A vps is probably the better choice
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> There u can also use linux
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Which makes everything a bit easier
17:54 < bridge_> <peace5905> i don't have a linux
17:54 < bridge_> <peace5905> i'm on windows
17:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yep
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @bencie. If it still not working maybe it's not even ur ram
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U could let it boot and see in router if ur pc got booted
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Into os
17:58 < bridge_> <bencie.> I use a wireless wifi adapter for now so I don't think that would work D:
17:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If it's your gpu for example why not
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or did u also reset windows itself
17:59 < bridge_> <bencie.> No
18:00 < bridge_> <bencie.> Cause the ports don't work, the wireless adapter can't connect to my router cuz it has no power?
18:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
18:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i thought u meant the graphics adapter with ports xd
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are your fans working?
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is your GPU turning on?
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> any indication that the motherboard itself hasn't died?
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> when does your MB turn on your USB ports normally?
18:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do you have a reset button on your MB?
18:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to reset its profile
18:05 < bridge_> <bencie.> During boot, shortly after power on as normal
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but not it doesnt?
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so it doesn't even boot at all?
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also what do you mean with boot?
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> like the motherboard screen?
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or the OS boot
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but now it doesnt?
18:06 < bridge_> <bencie.> Before os starts, during a load screen
18:06 < bridge_> <learath2> I had a very annoying ram issue, turned out to be bad contact due to a piece of sth in the ram port. Make sure it'a properly seated
18:06 < bridge_> <learath2> it's*
18:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> have u tried removing all USB stuff
18:07 < bridge_> <murpi> Did you wait after removing the cmos battery? Which board do you have?
18:07 < bridge_> <bencie.> I waited about 4-5 mins, I have a H310M PRO-VD
18:08 < bridge_> <learath2> Why do you think it boots but the ports don't work? What indication do you get that suggests it is doing anything at all?
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'd really re-re-re-recheck if all power cables are in properly
18:10 < bridge_> <bencie.> Well It looks to be running the same as normal with the power light, but I guess other than that nothing
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also since it's an intel.. try without your GPU
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and with the iGPU
18:11 < bridge_> <learath2> A case speaker is usually the only tool you have when debugging something like this unless your motherboard has a boot status display. So do you have a beeper?
18:11 < bridge_> <bencie.> SMTH that's kinda concerning to me is that I hear crackling noises when I move my power cable, if it's stationary then no noise
18:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> uff
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> crackling and eletricity sounds scary xd
18:12 < bridge_> <bencie.> I don't believe I do
18:13 < bridge_> <learath2> Well then that's the only other recommendation I have. Find one, plug it in, listen for the beep code
18:13 < bridge_> <murpi> Your board has a Debug LED
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oh true
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 4 x EZ Debug LED
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> EZ
18:14 < bridge_> <learath2> That's also very useful, look at your manual for the codes
18:14 < bridge_> <murpi> and a CMOS Jumper
18:14 < bridge_> <murpi> I'd try the CMOS Jumper
18:15 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd look at the leds first 😄
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'd look at the cables first xd
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (bcs it worked before)
18:16 < bridge_> <murpi> If you turned on the XMP profile in your BIOS, that might be why you're not seeing an image
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but he tried with his old RAM
18:16 < bridge_> <murpi> (Happens to me all the time) xd
18:16 < bridge_> <bencie.> Looks like DRAM is not detected
18:16 < bridge_> <bencie.> 2nd LED lighting up
18:17 < bridge_> <bencie.> Looks like DRAM is not detected or failed
18:17 < bridge_> <bencie.> Or actually wait
18:17 < bridge_> <bencie.> Might be VGA lemme look at orientation
18:17 < bridge_> <murpi> just do a bios reset using the jumper
18:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Triple check that the ram port is clean, even tiny stuff will affect connections at the very high frequencies these things operate at
18:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Try a different set of ports
18:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Try a single stick
18:18 < bridge_> <learath2> If it's VGA remove gpu try again
18:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> #ddtech
18:19 < bridge_> <bencie.> I don't have a jumper cap tho 😬
18:19 < bridge_> <murpi> Just get a screwdriver
18:19 < bridge_> <learath2> Just use a key
18:20 < bridge_> <murpi> or a paperclip
18:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a spoon
18:20 < bridge_> <bencie.> Place it in there? Or on? Xd
18:20 < bridge_> <learath2> Not a finger, too many resistencw
18:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> connect the 2 dots
18:20 < bridge_> <learath2> Conmect the two pins(?) together
18:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pins
18:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/saussi%C3%A7on-explode-boom-gif-16089684
18:21 < bridge_> <bencie.> Tried this, gonna check to see if it's clear and then cmos jumper
18:22 < bridge_> <learath2> There are two morons speeding next to my bus on a motorcycle carrying their helmets in their hands
18:22 < bridge_> <learath2> On a highway
18:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> r u in italy?
18:25 < bridge_> <learath2> Nah, I'm in Turkey
18:28 < bridge_> <bencie.> Did both, I still get the DRAM diagnostic LED, idk I feel like I'm putting them in correctly but I can only manage to get 1 clicks each when putting it in
18:29 < bridge_> <murpi> 📸
18:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> press harder
18:29 < bridge_> <bencie.> Did both, I still get the DRAM diagnostic LED, idk I feel like I'm putting them in correctly but I can only manage to get 1 click each when putting it in
18:30 < bridge_> <learath2> If latches on both sides are fully moved up, it's in
18:31 < bridge_> <learath2> Though if it's your first time building a pc, some motherboards can take much more force to put in a stick than the beginner expects
18:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he doesnt even build anything xd
18:31 < bridge_> <louis> ur computer is bricked buy another one
18:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he overcomplicates swapping RAM xD
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the spirit:
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> buy new insane gamer hardware
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> RTX 5090
18:32 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no
18:32 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> too expensive
18:32 < bridge_> <learath2> I run all my games on an A100
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sell your house
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u need THE gamer PC
18:33 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> 100 fps is enough buddy
18:33 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> on teeworlds
18:33 < bridge_> <murpi> After seeing path tracing, a 5090 would be quite nice
18:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 100 fps is enough to do novice maps
18:33 < bridge_> <murpi> 4090*
18:34 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i have that one 10 year old pc that runs teeworlds at like 20 fps
18:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and you are no insane player
18:34 < bridge_> <bencie.> I've  built a giga old pc up as a school project (we actually got graded on building a PC in school) but other than that I haven't built shit
18:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see correlations
18:34 < bridge_> <bencie.> Also, I got the clicks now xD
18:34 < bridge_> <bencie.> I defo didn't clip them in before
18:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Hopefully that's it. Most people are waaaay too gentle with ram to seat it properly
18:35 < bridge_> <bencie.> Yeah I needed to press double as hard
18:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/el-luchito-con-la-ram-gif-15851431
18:37 < bridge_> <bencie.> Oooo
18:37 < bridge_> <bencie.> Ports work :D
18:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
18:37 < bridge_> <bencie.> Damn that was so dumb of me haha
18:38 < bridge_> <bencie.> Thank you so much for the help and patience xD
18:39 < bridge_> <murpi> That's wrong wtf
18:39 < bridge_> <murpi> The correct way would be to smack the board onto the ram sticks
18:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also the GLUE is missing
18:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so it stays there
18:48 < bridge_> <learath2> I usually solder small wires from each contact on the board to each contact on the ram stick, but to each their own
18:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Now that I think about it that won't work. The frequency is so high that there will be timing issues 😄
19:26 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> hey <@749222324980416602>

19:41 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 watf is a 0.7 skin system in 0.6? My ddnet 0.7 progressed pretty far and it will enable ddnet client users to use 0.7 and the 0.7 skin system
19:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> finally i can see all channels at once
19:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for perfect instant first class support
19:41 < bridge_> <teero777> wait what
19:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> blazingly firefox
19:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> oke hydrogen is epic
19:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> wait yes
19:42 < ChillerDragon> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20344300/258588866-2f2419ae-b8c8-49fd-a8c2-afbce2fe7bd8.mp4

19:43 < bridge_> <teero777> ah so youre making a 0.7 ddnet client? or what?
19:43 < ChillerDragon> im currently adding 0.7 support and propose to integrate it in official ddnet client
19:43 < ChillerDragon> feedback is very positive everyone is hyped
19:44 < bridge_> <teero777> yes thats exactly what i ment. so @kaffeine0 can use the new compatability with new skins to do what he needs to.
19:44 < ChillerDragon> given his mod is using the superior protocol 0.7
19:44 < bridge_> <teero777> xD
19:44 < bridge_> <teero777> well ig thats his issue xd
19:45 < bridge_> <teero777> new version of ddnet will then support it right?
19:45 < ChillerDragon> you mean the next release?
19:45 < ChillerDragon> dont think so
19:45 < bridge_> <teero777> not next rls
19:45 < ChillerDragon> but soon(tm) hopefully
19:45 < bridge_> <teero777> somewhen in the future
19:45 < bridge_> <teero777> yea
19:45 < ChillerDragon> i gotta sacrafice some sheep for the merge gods
19:45 < bridge_> <teero777> only 526 years to go 🥴
19:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> @deen Version 17.2.1 commit is still missing on master
19:47 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> > the superior protocol 0.7
19:47 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> > .
19:47 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> > the superior protocol 0.7
19:47 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Not really superior.
19:48 < ChillerDragon> change my mind
19:48 < bridge_> <teero777> .-.
19:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> having both is bloat xd
19:48 < ChillerDragon> agreed
19:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no matter which is better
19:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> > so @Kaffeine can use the new compatability with new skins to do what he needs to.
19:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I want to check if a client have a skin, and use it in that case. I can't rely on DDNet version because a client can have "vanilla skins only" option turned on.
19:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> How 0.7 skins help here?
19:50 < ChillerDragon> whats your proposal for that?
19:50 < bridge_> <teero777> bro how are you gonna check that without a new client version?
19:50 < ChillerDragon> imo skins should have some checksum
19:50 < bridge_> <teero777> you need a new version anyways
19:50 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> We had that discussion and there is no reason to waste time on it.
19:50 < ChillerDragon> the 0,7 discussion?
19:51 < bridge_> <teero777> never took part in it. whats it about?
19:51 < ChillerDragon> yea i was memeing but also ready to nerd out on some useless debate for funs and giggles
19:52 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7055 is the easiest solution. Of course the idea to support server side skins would open many more possibilities, and it is close to server side assets, which would open a new world.
19:53 < ChillerDragon> serverside assets would be epic
19:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think its the cleanest solution too
19:53 < ChillerDragon> but also ugly
19:53 < bridge_> <teero777> haha soon well have nsfw ddnet servers xddd
19:53 < ChillerDragon> i already hate that mapres are a thing sometimes
19:53 < ChillerDragon> looking at the amount of non teeish designs out there
19:53 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 already possible with mapres. Seen it already :D
19:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean maps already support custom images
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i guess it wouldnt matter too much
19:56 < bridge_> <teero777> i think its not a bad idea
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just need to be sure libpng is secure
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but it's widely used
19:56 < ChillerDragon> so is log4j
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no software is secure
19:57 < ChillerDragon> but some software is more java than other
19:57 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/colbygk/log4r
19:58 < ChillerDragon> true gangsters use log4r
19:58 < ChillerDragon> blazingly ruby and did not cause a global outage
19:58 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I tried to draft some ideas/keypoints/requirements for that in some "DDNet New Season Ideas" chat but the chat was deleted when the "lets do the accounts right now" plan was canceled.
19:59 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> So what exactly do you mean saying that "serverside assets are ugly"?
19:59 < ChillerDragon> @kaffeine0 you are just after skins right? Or would you propse something that allows the nodes mod to be playable by ddnet clients?
19:59 < ChillerDragon> you mean me?
20:00 < ChillerDragon> i just disagree with the artwork of everyone who is not landil
20:00 < ChillerDragon> 90% of the gores and ddnet maps that got released make me want to uninstall the game
20:00 < ChillerDragon> because of custom mapres
20:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd chillerdragon logic again
20:01 < ChillerDragon> im a visual person
20:01 < ChillerDragon> looks is everything
20:01 < ChillerDragon> call me shallow
20:01 < bridge_> <gerdoe> visual person uses irc to chat
20:01 < ChillerDragon> yes
20:02 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> As I've said at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7042#issuecomment-1684090351, I think that a big task would never be done, so we need to split it into smaller doable tasks. I have no time to drive it but I can take some smaller tasks to contribute to the big goal.
20:02 < ChillerDragon> I still think we should repurpose the antibot api
20:02 < ChillerDragon> to be able to load multiple antibot modules and use this as a modding api for server plugins
20:03 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> > you are just after skins right?
20:03 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> "Skins" was the easiest task here. I'd find use for many more features but we need to start somewhere.
20:03 < ChillerDragon> there is basically a 99% finished ddnet server modding system in the codebase
20:04 < ChillerDragon> i would sell my last liver to get a coin texture in the game
20:04 < ChillerDragon> there something deeply satisfying about collecting gold coin
20:04 < ChillerDragon> for city mods and so on
20:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> skins can give you basically all stuff xD
20:04 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> It is not convenient for devs. It is almost like "anything is moddable if you have assembler and disassembler".
20:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just spawn tees with that skin
20:05 < ChillerDragon> i never tried the antibot interface but doesnt look bad
20:05 < ChillerDragon> its not like patching the binary xd
20:05 < bridge_> <gerdoe> ask noby xd
20:05 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I already need more than 64 characters for my mod, so "just spawn tees" won't work.
20:05 < ChillerDragon> buy more slots
20:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then we also need gameskin support
20:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just spawn projectiles
20:06 < bridge_> <teero777> if were already doing skins then might aswell do entity skins
20:06 < bridge_> <teero777> if we're already doing skins then might aswell do entity skins
20:06 < ChillerDragon> jopsti do you know if anyeone ever abused tee skins for non tee things in mods? Such as projectiles, or collectables?
20:06 < bridge_> <gerdoe> no why it could work if you a) have no physics for placeholder tees b) have more powerful physics algos on board
20:06 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> It is not like real API for modding.
20:06 < ChillerDragon> what makes it unreal imo is just the branding
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes, noby used them as cursor
20:07 < ChillerDragon> rename it from antibot to plugin and add a readme and a sample. Voila it true modding api
20:07 < ChillerDragon> ah tru i think i saw that
20:07 < bridge_> <teero777> api would be limiting right?
20:07 < ChillerDragon> but its more a debug thing for admins its not user facing polished
20:07 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 yea but i guess most modding apis are limited
20:07 < bridge_> <gerdoe> its not even dev facing polished actually kekw
20:07 < ChillerDragon> axaxa
20:07 < bridge_> <gerdoe> there are only hooks for antibot and nothing more
20:08 < bridge_> <gerdoe> like how tf would i change behaviour of votes
20:08 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i cant do this thru antibot api
20:08 < ChillerDragon> that would have to be added
20:08 < bridge_> <gerdoe> it means theres no actual modding api for now
20:08 < ChillerDragon> yea but its super close
20:09 < ChillerDragon> with a little tweak and extension and marketing it could be
20:09 < ChillerDragon> if there is antibot and some other modding api that sounds like duplication to me
20:09 < ChillerDragon> almost like having two network protocols who do the same thing
20:09 < ChillerDragon> ... wait wat
20:09 < bridge_> <teero777> bloat
20:10 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Sure but also API would simplify the task. Like: if I want to change some behavior I can inherit from a class and override a method. The less code I'd have to copy the better.
20:10 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i think all the logic should be put off the current cpp code
20:10 < bridge_> <gerdoe> to some script language like lua js or whatever
20:11 < bridge_> <teero777> making even more oop is not good.
20:11 < bridge_> <teero777> why have the base code in a gamemode that has nothing to do with it?
20:12 < bridge_> <teero777> instead of just editing the function??
20:12 < bridge_> <gerdoe> huh imagine compiling ton of a cpp code to just make 1 line work
20:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to me the least appealing thing about our code is, that server and client use different code for the physics
20:13 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Yes. Hm, maybe you like solving merge conflicts or you don't want to update the codebase, then you can just edit a function of course.
20:13 < ChillerDragon> @kaffeine0 woah cool didnt know meskulin built a lua moddable server 
20:13 < bridge_> <gerdoe> xd
20:13 < ChillerDragon> 2017
20:13 < ChillerDragon> thats older than me watf
20:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ^ has someone ever benchmarked it?
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i really wonder how fast such overhead is
20:14 < ChillerDragon> wat
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i found it rather big even with just wasm
20:14 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> LUA overhead is very limited, you'd not notice it.
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> adding API support for non cpp languages
20:14 < bridge_> <teero777> to edit the 1 line of code i have to then: make a new file > make a new class that inherits > copy the whole base function and edit the 1 line of code
20:14 < bridge_> <teero777> to edit the 1 line of code i have to then: make a new file > make a new class that inherits > copy the whole base function and edit the 1 line of code?
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i only trust numbers xd
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'd bet its the exact opposite
20:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 2 functions and 50% fps gone
20:15 < bridge_> <gerdoe> its not my solution lol
20:15 < bridge_> <gerdoe> .
20:15 < bridge_> <teero777> k
20:15 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/lua-srv/blob/master/gametypes/dennis/dennis.lua
20:15 < ChillerDragon> dennis.lua xd
20:16 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> It won't be used in games then. E.g. STALKER https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16 uses LUA for game logic. They won't use it if it hit performance that much.
20:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean most games run at max 60fps
20:17 < bridge_> <teero777> tw physics run at 50 tps right?
20:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:17 < bridge_> <teero777> i did some experiments on my setup a full 256 player server lags hard
20:17 < bridge_> <teero777> idk how lua would affect performance
20:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess u a maintainer?how much lua do you use, how exactly is memory shared. what's your FPS with it
20:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'm interested
20:18 < bridge_> <teero777> im no maintainer.
20:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> Factorio has a LUA API as well
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that defs runs like shit xD
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @kaffeine0 i meant u here 😄
20:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> Really? How many mods do you use?
20:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well tbh i havent touched it in years xD
20:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but when i say shit, i mean if your FPS drop 50% bcs of script support
20:21 < bridge_> <totar> I thought lua is quite fast
20:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> FPS aren't really relevant in Factorio though as long as it's smooth enough
20:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it also depends if the scripting support is unsafe, e.g. if it is allowed to call host functions /system calls etc.
20:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> As long as your base can run at 60 UPS
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep but in ddnet i'd say they are highly important
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> delete that from your head xD
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> LUA is like python one of the slowest languages
20:22 < bridge_> <totar> really?
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/lua.html
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> best source for hating languages
20:23 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I didn't touch LUA code, I've only heard from other devs and modders that they are happy with LuaJIT. I contributed 100 commits toward Linux support and switched to a different project.
20:23 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1692642242.png
20:23 < ChillerDragon> holy shit i made it work
20:23 < ChillerDragon> fakin dinosaur from 2017
20:23 < bridge_> <teero777> haha
20:23 < bridge_> <robyt3> Things that would be slow in Lua should be provided as C++ functions, so I don't think Lua being relatively slow is a huge issue
20:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> anyway
20:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why LUA when there is WASM?
20:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i still dont get it
20:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is a reason browsers tend to favor WASM in near future
20:25 < bridge_> <totar> this is without LuaJIT I think
20:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and it's not bcs javascript is so fast xD
20:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> even if its faster, it will probs not even beat JS
20:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and JS is already slow
20:25 < bridge_> <totar> LuaJIT is not 60x slower
20:25 < bridge_> <totar> JS slow compared to what?
20:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> native cpp/rust
20:26 < bridge_> <totar> lol
20:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean why lol
20:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if we add server side lua API, we could aswell add server side .dll support
20:26 < bridge_> <totar> not a fair comparison
20:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ofc it's fair
20:27 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> There are bugs in config, e.g. here: https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/lua-srv/blob/master/src/engine/server/luabinding.h#L46 you need to replace `CFGFLAG_CLIENT` with `CFGFLAG_SERVER`. I want to use LUA for my server but it is WIP yet so I can't say how feasible it is.
20:28 < bridge_> <totar> yes drag racing a plane in my car is a very fair comparison
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well ok
20:28 < bridge_> <gerdoe> its kinda uh
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u think it's unfair. then answer me one simple question:
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> will your lua interpreter be memory safe?
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or generally sandboxed
20:29 < bridge_> <totar> you said JS vs cpp/rust now JS vs lua
20:29 < bridge_> <totar> you said JS vs cpp/rust not JS vs lua
20:29 < ChillerDragon> @kaffeine0 send fix pr
20:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i mean JS or LUA
20:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> doesnt matter
20:30 < bridge_> <teero777> meskalin is doing js rn right?
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @totar 
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> here benchmarks with luaJIT
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/lua-vs-rust
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not even faster than the interpreter always
20:31 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 ye 
20:31 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon: pinged
20:32 < ChillerDragon> pinger
20:32 < bridge_> <totar> ez

20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
20:32 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki help
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rust looses in hello world
20:32 < ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
20:32 < ChillerDragon> blazingly lua
20:33 < bridge_> <teero777> rewrite ddnet in lua
20:33 < ChillerDragon> omg
20:33 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kaffeine writes a book
20:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/click-enter-gif-19678832
20:38 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Maybe I'll do. I actually planned to keep LUA support code private (and contribute it only to DDNet upstream if it would be the case).
20:38 < bridge_> <teero777> haha now he deleted his book to answer you xd
20:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
20:42 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> 😄 I answered "no" and wrote a list of reasons why I won't but then I changed my mind to "maybe". 😄
20:43 < bridge_> <gerdoe> xd
20:44 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
20:46 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon: what are the clients of you with "term-zx-x" in their clantag for?
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rust is faster
20:52 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> For Mod API as I see it, it would be either: 1. You modify Character or Player class so yes, you have to subclass to do virtually anything anyway, or 2. That point of modifications should be controlled by the mod CGameController subclass so you have to override a method there.
20:52 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> 
20:53 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> IOW in general I think it is OK for a mod to subclass those three classes. Everything else should be minimized. I'm not saying I subclass CServer to modify a line but in a properly moddable game I won't have to touch CServer or `engine/` at all, and there should be a strong reason to modify anything else.

20:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Mostly without purpose
20:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@teero777)
20:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Others have irc bouncers I have tw bouncers
20:58 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> In my mod I delegated CPlayer construction to CGameController so the mod controller can create custom player classes. Then that CPlayer subclass constructs custom CCharacter subclass on spawn.
20:58 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> It allows me to use the upstream CCharacter and CPlayer and have virtually zero conflicts there.
21:00 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> CCharacter and CPlayer subclasses have mod-typed GameController() getters so I also have zero controller downcasts.
21:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice, i also tried this once with vanilla source code, but at some point i had to make so much stuff protected xd
21:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> Zwelf: your message (and the next two from you) come from the username "[matrix]" on discord
21:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> libpng is used by browsers. we just need to keep it up-to-date
21:58 < bridge_> <zwelf2> I was mistakenly using @admin:ddnet.org (with which I've configured the bridge) for sending these message. For some reason that user is called like the bridge bot (`[matrix]`) on discord.
22:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 btw if u want to increase fps with numbers, you could use the same entities text texture, the game layers use
22:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we support streamed 3D texture vertices
22:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we just need to move where the entities numbers are created to somewhere accessable by the editor
22:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's currently in mapimages.cpp afair
22:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> luajit is one of the fastest IIRC
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 btw if u want to increase fps with numbers, you could use the same entities text texture, the in-game layers use
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> *ingame ofc
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so many lua fans around here 😬
22:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so many factario fans here 😬
22:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see a relation between that
22:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> does factorio even use luajit?
22:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, it does not
22:17 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> who is modifying maps to fix cheats btw
22:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now that drama starts again xD
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> JIT sucks anyway, since 20 years i read how awesomely awesome JIT is
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs in some synthetic benchmark it beats a compiled language
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i remember all the stackoverflow posts claiming java is faster
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> was always funny
22:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> JIT is definitely faster than interpreters
22:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> oco was vandalized $(
22:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> they "fixed" broken hammer
22:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> except this way still works
22:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143278566402961540/DDNet_Client_2023-08-21_22-19-40.mp4
22:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> LOL
22:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> its ok cyber still has the rank, right?
22:22 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> oh wait oco got trolled because of the weird switch stuff right?
22:22 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> some new ddnet update broke it or something
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well anyway, i don't see a reason why JIT Lua over a WASM runtime
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with jit lua you still have to code in Lua
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that alone sucks xD
22:23 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @murpi ur the one fixing maps?
22:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did you read the #announcements about it
22:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> discussing languages is probably putting the cart before the horse though, I think
22:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wat
22:25 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> its a teamrank cheat on a dummy map
22:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is the map new?
22:25 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no
22:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ping me when the drama starts xD
22:25 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> the map already got changed for fixes twice
22:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the new rule has 2 week grace
22:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc
22:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the more important thing is the actual architecture
22:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> i.e. how stuff is sent to the client, on what levele people can program for it
22:26 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> its a 8 year old map tho
22:26 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> fixing super old stuff to fit new rules is weird aint it
22:26 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> shame its not a 1000 year old dragon huh
22:27 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh that would be cool
22:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the most important is 100000000 FPS
22:27 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> you are never supposed to have teamranks in dummy maps anyway
22:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> architecture is important to reach <large number> fps
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep i agree, so always only support newest tech
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
22:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> mfw people complain about my high fps and yet this convo is being talked about
22:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> 120 fps sweep
22:31 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> smoking that 50 fps when you open the leaderboard pack
22:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> xd
22:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDD
22:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> T
22:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (@jupeyy_keks)
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> T
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> interesting
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> different replies depending on which matrix client i use xD
22:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> different bridges?
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> T
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that are different channels
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i c
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so that's the new fancy reply, awesome
22:38 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Why would you use some matrix when you can use discord?
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> matrix is nice, but all clients suck xD
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well matrix is pretty complicated.. that kinda sucks too
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but at least the idea is cool
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and open source
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and at least close to other chat programs
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not like irc xD
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my brother hosts a private matrix server for whole family
22:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the mobile app is close to telegram
22:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so good enough
22:40 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Obviously nothing that's open source can be bad but discord isn't bad either
22:40 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Beside hiding some channels for no reason it ok
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well discord doesn't give me much more than matrix.. but i'd say it feels more polished and stable
22:41 < bridge_> <pilonpl> They also broke dark mode recently
22:41 < bridge_> <pilonpl> But i guess it's an experimental feature
22:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> discord will likely eventually become bad
22:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just like all the other proprietrary platforms
22:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> going to matrix evades that cycle
22:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sent from my discord
22:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> discord has phone number requirements for some people, e.g.
22:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah and i'd like to have easier streaming, but in matrix that's all beta sadly
22:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> discord ofc wants discord nitro, but i find it overpriced
22:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for that price i can host 10 matrix servers lmao
22:52 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I hate facebook messenger the most
22:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It doesn't even work properly
22:54 < bridge_> <pilonpl> The video playback stops randomly
22:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @pilonpl i think this is pretty cool xd
22:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143287026930679969/image.png
22:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a matrix client with multiple channels at once
22:55 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I guess that's cool
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but also very beta 😬
22:55 < bridge_> <pilonpl> On pc
22:55 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It probably not a good idea on mobile devices
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my new phone is faster than the pc at work
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 4nm killer
23:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> i feel like u guya are doing some wip update that will make ddnet run twice as fast
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if someone manages to double the FPS on my current PC hardware, he deserves my pure love
23:07 < bridge_> <totar> 5000->10000fps
23:07 < bridge_> <totar> need that 0.02ms
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 15k fps to 30k
23:09 < bridge_> <pilonpl> So i created an account on matrix
23:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
23:11 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Right by why does it say "Encryption upgrade available" lol
23:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> imagine that
23:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> ngl i dont get the strive for Mega Privacy
23:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> Online and Privacy dont mix
23:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Tbh it's not really about privacy itself. It's about u being abused for business against your will
23:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno what that means xd
23:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Never had that
23:14 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Discord is better
23:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> This is the multi channel client btw
23:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://hydrogen.element.io/
23:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In case u want to test
23:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> There is a button for multi view
23:15 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I am on android rn
23:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It does offer some neat futures.. eg disable image preview
23:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> ig that makes sense
23:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> discord is rly shady and tries too hard to make anything monetizable
23:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> me when im a client sided nitro perk
23:16 < bridge_> <pilonpl> You still need apps with encryption to do illegal stuff
23:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
23:16 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I think it's a basic human right to discuss illegal things
23:16 < bridge_> <learath2> 😬
23:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Telegram is the new file host for illegal stuff xd
23:17 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Just because something is illegal doesn't mean it's bad
23:17 < bridge_> <pilonpl> And just because something is legal doesn't mean it's good
23:17 < bridge_> <learath2> 😬
23:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You know. Good and bad are hard to define anyway
23:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :brownbear:
23:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> like adobe products :^)
23:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah what some civilizations think is "good" would make you lose all faith in humanity
23:19 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I guess in a country like poland law is quite reasonable
23:20 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Even piracy isn't always illegal
23:25 < bridge_> <learath2> @robyt3 I think we even have `if constexpr()`, nowadays, no? You might be able to get the same perf
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> You mean for the check `strcmp(format, "%d") == 0` check? I can't get that to work.
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> `error: 'format' is not a constant expression`
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> `error: a parameter cannot be declared 'constexpr'`
23:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> Assuming I drop in a `strcmp` that's actually `constexpr`
23:39 < bridge_> <pilonpl> WTF
23:39 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Why did my pc turn on
23:40 < bridge_> <learath2> Aaaaah, I forgot that never made it into C++. Yeah no constexpr params. I guess you could use a string_view and template magic to do it if you wanna mess around with it
23:40 < bridge_> <learath2> Not sure if worth
23:51 < bridge_> <learath2> (Something like `boost::hana::string`)
23:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> he said the evil word
23:59 < bridge_> <yekrm> Is there a client in 0.7 with vulkan support?
