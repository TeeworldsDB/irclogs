09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Noe storage.cfg is for sure a way to go
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> @ChillerDragon But whay to I need to type in it xd
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Noe the path to the folder you want
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avada> hey, does anyone else has this problem, when minimize the game and open it again it often shows up like that? Sometimes i have to minimize and open dozens of times to fix it or have to change and reset resolution :/
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avada> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/626002529141915648/screenbug.png
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avada> I'm on DDNet 12.6 on Arch Linux
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've explored the possibilty of getting a wasm vm inside teeworlds, sadly all the vms seem to lack decent apis to expose host cpp functions
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Avada I dont really see the issue, could you point it out?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the grey area shouldve already been the ddnet window
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i once had this issue too, the grey area would randomly fill up some part of the screen (starting from the top), once it filled the entire screen for me
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> dunno why i dont have that issue anymore tho
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, missed that, I wonder what causes it
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we are mishandling some message from the window manager
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, but SDL should be the one dealing with those, so maybe we are mishandling some sdl event ðŸ˜›
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks like the window size changes are not communicated properly
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we dynamically change the resolution as the WM informs us about them
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Avada try gfx_resizable 0
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```void CGraphicsBackend_SDL_OpenGL::Maximize()
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> {
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>     // TODO: SDL
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> }``` doesn't look done to me ðŸ˜›
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you happen to remember why we check h > 4*w/5 on a resize?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Avada what is your resolution?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avada> 1920x1080
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avada> @deen thanks seems to work so far ðŸ™‚
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh I hoped you had some weird resolution
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll keep an eye out for it, if it happens to me I can maybe debug it
13:24 <+Ryozuki> deen you were helping nimlang dev right? congratz on 1.0 i guess :o https://nim-lang.org/blog/2019/09/23/version-100-released.html
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> From 0 to kys, how horrible does this look to you https://hastebin.com/ixorasupis.cs ?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ofcourse he did, that is why the pw was nimrocks:feelsamazingman:
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually nvm, I should probably allow pre and post hooks
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually nvm my nvm, I can do that like this
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The idea is to parse all the source for PLUGIN_HOOK and generate plugin_hooks.h
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Weird flex but ok
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/626050701780451340/image0.png
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I took a look at the stopper code and I don't really see why the behaviour changed, I think `(m_TileIndexB == TILE_STOP && m_TileFlagsB == ROTATION_180)` should have been taking care of this but somehow the speeders were still giving velocity somehow. I don't think it's worth reimplementing this abuse of entities
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I suggest we just remove the parts involving that
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avada> @deen @Learath2 hm it happens again with this grey bar bug :/
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sama> is there still the probleme with the "free" operator ?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sama> cause i have 80 ping on ger, its impossible to play and i had 30 before
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I had to make a guess, I'd say ddos
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut does simply cherry-picking the PR work?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ryozuki: I haven't been involved for a while
