02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> Hello, I just downloaded ddnet from steam and when I open it a window with some codes appears and then the game is displayed full screen and it closes instantly, I tried several times and when opening it for a frame you see how many pages I have and there are many of the game but I can't play ¬ø?
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/779761780129005568/782958737447059476/unknown.png?width=447&height=250
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all these reports seem to come from win7 users
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> is it a win7 problem then?
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> have you tried using outdated or just non steam releases?
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> maybe that could help
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> And will the online work if it is not of steam?
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i dont know but you can try
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> o.0
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> keeps happening ._ .
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> try using an old version of the ddnet client from ddnet.tw/downloads like this https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-10.6.2-win32.zip
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> better dont use such old clients
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they reset config variables and are less secure
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> or download 0.7 client
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> like fclient
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 0.7 is bad
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> 0.7 best
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best is you try the version before and if that works, its just a bug that probably will be fixable
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Nax are u on 32bit windows?
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> its not 0.7 being bad
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> its noby being bad at 0.7
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> no
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> I have 64bit
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alright
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-15.1.3-win64.zip
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you try this version?
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> ok
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> keeps happening
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, then i guess a dev with windows 7 has to debug the problem
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 did you find something useful in your last windows debug session?
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Nax random question but is your username in windows "User"?
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> ¬ø?
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u click on C: there is "Users"
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there a directory that is called "User"
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> User 
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Public
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and so on
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> XD is a meme in spa√±ish
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so its "User"?
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. press Windows key + E on your keyboard
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is 
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://uis.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/win10-fileexplorer-addrbar.png
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nax> ''pixelsaurio insensato''
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> click that and type C:\\Users
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm seems everybody busy i not get f4 but not get f3 too:cammo:
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there then a item called "User"?
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> my suggestion is even better
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> today was a bad day at aoc üò¶
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im reading the problem
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> who allowed the difficulty to spike so much from 2 to 3
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/f1bb5b5bd92b23ee091dd086e88e35b39723cd60
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why would you do it like this? we have `CLIENT_MAIN` and `CLIENT_DUMMY` already, just add another entry `NUM_CLIENTS` or so
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ someone else had a similar problem: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/2972902433493341292/
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm wondering how much the current servers would cost for a year
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll calculate it soon
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's too much, I'd suggest closing some server
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there is strong opposition to closing them
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd consider 2k‚Ç¨/a unsustainable
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> üòÑ
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd consider 2k‚Ç¨/y unsustainable
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see 4 ger servers in central europe (2 should be fine), we have two rus servers in the same location, I don't know how close brazil and argentina are in terms of ping, but I'd guess one brazil server in sao paulo would be enough, then we have korea&japan, where one would probably be enough
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I could try gathering some player statistics
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie how did you translate ddmax into chinese? ^^
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "traditional"?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think @Dan_cao did the translation
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Âè§ÂÖ∏ - classical
09:38 <+ChillerDragon>   idk if im stoopid and fished but why does digitalocean send me a mail containing this url http://mkto-ab430114.com/ ? Any idea on how i can make sure its legit
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> its not even https like woot and it redirects to hacktoberfest just fine
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that seems fishy, I wouldn't trust that email
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> me neither well i clicked already so yikes
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> i mean the sender looks fine but isnt that easy to spoof? Im sure one of u haxxors knows how to find something in the metadata https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/NH
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> pls dont hack my mail xd
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> ah fuck mktdns.com looks like a big flag
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> i can't belive i got bamboozeld
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 1577 ‚Ç¨ is the current estimation: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/108
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: Probably they use Marketo, thus the mkt* domains. I'd bet they use weird domain names for tracking? But still really annoying. PayPal does similar things where they send you to random domains that are not paypal.com but paypal-marketing-foo.com...
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> my DO mails also have this mktdns in them
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> wait deen are you saying this is an official DO mail? And they need another redirect to track me?
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's my guess, yes
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> saw nothing weird in the email header, except the mktdns, but they use that all the time
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis day3 is always a spike for aoc
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ I didn't really find anything that could cause this. It would be so useful to know where the crash happened :/
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> Imo todays aoc was easier, than day2. Today you just need to know about modulo, yesterday you needed to parse a string.
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't look at it yet
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> eh
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `line = line * 1000` > `%`
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah it looks quite simple
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would do modulo too
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Day 3 looks harder than it is
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea i was just in a rush and went for the first thing that came to my mind ^^
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, just like last years, if you sit down and think about it it wasn't actually that bad
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :giftee_red:
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When they introduce the 2d grid is when it starts looking scary :P
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add me on https://www.codewars.com/users/Ryozuki if anyone else does stuff there
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëÄ
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually might do this one in C
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Almost burned my bread looking at the challange :P
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poor bread
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784000802883764234/unknown.png

11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: mail seems to actually be from news.digitalocean.com
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're either compromised, or they really sent you this mail
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye we chose "classical" as ddmax. "traditional" is the oldschool ones
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah üôÇ
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> paypal is absolutely atrocios with their emails. looks completely like a spam email. links go to epl.paypal-communications.net
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like wtf
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> none of these translation make any sense but it is better than ppl asking constantly.
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they have their "is this email a phishing email" service
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at the start, when they changed the URLs to epl.paypal-communications.net, that service said "NO, don't click on that link, it's a phishing email"
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how should users figure out that these links are indeed correct
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie no sense is a bit strong
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fixit> i agree, had huge trouple yesterday because i wanted to try out cpp regex üòÑ today i needed like 15 minutes for both
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Abner360> Good morning
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fixit> i agree, had huge trouble yesterday because i wanted to try out cpp regex üòÑ today i needed like 15 minutes for both
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good morning
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> good morning
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Dragere modulo? Why not just create infinite lists
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in Haskell https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/3.hs
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess haskell is rly good for this stuff
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which goof decided python is above all other programming languages and shouldn't need a do-while loop?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't really fit, due to the indnetation = grouping
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, try to guess what
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for i in ‚Ä¶:
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     ‚Ä¶
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> else:
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     ‚Ä¶
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that's a decent reason
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already had this discussion üòõ
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kk
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's also defined in a very silly way btw
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it takes a really twisted person to come up with this stuff
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw, when is it okay to put solutions on github?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whenever u want i guess
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if someone looks it without finishing up to him
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the fun is solving it urself
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if someone looks it without finishing is up to him
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen do u know nasm?
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will u do it with that someday
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh should have used assembly very early on
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah it will get harder
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the first one would have been easy
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually this one would be easy too
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seen problem 2 solved in brainfuck
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh and assembly even has a way to do a do while loop üòõ
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's even the natural way to loop there
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen do one in a hardware description language
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> vhdl/verilog
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Github is trying really hard to break the dark theme all the time...
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if only they would provide their own, I wouldn't care about them breaking the 3rd party one
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to update daily
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/aoc/tree/master/2020 you can now explore my very mediocre python skills üòõ
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 r u on python 3.9?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 386
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on 3.9 u can use the list type directly
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784022359547314186/unknown.png
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üòã
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> totally not a image from my blog :pepeH:
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> updating python on linux without the consent of the package manager has never went well for me, so I'll stick to 386 for now üòõ
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i wrote that even arch wasnt on 3.9
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had to compile python myself
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now its on 3.9 tho
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Arch still isn't on 3.9
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Also works in lower Versions with .. i think `typing`
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784022777941458974/unknown.png
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> update
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @stnwtr ofc, my point is that from 3.9 u dont need typings for collections type hinting
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did they like bump it yesterday? I updated this vm like 4 days ago üòõ
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do "yay" every day
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay!
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used aur-tools when I had arch on my daily driver üòõ
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay is the best i think
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also short and has same syntax as pacman
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like how crusty and low level aur-tools is, makes me feel like I'm almost in control of the system
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorta had a layman'y feeling, very cool
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> gotta try that
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro try what if i may ask
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> aur-tools
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Using types in Python!? I would never
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh and you get to build your aur packages in a chroot, which gets you nice and clean packages
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would always
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can autocomplete
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only typing was forced on python, it would be almost an acceptable language
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not only did they add that changei n 3.9
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now u can add metadata to typings
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784023814186074112/unknown.png
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/whats-new-in-python-3.9
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You madman, that's not the Python I grew up with
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what would be cool? A fork of python that forced you to use types
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> NO!
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can have a unsigned type in python now
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with metadata typings
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Stop the blasphemy
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> \\o/
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> static typing gang rise up
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look how good typescript has been to javascript, literally gave it new life
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Don't make me start a npm rant
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro i fixed all our npm issues using --frozen tho
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Facebook as soon as they started to use javascript on a project that's very complex, the first thing they developed was Flow
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wow did you?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i told u to use --frozen
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get why you don't like npm
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it worked
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> whats that
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> something like that
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it just works is how I would describe my experience with npm
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes it so package-lock.json stays same
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wait where did you even add `--frozen`
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> we are talking about unique web, right?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know on rust you can have a build.rs on ur top level directory and it runs before u build?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784024881486495744/unknown.png
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use it tobuild my css
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 Look what's commented out here https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-web/blob/master/update.sh xD
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The old update script
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> npm ci fixed it all
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep, no problems so far
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well npm ci is --frozen üòõ
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> told ya
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Aaaahh
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but why would you want --frozen?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Idk
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But it just works
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> server runs on old debian
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you just randomly edit the package.json?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and does weird things
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the old npm
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we use a more modern npm developing
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> frozen tells npm to respect the lock file, that's all it does
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise it rewrites it and when we git pull it errors
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the issue we had
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (which is indeed a silly option, the fuck is the point of a lock file if you don't respect it?...)
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> npm update just kept breaking everything
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh you never npm update
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah sorry
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> npm install it was
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u get sick looking at the script tim sent u? u can see some systemd stuff there :monkalaugh:
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's a real beauty, gets called every minute by crontab :D
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't talk about systemd anymore, people just don't care that their system is becoming a monolithic blackbox
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro systemd has its on scheduler/timer whathever
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on arch linux u dont even need contrab
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But I like crontab
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > There are many cron implementations, but none of them are installed by default as the base system uses systemd/Timers instead.
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like all other things, people don't care if the government spies on them, people don't care if corporations spy on the
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye me too
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> people don't care about anything these days it seems, as long as it's more convenient it's all acceptable
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yes!
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> !
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> How did you get there from systemd?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't know if this was some kind of extreme systemd critique or just unrelated xD
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but i agree, it sucks, especially the phone market
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's the same idea, systemd is slightly more convenient, so people accept that a blob of millions of LoC that no one can fully understand runs as PID1
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Um, but you COULD look at it
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at what it started as, look what it is now. It's completely against the principle of "do one thing and do it well"
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happened to all the cron implementations we had, all offering different capabilities, having different strong points?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And isn't this the same as npm which pulls millions of LoC into my project from the npm servers where you have to trust a lot of different people to use any packages
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happened to poor udev? If not for the gentoo team systemd would be your only option on any distro today
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never said I like npm, I said it usually just works
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep, that's systemd for you, I agree
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides, npm doesn't replace anything
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> npm is a very simple piece of software, that even has alternatives you can understand
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I didn't realize systemd now reads your fstab on arch and "translates" it all into it's unit business until they changed something in systemd which broke my mounting ^^
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't confuse the software that is npm with the repository of packages that is npm
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I didn't realize systemd now reads your fstab on arch and "translates" it all into it's unit business until they changed something in systemd which broke my mounts ^^
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, ConsoleKit and PolKit, while they were never the nicest, what happened to those? Do you have any option to manage multiseat systems now except systemd?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Multiseat üòÑ
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's sad but I feel like support for multiseat setups will get worse and worse
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DBus is next and when Poettering gets his way, it will be moved all the way inside the kernel with an API that's so difficult to implement the only client for it will be systemd
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Thankfully there are still some sane people on the kernel mailing list that showed that this was actually insane)
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but people that care about these things are getting old, they will get bored and leave, we will be left with nothing but systemd and a linux kernel that's so deeply interconnected with it that there will be nothing else you can use
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep, seems unavoidable when you put it like that
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder when they will undertake coreutils, It's the next rational target. I mean if my intention was to take over the linux world
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Personally I don't care that deeply I got into arch and caring about the internals of my system after systemd. /etc/crontab still works and will keep working forever (even though managed by systemd ofcourse)
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> systemd-cpd, you tell the cpd over dbus what you want copied and it does it
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think /etc/crontab will be around much longer. Systemd loooves binary formats
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nahhh they can't remove that
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> init scripts still work with systemd as well
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They will first introduce the binary format and tell everyone that there is nothing to worry about, they provided a translator
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> possible, but they will keep the frontend
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For how long? It took them only a year to completely absorb udev
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I have no idea about udev
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After promising they won't absorb udev btw üòÑ
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Did they change the config format or smth?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> xD
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> udev currently can't operate without systemd
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah, they make everything dependent on systemd and keep making alternatives difficult or impossible to use alongside or as replacement while mainting the frontends system admins care about
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (it's complete integration, it links to libsystemd iirc)
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I read a 10 page document trying to figure out the options inside a unit file and how they behave precisely. The author gave up after 10 pages
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love convenience as much as the next guy, but convenience is for the user. "It just works" or "to make it work" are not good engineering decisions
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The documentation for the unit files seems mainly tailored for the user and convenience. It's relatively short and easy to find stuff. But I also got confused when I wanted to have 3 unit files to work together in a specific way the "idiomatic" way. With their `Wants` and `Depends` and `ConsistsOf` etc and in the end just gave up separated them, put restart=always on all of them so they crashed until the services connected in the right way 
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no documentation tailored for people who know what they are doing btw. The author couldn't find one, nor could I and iirc the author was told the code is the documentation if they want precise answers
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> When I want to restart them I need to restart them all separately now ^^ especially when I restart A I need to restart B so it reconnect
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep, it's missing the details
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> When I want to restart them I need to restart them all separately now ^^ especially when I restart A I need to restart B so it reconnects
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I precisely know how an openrc init file will operate and I can even reason about the ordering of init in openrc. Even without any documentation at all
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oddly enough, the inspiration for systemd actually has great documentation and I think is one of the best init daemons ever engineered. launchd
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple might have shoddy business practices but they consistently manage to have both the best and the worst of engineering in the same team. It's a very odd company üòõ
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I now remember what it was that broke my mounts back then. With systemd specific paths in /etc/fstab such as `/home` are automounted even with the `noauto` option. So because I don't want my `/home` automounted (it needs to be decrypted first) I had to remove it from /etc/fstab and specify the full path + options in the script that mounts /home for me
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Figuring out why this happened was a nightmare, first step was even figuring out that systemd had anything to do with /etc/fstab. I didn't know that
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the only way to keep your sanity in that situation is to put home in crypttab
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc there is some glue logic inside systemd that will stop the automounter before mounting any crypted partition inside crypttab
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> huh, ok xD
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> now find that documented üòÑ
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> look at me ranting away again, anyway I've made peace with it, we'll all rot in systemd hell, there is no stopping it might aswell embrace it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will even make a shrine to Poettering in my closet
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That guy pisses me off more than his silly invention, but I'm also trying to become more accepting of others, they say anger is not good for you
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> thanks @heinrich5991 for the phising feedback :) sounds good for me and kinda fucked up from their side :D
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> uhm @deen if github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts isnt the upstream what is? and why
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have our own private repos with lots of passwords and other private information in it
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like all mod accounts, bans etc
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like you could do some cleanup the public scripts repo should be the upstream and the private repos should be separat
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but sounds like annoying work that will end up with all kinds of stuff not working üòÑ
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> hire me
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> :D
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> can someone give bind for password on server?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> can someone give bind for password on server?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> im idk how trigger f1
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @triki do you want to log in with a bind?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `bind <key> rcon_auth <password>`
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `bind <key> rcon_login <username> <password>`
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @heinrich5991 i wanna bind pas for server
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @heinrich5991 i wanna bind pas for  join to the server
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `bind <key> password <password>`
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @heinrich5991  im tried but doesnt work
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @triki have you also tried it in f1?
15:53 <+ChillerDragon> yo does 1 know what the +122 means in gdb? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/KF
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think not all key binds trigger in the menus
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 122 bytes into the function, probably
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> yea either bytes or instructions thats what i thought
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> its rls so it cant be c++ lines i guess
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> any idea on how to hunt the linenum?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> build in debug mode or read the assembly
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> yea sounds obvious
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784070302329077771/unknown.png
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or build in RelWithDebInfo
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> the crash is unreproducible tho
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @triki does just executing `password nimrocks` work?
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> i do not know if i still have the binary :/
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> +122 is bytes
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> ty hackerman
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did you load it in the debugger if you don't have the binary, ChillerDragon?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> if i just try password nimrocks in f1 it is ok
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> i had the binary then it rebuild on crash
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> but with bind doesnt
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> so i have to guess the commit it run
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then maybe keypad binds don't work in the menu
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: is the debugger still open?
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> no :/
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well. out of luck then
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> that could show the assembly ez
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait for the next time the server crashes
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> yea but good to know i will try to log commit msg from now on
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without the EXACT binary the cores don't mean anything
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> but git checkout commit and rebuild is exact isnt it?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not even the commit sha is enough, you can't just build it again
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> fk
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could if you had reproducible builds
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> ok then i have to store binarys on crash
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know if ddnet builds reproducibly
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> its c++ :D
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but a lot of effort was poured into this
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it builds reproducibly on my machine
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't count on it since we didn't work on making it so
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (when I last checked)
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think at the very least it would depend on system state
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At least libantibot and libsteam should be reproducable üòÑ
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe you updated glibc inbetween e.g.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same dep&compiler versions are vital
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, saving the binary is the safest way
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> i think i might still have but idk which it is
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone know a non shit phone brand? My samsung is soooooo slow now it's insane
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> pinephone
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even got the flagship hoping to get some more time out of it but 2 years seems to be the most modern companies offer
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> puri.sm
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the thing to look out for is "how long do you get updates?"
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> either from first party or third party roms
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get updates, each of them make the phone even slower
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apple has a good track record there, unfortunately they're not general computing devices, so can't buy those
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple also loves their planned obsolescence
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 apple? üòÑ
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, my google-branded phone has had lineageos updates for quite some time
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the official ones stopped a year ago
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (nexus 5x)
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did consider an iphone for a long while, for their stellar privacy offering
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess one of the newer google phones would be a good bet
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> i had my iphone5 for like uhm 5+ years? it run fine till the end
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you're fine with 3rd-party OSs
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> `error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to ArrayList<Integer>` does anyone understand this
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> you can not convert a int to a array
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> :troll:
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are trying to set an arraylist to an int for some reason :P
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're using an integer and a list of integers interchangeably
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you want to append an integer to a list? what does that line do?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> `table.add(i).add(k) = s.next().charAt(i);` eh i did this xd
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> int arr[12] = 2; 
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this whole thing might be messed up lmao
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Also an int is a primitive in java, primitives can't be stored in arraylists)
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, and table is ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what @Learath2 says is misleading, they get autoconverted to Integer
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, in some cases, I did have a nice 40 minutes banging my head at the keyboard with that one
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> .add adds a new element to the list
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> table.add(i) tries to add an integer to the ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but its elements (the rows/columns) are also lists
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you could only add a whole list there (probably an empty one would be good for the start, so you can start adding elements)
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can probably also work directly on the input data, after maybe splitting the lines, if this is about AOC

16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i might do thaat
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i was just gonna make a nice 2d list but realized it was a lot more complicated
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not like list[a][b] or anything
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> at this point i might as well just manually count the trees from the input with my eyes :greenthing:
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can have a nice normal array in java üòõ
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ sigh, now my Intel Linux GPU driver seems to be acting up. Sometimes I get laggy graphics in DDNet even though DDNet consistently sends 60 fps. Only reboot fixes it...
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if I'd recommend working with arrays tbh
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're second-class features in java
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't have to mess around with an ArrayList if you don't want to
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen now that should be easier to debug, have you tried different opengl versions?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, doesn't help
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there are kernel warnings, so I think the i915 module is just  broken
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is renderdoc on linux so graphics debugging isn't entirely cancerous
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a broken module is also possible, linux support for graphics has always been and will probably always be in a sorry state
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> first time I've had Intel graphics bugs. Also hangs in videos sometimes
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (on Linux)
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yesterday i had my first deadly screen freeze bug
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> screen frozen when i was doing a part that required you to go under the map, rip my run
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> guess ill have to test drivers again
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> driver update should fix it on Windows
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i compile the mesa driver my own on linux and often have bugs üòÑ
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen btw the funding page, idk how you calculate it but all servers seem to be a couple $ off their donation targets
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 because I recently got the KSA servers
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, actually 1096 out of 1118, ah
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which is not working well and support ignores me, oh well
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> usually they want 100 ‚Ç¨ / month for a 1 core vps in Saudi Arabia, so I thought 15 ‚Ç¨ sounds like a steal
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Somehow one of the richest countries on earth can't do anything well üòõ
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if everyone is rich, might as well ask for a higher price
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so much systemd hate here üòÑ
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> I think systemd is far from perfect, but it's the right way to go. It's definitely better than that SysV mess we had before. Even Windows has service manager better than SysV init. Declarative unit files with unified syntax are just better than doing everything manually in shell scripts. It's even faster.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Here's one real life example: I bought new keyboard with backlight yesterday. Unfortunately, the keyboard doesn't remember its settings, so it has to be configured by some app after boot, otherwise you always get some rainbow nonsense. There's no official app for Linux of course, but someone has reverse engineered the protocol and created a simple command line app for configuring the backlight. So far so good, but there's one more thing. If
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ```ini
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> [Unit]
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Description=Restore keyboard backlight after suspend
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> After=suspend.target
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> [Service]
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Type=oneshot
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ExecStart=/usr/bin/g213-led -p /etc/g810-led/profile
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> [Install]
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> WantedBy=suspend.target
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ```
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> It's so simple and clean solution. No dirty hacks that don't survive next OS update are needed. How many service managers can do such thing? I'm not systemd fanboy because I've had a lot of troubles with it in the past, but it gets better and better. All you need is to get used to it. üòÑ
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i hope it doesn't look like paid ad from RedHat üòÑ
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uuuuuh, I really want to complaiin
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> sure
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just because there are no dirty hacks you can see, doesn't mean there are no dirty hacks there
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Comrade I also don't dislike systemd. I'd even guess most people do tbh
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and I think I can accomplish the same thing with openrc)
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> OpenRC is probably the only real systemd rival
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's only the case because gentoo is actually commited to protecting us from the inevitable blobization of linux
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might want to choose a different word there
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> blob is usually used for things that don't have source available
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All other distros took the systemd pill, there is no backing out of that. Who would bother even working on a better system when no distro will even use it?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used blob in a more literal sense, like a slime ball, inseperable
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's actually another systemd advantage - the same syntax and API available on most distros
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is lies, fed to you by the systemd propaganda machine. /bin/sh is actually ubiquitous
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> says the apple user xd
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> de facto, init scripts used to be distro-specific
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> de facto, systemd services are now less distro-specific
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ apple documents their init system very well
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast they provide documentation for their blob
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I read more discussions here about systemd than I actually use it. Add a few services once, then runs ok for years. Had no problems with OpenRC either
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> welp, installed new drivers and seems like it still freezes, and also introduced a new bug somehow
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis what is the definition of "new" in this case?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the latest?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the beta?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not teeworlds specific but i dont know how it even happened
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk i downloaded somewhere near the top of the list
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cuz the top top one had the "new bug"
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we might have to increase the driver range
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which is the screen turns black for a good 5 secons whenever i alt tab out of a fullscreen appl
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, it's all stupid propaganda. Every init system "runs fine" for all common users. Your grandma isn't stopped from using linux because of sysvinit, it's just silly talk. For the people who care about these things, systemd is objectively worse
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so im not using those anyways
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alright
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just give the driver version and releaste date of the driver @louis üòÑ
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found writing sysv init scripts more daunting than systemd service files
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there, one user that is helped by it ^^
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but writing proper /etc/init.d script is much harder than writing systemd service files
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to argue with an anectode?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I write init.d scripts in my sleep, there I win?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i've seen some "admins" putting everything to /etc/rc.local because why not üòÑ
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, should I make generalizations like Comerade just did so I can argue for 20min and not get done?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I rather provide the factual input I have
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean I wouldn't call "Exactly, it's all stupid propaganda. Every init system "runs fine" for all common users. Your grandma isn't stopped from using linux because of sysvinit, it's just silly talk. For the people who care about these things, systemd is objectively worse" objective and providing evidence
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can elaborate on any part of that statement you'd like
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i feel like a granny now, bcs it just runs fine for me xd
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want you to elaborate tbh
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah exactly
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29957/Intel-Graphics-Windows-10-DCH-Drivers?product=96551
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think its this one
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I don't want to elaborate either
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis thanks
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont even know if any of them work xd
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just want to provide a voice to the people (like me), who just use it and are fine with it
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it looks like everyone in this channel hates systemd
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> exactly
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And that's the state that everyone is in right now, no one wants to actually see it because "it works"
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's abandon all our principles, it just works
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "it works better for me than sysvinit", so I'm glad the replacement was done
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no one invested as much work to push another init system, so I didn't get to see them
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ubuntu did, but it didn't work out
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No one can, it's done, over
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Monopolies thrive in this exact way
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People complained for years about Microsoft doing EEE, now systemd and FSF are doing it right in our backyard and we are all "mhk"
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> ok i got the binary yay
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> systemd provided something of value to distros (next to the popularity), so they chose it one by one
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debian is probably the one which discussed it the most
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and as hard as it'll be on me, I'll try to stay out of this discussion now, seeing that the current split is 1 person disliking systemd and 3 people being at least okay with it
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As always, people jump in, say it works and leave. At the end I look like the bigot. Whatever, I'm done
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'll talk about this in 5-6 years and everyone will pretend they don't understand how every distro just disappeared leaving us with systemd/Linux
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> no, criticism is important
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis but its still an actual freeze?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not a crash
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the difference here is important in this case üòÑ
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The current system of governence works for me. I live fairly nicely. I still advocate for unions and worker rights. "It works" is just an awful bar for anything, not only software
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think so? same thing as before
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well i don't really want to test it takes a while to change drivers xd
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the driver you sent was a freezing one @louis ?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> actually, i think it would be better to have just a few distros, so devs could focus doing something useful instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> actually, i think it would be better to have just a few distros, so devs could focus on doing something useful instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Worry not, there won't be any left soon enough
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> hmm Learath2 u gdb pro
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> send halp
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> i got the binary but im not sure how to dissasemble
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> rip            0x5555555cf54a0x5555555cf54a <CMoney::Snap(int)+122>
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> i want to go here but CMoney::Snap is not a thing
16:42 <+ChillerDragon> dissasembly 0x5555555cf54a also doesnt work
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah for me
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, just want to be extra sure üòÑ
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: well just `disassemble` should work, you want to disassemble at %rip
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> No frame selected.
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> do i have to run first?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade choice is key in any market, monopolies are always harmful,  way too much control
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon oh I thought you already loaded a coredump
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> ah no i loaded the binary that crashed
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Learath2 yes, that's true
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i have no dump
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i just want to go to the offset and see what code it is
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon abusing gdb as a disassembler are we? üòÑ
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD discord was faster than github in creating the pr on the screen, interesting
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> seems like
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> objdump -D also has no CMoney::Snap
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well do you even have symbols?
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> no :D
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> but gdb also got this on crash
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is objdump -D supposed to contain CMoney::Snap then?
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1607010224.png
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what about `objdump -dCS` ?
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> the same way this guy got it
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> what is dCS
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> --disassemble --demangle --source
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh yep, you do need demangle for C++
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> worked yay
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> so is +122 now 122 assembly lines?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, you should be able to just do `disassemble CMoney::Snap` in gdb
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> also, `--visualize-jumps=extended-color` is really nice thing
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, so odd. I guess just disassemble with objdump
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> where do i put the visualize flag is it gdb or objdump?
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> well the question is how to find offset +122
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> objdump
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `objdump --disassemble=CMoney::Snap DDNet-Server` I guess?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the visualize jumps ^^
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> i mean i got the func that works fine
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just look at offset 122?
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1607010508.png
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> like 122 below?
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> lines
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> or what
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The numbers on the left side are not for decor üòõ
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> 1 line does not look like 1 byte
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> i thought the numbers are there to let me look like haxx0r
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0x7b4d0 + 122 is what you are looking for
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> so i need hex maps
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> maffs
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> also don't forget `-M intel` for sane assembly syntax üòÑ
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> :troll:
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> no trolling
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> i see we have strong opinions here
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> AT&C assembly syntax is just.... üòÑ
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> systemd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah att syntax is hard for humans
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> and intel xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> AT&T assembly syntax is just.... üòÑ
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> k but the jump thing as fun as it sounds i cant get it running :/
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess @heinrich5991 might disagree
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> lets start another holy war
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> let's not start a new flame war üòÑ
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for ping, ima stay out of flamewars for now
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> how to do hex maffs xd
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That wasn't a flamewar, it was an opinion on a very serious topic but if trivializing it helps you, I guess that's fine
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 122 is 0x7A
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `python -c 'print(hex(0xabc + 25))'`
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> ty
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> the 25 is decimal right=
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you read python?
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> is this a front? :D
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually reach for ghidra or radare when disassembling. While objdump is nice to just get a function out, it's really not fun to read the assembly all plaintext like that
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie would it be possible to merge the eyes 1 pixel to the center for Bub and Bob?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784085609584525322/unknown.png
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> ghidra is bloat
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> r2 is hard
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> r2 has a frontend that is for people who don't like the tui
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cutter works pretty nicely nowadays
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> oh?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know the bug comes from vanilla code, bcs the eyes are moving when spinning, but it always looks strange to see a gap üòÑ
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ghidra is a bit bloated but it has the best decompiler I've seen in a while
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> i like tui tho but it seems to be a hard tui
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Learning radare2 requires the patience of a monk
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1607010936.png
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> hm
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> i expected to see something here
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well what did you expect to see? üòÑ
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> like a call::crash()
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> :troll:
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without a core you can't check what is in rax or r13d so going to the exact line is rarely useful
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> well at least something where i could guess c++ lines from
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> i have rax
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> i have ot all
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the line below is call
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the cut off one
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that one is probably interesting
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> ah true
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> ye
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When working in plain like this I like to start at the top. This is a standard function, figure out what the arguments are
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I work my way down keeping note of what is in each register
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it's the instruction after
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1607011168.png
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> lgtm
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn't we just merge a patch about CCharacter::Team?
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> ah no its F-DDrace
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is so easy to ctrl-f
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üò¶
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> so you agree heinrich?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that the only mention of `Team()` in that function?
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> it crashed in line 115?
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> seems safe
17:04 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like pro debugger no
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it crashed either on the instruction before rip
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never seen a debugger stop on the instruction before
17:04 <+ChillerDragon> oh so the 112
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> maybe m_pOwner is null and then m_pOwner->IsPaused() failed?
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah no there is a check tho
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> m_pOwner can't be null there
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> but hm
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rdi has this, rsi has snappingclient
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> pro
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> r13d is moved into ecx afterwards
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, maybe m_pOwner is not 0, but there is no IsAlive() check
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I doubt i need it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI is the fourth parameter
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> ``rdi            0x55555590c4d0 93824996132048``
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to `CGameMask::TeamMask`
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> wait rsi is snapping client?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I guess it's something in the `m_pOwner->GetPlayer()->GetCID()` chain
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> ``rsi            0x41 65`` isnt 65 a bit high for a clientid?
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> ah no its a money so its fine i guess
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> nvm me :D
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rsi was snapping client at the very beginning of the function
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> 65 sounds fine 
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdyt about it being in the `m_pOwner->GetPlayer()->GetCID()` chain?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 I had a weird bug like this some time ago already, it said it crashed on a call to Getplayer->getcid, but there was a character check before, so the memory was there but without an IsAlive check it crashed
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> it looks rly scary
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> ye i also think i remember simialr
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I know
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait I don't
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A character can't exist without a player
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> well thats what you think :D
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, thats true
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But the pointer was still there
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pointing into garbage
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, could pause cause that or timeout maybe?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do some odd odd things sometimes
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> was a clean disconnect most likley
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or maybe m_pOwner isn't reset when the owner leaeves?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is indeed
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it reset or is it not reset?
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/023c97ec4e53a8d32790737a2a8e157ac246a759/src/game/server/entities/advanced_entity.cpp#L26
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> but thats on tick
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/023c97ec4e53a8d32790737a2a8e157ac246a759/src/game/server/entities/money.cpp#L38
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, should never be invalid i guess
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. what happens if snap is called before tick?
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> is the tick always called before 
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like a race thingy
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a normal entity
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be ike this
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like*
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, in ddnet source code it looks like there can't be disconnects between tick and snap
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but ah!
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what if the tick kills the character?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ohhhhhh
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea now that makes sense! @chillerdragon that can happen when we join a minigame
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea :D
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/023c97ec4e53a8d32790737a2a8e157ac246a759/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1163
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now how do I fix this correctly? xD
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reorder
17:17 <+ChillerDragon> remove minigames
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe remove the m_pOwner variable and replace it by a function getting it?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or don't kill the player
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ‚ú™ nah cause then it would look bad when looking to the side
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> moving eyes suck anyway
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a bit fishy to rely on Tick being called before Snap anyway
17:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a condition that can be broken easily
17:18 <+ChillerDragon> but what does the function do?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well is it really? I don't think it would make sense to tick after snap
17:18 <+ChillerDragon> how does it get the owner?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the question is basically whether disconnects/kills are allowed between ticks and snapshots
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and ticks can kill the character, so relying on it not changing sounds like a bad idea
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea okay now that also was the problem with the old m_pCarrier Bug i had that i mentioned before
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, idk what a CMoney is, so idk how it should be fixed but it seems like it belongs to the player, not a character
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> player is being Killed means character
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry for that misleading comment
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because the character is being killed when joining a minigame
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> why does it need a owner afterall?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the other question
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems the owner should be a player, not a character
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will just call GetPlayerChar(), not saving the m_pOwner
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Careful about that too btw, players need not always have characters as seen here
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but GetPlayerChar checks for IsAlive
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And funny enough characters need not always have cores, thats one amazing debugging journey
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> wat?
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> characters can be m_Core less?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon you should save cores btw, running the servers under gdb and doing a dying bt is not good at all :D
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> why
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> it just worked so good
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can inspect things postmortem with a core
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> yea
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> i just never opend a core so...
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> but i guess i will turn core safe on additionally
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's much easier than this mess :P
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't even bother running with gdb. The core has all
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just need to keep the binaries
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and do RelWithDebInfo. Makes the debugging much more pleasant
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> yea i set that now
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> thanks guys :)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, now with crisis averted, let's do editorwars
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> i use emacs btw
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> vim > emacs
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> dont do that
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> freezes ur machine
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :D
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> :D
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> i tried
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough editorwars people usually bring facts to the table
17:29 <+ChillerDragon> lol?
17:30 <+ChillerDragon> i never seen a editor war more sophisticated than fng > gores :nouis:
17:30 <+ChillerDragon> what facts?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that is my attempt at poking the systemd fanboys so I can continue my rant
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should probably get a blog
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> i see
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> you should get a block
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> :fire:
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm opinionated enough that people will just read it to be angry, might even get popular
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> just present everything as facts
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> there is someone wrong in the internet - community will be ur readers
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The trick is to disguise your subjective opinions as facts
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> yes
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> https://xkcd.com/386/ does the rest
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the OOP people, look how they convinced everyone that their subjective design decision is the right one
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Marketing is everything
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> my yt suggestions is usually full of oop rants tbh
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need catchphrases like "Encapsulation" "Safety"
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> i used that word today in my commit :D
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> guilty
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your yt suggestions are full of them because people give these rants a lot of watch time, just to get angry
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems almost primal, humans enjoy conflict
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> yt suggestions best
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> i had a "new virus from china" latley
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These machine learning algorithms are imho borderline abusive
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> was like 8 months old news suggested today
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> comments full of confused ppl
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very dangerous, you get sucked into rabbitholes, wasting hundreds of hours
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> thats the point
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the very least it's irresponsible to deploy something so predatory
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> but i also rabbit hole in irc
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> like rn
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> this conversation isnt of any more value than watching cat videos
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> no front
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They even track your daily schedule. I get the videos I watch at different times of the day
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> ye also noticed that
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> can be useful tho
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> imagine remembering ur self what u watch during times of the day
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only point of this conversation is to hopefully bait someone into commenting about systemd before my tea runs out
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> so 2006
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> idk why ppl even bother about systemd
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> i never know what i use or what the diff is
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> why would one care
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> after tea runs out I have 70 kanji to review and 10 pages of computer networks lecture to get through
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> when do i interact with it
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> what is kanji
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Êº¢Â≠ó
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> can u get high on it?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The characters japanese stole from the chinese
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> hm my font is too cheap
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> cant see shit
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't read kanji on computer either, my fonts are waay to small for it
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only know that is kanji in kanji because I've seen the pattern and it matches the context of the conversation
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The left character I can't distinguish the strokes at all, way too dense
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> wat
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> send screen
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> mine could also be a poop emoji
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784097051200716851/t.png

17:42 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1607013583.png
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> urs looks so clean :D
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well at a first glance I thought the left character was "vague"=="Êº†"
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the two side by side. No way I could tell them apart without putting my face in the screen üòõ
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784097526470541352/t.png
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> what tea do u drink?
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> and how much alcohol does it contain?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, maybe I should get new glasses? Are those easy to tell apart for you?
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> yes
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> go buy glasses nerd
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rude
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> :D
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> always watvhing the screen
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> reading books
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> go eat some carrots and go outside
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> carrots being good for vision is a myth
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> was about to ask
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> i think i heard a similar thing latley
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> it being a myth is fake news tho
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> being outside would only do good as far as I wouldn't look at a screen for the duration of my trip outside üòÑ
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> oh no dont do that
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> kids dont talk anymore
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess no takers for my great hook
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> when i was young we were talking with ppl in the public transport or waiting in the queue
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> nowadays all ppl watch in their phones
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go back to stewing in anger while doing my kanji for the day. Nice talking to you ChillerDragon
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> ye was big fun
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> ty for the haxx0r support
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> hf gl
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw, definitely try Cutter, would help a lot in browsing the disassembly
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> oh lol regarding i never interacted with systemd i think systemd just stole my coredump :D
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should be in /var/lib/systemd/coredump
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bot-gier1> /rank
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://youtu.be/pp06oGD4m00 surprisingly followable and an interesting topic
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I doubt many are interested in prime gaps :P
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> anyone knows how scoping of parameter expansion works in bash? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/qz
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> i want to pass the name of a variable to the function and retrive the value 
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> it works in a subshell but not in a function
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> ah i have to do f $p hm yea makes sense nvm im confused xd
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> yea ok i get it
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @ChillerDragon your welcome üòÉ
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @ChillerDragon you're welcome üòÉ

20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> the autoupdate for automappers is bugged 
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> if you change the Seed to 1 and click on "A" and try to do draw something or try to drag the number higher the client crashes
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> which it didnt before ofc
