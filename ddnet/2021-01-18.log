10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why does DDNet client hold hook if you hook, then go to /pause with a bind, release hook and unpause? I want that behaviour for my server aswell, but I dont know how
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> right now it holds the hook even if you release it in /pause, but after you resume the hook gets destroyed, only if you hold it again while resuming it will be held
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! ApolloZzc> hello, my name is apollo and i'm going through some crash problems, some maps are making my client stop responding like: baby aim 1 and caventure, please someone help me
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut i think thats client side
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since u can do that with f1 too
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki yes, but something has to be serverside, i dont know what tho
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is clientside indeed, but it wont work on my server
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u tried with ddnet client
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes ofc
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk then
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen any idea?
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> @! ApolloZzc are you on the latest version can you consitantly reproduce it?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and do you use Intel Graphics on Windows or something else?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wrapping errors in rust feels so nice
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> went from comented code to this
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800687422790303744/unknown.png
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this was how i wrapped it
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800687470924136448/unknown.png
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> epic
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feelsgoodman
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 🙂
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> implementing From<> on errors allows u to use `?` which is rly nice
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> epic
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! ApolloZzc> I'm using the steam version
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> bro nothing is more random than the vscode extentions marketplace all extensions appear and disappear or change author or are duped I can not find a single c++ extension currently :/
12:57 <+ChillerDragon> oh well ok "clangd" seems to be language support a weird name tho
12:57 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should fully join the vim masterrace but for cpp its so incovnienent idk
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> is it me being color blind or did clangd decide to use same colors for variables and functions? :/ https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610971212.png
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> irctroll
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> clangd is not the C++ plugin that’s the best on vscode. Microsofts offering is much better imo
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clangd best
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As for coloring, I think it depends on your color scheme, some color schemes only have so many colors so some get reused, or some don’t define different colors for everything
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u use vscode or vsodium or whathever it is?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ye extensions disappear randomly
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another reason  iswitched to vim
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was rly annoying
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah the open source version is a bit restrictive w.r.t extensions
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe that’s why you are missing some?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki are you a vim wizard yet?
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i consider vim like c++
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never got as fast as I wanted with vim, too used to the mouse
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant fully master it
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont use the mouse tho
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should watch geohot’s stream if he ever streams coding again
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That man is a true vim-wizard
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well there will always be super dope ppl
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on the level of someone who uses it on a daily basis i guess
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mastering is one thing, I just wasnt fast enough. Maybe I should give it another try one day
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 to make most profit from vim
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to personalize it a lot
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> create ur own macros commands etc
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does vim have proper multiple cursors?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can edit multiple lines
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did it once
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use multiple cursor editing quite a lot since refactoring is quite shit with most every ide
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> How to install the one by microsoft tho @Learath2
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont know if multiple cursos is the best solution
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this sounds like the XY problem
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use replace or make a macro
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> depends on the problem i guess
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> oh there is a open source version?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Honestly,  no idea, it suggested it to me when I first opened a C++ file
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice i think ur right
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb watchign snk
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610973375.png
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> seems like i have to install some ms binary blobs xd
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> from a sketchy aur
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Binary version only has branding, telemetry and store settings
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Telemetry you can disable(tm)
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> and backdoor to break linux and promote windows
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://vscodium.com/
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> i think i have that open src thing
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> i would sell my first born to get proper color so ms it is
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The open source version has the store set to some open source clone of the ms store
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is a nice idea. But it’s always so out of date and is missing a lot of extensions
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chiller I really think your color issue is your colorscheme not the c++ extension
13:39 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> the mobile age introduced the "there is a app for everything" slogan
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> and ppl always say linux has no software
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> but aur is bae xd
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610973627.png
13:42 <+ChillerDragon> love you @Learath2 now i got OSS vscode and a ms marketplace and ms exnetions and colors are golden :3 thanks vscode por
13:42 <+ChillerDragon> pro*
13:42 <+ChillerDragon> good colors to fixe whitespaces and typos in comments :)
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki there are some crates that generate these From implementations for you
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror for libraries, https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow for applications. for examples
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *for example
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are a couple of others
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 this is nice, but only from a end user perspective
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a library should wrap the errors
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and not use this
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check the first link for libraries
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only checked the second sry xd
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thiserror looks like it
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like anyhow, and i used it once
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ok if ur lazy or early in the development i guess
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Use Anyhow if you don't care what error type your functions return, you just want it to be easy. This is common in application code. Use thiserror if you are a library that wants to design your own dedicated error type(s) so that on failures the caller gets exactly the information that you choose.
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 why do u think thiserror is not part of the std?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to keep things minimal?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't need to be part of std in any case, since it doesn't appear in your public API
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my experience rust likes to have lot of things in external crates
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont have to fear dependencies
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> regex is a crate, rand is a crate
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw this in a discussio
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> n
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ developers are always afraid of using a library
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but in rust case its not the same
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Real c++ devs aren’t scared of any library. They all use the mother of bloat that is boost even
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this crate reduced my code by 100 lines
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more or less
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800726300666888222/unknown.png
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust macros dope
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is a consequence of static linking, the state of dynamic linking is so bad that people really don’t want to mess around with libraries if not necessary
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 my biggest problem with c++ is usually adding a library
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's a consequence of having a default way to build dependencies
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even using a library
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u spend shitload of time just to get a library
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially in non windows
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> non linux
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what im talking
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 eh, building all libraries yourself and statically linking them in removes all complexity from libraries on almost any language I can think of
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cargo just makes it trivial for rust
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im making a url shortener for fun in rust
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon ill make it public
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. look how we never have any issue with the handful of libraries we build and statically link in ddnet either. Even though our build system is very questionable
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we did have problems with the statically linked ones
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sdl?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linking order, getting them to work for the first time
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all not trivial
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki using an in memory key-value store?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sqlite
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im doing it rly simple
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800727392045367336/unknown.png
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im nearly done
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 248 lines of code only
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ah, linking order can get a little interesting, but it’s still usually trivial to figure out what is out of order. Iirc nowadays lld even tells you which one needs moving using some heuristic check
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 dynamic linking can be a bit of a shitfest on linux
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> one example i found is
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haskell
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arch maintainers rly want to use dynamic libraries on haskell
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should see the massive amounts of haskell libraries
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i update
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dynamic linking is not “a bit of a shitfest” it is a shitfest on linux
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly it’s not much better on other platforms either. Windows almost never uses system libraries so every application brings their own libraries and they use very crude image signature techniques to not load the library a billion times. The really shared ones have to ship with 50 different versions and the loader needs to load the correct version, like msvcrt or the vc++ redis
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macOS has frameworks the size of an entire linux distro to handle the versioning issue for the system shared libraries, but almost always applications ship every other lib/framework they use as the system versions can’t be relied on as they are ancient most of the time
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The most recent version of appkit is around 40M
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Linux is the only one that doesn’t waste memory and require an overly intelligent loader by default. But that comes at the cost of the pain of mismatching libraries
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I once envisioned a runtime flatpak crafter, you run the executable and before the actual loader, I wanted to populate the “environment” with the correct dependencies. It would work on all platforms and not waste space, but it requires a huge repository with compatibility information
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I like the way arch packages haskell packages
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> wtf with wiki now
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> where is my encodings page I need
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @deen help
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I will stop answering your questions if you ping deen
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> how can I unping deen
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you tell me that you're not going to ping deen for every single issue, I can tell you the answer
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I wont
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> If you will answer my issues
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What encodings page?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I believe it was wiki.ddnet.tw/encodings
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki Any idea what happened with https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gSXqwOzoa0IJ:https://wiki.ddnet.tw/encodings/+ ?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess it wasnt ported, it should be easily ported since it was just a mirror
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> embrace the wiki spirit and create the page
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add content
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and dont complain
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen do you find it okay to be pinged randomly? if so, I rescind my comment above
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Evgesha probably assumed that I was involved in the wiki project since I posted the news, so not really a random ping
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen Zwelf told me he didnt want to port it
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've seen him ping you on quite a lot of issues. hm okay
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> On steam I get "An error occured while updating (app configuration unavailable)" any ideas?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Trying to play ddnet via steam for the first time
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, haven't seen that
15:53 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki> @timakro rerun
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> doesn't work
15:53 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki> hmm
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Дядя Женя the content was mirrored from https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/d3788aeb947fbecb33e6ebf6ef740cdc08040158/doc
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "They are automatically generated. Better suited to just include it on ddnet.tw on a sub page"
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> nvm, was not a ddnet problem, can't install anything ^^
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u on arch
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> fresh windows install
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh windows
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> having issues with my vm
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh vm
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> actually gpu
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe missing some net framework redistribuibles
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i thought it was a vm issue, had blackscreens and video glitches. then just said fuck it go back to dual boot and got the same issues ^^
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> now it magically works agin
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Can you make a PR on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web to include them?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Not sure what to do now. I had these issues a year ago. I could still rma my gpu but if they actually test it it might work for them, idk what happens then
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u got the drivers right
15:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Yes, I'll make a pr
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what gpu btw
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> rtx 2060
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I just told geforce experience to install the drivers
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you can't do anything wrong there
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u download from nvidia web
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows installs automatically old drivers
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its always better to redownload from the web
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i got black screens with both
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> also with half a year old drivers
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> if i get a 3070 or 3080 i'll get that and then try to rma ^^
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but for now i prefer a half working gpu over no gpu
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro got another PSU to try? maybe it delivers instable power
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or putting the GPU into another system
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> never heard of instable power?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it's definitely enough if you mean that
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i woud suspect the psu if it shutdown for no reason
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk if black screens could be caused by the psu
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but i can't really try any of that
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800742504773320704/20210118_141142.jpg
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Or this :D
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would rma the gpu
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly should try to get it fixed
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz buying a gpu noawadays
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is a nono
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my 200€ gpu costs 500€ now
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the marketi s crazy
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I can live without a gpu for a month
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> dedicated gpu
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its just a month :monkalaugh:
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah me neither -.-
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But maybe I'll get rma money xD
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'd be okay with paying 100 € more than the recommended retail price for an nvidia card
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And you can get that if you look for it
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I had an eye on gpu prices because I was looking to upgrade anyways
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I saw it twice the last months
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> xDD
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the 3070 costs 920€ its msrp price is 500€
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> like ~100 more
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> never for the "real" price
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I see a 3070 for 730 here
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my 180€ gpu

16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> german :monkaS:
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I thought availability of the 30 series would get better but it got worse haha
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> much worse
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard this is due to only 2 companies being able to make the gpu silicon
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and covid
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Have you seen those monster machines they use to make cpu dies?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Must be similar to gpus
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can you do memory tests on vram?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro maybe something like occt and there seem to be some cuda-based vram memtests
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> so should I sell my gpu now and upgrade to sli when the prices dump again? :D 
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> SLI makes no sense
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> oof why
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> then the better gpu model i guess
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> i heard sli is not getting twice the performance but "no sense" sounds even worse
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> most games don't support it and even if they do, you don't get much more performance, but have much more power draw
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> so more eletricity costs hm
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> well my gpu is 5yrs old i can also upgrade it without going to sli ;D
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> invest in gpu market now :D
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont invest when its in a all time high
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> yea invest might be the wrong word but sell ur gpu now to rebuy later
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> its not investing its going short on gpu stocks xd
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like a save bet to me i doubt they stay high like this
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sell your computer now
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's going to be cheaper in the future
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> vram is fine, this is the weirdest shift, i can't even reliably reproduce it
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> vram seems fine, this is the weirdest shit, i can't even reliably reproduce it
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tried a different hdmi cable xd
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or display port or whatever
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> would a broken display port cable crash the system though?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hard to say, probs not
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tried unplugging from PCIe and clean the contacts?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and maybe try a ubuntu live usb
