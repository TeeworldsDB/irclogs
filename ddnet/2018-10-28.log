17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> Hi, any idea why compiling the server with sql support seems to break my name "♪" or "♫" ? Those special characters are fine if i type them in chat and so on but i see a square on top of my tees.
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> huh?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not about storing them in mysql db?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In MySQL utf8 is not called utf8, it's called utf8mb, so you should set that as the character set
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that shouldn't cause the name to break. does it work on ddnet servers?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> Yeah it's working fine on ddnet servers, it's working fine when i build without sql support and even when i build with sql support it's writing them fine in the console, just not on the game screen and just for the names
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> as far as i understood is nobody here motivated to upgrade to 0.7?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Could someone explain why
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0 modding support
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> srsly @fokkonaut
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ❤ xD
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fok u naut
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no u
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so i understood that 64p and broadcast might become tricky. But is there something else aswell?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 64p support ez if this gets merged
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1580
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> rewriting the server should be mostly easy
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> not sure about rewriting the client tho
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can explain why \o/
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who cares about 0.7? It's nothing we didn't have and nothing we can't implement
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's so much work. For what? Saying we are teeworlds compatible?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeworlds only players hate ddnet
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why be compatible with them
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet is a mod of teeworlds
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby we must end that then
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :toptri:
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :feelsamazingman:
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1580/commits/4b3fa66a9f636230378a184d1c2f650249f9148e
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what does that do
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i love u
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice video @Ryozuki
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> XD
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> "deen i love you"
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - nice video
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 so you actaully want to break the teeworlds compability because of lazyness?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lets forget about the client and go in small steps.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> We could ship a small working ddnet version with the most basic features like freeze times database connection (to the old one so we have a nice bridge to 0.6). And release only basic maps that can be handled by the new basic 0.7 mod.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and then we can keep developing the 0.6 mod and expand the 0.7 step by step. And offer and ddnet for both versions. That would be very great.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but why u want to port it
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because new teeworlds player that find it in steam or go to teeworlds.com wont find the ddnet and other modding parts of teeworlds
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they didnt find ddnet before too
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so there is no diference
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> splitting the community of fresh players that builds our future is no good idea
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.6 has the default gamemodes filter on by default
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poor argument
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a different client and unticking a box is a different thing bro
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats a totally different thing
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think so
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they want to find ddnet
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they will
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ...
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and 0.7 is really bad
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how do u want to find it if u dont know it exsists
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is really bad about it?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the way to go is to make ddnet in steam
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not porting to 0.7
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forget about teeworlds
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet is part of teeworlds
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and teeworlds is great
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 is not great
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stop saying i should forget about it
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is not great about it
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that was my orginal question here
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can't we fix it?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> skins, the menu, and overall the main devs
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a regression
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks really ugly
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and he removes broadcast
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo the menu is an improve. it is still under development
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he only makes it worse
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we can try to get broadcast back agian and change something in the development process
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> by being active on github
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with his mindset sure xD
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and not by being quite and break compability
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oy is pretty active
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and new skin system is shit, it looks bad
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like old teeworlds
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he talks with people on github and on the forum
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you wont convince me
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tested it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i dont like it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think if we show up there and request some logical important changes we can get results
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then do it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i do
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer that the devs of ddnet dont spent time on useless things
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i dont know what has to be changed
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so do it yourself
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why i am here
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> to ask what is needed from the vanilla side
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why you ask that here
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont like the idea of forgetting about other tw mods
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and not on teeworlds
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because teeworlds doesnt care about ddnet
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet based mods would be able to come with a standalone ddnet
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to know what the vanilla codebase needs that ddnet can be updated
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so ddnet shouldnt care about teeworlds
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want it to update
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you dont sound any better than Oy
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do u know that?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sound better than him
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he let teeworlds die
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stop fighting each other and start to collaborate
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and released a shit product
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you let it die aswell
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well, have fun porting it
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard its about 5000 commits
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guis can someone please answer my question ._.
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is there something that is required in the vanilla codebase to be changed to work for ddnet 0.7?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Or is it just a lot of work
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki 5698 or something like that
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw: @ChillerDragon i play tw 10 years now, right? Ryozuki doesnt believe me i started in 2008
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #off-topic
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsgoodman:
