00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ps4 & switch system and graphics APIs are locked behind developer programs that are incredibly hard to get into for open-source authors
00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> and there is no existing directx backend for use on xbox
00:01 < bridge> <Ewan> so for any platform it would be a tremendous amount of work. somehow get into the developer program, add a new graphics backend, deal with the countless quirks of the system, and of course, somehow navigating the UI with a controller
00:05 < bridge> <Ewan> if you care that much there was a thing floating around a little while ago that you could install linux on a ps4
10:31  * ChillerDragon deen moment

14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then one of the GPUs probably has no vk driver anymore
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it uses what the vulkan instance reports as name.. so i cannot really tell ya xD
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> r u on windows?
14:16 < bridge> <Teero> arch
14:20 < bridge> <Teero> ah fk i didnt even have radeon vulkan drivers installed xD
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah btw
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is radv and amdvlk
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are 2 vulkan drivers on linux
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> radv is by valve basically
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> amdvlk by amd
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> radv usually is better
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are a very few exceptions
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> namingly yuzu emulator works better on some titles with amdvlk ^^
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> radv is part of mesa
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> amdvlk is standalone
14:22 < bridge> <Teero> no need for nintende i only play teeworlds üòé

16:58 < bridge> <ZombieToad> hello @deen @Learath2 @snail why am i getting banned for constant racism when im not saying anything? i was gone away for 2 weeks now im coming back and getting banned for 3 months?
16:58 < bridge> <ZombieToad> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412325078328672258/1093912734044782713/image.png
17:33 < bridge> <Voxel> Who banned you
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel he is SP | Someone
17:34 < bridge> <Voxel> no i know that but
17:34 < bridge> <Voxel> i wanna hear the answer anyways
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> #freespsomeone
17:51 < bridge> <Skeith> I didn't do it, but I'll take credit
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> oof sp somone hater
17:52 < bridge> <Skeith> No need to use the bridge, just ask via your alt :troll:
17:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Mfw chillerdragon don't defend turboracist trolls challange, impossible difficulty
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> banbannetwork
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> u all stop bolly poor sp someone alr i havent seen him being racist once
17:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> racistdragon
17:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> sure xd
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> just mute him client side
17:56 < bridge> <Skeith> Is that why you don't see him being racist, you muted him?
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> no i would never mute babe sp somoni
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> but i recommend muting him in your client instead of abusing admin powers because of chat usage
17:59 < bridge> <Skeith> It affects everyone, and breaks the rules, if you had a üß† you would know client muting solves nothing there. Sure, everyone could client mute, but why should everyone be forced to do that, repeatedly... Since he swaps names when he does it. :troll:
17:59 < bridge> <bencie> i can also recommend not typing racist messages üß†
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> ah ok if he uses other names to be racist then it makes sense i didnt realize it yet
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer toxic chat over toxic admins every time
18:00 < bridge> <Voxel> garten of
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> because toxic chat you can mute but toxic bans you can not fight
18:01 < bridge> <bencie> ye but its not toxic to ban racists
18:01 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah jesus christ chat being > any chat ever i swear
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> just put the racist words in the banned wors.txt thingy and go full china censor then xd
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> so we can still play in game with the pro player sp somoni and do some runs
18:02 < bridge> <gerdoe> afkdragon talks about game activity smh
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> xd
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> touche
19:22 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1093948820431306802/image.png
19:22 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
19:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i 110% have drivers
19:54 < bridge> <ZombieToad> if you could provide proof for me being constantly racist that would be good
19:54 < bridge> <ZombieToad> i think ddnet needs more transparency with moderation
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> what's a 6 letter race that starts with n and ends with r
20:23 < bridge> <bencie> nascar
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> correct
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> but i was asking the racist ‚òπÔ∏è
20:24 < bridge> <bencie> oops
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> the race enthusiast
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> can we word wrap with UI::DoLabel
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't look like it
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think i added a options struct that could be extended to support this
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i see `SLabelProperties` but nothing about word wrap
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> atm
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its called maxwidht or smth anyway
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah possible it doesnt exist yet
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or its some rendering flag, cant remember xd
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> that sounds more likely
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but generally we could‚Ñ¢Ô∏è render multiline
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i could do it and pr with a few other changes i made. horizontal scroll region & drop down that doesn't go past the bottom of the screen
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> usually a label isnt multiline tho
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
