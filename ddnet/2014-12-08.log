01:02 < xrothx> deen:  uploaded royal
01:03 <@deen> xrothx: feel free to reload
01:08 < xrothx> way better, now everybody is happy.. 
01:08 < xrothx> I liked my edits more ^^ but yah..
01:21 < eeeee> how important are the skins in demos
01:21 < eeeee> like when people upload their demos to youtube they would obviously have their skins installed and shown in the video
01:22 < eeeee> but custom skins get tricky in js demo player
01:23 < eeeee> i can make it to load skins on demand, but then some people would likely try to troll it by changing the skin name ten times a second or something
01:25 <@deen> Allow to select a few skin files as well?
01:25 <@deen> Or just use a lot of default skins
01:25 <@deen> I personally don't consider it important, but I'm not a big fan of skins anyway
03:10 < Nimda> DDNet EUR went down!
04:02 < eeeee> text rendering via html5 canvas seems fast enough, but turns out i still cannot completely get rid of freetype because the code uses text width to draw buttons :(
07:49 <@deen> EastByte: oh, you meant immediately taking down EUR?
11:56 <@EastByte> deen: no I didn't
11:56 <@EastByte> what happened
11:58 <@EastByte> hmm server is unreachable
12:16 <@EastByte> deen: I know what happened
12:17 <@EastByte> ovh forced reboot, and my debian the network configuration was wrong
12:18 < Nimda> DDNet EUR went back online!
12:19 <@EastByte> -the
12:53 <@deen> eeeee: hm, no text width in canvas?^^
12:56 <@deen> EastByte: ok, when will it go down?
13:17 <@EastByte> deen: 2014-12-14
14:37 < o_be_one> morning !

17:02 < Savander> hi !:)
17:03 < Savander> https://soundcloud.com/alexomfg/omfg-hello
17:03 < Savander> nice song :p
17:25 <@EastByte> deen: I just realised my raspberry lan tw server still is running: https://eastbit.net/priv/raspitwidle.png
17:26 <@EastByte> as long as you don't restart the pi, it runs flawlessly
17:27 <@deen> nice
17:28 <@deen> would be interesting to see how many players work without lags
17:28 <@EastByte> yep
17:29 <@EastByte> maybe tw runs smoother on arm, who knows
17:29 <@deen> I can give you my little udp-relay script
17:30 <@deen> need to set sv_max_clients_per_ip 64 and sv_spamprotection 0
17:30 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/udp-relay.py
17:30 <@EastByte> pff the dummies of my bouncer can behave independent from eachother :P
17:30 <@deen> well, then take your bouncer^^
17:30 <@EastByte> didn't implement any movement though
17:31 <@EastByte> iirc once there was such a udp relay tool written in delphi^^
17:33 <@deen> segfaults in lua!
17:33 <@EastByte> !
17:33 <@EastByte> deen is fuzzing the world!
17:34 <@EastByte> you should try that in a reallife date against a woman
17:34 <@EastByte> maybe they are exploitable
17:36 <@deen> interesting, they found a very similar bug 3 months ago, but mine still segfaults
17:37 <@deen> apparently lua only very rarely has bugs: http://www.lua.org/bugs.html
17:37 <@deen> 2 bugs this year so far
17:37 <@deen> and I found 2 more!
17:37 <@EastByte> ^^
17:41 <@deen> it's really funny how this works
17:41 <@deen> 6 lines and only in combination they crash, none of them alone
17:41 <@deen> even though they all look pretty normal to me except the last one^^
17:42 <@EastByte> hard to find without your method I guess
17:42 <@deen> yeah
17:42 <@deen> and the backtrace is thousands of lines
17:42 <@deen> afk
17:56 < o_be_one> lol Savander sure nice song :p
17:56 < Savander> :d.
18:11 < laxa> noother`: I have no idea why, maybe it's my server's fault, but nimda sometimes timeout from all networks without any reason.
18:30 < laxa> Careless Skeith & mB. | maple 1:13.44 WfC4iI58NCQ
18:31 < laxa> deen: new video :)
18:31 <@deen> laxa: uploaded ;)
18:32 < laxa> new shortcut on the map
18:32 < laxa> the run is pretty bad
18:32 <@deen> even on ddnet.tw
18:32 <@deen> no, not a new shortcut
18:32 <@deen> i showed .me' that shortcut when he mapped it
18:32 <@deen> he said "no one will ever use it"
18:32 < laxa> wtf lol
18:33 <@deen> but then the map was really popular about a year ago
18:34 <@deen> when everyone was using it
18:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #115: Fix visual studio build (C89-compatibility) (DDRace64...pr_predict) http://git.io/kFRPGw
18:45 <@EastByte> /* set DSCP/TOS */
18:45 <@EastByte> is that new?
18:47 <@deen> EastByte: in what sense?

18:48 <@heinrich5991> "new from vanilla" I guess
18:48 <@heinrich5991> was the question
18:48 <@deen> yeah, i recently added that
18:48 <@deen> not sure if it does any good for anyone
18:48 <@EastByte> ^^
18:48 <@heinrich5991> just wanted to ask, does that have a use? :)
18:48 <@deen> at least people could set higher priority for teeworlds packets in their routers
18:49 <@deen> well, if anyone in the internet cared about these flags, it would have a use
18:50 <@deen> I always used them for traffic shaping where the port isn't clear
19:16 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #116: Cleanup grenade prediction, now also correctly shows smoke trails (DDRace64...pr_predict) http://git.io/mggTUQ
19:21 <@deen> nice
19:29 < Nimda> leopold by Shorefire just released on Brutal at 2014-12-08 19:27
19:59 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:59 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 504
19:59 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
20:51 < eeeee> well canvas does have some text width methods but it would require more work to integrate and would also be two times slower
20:52 < eeeee> i'd have to do some caching or something
21:09 <@deen> ok, doesn't sound ideal
22:12 < xRoTxh> deen: 
22:12 <@deen> xRoTxh: 
22:13 < xRoTxh> I uploaded a winter version of ROYAL
22:13 < xRoTxh> Could you put it on a testserver again? ^^
22:13 <@deen> huh?
22:14 <@deen> just go on a test server and use change_map?
22:17 < xRoTxh> forgot the rcon pw
22:19 <@deen> PM
22:19 < xRoTxh> thx
23:41 < maple> wow lol
23:41 < maple> the demo is impressive
23:41 < maple> only i take so much time
23:41 <@deen> what demo?
23:41 < maple> the careless one
23:41 < maple> pretty bad
