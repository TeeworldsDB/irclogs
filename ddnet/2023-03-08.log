12:57 < bridge> <Simon'> isnt this year ddnet 10th birthday?
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> yea seems about right given that the first finish of deen is 2013 https://ddnet.org/players/deen/
13:04 < bridge> <Simon'> deen should know the date
13:04 < bridge> <Simon'> will there big birthday event?
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://wiki.ddnet.org/index.php?title=Timeline&oldid=6579
13:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the wiki says it's 2013-07-18
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> multimap is hard

13:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Whenever I talked shit about this dude people came in to defend him. Look at what he created...
13:51 < bridge> <Voxel> xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
14:22 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I was always wondering: why don't we have a tile-size option in the editor so it's possible to map smaller/bigger tiles then the default?
14:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, what do you mean?
14:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Teeworlds supports only one tile size
14:23 < bridge> <AssassinTee> for example, you use a tilelayer in the background with parallax, but since it's "further away" you want smaller tiles for a better distance effect
14:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, is this currently doable? I don't know if we have zoom levels for layers
14:25 < bridge> <Learath2> It might require a map format change again
14:26 < bridge> <AssassinTee> We have zoom layers, but it's documented nowhere, I managed to break it and it's unclear to me how to map with it what I want to
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> wait what you can zoom tiles?
14:27 < bridge> <AssassinTee> in the editor, yes
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> how o.O
14:28 < bridge> <AssassinTee> group->custom zoom, press zoom button on editor top (next to grid)
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> indeed i did not know that thats fancy
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> so you want to se a size of the tile instead of a general zoom? how is that even different 
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> parallax
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you can for example put smaller tiles in your fg
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> or do some detail work in different sizes
14:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> or the zoom in the bg doesn't make my tiles small enough, but I can't control it's value
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> a
14:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> and working with parallax and zoom is really REALLY confusing
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> so you need more fine grained control
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> does that thing even work? do clients see it resized in game?
14:34 < bridge> <AssassinTee> oh no, they don't ?!
14:34 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Now I don't get this feature at all
14:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Do you think I could open a discussion? I would be willing to implement it as well
14:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Do you think I should open a discussion? I would be willing to implement it as well
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> If it does not get applied to the actual map file then it is probably some ddnet editor shinanigan and not supported by the current map format.
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> If that is the case one would have to create a new map format.
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> when having map format questions always ping patiga he is the guru
14:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> does the map format never receive updates? Also makes me question slicing, as if it's also "hacked in"
14:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @Patiga ping üòÑ
14:41 <+ChillerDragon> most of the map updates cause compatibilty break so old clients can not load the new maps
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> like for example the ddnet client not being able to load maps made with a 0.7 client (yet)
14:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> if you change tile size, it can only be a visual (detail) layer and could therefore be only marked as detail and maybe not even served for other clients (or they ignore it)
14:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> "but Assa, people will draw over gamelayers with half tile size" ü§î
14:47 <+ChillerDragon> serving two map files is actually what is being done with 0.7 maps on bridge servers but adding yet another map format is additional complexity im sure there will be some backlash
14:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> The idea is, that you expand the map file format but only in ways which get ignored by other clients, you can't load a ddnet map with a 0.7 client anyway (at least fully, missing layers like tele-layer)
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you can mostly load a ddnet map in 0.7
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only the tilesets are missing
14:50 <+ChillerDragon> yea this way is fine but not the other way around
14:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> multimap: telelayers are missing, probably other stuff, too, sound layers get ingored
14:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083024192338935818/screenshot_2023-03-08_14-50-24.png
14:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> multimap: telelayers are missing, probably other stuff, too. I know from my material experiments that sound layers get ingored entirely
14:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083024192338935818/screenshot_2023-03-08_14-50-24.png
14:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> So we could just let the clients which can't load a map with that feature ignore a non-default-tile size and force it as detail for now
16:34 < bridge> <deen> I will be quite busy around that time, so can't organize anything
17:37 < bridge> <Learath2> A couple months ago I asked for a way to diagnose a stutter, I remember getting some good advice but I can't find it by searching :/
17:37 < bridge> <Learath2> So anyone any good ideas on how to diagnose a stutter with no apparent reason?
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .
17:42 < bridge> <Learath2> Aha, thanks. So I was going to grab an old version that doesn't stutter and use the benchmarking tools
19:47 < bridge> <Simon'> What about asking some other guys to organize it?
21:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could do that, yes
21:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or help organizing something üôÇ
21:24 < bridge> <Simon'> I was thinking of a maybe a little bit more known person
21:25 < bridge> <Simon'> Someone who has been some time around and has gathered some trust
21:25 < bridge> <Simon'> But i have an idea
21:26 < bridge> <Simon'> Replace the map on Reis server with an older blmap so the players will have a flashback when joining
21:26 < bridge> <Simon'> v2 or something
21:27 < bridge> <Simon'> And then for normal maps ask some of the peak mappers for torunament map
21:28 < bridge> <Simon'> Maybe do a brainstorming session with some mods mappers if they get a nice idea
21:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Theoretically, I could host another server with the database of my BlmapChill server and F-DDrace mod
21:29 < bridge> <Simon'> Yeah
21:29 < bridge> <Simon'> And then do a nice anniversary background for the menu
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> first ddnet map as tournament
21:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> which is the first map released on ddnet? i think its probably multiple
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> first one that is not from ddmax
21:30 < bridge> <Simon'> Ah yes bring map the old multi easy map
21:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ddmax maps got released way after ddnets release
21:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> /map Mutlimap
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have no idea, there must be some first map xd
21:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Multimap*
21:30 < bridge> <Simon'> And then do a big callback on skype and Facebook and whatnot for the retired players
21:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, but I think multiple maps got released at once in the beginning. DDmaX lived for about 1-2 years after ddnet started
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Challenge is deens first finish
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.org/mappreview/?map=Challenge
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> awesome map for a tournament xD
21:31 < bridge> <Simon'> And then ask the streamers which have some streaming experience for streaming events, so the retired who dont actually play can still watch
21:32 < bridge> <Simon'> And then do a second torunament for gores
21:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No need to ask, they will do it anyways :D
21:32 < bridge> <Simon'> And do a fat giveaway, and for the giveaway present a temporary sponsor
21:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I like your pfp üçû
21:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> very original
21:33 < bridge> <Simon'> And then shut Fokos server for p2w
21:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> U
21:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Portal would ofc be disabled on a V2 server
21:34 < bridge> <Simon'> Dude when i started playing u were one of the big guys to me fokko
21:34 < bridge> <Simon'> How far down have u gotten
21:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ? xD
21:34 < bridge> <Simon'> Hosting a p2w server and ddosing
21:34 < bridge> <Simon'> Tststs
21:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What kinda random r u
21:35 < bridge> <Simon'> I used to not understand why ppl didnt liked u
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno how this escalated so quickly now, but lets go üçø
21:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
21:35 < bridge> <Simon'> Anyways
21:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wont even argue with this guy
21:35 < bridge> <Simon'> This guy is coffee
21:35 < bridge> <Simon'> Calm
21:35 < bridge> <Simon'> Not THE coffee
21:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just for your clarification:
21:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 1. was always possible to buy/donate on my server
21:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 2. never ddosed
21:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xddd
21:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think u mix it up with vali or Rei, idk
21:36 < bridge> <Simon'> Maybe do an announcement that organizers are needed
21:37 < bridge> <Simon'> Tststs
21:37 < bridge> <Simon'> Fokko
21:37 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> so p2w
21:37 < bridge> <Simon'> Ddos is not just vali and rei u know
21:38 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> lets ddos some 2d game that didnt any serious bad thing never
21:38 < bridge> <Swarfey> ye but it has been like that since basically always
21:38 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> i find it good idea to risk it for some 2d game
21:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye, i was just proving him that this statement is wrong xd
21:39 < bridge> <Swarfey> and that guy is saying fokko got low lately xd btw how did this go from helping organizing an event to ddos
21:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> childhood trauma probably
21:40 < bridge> <Simon'> U know what would be pog for anniversary?
21:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> banning u
21:40 < bridge> <Simon'> Having matricks back in the game
21:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :feelsamazingman:
21:41 < bridge> <Simon'> If he showed up in a video with deen and the other ddnet founders that would be insane
21:41 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> lets do ddos from ddnet servers
21:41 < bridge> <M é…π „Ç∑> Go
21:41 < bridge> <M é…π „Ç∑> :troll:
21:41 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> imagine ddos by all servers around the world
21:41 < bridge> <Simon'> Maybe do fat discord vc event with music
21:41 < bridge> <Simon'> And matricks in the vc
21:42 < bridge> <Simon'> Matricks is a piece of history
21:42 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> even fucking chile
21:42 < bridge> <Simon'> And the other founders, Teetow and so on
21:43 < bridge> <Simon'> Involving the community could be a good move
21:46 < bridge> <Simon'> I will for sure do not a single thing since i like brainshiting this ddos network and enjoy watching these degenerates being degenerates
21:47 < bridge> <Simon'> Also fokkonaut also ddosed vali back, idk if he private ddosed him or his server since it was about 2019/2020 when he did
21:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This statement shows, that you have absolutely no clue.
21:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> My server started in 2019, and there was absolutely no DDoS at that time.
21:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> So there was also nothing to DDoS back.
21:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But since everything you said today is completely garbage, it doesnt matter anyways xD
21:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Discord Mod could we maybe get rid of this guy, since he is accusing and starting dumb arguments out of nowhere
21:51 < bridge> <Simon'> He pinged
21:51 < bridge> <Simon'> Bann him
21:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (check chat history)
21:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> lmao wtf
21:53 < bridge> <Simon'> Well well if thats not rei joining all in when its about ddos
21:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> yes
21:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> but it's funny to see how retarded you are, saying bullshit
21:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> stop saying things when you have no clue, as @fokkonaut saud
21:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> stop saying things when you have no clue, as @fokkonaut said
21:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> not even the 1st time you're like that
21:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @ReiTW want some üçø ?
21:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> :gigachad:
21:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> No need to answer to those type of people anymore
21:55 < bridge> <Simon'> Idk bro i came here wanted to talk about anniversary, fokkonaut comes and randomly talks abt my pfp
21:55 < bridge> <Simon'> Ok then
21:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> not a reason to say things that people didn't even do
21:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> u mean this?
21:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lmao
21:55 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Stop talking here offtopic from now one
21:55 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Stop talking here offtopic from now on
21:56 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Stop talking here offtopic from now on.
