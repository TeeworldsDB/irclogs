00:02 < Savander> xD
00:11 < Savander> lol
00:11 < Savander> i can see frame by frame
00:12 < Savander> how teleport works
00:12 < Savander> hahah
00:12 < Savander> :D
00:12 < Savander> funny :D 
00:12 < Savander> maybe i should record it in 300+ fps
00:12 < Savander> and make a scientific video about teleportation in teeworlds.
00:12 < Savander> <hehehe>
00:12 < Savander> xD
00:12 < Savander> its good idea! What you think!
00:12 < Savander> haha
00:13 <@heinrich5991> Savander: that's just hte demo player that interpolates :)
00:13 < Savander> csiI!
00:13 < Savander> :c
00:41 < KinG_> hey
00:41 < KinG_> deen: commands don't work in ddnet persian
00:41 < KinG_> like /top5
00:41 <@deen> KinG_: server looks down, i can't reach it
00:41 < KinG_> wtf!
00:42 < KinG_> can u ping it?
00:42 <@deen> KinG_: as I said, it's connected to GER database, so if it has no connection to europe, no commands will work
00:42 <@deen> no
00:42 < KinG_> deen oh now i see
00:42 <@deen> can't ping it from any location in the world
00:42 < KinG_> deen: we got ddos and server changed to intranet
00:42 < KinG_> so attack stop
00:43 < KinG_> but deen i still join from internet list in game!
00:43 < KinG_> i refresh and i have servers
00:43 <@deen> they will disappear if the masterserver can't reach them
00:45 <@deen> well, we have a problem if the server gets ddosed and taken off the internet all the time
00:45 <@deen> when will it be back?
00:45 < KinG_> deen: yeah just need some time
00:45 < KinG_> deen: next time install database on server itself ^^
00:45 < KinG_> but at least we are sure we won't get ddosed
00:45 <@deen> that's a lot of work and when the server suddenly disappears, then i have a lot of trouble fixing the database
00:46 <@deen> also, it doesn't really work with the ddnet concept of databases that a server just disappears for hours
00:46 < KinG_> http://ddnet.tw/status don't work for me
00:46 <@deen> works for me
00:46 < KinG_> ok works now
00:47 < KinG_> ok
00:47 < KinG_> server back online
00:49 < KinG_> down again
00:49 < KinG_> wth
00:50 <@deen> yeah, we're getting lots of attacks today
00:50 <@deen> on Chile and GER too
00:54 < KinG_> ok so deen i'm gonna setup a firewall
00:55 < KinG_> deen: give me the ports u need and seperate them with , like 22,6565,...
00:55 <@deen> oh shit
00:56 <@deen> Now I understand why in the last days many people have problems connecting to GER...
00:56 < KinG_> why?!
00:56 <@deen> the attackers are collecting IPs of players, then spoof them and DDoS the servers with their IPs
00:56 <@deen> so they get blocked and they can't play anymore
00:56 < KinG_> but how?!
00:57 < KinG_> how do they collect players ip?!!!! wtf
01:00 < KinG_> deen: any ideas how they collect ip?!
01:00 < masoudd> Who collects ip?
01:00 < KinG_> some assholes ^^
01:01 < eeeee> sounds like a time for teewebs http serverlist tchnlg
01:02 < KinG_> hmm
01:03 < KinG_> there is a possiblity that a popular website for teeworlds is controled by attackers
01:03 < KinG_> so they get ips! but a low possiblity
01:03 < eeeee> s/website/server
01:03 <@deen> and not a popular one, just any server
01:04 <@deen> and i know it is, because they use that to ddos players as well
01:04 < KinG_> i got dced yesterday several times until i changed ip
01:04 < KinG_> but how my ip?!!!!!
01:04 < eeeee> KinG_: do you use server browser or only the ddnet tab?
01:05 < KinG_> server browser
01:05 < KinG_> and i only play on ddnet
01:05 < eeeee> they won't get your ip if you only use ddnet tab
01:05 < KinG_> that's confusing because i never joined other server than ddnet and no websites yesterday!
01:06 < eeeee> your client still sends his ip to every teeworlds server in the world
01:06 < eeeee> whenever you use open server browser
01:06 < KinG_> oops
01:07 < eeeee> that's how ping is computed
01:07 < KinG_> i understand now
01:07 < KinG_> so we just have to find out which server is stealing ip
01:07 < eeeee> not possible unfortunately
01:07 < KinG_> we can see the ips of attackers
01:08 < KinG_> and match it
01:08 < eeeee> and even if we do find it, they'll just change ip and rename the server so you have to look for it again
01:08 < KinG_> so....
01:08 < KinG_> no way to stop them
01:08 < eeeee> we just have to come up with an alternative to server browser
01:08 < KinG_> i'll still try to install a good firewall on server lets see if it'll work
01:08 < eeeee> it won't -_-
01:09 < masoudd> Anyone can get the ip of teeworld players. If I understand correctly, when you refresh the server list, you connect to all of them to check you ping. So all you have to do is to have a server registered to the master server and IPs start flowing your way
01:10 < KinG_> and start ddosing them 
01:11 < KinG_> damn server have no internet connect i have to find a way to install needed files from intranet
01:12 <@deen> KinG_: i think we had this discussion before, software firewalls don't work when your network gets overloaded
01:12 < KinG_> yeah ....
01:13 < masoudd> who would ddos clients?
01:13 <@deen> eeeee: an alternative explanation would be that some of the botter clients just installed a botnet thingy on the clients
01:13 < masoudd> crazy
01:13 <@deen> masoudd: it's especially bad for players who can't change ip
01:13 < masoudd> yeah
01:14 < masoudd> analyze the incoming traffic. see where it is coming from? how many ips are attacking you
01:15 < KinG_> why they only ddos ddnet persian?!
01:15 < KinG_> we have no players
01:15 <@deen> KinG_: I'd guess someone else ddoses you, someone from iran
01:15 < KinG_> wait a sec ...
01:15 <@deen> KinG_: and GER also gets ddosed but it has protection
01:15 < KinG_> persian pro is down
01:16 < KinG_> and 10 mins after that
01:16 <@deen> so someone is attacking them and you
01:16 < KinG_> ddnet persian is down too
01:16 < KinG_> but it's impossible
01:16 < KinG_> persian pro is on intranet
01:16 < KinG_> and the person that is attacking us attacks from internet
01:16 <@deen> you can do an intranet ddos attack maybe
01:16 < KinG_> !
01:17 < KinG_> what u mean
01:18 <@deen> maybe they have a botnet inside iran, then they can attack persian pro even when it's not on the internet
01:18 < KinG_> how can i see incoming ips and outgoing ones on linux?
01:20 <@deen> KinG_: no idea what you're trying to do^^
01:20 < KinG_> just trying to see what ips are connected to ddnet persian server
01:20 < KinG_> ipconfig on windows
01:20 <@deen> you can use tcpdump, but I'd prefer not to
01:20 < KinG_> dunno what is the command on linux
01:21 < masoudd> Hmm read netstat or ss manpage
01:21 < KinG_> yeah on netstat
01:21 <@deen> if anyone wants to investigate whether a bot client installs malware, the affected client claims to have only used this client: http://13x37.com/portal.php
01:22 <@deen> and I've heard of 13x37 clan ddosing servers before
01:22 < KinG_> good that i never used it
01:24 < eeeee> guess we'll have to bundle an antivirus solution with ddnet client soon :D
01:24 <@deen> eeeee: haha
01:25 < masoudd> KinG_: If it's coming from intranet you can find who's doing it
01:25 < KinG_> no for me it's coming from internet but for Persian pro is from intranet and i know who is doing it
01:26 <@deen> eeeee: maybe he was just mistakenly detected as one of the ddosers
01:27 < KinG_> persian up again
01:29 < KinG_> ok i have the graph of internet usage of server
01:29 < KinG_> it's wierd!
01:30 < KinG_> no more than 60Mb incoming traffic
01:30 < KinG_> so why server shuts down internet?!
01:32 <@deen> no idea
01:37 < KinG_> deen: when server is out of access from german and someone just finish a map, what happens? it'll get updated with server when german can reach server?!
01:37 <@deen> hopefully
01:37 <@deen> but maybe not always
01:38 < KinG_> so if u install database on irn what?!
01:39 <@deen> eeeee: ok, they say it was definitely no mistake, so either part of a TW botnet or getting spoofed
01:48 < eeeee> we can try to request ravomavain, the master imperator wielder of h4x rays
01:49 < eeeee> he did some reverse eng back in the day but seems very busy nowdays
01:49 <@deen> or just randomly part of a botnet, considering the number of our players it's not impossible that someone just randomly ends up being in a botnet
01:50 < KinG_> i'm sure that i'm not in a botnet ^_^
01:52 < KinG_> ok another odd thing! i can't see servers in DDNet tab
01:53 < KinG_> only on internet tab
01:53 < KinG_> wth?!
01:53 <@deen> maybe some filter activated
01:53 < KinG_> no all off
01:54 < KinG_> restarted client and it works
01:54 < KinG_> ah nvm 
01:54 < Savander> serverlist isnt from ddnet server?
01:54 <@deen> ok, weird
01:54 < Savander> i mean json
01:54 <@deen> Savander: yes, serverlist is from ddnet, but if it can't be loaded it should use the cached version
01:54 < Savander> hm.
01:54 < Savander> okay
02:12 < KinG_> !twp KinG
02:12 < Nimda_6518> KinG is currently playing Exchange on server : DDNet Persian - Solo [teecity.ir] [DDraceNetwork] [3/64].
02:12 < KinG_> this map is really annoying
02:14 <@deen> yeah, it's pretty hard
02:20 < KinG_> on the last part btw
02:20 < KinG_> i finished this on persian pro
02:21 < masoudd> KinG_: I can't find the ddnet persian solo
02:21 < KinG_> 8305 masoudd 
02:55 < KinG_> this last part is KILLING me
02:55 < KinG_> !twp KinG
02:55 < Nimda_6518> KinG is currently playing Exchange on server : DDNet Persian - Solo [teecity.ir] [DDraceNetwork] [3/64].
03:15 < KinG_> ahhhhhhhh any ideas how to get passed this last part of Exchange?!:|
03:23 <@deen> nope, never played the map
03:32 < KinG_> 92mins playing map 60 mins on last 2 part :|
03:41 < KinG_> 102mins and still on final part
03:41 < KinG_> world record is 1min and 50 secs ^^
04:13 < KinG_> deen: u still here?
04:13 < KinG_> deen: check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtM1BmU5O44 i checked, these maps are not in ddnet map list
04:14 < KinG_> deen: then where do these guys finish these?!
09:39 < DMTee> hola everyone :)
09:39 < DMTee> deen u here?
09:42 <@EastByte> hello DMTee 
12:06 < Nimda_6518> Woader by Destoros just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-14 12:00
12:06 < Nimda_6518> WinterMine by Alborq just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-14 12:00
12:06 < Nimda_6518> Violet by Ama just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-14 12:00
12:06 < Nimda_6518> X-Cross by Bixes just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-14 12:00
12:18 <@deen> Only 1 more day of ddmax releases
13:39 < Sadale> What's ddmax? Is it a clan?
13:41 < Savander> Old ddrace server
13:41 < Savander> very oldl
13:42 < Savander> a lot of maps from there
13:43 < Sadale> ah. interesting :3
13:43 < Sadale> Speaking of old server, I misses the day when city was very popular :(
13:44 < Sadale> [N]Race is now ded. It's not even compatible with 0.6.x series
13:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vmY1C
13:44 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 2077a4f def: Add a string for localization
13:44 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 cc63e9f def: Fix demo cutter to add .demo file ending
13:47 <@EastByte> Sadale: you played city?
13:47 < Sadale> yep
13:47 < Sadale> EastByte, ^
13:47 <@EastByte> what city mods do you still remember? :D
13:48 < Sadale> EastByte, MiKCity, Laser city, Fun Tee City(I made it :p)
13:48 <@EastByte> hm can't remember these names
13:49 < Sadale> EastByte, both mikcity and laser city ws made by micheal96? or mikeal96. I can't remember his exact nick.
13:49 <@EastByte> when I played there was buycity, b|city, ncity and e|city
13:49 < Sadale> EastByte, ah. you came later then. mikcity was in nrace era
13:49 <@EastByte> interesting
13:49 < Sadale> laser city was in a custom mod. 
13:50 < Learath2> never quite got the hang of city mods
13:50 <@EastByte> hanging around, earning money, buying things
13:50 < Sadale> Well, it's kinda sad. The developer of [N]Race deleted the mod. Reason unknown :(
13:50 < Sadale> EastByte, ah. FYI: [N]Race had no money
13:51 <@EastByte> yes, and iirc [N]Race was the base of n city?
13:51 <@EastByte> which was developed by BotoX
13:51 < Sadale> I'm not quite sure. But the name of [N]City suggests so :p
13:51 <@EastByte> yea, there was some kind of racing mod before
13:52 <@EastByte> the citys these days are completly pay2win
13:53 < Sadale> Yet, I bet that the guys who made the city mod makes almost no money :p
13:53 <@EastByte> actually they do
13:53 < Sadale> o rly? :o
13:53 <@EastByte> a friend of mine 'Blinky' made about 100 euros in two weeks
13:53 < Sadale> Every two weeks? :o
13:54 < Sadale> or it's just two weeks?
13:54 <@EastByte> I think he stopped hosting it after that
13:54 < Sadale> ah.
13:54 < Sadale> interesting. :o
13:54 <@EastByte> but kids like to pay for vip stuff
13:55 < Sadale> I'm jealous. I never managed to make any money with programming :p
13:56 < Sadale> EastByte, BTW, the kids are going to be mad that the city was closed after two week. They paid it :p
13:56 <@EastByte> sure
13:57 <@EastByte> to earn money you only need to ignore your conscience
13:57 <@EastByte> it's that simple :P
13:58 < Sadale> lol not even true =p
13:58 < Sadale> Anyway, I'm already happy enough. Programming was v difficult for me. At least now I can program whatever I want, just like most average amateur programmers here :3
14:03 <@EastByte> Sadale: so you don't plan to do it professionally?
14:04 < Sadale> EastByte, hmm. not sure. At least I have no plan right now. 
14:09 < Learath2> 100e ? must get in city business fast
14:11 <@EastByte> there is a living example :D
14:11 <@EastByte> http://ifcity.net/site.php?id=5&lang=
14:11 <@EastByte> see all the nice advantages? :D
14:11 <@deen> eeeee: a request for you :P http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1795
14:12 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, that's why i didn't want to host city servers on ddnet
14:12 <@deen> this kind of "donation" is called pay-to-win
14:12 <@EastByte> like I said :)
14:13 < Savander> pay-to-win rulez!
14:13 <@deen> not at all, it's disgusting
14:13 <@deen> The only thing I would add for ddnet is pay-to-kill-someone-in-race
14:13 < Savander> xDDD
14:13 < Savander> haha
14:14 <@EastByte> that's a joke I suppose
14:14 < Savander> league of legends or counter-strike global offesnvie has good shop
14:14 <@EastByte> Savander: in teeworlds that would be like selling skins
14:14 < Savander> yes
14:14 < Savander> something like that
14:14 < Savander> additional eyes
14:14 <@deen> EastByte: people do sell skins
14:15 < Savander> (0.7 teeworlds)
14:15 < Savander> hats
14:15 <@EastByte> deen: I mean bound to an acccuont
14:15 < Savander> gameskins
14:15 <@deen> which is one of the reasons I removed all BB skins from ddnet client
14:15 < Savander> etc
14:15 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, but other people accepted money because they knew they could talk me into adding a skin into ddnet client...
14:15 <@EastByte> hmmm
14:16 < Savander> Sellings skins in teeworlds, now is useless
14:16 < Savander> you can't see other people skins
14:16 < Savander> in csgo, lol, you see 
14:17 < Savander> and that's cool :D
14:17 <@EastByte> someone could basically make a gravatar for teeworlds
14:17 <@deen> i don't think it's ok to make little kids addicted to a game and then take their money
14:18 <@EastByte> sure it's not okay
14:18 <@EastByte> but that's how it works
14:18 <@deen> some friend of my brother paid hundreds of euros for skins and stuff
14:18 < Savander> their pay for work
14:18 < Savander> why it's not okay?
14:18 <@EastByte> people without conscience can abuse that easily
14:19 <@deen> Savander: it's ok if you pay first, then play the game (forever)
14:19 <@deen> but they bate kids with a free game and then when they are addicted they need to pay to get better etc
14:19 < Savander> it's okay to pay for skins. If you can't do it yourself 
14:19 < Savander> And you want a custom skin, visible in game
14:19 < Savander> you just pay for it
14:19 <@deen> well, the skins thing is just useless, i don't know why people pay for it^^
14:19 < Savander> their decision
14:19 < Savander> to be "better"
14:20 < Savander> stand out in community
14:20 <@deen> Savander: yeah, skin is not as bad. play-to-win is worse
14:20 <@deen> pay*
14:20 <@deen> play-to-win is fine :P
14:21 < Savander> xDD
14:21 < Savander> hahahha
14:21 < Savander> ye, i don't like pay to win too
14:21 <@deen> I really like Minecraft's model
14:21 <@deen> where you pay once and get an account that you can use forever and have no more costs
14:21 <@deen> even though the game is highly addictive and could easily make much more money
14:22 < Savander> ye
14:23 < Savander> but now, minecraft is under microsoft
14:23 < Savander> they want to release new "minecrafT"
14:23 < Savander> 1. minecraft 10 - 10€ 
14:23 < Savander> for windows 10
14:23 < Learath2> good people dont make money :P
14:23 < Savander> xD
14:24 < Learath2> I hosted the most pay to win Arma 2 Epoch server for a while
14:24 < Savander> Tibia
14:24 < Savander> Metin 2
14:24 < Savander> if you want something faster!
14:24 < Savander> PAY FOR IT!
14:24 <@deen> Savander: maybe MS can make minecraft their new UI when they remove Metro again
14:24 < Learath2> ofc until one of the admins leaked my scripts after then no money was made
14:25 <@EastByte> so you made money
14:25 <@EastByte> and you are not 'good'
14:25 < Learath2> mwhahahah
14:25 < Savander> what is bad in making money haha
14:25 < Learath2> well someone needs to pay the server bills
14:25 < Savander> people are stupid
14:25 < Learath2> deen: if you want a official ts server i do have one thats generally staffed
14:25 <@deen> Learath2: nah
14:25 <@deen> but thanks
14:26 <@deen> people always ask me to come on TS, i don't like TS :P
14:26 < Savander> :>
14:26 < Savander> you not?
14:26 < Learath2> I prefer mumble but community pressure made us move to ts 
14:26 <@EastByte> ^
14:27 < Savander> i saw you on teamspeak, several times :>
14:27 < Savander> And you was with us! 
14:27 < Savander> were*
14:27 < Savander> you were*
14:27 < Savander> xD
14:30 <@deen> lies lies lies :P
14:31 < Savander> :c
14:31 <@EastByte> c:
14:31 < Savander> din
14:31 <@deen> Â°ÍœÂ°
14:33 < Savander> ^^
14:38 < Learath2> https://gist.github.com/ccd286644522c18e7731
14:39 < Learath2> anything else you think could happen on irc ? :D
14:39 <@deen> don't know irc well enough to know anything else
14:39 < Learath2> well should be good enough
14:40 <@deen> sure, can always extend it later i guess
14:40 < Learath2> just need to implement some methods to allow the plugin to interact with the bot now
14:42 < Savander> deen, you should repair this map or something :P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVUab8ecX50
14:42 <@deen> don't understand how it's bugged
14:42 < Savander> look later
14:42 < Savander> 1.5
14:42 < Savander> 1 minut 30
14:43 <@deen> still don't understand what happened there
14:43 < Savander> tele + death in same place
14:44 < Savander> don't kill you if you have enough speed
14:44 <@deen> ah
14:44 <@deen> that's bad
14:44 < Savander> yes
14:44 < Savander> we bugged it, (not only we)
14:44 < Savander> onion .me probably too
14:44 < Savander> he has 1 minut 50 seconds as well.
14:45 <@deen> ah, i hate that yt plays another video after one ends
14:46 < Savander> sorry
14:46 <@deen> always scares me because i'm on another screen/tab^^
14:46 < Savander> xd
14:46 < Savander> you can disable it
14:46 < Savander> right corner "Autoplay"
14:46 < Savander> rigght top corner
14:46 < Savander> on "similar videos"
14:46 < Savander> oh, no
14:47 < Savander> in "Up next" section
14:47 <@EastByte> deen: how to enable the old /pause mode?
14:47 <@deen> EastByte: sv_pauseable 1 and use /spec
14:48 <@EastByte> okay thanks
14:48 <@deen> mapper choice whether to enable it on ddnet
14:48 <@deen> i don't like it
14:48 <@deen> the russians probably still hate me for disabling it by default
14:48 < Savander> :D
14:48 < Savander> deen,  you should remove some rankings
14:48 < Savander> on this map then
14:49 < Savander> 8 are cheated
14:49 < Savander> 8 ranks
14:49 <@deen> yes, but i don't know how to fix it and which are cheated
14:49 < Savander> come here
14:49 < Learath2> should have seen when we first added the new pause as /spec then removed the old pause
14:49 < Learath2> oh the shitstorm
14:49 <@deen> Savander: a bit busy with other stuff
14:49 < Savander> just put kill title
14:49 < Savander> around teleport
14:49 < Savander> tille*
15:27 <@EastByte> QuintessenZ official map is coming
15:27 <@EastByte> every member of the clan made some parts
15:27 <@EastByte> except me
15:36 <@deen> nice
15:37 <@deen> i finally got around to fix all my mail stuff
15:37 <@deen> getting full score on anti-spam measures for my outgoing mail
15:38 <@deen> my incoming mail spam filter is learning again
15:38 <@deen> and i get a mail when a cronjob on any ddnet server fails
15:46 <@EastByte> you are hosting mail still on your own?
15:47 <@deen> yep and now it finally works :P
15:47 <@deen> (perfetly i mean)
15:48 <@deen> perfectly*
15:48 <@EastByte> oh that's possible? :P
15:48 <@EastByte> I probably will never set up and smtp server because I'm afraid of it
15:51 <@deen> EastByte: there are some simple guides where you have to install 50 packages and edit 100 config files and then it kind of works until you figure out 20 typos in the guide and 10 things that have been deprecated in the last 6 months
15:52 <@deen> but it can't be worse than my other email account which is at united-internet
15:52 <@deen> they let all spam through and put my actual mails into spam filter...
15:54 <@EastByte> sounds promising
15:55 <@EastByte> I just use my mailbox at the domain provider gandi.net
15:55 <@EastByte> there you have 5 free mailboxes per domain
15:56 <@EastByte> but I think it also lets everthing through, which is how it should be?
15:57 <@EastByte> I mean how do you want to register on a website like baumalein.de were the activation mail has no source^^
15:57 <@EastByte> where*
15:57 < Learath2> I set up my mailserver then forgot i cancelled the vps i set it up on
15:57 < Learath2> result lost all config
15:57 <@deen> EastByte: on ddnet forum i disabled the need to click on activation mail^^
15:58 <@EastByte> that's good
15:58 <@deen> no spammer ever get through the forum's ingenious spam protection
15:58 <@deen> with our two great questions: "What does TW stand for?" and "What does DDNet stand for?"
16:39 <@deen> Should I wait for https://letsencrypt.org/ or is there a good free CA right now?
16:43 <@EastByte> no, please wait
16:45 <@EastByte> waiting some further months won't be so hard for ddnet.tw
16:47 <@deen> right, the only bad thing is the forum where you enter your password unencrypted
16:47 <@deen> or with my self-signed cert
17:06 < Nimda_6518> Regen 3 by Gridwyn just released on Brutal at 2015-07-14 17:00
17:08 <@deen> if someone wants to code sth: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1797&p=18757#p18757
17:11 < Sadale> lol "This isn't the sense of creating and sharing skins, at least not for me."
17:12 < Sadale> agreed. Others can't view your new skin :(
17:13 <@EastByte> I just want every player to look unique
17:13 <@EastByte> the only way to do this is using normal skins + custom color
17:13 < Sadale> It's a flaw of teeworlds. :(
17:14 < Sadale> Teeworlds should automatically download custom skin of other players
17:14 <@EastByte> well a bit different in 0.7
17:14 <@deen> Sadale: eeeee has a patch so that you can download new skins via http from ddnet's skin database
17:14 < Sadale> EastByte, you heard some news of 0.7 ?
17:14 <@deen> so if he makes a PR we'll have that in ddnet soon
17:14 <@EastByte> 'it's coming this year'
17:14 < Sadale> deen, cool!
17:15 <@deen> EastByte: i thought about it, if TW goes to 0.7 and then gets released on steam, we wouldn't get any of the steam players at all
17:15 <@EastByte> orly :D
17:15 <@EastByte> we need the bridge then
17:15 <@deen> well, most new players never unselect the "default gametypes only" anyway
17:15 <@deen> so they'll stop playing TW before they discover ddnet
17:16 <@EastByte> casual gamers probably
17:16 <@deen> no, also people who would love ddnet but don't love TW the same way
17:16 <@deen> i played tw for maaaaany years before discovering ddrace
17:16 <@deen> and i only discovered it because i was playing at night and no one was online on vanilla and ictf
17:16 <@deen> and the only server with players was ddmax
17:17 <@EastByte> for ictf you already need filters disabled
17:17 <@deen> yeah, i still never played ddrace^^
17:18 <@deen> i think it didn't exist when i found ictf
17:18 <@EastByte> hm we are different then
17:18 <@EastByte> I always played with filter settings
17:19 <@EastByte> (turning it on and off)
17:19 <@EastByte> and I guess I tested multiple mods
17:20 <@deen> cool, finally set it up to proxy my ssh connection to ddnet china over ddnet.tw
17:21 <@deen> because i noticed that i have 50-80% packet loss from home, but 0% from ddnet.tw
17:21 <@deen> now i don't have to wait 10 minutes to ssh connect anymore!
17:25  * Sadale is closer than EastByte compared with deen 
17:25  * Sadale played with filter setting. That's how he discovered cities :3
17:26 < Sadale> Oh. I still remember the day the people use ctf as a race mod.
17:26 < Sadale> s/mod/map/
17:26 < Sadale> They use flags as a goal. They also somehow invented dummy drag.
17:27 <@deen> Sadale: yeah, i also remember watching pros race ctf maps many years ago
17:27 <@deen> i always sucked at that myself
17:27 < Sadale> I came to teeworlds is late ctf-race era. After I came to teeworlds, ctf race maps disappear quickly and race mod spawns.
17:27 < Sadale> deen, same here.
17:27 < Sadale> When I played dummy drag for the first time, I had no idea what I was doing. I just see there's a tee hanging around suddenly got down. Then we enter there and gets up/
17:28 < Sadale> Completely had no idea why the dummy could goes down :p
17:31 <@EastByte> I remember that when I played mods, many servers were hosted at home
17:32 <@EastByte> high pings everywhere
17:32 <@EastByte> and the fact that there is no client side freeze prediction...
17:34 <@deen> nowadays players consider the lack of freeze prediction a feature =/
17:35 <@deen> you can use it to feel your ping
17:36 <@EastByte> "feel your ping" haha
17:36 <@EastByte> it feels awesome to have <40ms :P
17:37 <@EastByte> back then people with 16k adsl were the kings
17:38 < Sadale> EastByte, well, ping is still high everywhere for me.
17:38 < Sadale> teeworlds is an eurocentered game. It sucks in Hong King.
17:39 < Sadale> EastByte, BTW, I remember that 24/7 server was a feature. It's important for a city to success.
17:42 <@EastByte> well, WolfAlex <- this guy had a vps and hosted my server back then
17:47 < WolfAlex> :D
17:58 < Sadale> cool!
17:59 < Sadale> EastByte, I hosted my server on my own desktop computer. It shutdowns when I shutdown my computer :p
17:59 <@deen> Sadale: that's the best for testing maps
18:00 <@deen> when you're logged into rcon and save the map in editor, it's reloaded automatically
18:00 < Sadale> deen, well, I did that for a, uh, city for production.
18:00 <@deen> ^^
18:00 < Sadale> aka non-testing maps
18:02 < Sadale> Now it's a bit better. I got a raspberry pi home server :3
18:03 <@EastByte> I also have a pi running 24/7
18:03 < Sadale> The original purpose of my RPI was for the server of my own game. Before RPI, I hosted my game server on a spare samsung phone :p
18:03 < Sadale> EastByte, same here
18:03 <@EastByte> pretty nice for tw servers actually
18:03 <@EastByte> haha
18:03 < Sadale> true. The server load of tw is pretty low. lower than I thought
18:03 < Sadale> Actually, I'm a bit worried that my pi may get hacked :(
18:05 < Sadale> I'm now putting all eggs into a single basket. Guess what? I've recently connected my RPI to a printer. so if the RPI got hacked, the hacker can waste my ink by printer black papers :p
18:05 < Sadale> jk. It won't print if I don't put paper on it
18:06 <@EastByte> reminds me of I wanted to set up my thermal printer
18:08 <@deen> last year edis had the cool action where you could colocate your rasperry pi for free
18:08 <@EastByte> there are still providers doing this for free I think
18:08 <@deen> cool
18:08 <@EastByte> but the location is not always promising
18:09 <@deen> i want edis in chile again, but they don't have free servers =/
18:09 <@deen> they are so cheap, it's crazy
18:09 <@deen> but they used to shut down my server when it got 100 kbit/s incoming
18:09 <@deen> now i asked per mail and they say they don't know anything about that
18:13 <@EastByte> 100 kbit/s?
18:14 <@EastByte> is that even enough bandwidth for 2 players?
18:17 < KinG_> hey
18:17 < Sadale> EastByte, probably enough
18:17 < Sadale> EastByte, But not 3
18:46 < KinG_> Heavy ddos on persian
18:46 < KinG_> damn
18:51 < Sadale> KinG_, how do you guys deal with ddos?
18:51 < KinG_> just want to install a firewall now
18:51 < KinG_> nothing ^^
18:56 <@deen> KinG_: firewall doesn't help against ddos
18:56 < KinG_> these noobs in iran dunno how to ddos
18:56 <@deen> not sure how often i have to tell you
18:56 < KinG_> they just send packets
18:56 <@deen> yes, but if your network gets deactivated, software firewall has 0 use
18:56 < KinG_> i can fix this against iranian attackers
18:56 < KinG_> but not real ddosers that attack ddnet
18:57 < KinG_> deen i'm gonna restart server
18:57 < KinG_> i can't reach it
19:11 <@EastByte> ^.^
19:21 < KinG_> EastByte: i restarted server and why still game servers are not running and server isn't on ddnet.tw/status
19:21 < KinG_> ?!
19:21 < KinG_> ah nvm deen is bac
19:21 < KinG_> back*
19:21 <@deen> i fucked up a bit^^
19:22 < KinG_> nvm shit happens :)
19:23 < KinG_> at least now ppl from iran can't flood port 80 ^^
19:23 < KinG_> oh
19:23 < KinG_> my
19:23 < KinG_> GOD
19:23 < KinG_> csf takes this much ram?!
19:27 < KinG_> i'm glad that firewall stopped these noob iranian kids sending packets
20:44 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

21:30 < Learath2> deen: timeout protection bugged out i have two leareath2s here
21:31 <@deen> that's bad. i'm not sure why that sometimes happens
21:35 < Learath2> Any idea what is a easy map i can teach basic stuff on ?
21:37 < KinG_> basics by .me
21:38 < KinG_> Learath2: or probably 2easy
21:39 <@deen> Kobra 2 :P
21:39 <@deen> mainly because it's not faily
21:39 < Learath2> no way he is finishing a Kobra map
21:39 <@deen> I've seen total noobs finishing a kobra map within 2-3 days of practice :P
21:40 < Learath2> deen: there seems to be a bug when switching maps and having a dummy connected
21:40 <@deen> There's also 4Nubs
21:40 <@deen> Just2easy, GoldMine
21:40 <@deen> Learath2: what bug?
21:41 < Learath2> SIGSEGV
21:41 <@deen> ouch, reproducable?
21:41 <@deen> can you get it within gdb and client_debug version?
21:42 < Learath2> ill do it in a sec
21:42 < Learath2> it was on win64
21:42 < Learath2> both me and my friend experienced it
21:43 < KinG_> there is also a bug, sometimes hen i change to my dummy i can't hear sounds of hooking unhookable or hookable
21:43 < KinG_> when*
21:44 < Learath2> also there is a map called Easy 1 which isnt easy
21:46 < KinG_> Learath2: basics is the map u are looking for
