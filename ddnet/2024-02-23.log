00:30 < bridge> <miguilim> Because we already have a way to encode strings into a packet. However, someone invented a way to encode string converting to ints just to have a fixed size to just to use in ONE snap item
00:31 < bridge> <zhn> one?
00:31 < bridge> <zhn> its used for datafile
00:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> Oh, you about this
00:32 < bridge> <zhn> and any other strings in protocol though
00:33 < bridge> <miguilim> so why we are using on network?
00:33 < bridge> <miguilim> no
00:33 < bridge> <kekomonter> How I remember no
00:33 < bridge> <miguilim> thats not how you code strings
00:33 < bridge> <kekomonter> CPacker have AddString
00:33 < bridge> <miguilim> to send a string in a control message, a chunk value or anything else you just encode the letter with a null terminator
00:34 < bridge> <miguilim> yes, exactly, and this is not the StrToInts in the printscreen
00:34 < bridge> <miguilim> the addString is this
00:34 < bridge> <miguilim> to send a string in a control message, a chunk value or anything else you just encode the letters with a null terminator
00:35 < bridge> <miguilim> but for cleint info snap info, you need to encode into multiple integers
00:35 < bridge> <miguilim> and will need to use this object structure XD
00:35 < bridge> <miguilim> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210369380232200303/image.png?ex=65ea4f53&is=65d7da53&hm=194a5b533c47c9b232c7990927e8e286119f0a3857bb6d2eef8db686553ce47a&
00:36 < bridge> <miguilim> no, we dont have 4 names here. We have 4 fragments of a name XDDDDDDDDDD
00:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I didn’t know that was possible. Never.
00:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> For now the target audience is devs not players. The official tw binaries work okay enough. But the code is full of compile warnings and stuff like that. I do not plan to build a competing project. Just a temporary thing to get in some merges.
00:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good to me but docker system prune -a should also do. Anyways don’t use docker it sucks. If you have to use podman at least.
00:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> iirc one of those was crucial in 0.6 I forgot which but either game data or game info is something you want to send a lot.
00:52 < bridge> <miguilim> :thonk:
00:52 < bridge> <miguilim> client info I need to send only one time, and when update?
00:53 < bridge> <miguilim> obj_character_core and event_sound_global are never sent as snap items
00:53 < bridge> <miguilim> 13 and 18
00:57 < bridge> <miguilim> can you confirm this?
01:00 < bridge> <miguilim> obj_character_core, event_common and event_sound_global are never sent as snap items
01:00 < bridge> <miguilim> 8, 13 and 18
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea idk sorry i only translated a snap successfully so far client side. I build a snap server side like 2 days ago and it is not working :c
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But keep me posted maybe i finally realize whats wrong with my snap
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh wait i didnt fully read the quesiton lol
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> yes so obj\_character\_core is not sent i think thats a base class. So is event\_common. The others just inherit from that.
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sound global i would have to check
01:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So 8 is not sent but it is included in 9  https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/snap_items.html#obj_character
04:17 < bridge> <miguilim> from what I can see, the sound global is sent as a SV chunk and then mocked to the netobject by the client
04:17 < bridge> <miguilim> I just wrote the documentation about snaps
04:17 < bridge> <miguilim> check:
04:17 < bridge> <miguilim> 
04:17 < bridge> <miguilim> https://protocol-docs.teeframe.com/packets/default-packets.html
04:17 < bridge> <miguilim> https://protocol-docs.teeframe.com/snap/snap-structure.html
04:18 < bridge> <miguilim> the thing is that everything in your snap header must be right, check the infos about CRC, Size, Removed Items Count and Delta Items Count
04:19 < bridge> <miguilim> the only thing I'm unsure is about the Removed Items Count (I'm not really sure if its related to the last snap sent or something else) and Delta Items Count (idk if its just the current items count in the snap)
04:20 < bridge> <miguilim> however, you can try just spamming a snap single chunk with obj_game_info and obj_player_info with 0 removed items and 2 delta chunks (and everything else correct)
04:20 < bridge> <miguilim> after the initial handshake, the client will understand you as a server and will move you to the game screen
04:21 < bridge> <miguilim> I'm doing this after inital handshake
04:21 < bridge> <miguilim> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210426115156475934/image.png?ex=65ea842a&is=65d80f2a&hm=c627a0ae47a2a8f43b110bcb92f71bfacb91e5a93676193bbfcae16566056e14&

04:22 < bridge> <miguilim> also give some feedbacks if you find something wrong or unclear :owo:
04:25 < bridge> <miguilim> yes, but from a point of view of the protocol, number 8 is unused. The message id never touches the network and only exists on the teeworlds official implementation
04:26 < bridge> <miguilim> I marked 0, 1, 8, 13, 18 as unused on my listing (https://protocol-docs.teeframe.com/snap/snap-items.html)
04:55 < bridge> <miguilim> Another thing I'm trying to figure out is why there is a MAX_SNAPSHOT_PACKSIZE (900 value). Why we just dont use the 1400 maximum packet size to decide if we need to split the snap?
04:55 < bridge> <miguilim> The thing is that value is also used on client. So I cant just not use it
04:56 < bridge> <miguilim> Another thing I'm trying to figure out is why there is a MAX_SNAPSHOT_PACKSIZE (900) value. Why we just dont use the 1400 maximum packet size to decide if we need to split the snap?
04:59 < bridge> <miguilim> Another thing I'm trying to figure out is why there is a MAX_SNAPSHOT_PACKSIZE (900) value. Why we just dont use the 1400 - (things we send) maximum packet size to decide if we need to split the snap?

10:18 < bridge> <teero777> Can you fix my bug problem?
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is your bug problem
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Fridays for rust
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> It's illegal robot talk so I can't ;(
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use asan
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And tsan
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> It's logic bug...
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What's hard then
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And some logging
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> See where the value gets wrong
10:21 < bridge> <teero777> My head can't find a way to implement something some way that doesn't require a threadripper
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U have a bottleneck
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then you are at the right address
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I make your code the fastest
10:22 < bridge> <teero777> Well no xD I just can't think of a way to solve my problem efficiently.
10:23 < bridge> <teero777> Has do with rating organisms while simultaneously having multiple goals.
10:28 < bridge> <teero777> My rating is fucked and I have no clue how to get it right.
10:28 < bridge> <teero777> I could implement a bruteforce solution but that would be a 25x slowdown which I cannot afford
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Efficiency is not the key. Throw your 32 threads on your problem
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And 64 GB RAM

11:16 < bridge> <.rafaelff> @miguilim PM me please? (Your settings forbid me from starting it)
12:48 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> @kaffeine0 I don't want to merge my own pr -.- could you add https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds/pull/61 to the merge queue pls. Ideally before I go to sleep
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or jopsti u go if you have 1min to look at the change :3 
12:50 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Is it possible to merge a MR with CI failed? I thought we'd have CI fixed before merging something.
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no its not possible
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> PR ☝️ 🤓
12:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 😄 the best approach ever 😄
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kaffeine0 but only the jobs i activated to be required to pass
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since half of the jobs fail due to the cmake issue its only 2 jobs that need to pass for now. Thats why im pussing #61  so much
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks babe
12:53 < bridge> <robyt3> I found out it's also possible to re-run only individual jobs that failed, so you don't need to force push to refresh if only macOS CI is acting up again
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye ik thats epic
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use rerun more than i would like to admit 
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> robsti wats your opinion on teeworlds-community?
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1708689299.png watafak is going on now
12:59 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think I have the time and motivation to contribute code or large reviews to teeworlds-community. Seems good if you keep the scope low any only fix build issues and bugs. I'd consider most refactoring out of scope though.
13:01 < bridge> <robyt3> For build/CI failures I'd look at the difference between teeworlds and DDNet and then cherry-pick the relevant commits
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Robyte is already team dd pg
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is teeworlds community
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0.7 maintained by the community xd
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> just use ddnet 4head
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If we'd have website etc would be cool. But as is, I also find it useless xdd
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Official website and steam

13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Have you ever ran into performance issues playing that game, eg with a lot of entities on the map or smth
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> some ppl do with megabases but its hard to hit
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> people make crazy stuff since there is no limit

13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> hard to grasp how big is this cuz this is the map look
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Interesting, does it then use all cores?
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs yes
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> read their blogs
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> they rly care about perf
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and nice code
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think belts are indeed threaded
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks >  Factorio is primarily limited by cache misses - which is why the (otherwise rather mediocre) 5800X3D and its enormous L3 cache dominates your linked benchmark.

14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 yea thats my plan to cherry pick ddnet fixes to get the build passing. Some of the more motivated ppl might have more ambitious plans lets see how long until i rq from democracy. Yea i assumed youd be busy but ye if you ever feel like approving a pr that would be pog.
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki yea i did not invite you or deen since i assumed you have no interest at all in the teeworlds code base. Let me know if you want write access.

17:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> in ddnet code base? 😏
17:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> time to add textures, woo... im pretty sure it will be fun
17:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: you are really close to jsfiddle for tw graphics :3
17:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea, i also have thought about that
17:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pls do
17:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i would need to make ui
17:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> sounds not fun at all
17:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but i think when i make Graphics class it wont be that bad after
17:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mean an editor?
17:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Use monaco editor it’s vscode as js lib
17:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The rest of the ui is just the canvas
17:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i mean.. basically im rewriting teeworlds graphics in js
17:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
17:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s what I almost did
17:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just to build a fiddle

19:33 < bridge> <miguilim> You say in your documentation that snap items have sizes. However, we send ints inside the items, and ints does not have fixed sizes
19:35 < bridge> <miguilim> Ex. obj_projectile size is 6, however m_X can use 2,3,4 bytes to encode it value
19:35 < bridge> <miguilim> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210656250862370947/image.png?ex=65eb5a7f&is=65d8e57f&hm=7f7235bd295277e8c6aaa173ec26b6b998132e9c42092876f2eed303392c9e06&
19:35 < bridge> <miguilim> Or no? O.o
19:40 < bridge> <miguilim> Or not? O.o Idk if I'm missing something here
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> All ints are 4 bytes in snapshots
21:02 < bridge> <miguilim> hmmmmmmmmmm I didnt confirmed but from what I tested this is actually not true
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> I really doubt we used packed integers for the contents of the snapobjects but there is a slight possibility that I'm misremembering
21:05 < bridge> <miguilim> This is the ChillerDragon lib example
21:05 < bridge> <miguilim> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210678742670905344/image.png?ex=65eb6f71&is=65d8fa71&hm=33ac5d8d61e95014de554029b3cb02af9b3cfc66277a4f4ca24e0022c479726b&
21:05 < bridge> <miguilim> You see game_start_tick is 00 -> 0, x is 90 0c -> 784 and so on
21:06 < bridge> <miguilim> tick is 9b 13 -> 1243
21:06 < bridge> <miguilim> :thonk:
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> You'll see everywhere in the code that we use `sizeof(int32_t)` to iterate through the snapshot though :/
21:08 < bridge> <miguilim> yes, thats why is so confusing
21:08 < bridge> <miguilim> whoops
21:08 < bridge> <miguilim> just found
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we do pack them but then unpack them very early and I'm just forgetting that?
21:08 < bridge> <miguilim> when the server sends the snapshot, it compress
21:08 < bridge> <miguilim> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210679632412803102/image.png?ex=65eb7045&is=65d8fb45&hm=e62dad7c266438e16e24a74193389416bb20cda7a590eb5cd3d740f692b18c16&
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yep that would make sense
21:08 < bridge> <miguilim> the aCompData is passed by reference and altered inside the function
21:09 < bridge> <miguilim> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210679744748851261/image.png?ex=65eb7060&is=65d8fb60&hm=d6a92a8fe271b70604eb3bb5a8d0c04b721c9ae272d55566cb12862b367faa49&
21:09 < bridge> <miguilim> correct if im wrong XD
21:09 < bridge> <learath2> Soo when you get a snap, first thing you should probably do is to unpack so you can work with nice 4 byte ints all over
21:10 < bridge> <miguilim> :yeauhuhok:
21:11 < bridge> <miguilim> So the snap having a fixed size is a wrong assumption from a protocol perspective right?
21:11 < bridge> <learath2> Yes that sounds wrong, most snap items however do have fixed size
21:13 < bridge> <miguilim> :thonk: but they only have fixed size in the code, not in the encoded packet that is sent
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, so more exactly, most snap items have fixed size after they get unpacked
21:13 < bridge> <cyberfighter> fddrace, @fokkonaut switches arent shown, bug or intended?
21:13 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210680895703617638/image.png?ex=65eb7172&is=65d8fc72&hm=960f9cb481e5190750acebafbe8980ac115b6fbd896415e987171c76df41b2b0&
21:13 < bridge> <miguilim> :pepeglasses:
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> on the level of what ends up on the wire, you can't really say anything about sizes
21:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> they should, if not maybe a client update fucked something up
21:14 < bridge> <miguilim> Now everything is more clear, thanks for the help mate
21:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont know about recent client history
21:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> im in a kinda newish version
21:17 < bridge> <robyt3> Does it work again after you disconnect and rejoin, or after you restart the client entirely?
21:17 < bridge> <cyberfighter> disconnect rejoin doesnt fix it
21:17 < bridge> <cyberfighter> its never shown
21:17 < bridge> <cyberfighter> it used to be shown before on other client versions
21:19 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok i updated to latest nightly and its still broken
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Likely caused by #7979
21:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7979
21:20 < bridge> <cyberfighter> is there nightly before that pull i can download to check? or i dont need to
21:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like switch layer is not rendered anymore when `m_GameInfo.m_DontMaskEntities` is `true`
21:21 < bridge> <robyt3> @fokkonaut I assume you send this flag on your servers then?
21:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye, its required in order to show tiles which are non Default
21:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It was added by Heinrich Back then
21:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> for this purpose
21:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Shouldn't we just always render the switch layer if it exists? Kinda weird to render it only when DDNet and DDrace types are set
21:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye

22:39 < bridge> <peter44h> I have to agree it goes hard
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> Hey, I'm trying to cross-compile DDNet to MacOS from Linux. I got osxcross installed with MacOS 11.1 SDK. My issue is that CMake complains about SQLite3 not being installed, so I'm wondering if anyone knows how to do this?
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> 
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> ```
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> cmake -DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/darwin-x86_64.toolchain -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=../../osxcross/target/SDK/MacOSX11.1.sdk/ ..
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> 
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:638 (message):
22:53 < bridge> <furo321>   You must install SQLite3 to compile DDNet
22:53 < bridge> <furo321> ```
23:03 < bridge> <peter44h> Looks like there is no sqlite3 for mac provided as a bundled lib
23:03 < bridge> <peter44h> you could try building and installing it into the sysroot so the CMakeLists.txt of DDNet can find it
23:05 < bridge> <peter44h> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/tree/sqlite3
23:05 < bridge> <peter44h> there's no "mac" directory here
23:05 < bridge> <peter44h> personally I wonder why not just put an sqlite source file and build it? it's totally trivial
23:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> deen is always compiling nativly on mac right? i've yet to see one person actually cross compile to that
23:08 < bridge> <peter44h> yeah it's a bit nontrivial to do it
23:08 < bridge> <peter44h> I've never done it before
23:09 < bridge> <peter44h> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/tree/master/sqlite3
23:09 < bridge> <peter44h> there's no "mac" directory here
23:11 < bridge> <peter44h> looking at the commits here I see:
23:11 < bridge> <peter44h> > Revert "Remove sqlite3 on macOS since it's part of system"
23:11 < bridge> <peter44h> but it got deleted in the next commit:
23:11 < bridge> <peter44h> > Update libs
23:11 < bridge> <peter44h> which seems like it's (maybe?) a mistake?
23:11 < bridge> <peter44h> this is from 2 years ago though
23:13 < bridge> <peter44h> could the part about "part of system" be true? since I think otherwise someone would have noticed
23:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> youtube, you drunk, go home
23:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210715666597023864/image.png?ex=65eb91d4&is=65d91cd4&hm=f40aff48b3814faa5344dc67e498a0731d2353e001c8c9f287638e1ccc4c3948&
23:34 < bridge> <peter44h> okay, for some reason sqlite only provides an autotools configure script
23:34 < bridge> <peter44h> You *might* be able to cross-compile sqlite3 like this:
23:34 < bridge> <peter44h> `CC=target-triple-idk-clang ./configure --prefix=<wherever darwin-x86_64.toolchain specifies> --host=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`
23:34 < bridge> <peter44h> `make install`
23:34 < bridge> <peter44h> though autotools is so bad and flaky this may well not work
23:58 < bridge> <peter44h> I would try myself but it seems this osxcross requires an apple account to download build tools or whatever
23:58 < bridge> <peter44h> I can't do that
