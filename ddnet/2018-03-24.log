00:58 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> dunno. same as ever I guess
00:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I've been running it since 2002
00:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I like the customisability
00:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> never having to hunt for "-dev" or "-src" or "-dbg"
01:10 <+Learath2> I use gentoo on all the systems I have physical access to. Never thought of installing it on a server
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the thing that stops me from using gentoo is that I fear that I'd let software go outdated because I don't want to compile it
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's really snappy except for chromium and libreoffice tbh
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the ck-kernel is really good at leaving the computer usable during compilations üòÉ
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chromium (or firefox) is really the dealbreaker here, right?
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Firefox is like 15-20 mins for me, chromium is just outright ridicukous
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think around an hour for chromium but you can get google-chrome or chromium-bin if you are okay with not compiling that one
01:59 < Edible> freebsd has a package manager, you can probably install flatpak or w\e
01:59 < Edible> can you use snappy or flatpak on gentoo? (and does firefox/chromium have it)
02:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I still compile seamonkey on this pathetic little server
02:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> firefox only on the desktop. but probably is about the same
02:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> chromium, even assuming I had any desire to have it, hah.
02:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> yeah, chromium in gentoo is an exercise in masochism
02:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> not to mention while it's compiling you're probably running chromium on the desktop and already half your memory evaporated right there ‚ò∫
02:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: it's not like compiling takes that long usually. apart from libreoffice/seamonkey on the desktop
02:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: even then, eh. fire it off in the evening, check back in the morning.
02:08 <@heinrich5991> computer is next to bed
02:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and... the HD is noisy? √¢Àú¬∫
02:08 <@heinrich5991> no
02:08 <@heinrich5991> the fan
02:09 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ah
02:09 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I bought a cheap water cooling kit ages ago for the tower
02:09 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> made such a huge diff
02:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I initially bought it 'cause unc0rr and crew had built a sand glitcher in our minecraft world which was running my CPU hot 24/7
02:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> aaaand add on to that me connecting into the world as a player and kaboom
02:27 < Edible> i mean, why not install a package?
02:27 < Edible> just do that
02:27 < Edible> its such a hassle for basically no purpose
04:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> customisation. and as noted easy access to dev/src/dbg 
04:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> also getting a new version or fixing/patching is fairly trivial
04:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and the -9999 packages can be useful
04:10 < Edible> you're gonna mess with the chromium source?
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> is necropotame not here
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=6058 the vote got even :O
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> rigged
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> emojis back again! xD
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cool lets waste sum more time adding and removing emojis again instead of making bot detection
09:54 <@deen> I stopped running Gentoo on my laptop when the fan failed because of always compiling stuff :D
10:25 <+Learath2> nemo: I need to have chromium for working with react-native
10:26 <+Learath2> I love how you get to strip packages of useless features in gentoo
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But yeah there is no stripping down a program so bloated as chromium, I don't even know how that thing is able to run üòõ
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> no emojis -.-
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> pleeeeeeaaaaaaase
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo does someone know how to let python control a other script? I was already abel to pipe the output of the script into the py script and python recives all data fine but how do i sent the data back from the python script to the other script
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IPC is the same in any language
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sockets, named pipes, shared memory, you can also abuse the stdout of the second script
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how do i abuse the stdou
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ou fuck i ripped my terminal
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can i modify my .bash_profile without terminal ?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yay got my terminal back ‚ù§ but still no clue how to abuse the stdout of the script or any of the other things
13:59 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon python should have a way of redirecting stdin and stdout of the newly launched process
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it does
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> things to look at are the stdin parameter and the stdout parameter
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon what are you tring to do? üôÇ
14:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1091: Add infrastructure for preserving bugs (master...pr_ddnet_mapbugs) https://git.io/vxBSz
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Do I understand it good that binary got the old physics back?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the tunezone with immediately exploding grenades in binary gets the old double-explosion back
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah check
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> GG wp
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 some econ stuff for vanilla (fake semi legal vanilla modding u know xd)
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo is tehre a shortcut to refresh a fucked terminal?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mine went fully crazy
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure i am going to archive this multiple times so a shortcut instead of reopening the application would be usefull
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon `reset` or `tput reset`
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stty sane worked for me c:
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i use a weird triple pipe now
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ./nc.exp | ./mod.py | ./mod.py
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesn't look too weird üòõ
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ./nc.exp | ./mod.py | ./nc.exp
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it does i have two netcat connections
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> one for input and one for output.. but one could be enough i guess because it can handle both theoretically
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm i just realized there is not too much gameplay information in this econ log wasnt there a server who tracks the kills via econ? Where do i get the information about kills?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> econ should get the kills
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i netcat to the econ port and kill somebody i dont see it in the log
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it gets the entire console output iirc, we do see kills in the console
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it seems like econ only gets the same stuff the rcon admins get ingame
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interesting, do we have some verbosity settings somewhere?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought admins do get the entire log anyways
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> admins dont get kills lol
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this would be too spammy
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the log does get kills `[2018-03-23 18:51:48][game]: kill killer='28:Cendren' victim='28:Cendren' weapon=-2 special=0`
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ye true
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the log
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but not the f2 console
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and econ doesnt seem to get the entire log
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interesting
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sad
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can get a headless client and have it in spec to track stuff
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or pipe the server output to your script instead
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats smart
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pipe the server output
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have this tripple pipe anyways
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just replace the first ./nc.exp with ./tw_sv
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ur so smart @Learath2 ty
17:42 <+Learath2> crafty sure, there are plenty smarter then me :)
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Julian ‚òÅ> I luv Devtalk
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Julian ‚òÅ> Guess the client is coded in C++
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> u
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> need C+= tw client
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are you new to teewoods @Julian ‚òÅ ?

18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no girls in the internet
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> all fake news
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> I'm suprised no one pointed out that I assumed her gender based on her name
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> #girlsonline
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> who doesn‚Äôt know girls named Julian
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> ü§î
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> "girlsonline" sounds like a porn website
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Julian ‚òÅ> @ChillerDragon I have been around since 2015 I think
