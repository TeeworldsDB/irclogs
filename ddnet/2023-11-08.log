08:07 < bridge> <teero777> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i agree that everything before 2016 is dark ages
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no vulkan no life
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> no modern rust too
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
11:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is there a job title for people who just write documentations?
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "To be replaced"
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> By gpt
11:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it for coding documentation
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or like a physical product
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like the "Getting Started" stuff
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh dunno
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Technical writer if it's technical
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else maybe instruction designer
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just put engineer in the end xdd
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess there isn't then
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How to engineer
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Documentation engineer
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
11:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Documentation Technical Artist
11:58 < bridge> <axel_vestin> Eyyo whats up
11:58 < bridge> <axel_vestin> I was wondering if there are some easy bugs for first-time contributors to do
11:58 < bridge> <axel_vestin> 
11:58 < bridge> <axel_vestin> I know C++ and i have some experience as a developer
11:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Why can't my fridge auto stock pepsi. It sucks to go home and find out that I ran out of pepsi
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #7399
11:59 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7399
12:00 < bridge> <axel_vestin> Ok thanks I take a look
12:04 < bridge> <axel_vestin> btw uuuh the wiki page for development under "Installing the dependencies" doesnt work for Debian 12, the packages arent correct
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Which one exactly
12:04 < bridge> <axel_vestin> python -> python3 (no such package python) and spirv-tools4 ->  spirv-tools
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok, u can update that if you want
12:05 < bridge> <axel_vestin> ok cool
12:05 < bridge> <axel_vestin> (i assume u arent using python2 still xd)
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Btw the ddnet readme has it correct
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe just copy it from there
12:05 < bridge> <axel_vestin> oki i do this
12:05 < bridge> <teero777> it doestn @jupeyy_keks xd
12:06 < bridge> <teero777> it doesnt @jupeyy_keks xd
12:06 < bridge> <teero777> this is on the readme `sudo apt install build-essential cargo cmake git glslang-tools google-mock libavcodec-extra libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libvulkan-dev libwavpack-dev libx264-dev python rustc spirv-tools`
12:06 < bridge> <axel_vestin> yeah installing 'python' doesnt work u need to specify python3 or install the package 'python-is-python3'
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh it says spirv-tools at least xd
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that is kinda weird. I remember it being correct as well
12:07 < bridge> <teero777> atleast on debain
12:07 < bridge> <teero777> on arch python is correct
12:07 < bridge> <axel_vestin> im on a fresh install of debian 12
12:07 < bridge> <teero777> atleast on debain.
12:08 < bridge> <axel_vestin> i make sure the compile goes fine then i update
12:08 < bridge> <teero777> ig someone assumed that the package names were the same on diffrent distros
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks
12:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe i just didn't remember it right cuz I sure wasn't using arch. and ubuntu does use python3 instead of python i think?
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'm surprised they don't do a meta package, since Python package straight doesn't exist
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's pretty common to do a meta package that references the current version
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. clang will install latest version but u can still install older version explicitly
12:12 < bridge> <axel_vestin> maybe they wanna make sure people understand which version they are installing or smth?
12:12 < bridge> <axel_vestin> if u come from older versions
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> where was python1
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where is the effort to remove python dep
12:13 < bridge> <axel_vestin> u arent using python?
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i try to not touch it
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i used to use python regularly until typescript showed up on my radar
12:15 < bridge> <axel_vestin> python > typescript
12:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> by regularly i mean just simple scripts like batch renaming stuff
12:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i don't know bash
12:15 < bridge> <axel_vestin> bash sucks i love it
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> python comes straight from hell
12:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I use shell (well I am on linux)
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's there to be hated
12:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I did learn powershell scripts for a while
12:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I also use lf (file manager) with some custom scripts that zogtib made to batch rename stuff
12:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but everything is a bit long so i just use nodejs now
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :banhammer:
12:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean one of my old projects still uses powershell as build scripts
12:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> so renaming stuff is very easy bcs when you want you just open `lf` select the folders/files you want and it opens them up in your text editor and I rename them from there :). And since I use `vis` which has mutliple cursors renaming stuff is very easy ;).
12:17 < bridge> <axel_vestin> yuck
12:17 < bridge> <zogtib> batch renaming is done with `vidir` from `moreutils`
12:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't say i liked it
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171770648742342707/image.png?ex=655de375&is=654b6e75&hm=85487ff4582ec22c564ff95662e33fa129fbaa333fe17b373a43b4b1faf197c5&
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just there
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i guess i did wrote bash scripts
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> have you tried to light it?
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably hated it more than ps1
12:19 < bridge> <axel_vestin> um should i do a pull request to update readme deps too?
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
12:19 < bridge> <axel_vestin> oki cool
12:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
12:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171771509874888714/image.png?ex=655de442&is=654b6f42&hm=c992552b33e7e48ce3851cbec0da7172e44aa7c3782b384e9c3179b85ea50b28&
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's at least a straight forward script
12:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, just run some nodejs stuff and zip
12:24 < bridge> <axel_vestin> set -e, set -o pipefail set -o nounset are nice flags for bash scripts
12:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh i'm rich
12:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171772252526755840/image.png?ex=655de4f3&is=654b6ff3&hm=b2deba4b7cee29cfe2f00bf80bee2ce32496d25746e559d9b61cd784a905ac9c&
12:25 < bridge> <axel_vestin> is it ur onlyfans
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean have or not have xd
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> man if my onlyfans only earns 7 dollars per month i'm gonna die
12:25 < bridge> <axel_vestin> so u earn more from ur onlyfans
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i don't want to know how many hours u've spent for this money xD
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> haven't checked
12:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like a week probably lol
12:26 < bridge> <axel_vestin> uuuh should i create an issue for my pull request
12:26 < bridge> <axel_vestin> im github noob
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮 ok that's nothing
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think pull request would suffice if you already have a PR to submit
12:27 < bridge> <axel_vestin> ok
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my projects usually aren't more than a week long
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so this is the money for a single project?
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't have more
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see, well then gg.
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 10$ per month is good
12:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this is the only one i'm feeling good enough for a paid plugins
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if the project keeps getting in the money for like 2 years xd
12:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too bad unity is going to die
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd rip
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i do hate that I have so many projects to maintain tho
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sometime a random issue would just pop up for a thing that I made like three years ago
12:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then i have to relearn all the stuff i was using at the time to fix it
12:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> none of the "currently have people using them" projects are using the same languages
12:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip. is that a problem with android? or also unity projects?
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, i just have a lot of stuff
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok. i once used play services in my teenages.. and man google changes the api like every week back then xD
12:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I had like a spa with javascript, a piracy server backend with typescript, a input method script with lua , a unity plugin with C# and another unity plugin that interlops with tsx.
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why don't you simply drop the projects that break ?
12:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> people still use them
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more than 0.5 ppl?
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably in the thousands
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not the unity plugins tho
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol, OSS or money?
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the other stuff
12:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unlicensed but does live on github kind of open-source
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i c
12:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not like I wrote them as open-source projects
12:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just a thing that I need and people picked it up randomly
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i was just wondering if you at least get smth back for maintaining old projects
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess not
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like where did all these people come from
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171775348145405962/image.png?ex=655de7d5&is=654b72d5&hm=ed134d188ce5cea75c84c7eabf7a98d4792fd5c51968a7de251111307adc5903&
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this is just the discord for that server thing
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf, u fame bro xdd
12:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> TsFamous
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is just the question if they real ppl xdd
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk actually
12:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think most people in the discord are joined just to see if we have pirated games
12:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like we don't actually provide any games, it's just a server software that allows those legally questionablue games to run. so maybe a bunch of people just joined and saw there was nothing and just let the server sits in their discord
12:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> it is funny sometime you find people selling your stuff when it is openly available for download
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tsfreddie the mmo reverse engineer
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is kinda cool to have to write these in a life time
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171776873659899904/image.png?ex=655de941&is=654b7441&hm=11af571feceec583ec5e76f607e3bac173f341540c7048b19780a541dfd11835&
12:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> really interesting how much stuff u already done in your young age xdd
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how do you find time for them while having a 18h job xDD
12:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ez
12:45 < bridge> <teero777> 10x dev
12:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not have a job before doing the 18h jobs
12:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> rate my dashboard for that thing
12:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171777477874565130/image.png?ex=655de9d1&is=654b74d1&hm=8bbc8a1f8afc136b89235e617b0da2cc4e8ef15d3fd538f3f6fba9d627f4ef4a&
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
12:45 < bridge> <axel_vestin> i have ur ip now
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 127.0.0.1
12:46 < bridge> <axel_vestin> wtf we have the same ip
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno looks very generic. i rate it a 7/10
12:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fair enough
12:46 < bridge> <axel_vestin> it looks good
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also I've been working on some stuff that is technically for work but it happens to benefit my personal project as well
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - company needs a UI framework for Unity
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - I had released one before
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - added dependency at work
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - the framework was old
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - fixed them for work so it works for company
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - contribute upstream as company
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> - upstream is me
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
12:53 < bridge> <axel_vestin> nice
12:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw my leader told me not to ever use git to push code onto anywhere public. but i don't see how they can MITM ssh connections without me noticing.
12:56 < bridge> <furo321> @axel_vestin Just so you know, you can either put an x in the [] or an empty space and they will be formatted as an actual checkbox :)
12:56 < bridge> <axel_vestin> oh ok
12:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> atleast u make something off side projects
12:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if i could make a side project that makes $
12:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i never have ideas and im tired and lazy
12:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm also tired and lazy
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm just more greedy than you
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess im comfortable enough with my job salary
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's literarily just a plugin that let you tag objects. people can make that with one single script in less than 20 lines
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> see
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats the money maker mindset
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to get it too
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i dont know what to do
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u sell godot plugins?
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe thats a start
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> or since im so into ff14 i could make smth there
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> its easier if it has a oficial marketplace  i guess
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there is thirdparty godot market place
13:01 < bridge> <axel_vestin> Regarding https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7399
13:01 < bridge> <axel_vestin> 
13:01 < bridge> <axel_vestin> If i implement a change where it looks at the images for duplicates, renaming the ones that have different data but the same names,
13:01 < bridge> <axel_vestin> 
13:01 < bridge> <axel_vestin> do i need to update some pointers for the tile layers etc that point to the now renamed image?
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and the first party one is on the way
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i can make godot rust plugins
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> that would be fun
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie url?
13:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just cross compile for all platforms and bundle them, then no one really cares if it is rust
13:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> let me find it
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can do that with a github action
13:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think to sell plugins you have to remember you are making them for non coding people
13:02 < bridge> <axel_vestin> In my opinion, it would be more fool-proof that if there are images with duplicate names, the appending is aborted? The user should know best?
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-diff/releases/tag/v0.1.2
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> like this
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
13:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://godotmarketplace.com/
13:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess it is just called that
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also found this https://godotassets.io/
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> urs looks more dope tho
13:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> an offical one would be cool
13:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> iirc they did say they are working on making monetization possible on the offical one
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if there is any ppl buying at all there tho
13:04 < bridge> <axel_vestin> u mean i should use that tool when appending a map in the editor?
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> no that is unrelated to whathever u are talking about, its meant for @tsfreddie
13:04 < bridge> <axel_vestin> oh xd
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> that tool takes 2 maps
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and shows the difference in changes
13:05 < bridge> <axel_vestin> ah yeah ok
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> by placing a new group
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and red green yellow tiles
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> like git diff
13:05 < bridge> <axel_vestin> cool
13:06 < bridge> <furo321> I think it should just ignore duplicates, because in most cases it's going to be the same texture/asset.
13:06 < bridge> <axel_vestin> ok if nobody has a strong opinion about it i just abort the appending if there is name collisions
13:06 < bridge> <axel_vestin> yeah
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie did u ever make any roblox stuff
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hear the market size is insane
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> best is you either just try out a bit, or discuss this directly in the issue 😄
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here it will be lost
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah renaming sounds good to me
13:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you already lost it @jupeyy_keks ?
13:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i considered it when I was like 16
13:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then I found out people usually make games with unity
13:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> didn't realize roblox stuff is money milking machine
13:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have a friend working for a company that make roblox and minecraft contents
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u want to be fame, add mario character to every game in existence
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am lost
13:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Pointers to the ignored images (and sounds) need to be updated to point to the respective existing images though
13:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's for kid who like to stole parents' credit cards
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as if you never stole money from u parents
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://create.roblox.com/landing
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> they got a whole ass unity-like editor
13:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't get it
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvm it
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> what lang uses robolox
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure its c#
13:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> get out of my head
13:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lua
13:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> modding is usually lua just for the embedability
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Scripts are containers that hold Luau code and can modify the properties and behaviors of other objects. You can use scripts to implement the overall logic of your experience to do things like manipulate an object, change its appearance or events, or respond to user interactions.
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> its always lua
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> my worst nightmare
13:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i did use lua when I was making that tetris game in dota2
13:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I found a typescript to lua compiler and switched to typescript instead
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo's brain:
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rust > WASM > rest
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i agree with u ryo
13:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they made typings and stuff for dota2 that is in lua which is hilarious but also pretty awesome
13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I like languages that I can just pick up in 10 minutes and make a fun weekend projects
13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> which is why I still can't learn rust
13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just not aligned with my brain
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's ok, i won't blame you.
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i shame you
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for 99.99% the language doesnt matter anyway
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust!
13:22 < bridge> <stormaxd> i might distrub y'lall, but i get a bug while making own RPC, it just won't appear so i have a problem with small_image, does someone know how to fix this?

13:23 < bridge> <stormaxd> a bit wrong code
13:23 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://i.imgur.com/PUmQZX0.png
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess idle is not a good uuid
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm actually i forgot how discord works
13:23 < bridge> <stormaxd> well, im using 
13:23 < bridge> <stormaxd> ```cpp
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>  static float OldUpdateTime = Client()->LocalTime();
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>     if (OldUpdateTime + 5 < Client()->LocalTime())
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>     {
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>        OldUpdateTime = Client()->LocalTime();
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>        IDiscord *discord = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IDiscord>();
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         int LocalID = m_aLocalIDs[g_Config.m_ClDummy];
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         bool Afk = m_aClients[LocalID].m_Afk;
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         if(!discord)
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             return;
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd> 
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         const char *pText;
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         const char *pImage;
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd> 
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         if(Afk)
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         {
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             pText = "Idleing...";
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             pImage = "idle";
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         }
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         else if(Client()->State() != IClient::STATE_ONLINE)
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         {
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             pText = "Chilling in menus";
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             pImage = "menu";
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         }
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         else
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         {
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             pText = "Playing";
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>             pImage = "greenline";
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd>         }
13:24 < bridge> <stormaxd> 
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but this is a problem with understanding the discord rpc
13:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's too hard
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub trait ValueDeserializer<'a, TType, TLibfunc>
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> where
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Self: for<'de> DeserializeSeed<'de, Value = NonNull<()>>,
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>     TType: GenericType,
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>     TLibfunc: GenericLibfunc,
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> {
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>     fn new(
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>         arena: &'a Bump,
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>         registry: &'a ProgramRegistry<TType, TLibfunc>,
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>         info: &'a <TType as GenericType>::Concrete,
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>     ) -> Self;
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks easy!
13:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and honestly it's hard to find a reason to learn it other than I just want to make something fast and safe. but I don't really need speed and i don't really understand safety anyway.
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should learn it cuz its kinda fun idk how to say it, its u get the power of c++ with modern tooling
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u say u dont understand safety
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will teach u a bit
13:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean i get that
13:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i don't even use C++ for the stuff that I do
13:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> shame, shame, shame!
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/game-of-thrones-got-shame-nun-gif-4969023
13:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> even in godot i'll just use gdscript instead of C# even tho it is so much slower
13:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: i'm sure if rust is required at work i could pick it up in less than a week
13:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually, is working for Valve a cool thing to be a dream goal. I remember i think it would be cool to work for Valve but i don't remember why now<a:amogus:876956004674338848>
13:39 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if you can only count to two, then yes
13:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh right. I was trying to find some quality sound design tools and presets then I realize it's like music which really is a expensive hobby to learn.
13:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like a VST specifically for one type of soundscape costs like 400 dollars
13:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like wtf
13:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171791573911080980/image.png?ex=655df6f2&is=654b81f2&hm=7b9a75244f256be476b63dd5aa098450f4bb6c1a6a66e853949b08b995588e0b&
13:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and if you just want samples, some libraries costs $150 a year on subscriptions
13:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:43 < bridge> <stormaxd> ok another question, when im left servers, pMapName dont want to disappear

13:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why did I saw chillerdragon at first glance in that first screenshot
13:44 < bridge> <stormaxd> lul
13:44 < bridge> <stormaxd> idk
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> as a chinese person who doesn't really speak english anymore. i still remember the day chillerdragon just give up on typing and proceed to sent me voice messages.
13:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ChillerDragon im gonna yoink your TeeCaptcha idea :greenthing:
13:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what teecaptcha idea
13:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/TeeCaptcha
13:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
13:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> make one with properly styled modal
13:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is it just going to be images or randomly generated? because if it was just images i could just train a bot to read all the inputs LOL
13:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Or make one where u have to select a map by name :justatest:
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the chillers one you can just get the answer from his repo i think
14:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It will be hard for ppl who spend all their time on multeasymap
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, there are just 22 sets of fixed images
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 23*
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/TeeCaptcha/data/tree/142874132e5daebdacb2cde43ef9cf25da8d6705
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also read from io for every request is insane lol
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/TeeCaptcha/tee-captcha/blob/c89b77133db7a8a1752df81f399f65a8e11494a8/tee-captcha.js#L82C3-L82C3
14:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> man i'm so sleepy again
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> Would also be cool if the images are captured from a live game server.
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> technical writer
14:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I do `FILE *f = fopen(pathname, "r")` but when I execute the program it's relative to the path I execute it from. Is there a way for it to be *absolute*. (btw the pathname is "`data/shaders"`)
14:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The way I do it rn is that I cd to the neccessary folder first and then execute but that seems hackish to me
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Put the full path as parameter
14:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd need to start with /
14:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah ig my question was bad. I don't know how to get the full path
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you ist cpp17?
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use
14:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I ist C
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh Just Look how ddnet did it xd
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or Internet
14:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i literally repurpose other code from ddnet to make updates LOL
14:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> so if I do that I am Pixel?
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
14:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U also get his art skills
14:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> IM NOT PIXEL ‼️‼️‼️‼️
14:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am now!
14:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> because Pixel != Voxel
14:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ur pixel * 6

14:41 < bridge> <zogtib> ``` @mr.gh0s7
14:41 < bridge> <zogtib> argv[0] should be valid, it's the only way to get a short-of path of the executable (without using /proc)
14:42 < bridge> <zogtib> `argv[0]` couldn't be used only if it is intentionally invalid
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can put c after the backsticks for color
14:43 < bridge> <zogtib> true XD but I'm so used in no syntax highligting
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn oldschool
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a kid i like colors
14:43 < bridge> <zogtib> no way I'd guess it was missing XD
14:43 < bridge> <zogtib> so I'd edit it right?
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can edit it

14:44 < bridge> <zogtib> ``` @mr.gh0s7
14:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ddnet uses argv[0] too I guess I shall do it the zogtib way :)
14:45 < bridge> <zogtib> You could undo the chdir if you need, but prob you won't.
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can also use getenv to get home dir
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do u seriously want to tell me u code without colors?
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its more portable
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> haxxor
14:46 < bridge> <zogtib> I currenlty do, didn't always 🙂
14:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I do only syntax-highlighting for comments
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> @gotroyb r u 60y old
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you intentionally make your life harder or what xd
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2023/10/25/htmx-with-rust
14:47 < bridge> <zogtib> syntax highligting hides beautiful code structure or smth
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol no
14:48 < bridge> <zogtib> coloring helps seeing the 60% (let's say) easier but makes seeing the 90%+ harder
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I already die when phantom code for parameter name doesn't work xd
14:48 < bridge> <zogtib> at least for me ig
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?? xd
14:48 < bridge> <zogtib> also I currently program in C so syntax isn't very complicated or smth
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u program in c for a living
14:49 < bridge> <zogtib> I'm in uni, I'm supposed to study for that but... (long story)
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i want to make my own data format and learn serde deep
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> any idea
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> teeformat
14:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> currently :kek:. soon™ in your own
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You could try to serialize data for wasmer
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i think im learning serde deep rn cuz my work
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> what format does it use
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your own xd
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> When i was in uni i also coded fng mod in notepad++. And i have to say, i don't miss these times xD
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The cool thing is that u have to remember variable names better etc
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But once u forget them, rip
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never was in uni
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> take that
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ez
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i was 1 year
14:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :greenthing:
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saved probably like 3k€ and got a job so instead i got money
14:54 < bridge> <zogtib> I open other files in `less` so I can see variable names etc directly, I don't use memory for  everything.
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @snailx3 TOCTOU :justatest:
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can pipe less with bat
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> for colors
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> made in rust btw
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
14:55 < bridge> <zogtib> also I cannot for not colors 🙂
14:55 < bridge> <zogtib> I know bat already 🙂
14:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I use bat for colored inspect
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> with neovim u can use bat
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> for previewing

14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know what unix is
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> right? xd
14:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I do.
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean voxel
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe he is trolling
15:00 < bridge> <yekrm> My eyes :1282confused:
15:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i do not
15:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is it an app
15:01 < bridge> <zogtib> UNIX technically is a trademark
15:01 < bridge> <zogtib> linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD etc are all UNIX-like Operating Systems
15:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Look at this masterpiece
15:03 < bridge> <zogtib> so linux cannot be called UNIX (UNIX is a trademark) but the behave similarly, they have common functionallity hence linux is UNIX-like

15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > This means we achieved qualification for the open source Ferrocene toolchain. Ferrocene 23.06.0, based on Rust 1.68, is now fully usable in safety critical environments.
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > With these qualifications, Rust can now be used to develop software for electronic systems in series production road vehicles. We’ve qualified Ferrocene for use in systems up to ASIL D – the highest classification of initial hazard as defined by this standard. This standard provides automakers with guidelines that make the software being used to develop, produce, operate and service the automotive sectors safe to use.
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Beyond the automotive, Ferrocene can also be used in electronic programmable systems in the industrial sector. Here the focus is on developing products or applications that carry out safety functions. Like the automotive certification, we’ve also gone for the highest level of risk reduction and qualified it at SIL4.
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> > “Ferrocene is a major achievement both for Rust and safety in automotive,” says Florian. “It shows that Rust software can be used in all critical environments. The process was challenging but matched what we’ve come to expect from Rust: It enables building correct software at a much lower cost.”
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> > With this step, we can start rolling out the sales process on Ferrocene. Our initial availability is limited to a minimum order of 10 license seats for 12 months, starting at €2.400,00 (€240 each) for the quality managed licenses.
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Cool
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But why does it cost money xd
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> safety licenses cost
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i bet they spend a lot to get their compiler qualified
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> but this is aimed at big corpo
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> they got the money to pay that xd
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then why doesn't it only cost money for them
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need the qualification when using the software on a distributed car
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess u dont need the license for it if u dont
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks the source code is open btw
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can use it

15:34 < bridge> <stormaxd> why tf i have error expected ; after class in `variables` and`config_variables`

15:37 < bridge> <teero777> does the compiler or the IDE complain?
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Awesome, now i will still not use it anyway xdd
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki non rust problems 😏
15:41 < bridge> <stormaxd> compiler
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Search for ; in the file
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The file is included multiple times
15:43 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://i.imgur.com/d3OcTEZ.png
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also it's included in a textual sense
15:43 < bridge> <stormaxd> so i have to search where file was included twice?
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes and look how the macro definitions look like
15:44 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://tenor.com/view/skull-skull-emoji-omori-basil-basil-omori-gif-25680753
15:44 < bridge> <zogtib> that file is meant to be included multiple times
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or show the compile output
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe it's more clever
15:45 < bridge> <stormaxd> `C:\Users\storm\CLionProjects\StormAcl\src\././game/variables.h(8,1): fatal  error C1189: #error:  "The config macros must be defined" [C:\Users\storm\CLionProjects\StormAcl\cmake-build-debug-visual-studio\game-client.vcxproj`

17:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> 1st screenshot
17:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> who are u
17:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> see u first time
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> it skips serde_json::Value altogether
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u know how ur json looks it can be fast using that macro
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> well thats what i got from the comments
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to pass a non-null pointer as `src`
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> where do u call this method
17:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I added them now :)
17:16 < bridge> <axel_vestin> oh ok cool
17:16 < bridge> <axel_vestin> i know some opengl if u have a question
17:19 < bridge> <stormaxd> i spend 1hr for resolve problem
17:19 < bridge> <stormaxd> i just worgot to put , in the end
17:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Will do, thanks :)
17:39 < bridge> <axel_vestin> uuuh how do i run the tests
17:39 < bridge> <axel_vestin> for client
17:40 < bridge> <axel_vestin> nvm im blind
17:40 < bridge> <sedonya> :owo:
18:04 < bridge> <Ewan> what is confusing
18:04 < bridge> <sedonya> #define is in dark color and cannot be called in the code, which causes a lot of compilation errors
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> because it’s wrapped in an #ifndef
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ifndef = if not defined
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> which it is, by the CMake
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like you should move `SCLIENT_RELEASE_VERSION` below the `#endif`
18:14 < bridge> <sedonya> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1171860327902752768/image.png?ex=655e36fa&is=654bc1fa&hm=44c4458aeb6692cb4b921fe2b250466513b8879e2553bcd3b7bf88f9cb1d4e75&
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
18:39 < bridge> <sedonya> But I still want the regular version just as much
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> The regular version will be defined properly by cmake. That's why it's grey
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> It is defined, so the ifndef doesnt happen
22:02 < bridge> <devinci24> Have you guys touched any network related code?
22:02 < bridge> <devinci24> Today me and another played have had a very strange thing happen. We could perfectly see chat and other players movement but were completely unable to move.
22:02 < bridge> <devinci24> I'm not sending this on bugs cause it may be more network related (mine is reallyyy bad), but idk, never happened before as far as I can remember.
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could not chat yourselves?
22:03 < bridge> <devinci24> hardly. message sometimes was sent quite fast, sometimes took a few seconds
22:04 < bridge> <devinci24> but it was fixed after restarting the game
22:12 < bridge> <learath2> This is an ancient bug. Has been around for half a decade
22:14 < bridge> <learath2> No idea how to trigger it, no theories on what it might be. Happens to me completely randomly sometimes. Usually preceded by a connection problems for just a sec
22:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if it's a bug or the server not receving the messages
22:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> was it on ger10?
22:14 < bridge> <devinci24> yes I think
22:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then I'd put the blame there @learath2
22:15 < bridge> <devinci24> oh okay. strange I haven't had that earlier since I usually have those connection issues xd
22:16 < bridge> <learath2> It happened to me way before ger10 and the advent of smartish xdp firewalls
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> by message you mean inputs? everything seemed to be working properly except for my movement. where it seemed like I had 10k ms when the game showed constant 70 (con control shift d)
22:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, so the input worked, just delayed a lot?
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> And messages had a random delay almost as if the server was actively being ddosed?
22:22 < bridge> <devinci24> ehh idk. i'd like to say no. like the client was registering it but not the server so I was like going back? at least I spent like 5 minutes trying to reach a tile that was 1 jump away and couldn't xd
22:22 < bridge> <devinci24> no
22:23 < bridge> <devinci24> well, mine yes
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> For me when that happens either my messages are completely fine or delayed by several seconds
22:24 < bridge> <devinci24> okay maybe it was the same then
22:26 < bridge> <devinci24> next time, hoping there wont be a next, I'll try to record it or something
22:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you can, record it with wireshark, too
22:35 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ive had those bugs before

22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> print format specifiers are really annoying, ngl
22:52 < bridge> <robyt3> The ones for `size_t` are basically broke for translated texts because `PRIzu` is defined as different strings depending on compiler

22:53 < bridge> <robyt3> We don't print `size_t` in any localized text though, and casing to `int` fixes it for most cases anyway
22:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just cast them to `int` I guess
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Only Learath, master of all 4 compilers could stop them
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but when the world needed him most, he vanished

22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is one for you

22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬 😬 😬 😬 😬 😬 😬
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> What am I stopping?
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> Ah printing size_t
23:00 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, not printing size_t is the best
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> variadic templates are best

23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly mingw still makes trouble
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least that was the reason we removed it
23:18 < bridge> <learath2> I dont even remember the mingw issue. Remind me pls
23:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apprently you need c99 for %z
23:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps msvc started supporting that nowadays?
23:21 < bridge> <learath2> Ah but msvc refuses to even support c99 properly?
23:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/visual-cpp-language-conformance?view=msvc-170
23:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can't figure it out from this
23:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but in theory they wanted to start supporting parts of it
23:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> something something fungal plant pathogens of the order pucciniales
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ask chairn. He uses mingw 1.0 on Windows 98

23:27 < bridge> <learath2> No support for z.... I hate Microsoft

23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> OpenGL question :). Here https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders on the `More attributes!` section it add color to the vertices array which I am not particulary fond of. Instead I made another array named colorsOfVertices and created  `GLuint VBOs[2]` and then ```c
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBOs[0]);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBOs[1]);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(colorsOfVertices), colorsOfVertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ``` instead of ```c
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3* sizeof(float)));
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);```
23:38 < bridge> <zogtib> This mentions that support for `%zu` was added at VS 2013, but MinGW doesn't?
23:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> This works btw. I forgot to actually ask something xD
23:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Is it bad practice to do this? (create mutlitple VBOs for each to hold vertices and the color of the vertices)?
23:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Classic rainbow triangle :)

23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh hard to say if it's bad practice. It might be slightly less cache friendly because you load memory from two locations.
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's maybe a bit more annoying to work with. But if u update your color buffers often, might actually be better.
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do depends on your use case i guess. Like always.
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I personally would not split them
23:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ok, thanks! 🥼 🎩
23:46 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't split them either but I'm not a gfxwizard like jupsti
