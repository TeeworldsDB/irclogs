00:31 < bridge> <louis> its a bit more complicated to prevent ppl from just spamming it to get infinite speed
00:31 < bridge> <louis> it also needs nice behavior when youre already at high speeds etc
00:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that applies to all sorts of impulses really
00:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and generally the dash cooldown would be longer than the dash itself
00:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so you can't spam multiple impulses before the deceleration hits
00:40 < bridge> <louis> teeworlds doesnt have deceleration while a movement key is held tho
00:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean like an extra deceleration applied by the dash itself, though ig in some games that wouldn't be needed
00:51 < bridge> <.puch> @chillerdragon thank for your help today, the tournament worked fine cause of you ‚ù§Ô∏è
00:51 < bridge> <louis> ah right
00:52 < bridge> <louis> thats probably the best way to go about it, lotsa special cases for like teleports etc tho
00:53 < bridge> <louis> i personally also enjoy games that allow u to "cancel the deceleration" like celeste (not sure how they implement it tho)
01:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> that's just code it to specifically do that
01:17 < bridge> <louis> ye but the more special cases u add the more ppl will have differing opinions on implementation etc
03:07 < bridge> <pathos3005> @chillerdragon do you take map requests for training to put on your servers?
08:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @pathos3005: yea but I‚Äôm picky on the design as you already know hehe
08:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @.puch: nice to hear! You using the unstable v2.0-dev master made me a bit nervous. I am glad nothing exploded.
08:32 < bridge> <.puch> @chillerdragon haha i checked option 4 but didn't want to parse again i knew my code was robust enough
09:08 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^.^
11:35 < bridge> <melon> is there any other way to create a demo while ingame apart from `save_replay` and connecting your dummy?
11:35 < bridge> <melon> there probably is but i cant figure out the command atm
11:38 < bridge> <Assa> well there are autodemo settings, or do you mean other ways which do not use the save_replay command in the background?
11:39 < bridge> <melon> there are people who have save_replay disabled, but demos enabled, and i'm not sure how to get his current demo without telling them to leave the server
11:39 < bridge> <melon> there are people who have save_replay disabled (`cl_replays 0`), but demos enabled, and i'm not sure how to get his current demo without telling them to leave the server
11:40 < bridge> <Assa> do they maybe have ghost in their run?
11:40 < bridge> <Assa> do they maybe have ghost of their run?
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Click "Start Demo" in the ESC menu
11:40 < bridge> <melon> i dont quite follow
11:41 < bridge> <melon> oh that works? awesome, thanks.
11:41 < bridge> <melon> whats the cl_ command equivalent?
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno rn xd
11:41 < bridge> <melon> xd
11:41 < bridge> <Assa> really you didn't know of this button? :pepeW:  okay
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CLI enjoyer
11:42 < bridge> <melon> i had cl_auto_demo_on_connect 1 for around 3 years now
11:42 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
11:42 < bridge> <Assa> do you disconnect by binds?
11:42 < bridge> <melon> ctrl+q
11:42 < bridge> <melon> ctrl+alt+q
11:42 < bridge> <Assa> like how do you miss that :kek:
11:42 < bridge> <melon> :justatest: :feelsbadman:
11:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im sure the command is something like ``record`` 
11:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or ``record_demo``
11:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa you need a bind to disconnect? You can bind ``quit``
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> not really, thank you
11:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i once rebound my kill bind to use ``connect ip`` on a server where selfkill was not allowed that was really op xd
11:47 < bridge> <Assa> I wish to know if I can bind something to on button release
11:47 < bridge> <Assa> but i guess this would be too op
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> like holding a button for less mouse sense
11:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want lower sense while you hold the button?
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> yes and normal sense on release
11:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds like you want the +toggle syntax I made up
11:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10461#issuecomment-3041453983
11:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think it‚Äôs already possible tbh
11:50 < bridge> <melon> yes it iss
11:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> `bind mouse4 "+toggle cl_mouse_max_distance 2 210; +toggle inp_mouse_sensitivity 80 85"`
11:51 < bridge> <melon> inp_mouse_sensitivity
11:51 < bridge> <melon> chiller is drunk
11:51 < bridge> <melon> `bind x +toggle inp_mousesens 1000 100`
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I copy pasted
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> From the issue
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But it won‚Äôt be your current sense you go back to
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can only toggle two values
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs the thing I invented which doesn‚Äôt exist xd
11:51 < bridge> <melon> well yes, thats what a +toggle is for
11:51 < bridge> <melon> 
11:51 < bridge> <melon> if you want to alternate between things you can use configs
11:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So you need to update your bind every time you change your sense
11:52 < bridge> <melon> do you regularily change your sens? xd
11:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Me?
11:52 < bridge> <melon> ye
11:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I increased on a regular basis 12 years ago and then stopped at 1k
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would never change
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But others do
11:53 < bridge> <Assa> I know what you did
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs a maintenance smell in your config
11:53 < bridge> <melon> i guess one cool thing would be `bind x +toggle inp_mousesens = inp_mousesens 100`
11:53 < bridge> <melon> but that would be scripting ig
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You have one magic number twice
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not dry
11:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @blaiszephyr: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10461#issuecomment-3041453983 better syntax :p
11:54 < bridge> <Assa> yeah here is a usecase for you: activate dyn and switch mousesense on button hold
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> like I really need to change more then one var
11:55 < bridge> <melon> emulating a sniper scope, i respect it
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> this is actually what I use it for xD
12:42 < bridge> <Assa> 102
12:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you are the biggest troll @.puch the readme of your PRIVATE repo includes "Feel free to open issues or pull requests!" xd

12:45 < bridge> <.puch> haha
12:45 < bridge> <Assa> time to invite chiller dragon to some of my other projects
12:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im sure if you invite and uninvite quickly the email gets sent anyways

12:46 < bridge> <.puch> you trolled me I guess
12:46 < bridge> <.puch> ^^
12:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
12:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you farmed a star
12:47 < bridge> <.puch> i got the best star then
12:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:deen_star:1322627615906992149> is the best star 
12:48 < bridge> <.puch> yeah but this is nothing so I do not expect deen ^^
12:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he stars stuff actually
12:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but only if its ddnet related
12:48 < bridge> <.puch> i just did github cause I wanted something clean
12:49 < bridge> <.puch> i just did github repo cause I wanted something clean
12:49 < bridge> <.puch> then I know im not the best for that ^^
12:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you also star most tw related repos xd
12:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @.puch you leaked ur webhook btw

12:50 < bridge> <.puch> how can i add it in a cfg file
12:50 < bridge> <.puch> yeah
12:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and gitignore that
12:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** drama averted xd
12:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** imagine someone found that and used it during tournament lmao
12:51 < bridge> <.puch> yeah lol
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> can I curl funny stuff there?
12:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
12:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i as the owner of the repo allow you to spam the shit out of it
12:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> I did curl push something, it worked, I don't know where it pushed to xD
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg trol
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you will go to jail for this
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @.puch fast delete the webhook before assa gets your discord banned with racial slur spamming
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> by circumventing non existent security and breaking nothing in the process?
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its production tournament
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> nah, I just post vacation ads
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> wdym
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you illegally obtained a private key and breached a system
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats for sure jail time in germany
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fast ping lawyer jopsti before anything bad happens
12:56 < bridge> <Assa> yeye sure
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> my lawyer says, I didn't obtain it illegally, as I was also invited to this project
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ez legal dodge
13:07 < bridge> <.puch> xdddd
13:07 < bridge> <.puch> but assa doesn't want to work with us @chillerdragon üò¢
13:08 < bridge> <Assa> that's not true, I want to morally support you ü•≥
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> btw the german hacker paragraph is very shitty, like a judge (who actually lives very close to me) decided that and he has absolutely no clue about this topic.
13:29 < bridge> <Assa> German programmers, who find a vulnerability or open data in a company, now contact the CCC, which then conacts the company and the BND, so that they can't get sued
13:29 < bridge> <Assa> like this is bonkers, lets involve a third party, because CDU is too stupid to secure their app properly
13:30 < bridge> <Assa> (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

15:05 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> 
15:05 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> does it ever tell you the password if this happened
15:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** tell who which password @ChnFreddie 
15:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this means the save is stored in sqlite3 instead of mysql https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/832dfc53217a4c29bace4556102d520f322c4e5f/src/game/server/scoreworker.cpp#L1622-L1765
15:12 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> the auto generated password if they didn't provide one.
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** as far as i know this is mostly the auto generated one even if a user provided one
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if the game server cant check if the user provided pw is already used because mysql connection is dead it will force the generated one to avoid conflicts i think
15:13 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> so how does he know what password is gonna use
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and the user sees the pw in chat
15:13 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> the server didn't send them
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no?
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not in the broadcast in the chat
15:13 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> didn't seem like it
15:13 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> ddnet-saves.txt didn't catch it either
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet-saves.txt looks at the chat too
15:14 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> so chat didn't have it
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rip
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did you lose a run right now?
15:14 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> not me
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** was it on CHN server? xd
15:14 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> ye
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe intercepted by GFW xd
15:15 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> i'll tell them to double check that file then
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** do you have a demo?
15:15 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> nope
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** just ssh into chn server and check the sqlite3 ü§∑
15:16 < bridge> <ChnFreddie> i don't have access to servers anymore lol

15:30 < bridge> <Assa> I am if I find issues with your PR, because then you can move forward or a maintainer can decline you faster
15:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sure I take all the help I can get
15:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks owo
15:38 < bridge> <pathos3005> Cool bug find
