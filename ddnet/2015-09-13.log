00:00 <@EastByte> o_be_one: why don't you test it with your MC32?
00:00 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: so I'm here now
00:00 <@heinrich5991> still up for ddrace?
00:01 < o_be_one> test what EastByte ? hosting DDNet serv ? sure i'll do, i'm just currently installing it
00:01 <@EastByte> yes
00:01 < o_be_one> cause ive some other things to host on it
00:02 < o_be_one> so i need containers :)
00:02 < o_be_one> all my hosts have containers, but for the first time i'm switching from OpenVZ to LXC, i've things to understand and try before
00:02 <@EastByte> oh nice, I recently worked with lxc for the first time
00:03 < Learath2> heinrich5991: sure 
00:03 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: I'm on your TS
00:17 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: are you hosting GER2?
00:17 <@heinrich5991> I can't get serverbrowse info from any GER2 server
00:17 <@heinrich5991> but I can connect to them
00:17 <@EastByte> GER2 is running on eeeee's server
00:27 < o_be_one> no i dont host GER2
14:06 <@EastByte> why do I notice so many botters on ddnet :/
14:06 <@EastByte> hm looks like baumalein is alive again
14:09 < Learath2> i saw a bot yesterday would balance on a single tee
14:10 <@EastByte> what I often notice is: some player doing a hard dummy dragging part with perfect aim and suddenly he aims on the player next to him...
14:10 <@EastByte> obviously bad target system
14:35 < Learath2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=11&v=tgmhi0Vi9oo
14:35 < Learath2> w/c
14:38 <@EastByte> working with nim after one night struggling with C++
14:38 <@EastByte> drugs?
14:56 <@heinrich5991> :)
15:33 <@heinrich5991> meh
15:33 <@heinrich5991> ddnet has time-modifying maps apparantly
15:41 <@EastByte> time-modifying?
15:44 <@deen> EastByte: Flappy Bird for example
15:57 <@EastByte> ah
16:08 <@heinrich5991> well, not flappy birds
16:09 <@heinrich5991> like a not-just fun map like flappy birds where the time is increased each time you fall into a teleporter
16:09 <@EastByte> ah, that one, right
16:10 <@EastByte> I don't really understand why this was implemented for the recent tournament
16:10 <@EastByte> when failing you are losing anyways
16:11 <@EastByte> losing time*
16:12 <@heinrich5991> yea. and with that, time becomes a meaningless measurement, no longer "time" but rather "points" or so :(
16:20 <@EastByte> hm
17:16 <@EastByte> okay let's see whether my computer can run 11 tw clients without flaws
17:20 <@EastByte> deen: hi_leute_gll wants the max team size to be removed on tournament ending, what do you think about that?
17:34 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: what's the max team size?
17:34 <@heinrich5991> oh, you mean a map specific max team size?
17:35 <@EastByte> currently 2, which makes finishing brutal maps harder
17:35 <@EastByte> yes
17:36 <@deen> so, DDNet GER is running out on October 10
17:36 <@deen> EastByte: yes, that's good
17:36 <@deen> EastByte: just don't make a .cfg file
17:36 <@EastByte> eh, I actually would keep the server
17:37 <@deen> EastByte: gfx_backgroundrender 0
17:37 <@deen> and use multiple desktops
17:38 <@EastByte> I'm using one workspace per client
17:38 <@deen> Well, I wouldn't keep paying for a server that has ping 120 for half the players every evening
17:38 <@deen> could as well tell them to play on CAN
17:38 <@EastByte> well I would keep it atleast as backup or GER2/3
17:38 <@EastByte> also you could downgrade the server (less vcores) for less fee
17:39 <@deen> sure, let's pay 30 € / month just as a backup
17:39 <@deen> and not actually run anything on it!
17:39 <@EastByte> 1vcore is just 10eur/m :p
17:39 <@deen> great, any other servers i should buy as backup?^^
17:39 <@EastByte> pff^^
17:40 <@deen> I'm not particularly interested in keeping DDNet running anyway
17:41 <@EastByte> well, don't forget it already was fully funded for this year
17:41 <@deen> yeah, people already told me that I know have an obligation to keep DDNet running because I got donations for that
17:42 <@deen> that's the reason I paid back all donations last time, might consider it again
17:42 <@deen> and I still paid 400 € more into DDNet than was donated, so meh
17:44 <@deen> talking about GER, it looks dead right now
17:44 <@deen> ping 500, 90% packet loss
17:45 <@EastByte> indeed...
17:45 < Henningstone> ah that's the reason why I cannot connect
17:45 < Henningstone> just wanted to complain :)
17:45 <@deen> perfect start for a tournament
17:45 <@EastByte> meh, it was a bad idea to run naufrage 3 on the tournament servers
17:45 <@EastByte> too much serious racing
17:46 <@deen> if you had run novice maps the servers would be much empties when the tournament starts
17:46 <@EastByte> probably
17:46 <@deen> but now it will be empty anyway with the current downtime
17:46 <@EastByte> ger1 isn't running naufrage
17:46 <@EastByte> it's ger2
17:47 <@deen> bad idea
17:47 <@deen> GER2 has really expensive traffic, should try to keep that server empty
17:47 <@deen> but i guess with GER having ping 120 for everyone and lags that's impossible
17:48 <@EastByte> eeeee: sry for pulling the mayority of ddnet to GER2
17:48 <@deen> AWS is terribly expensive
17:49 <@deen> ah, and people complain that they have bad ping and lags on GER2
17:49 <@deen> other people than have problems on GER of course
17:49 <@EastByte> wow what's going on with GER
17:51 <@EastByte> deen: I think it should be possible for you to completely rely on sponsored servers? (since you are stepping back)
18:58 < devnull> are the servers still lagging?
18:59 < Henningstone> no, they are back online yet
19:00 < devnull> everyone on the ger server has a ping above 60 but 3 players
19:00 < devnull> with 40
19:00 < devnull> dont think that thats normal
19:14 <@deen> devnull: well yeah, and that's why i want to cancel that server
19:14 <@deen> also, GER2 getting ddosed
19:23 < o_be_one> hello
19:28 < Savander> hi
19:28 < WolfAlex> deen: how about posting the broadcast messages also here in irc? (by a bot)
19:28 < o_be_one> +1
19:33 <@deen> I'm not broadcasting
19:33 <@deen> or doing anything else ddnet related
19:35 < o_be_one> we must ask to EastByte so :p
19:35 < Savander> it was one time 
20:25 < devnull> how is the tournament going?
20:33 <@EastByte> !ddnetpeak
20:33 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 583
20:33 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:34 < WolfAlex> EastByte: watching the stream? :D
20:39 <@deen> GER, GER2, RUS and Chile getting DDoSed
21:00 < eeeee> deen: yeah sounds about time for your to retire. honestly you did an amazing job holding it up for so long
21:02 < eeeee> not sure anyone would be able to take over ddnet, but hopefully something new will grow and displace it, like ddnet displaced ddrace/ddmax when they died
21:07 < fstd> the only thing you can rely on in TW is the DDoS
21:08 < eeeee> or can you
21:08  * eeeee envisions a faek ddos company that cheats its customers
21:09  * Henningstone would fancy that :)
21:09 < Henningstone> just played on ddrace. not possible
21:09 < Henningstone> damn laggs...
21:09 < fstd> heh, some $$ could be made with negligible downtime!
21:10 < eeeee> could lvrg the same principle as the server crasher software i posted on tw forum
21:15 < fstd> haha.  that  took me a while to recall
21:15 < fstd> it was an amazing product
21:31 < WolfAlex> stream down?
22:47 < Nimda> JustGeneric by Skeptar just released on Brutal at 2015-09-13 19:54
