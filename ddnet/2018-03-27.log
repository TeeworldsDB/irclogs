03:02 <+jxsl13> anyone on the line?
03:08 <+jxsl13> need some theoretical ideas for a bot detection
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heuristic or deterministic?
03:14 <+jxsl13> heuristic would be neater :D
03:14 <+jxsl13> tbut a combination would be also ok
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> train a neural network to detect bots on teehistorian files
03:16 <+jxsl13> tI don't know anything about ML :O
03:17 <+jxsl13> some combinatorics maybe, but not ML ._.
04:10 <+eeeee> building a large enough library of positive and negative examples is the hardest part
04:11 <+eeeee> then you need to automate testing of detection against this library (and make it fast an easy to run)
04:11 <+eeeee> after that doing heuristics or ml or whatever will be a breeze
04:15 <+eeeee> and starting with the heuristics without the previous 2 steps would be a waste of time, don't even bother :P
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe ASK @noby
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe ask @noby
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think @noby mostly checks for mouse inputs and delay between shot and aim or something and he used some graphs xxxD
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I've been thinking... wouldn't it be nice if one can start a local server directly from the editor, maybe even with remembering your position and autoreloading the map on save. This way, it should help with quickly iterating on certain map part.
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <モカツ〜〜〜> Just move spawn tile, and you can always bind reload 
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <モカツ〜〜〜> 
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <モカツ〜〜〜> But still :f3:
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the editor could use many cool features.  but the general interest is too low and the amount of work is too much
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Where can i pull the teehistorian files from?
12:20 <@deen> @CptDalv The official DDNet ones? They're supposed to be secret
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you could steal speedrun techniques with it
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> Hm
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Re3ses> hmmmm might contact rei if he can h4xx0r that >:D
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> @deen "Learath2 - heute um 03:16 Uhr
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> train a neural network to detect bots on teehistorian files"
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Have to create my own dataset then ^^
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you're serious about that, then we might provide you an anonymized part of the data set. @heinrich5991  opinions?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Well maybe creating my own dataset is more convenient in terms of sorting/labeling...
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I guess. shouldn't be hard to anonymize
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> however, we have next to no labeling
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxd
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shameless selfpromo
