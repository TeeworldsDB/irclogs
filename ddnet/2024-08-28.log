00:43 < bridge_> <murpi> Which one?
00:48 < bridge_> <murpi> Ah discord is having API issues
00:53 < bridge_> <kebscs> how can i make so my votes dont instantly pass on local server?
01:01 < bridge_> <furo> You would need someone else connected with a different IP. You could open up another client, but connect it through IPv6 instead, e.g. `connect [::1]`.
01:02 < bridge_> <kebscs> ty

02:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Is teeworlds more verbose than ddnet? Looks normal to me. Do you have debug mod on? Or what verbosity level is your ddnet console set to?
02:16 < bridge_> <melo∆û> depends on if debug is on by default if built from source. Since this is teeworlds master I have no idea, I'm not really familiar with anything that happens over there, it just stood out while I was testing something
02:17 < bridge_> <melo∆û> depends on if this debug information is expected by default if built from source. Since this is teeworlds master I have no idea, I'm not really familiar with anything that happens over there, it just stood out while I was testing something
02:18 < bridge_> <melo∆û> My entire console was filled with: weird message 'invalid' (0) when joining any ddnet Server btw, is this known?
02:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet abuses msg type 0 for its extensions
02:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on vanilla servers this does not happen
02:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt know thats printed by default thats indeed a bit odd
02:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i personally wouldnt notice because the vanilla based clients i use are waaaayyy more verbose and i like all the verbosity i can get xd
02:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1724806437.png
02:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> debug should be off by default
03:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> crazy `str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "dropped weird message '%s' (%d), failed on '%s'", m_NetObjHandler.GetMsgName(MsgId), MsgId, m_NetObjHandler.FailedMsgOn());`
03:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> is not wrapped in a debug if statement on the client side
03:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> on the server side it is
03:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> i did not realize that. Thats odd im sure Oy would merge a pr to fix that to reduce spam on ddnet servers

07:48 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> is this intended for clang-format. or is this just what vscode do
07:48 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i mean the comment spacing
07:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Mine also does this xd
07:50 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i can't pr these changes can i
07:50 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Remove each space individually üò¨
07:50 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> :cammostripes:
07:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Is it clang format 10?

07:52 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> lmao
07:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I have a newer version in neovim and it adds spaces but with clang format 10 it doesn't add spaces
07:53 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i'll try to install a lower version
07:54 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i'll check our ci actually.
07:54 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> thanks my man
07:55 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> winget is too new for clangformat 10 apparently
07:57 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I always download exe from here https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-tools-static-binaries xd
07:57 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
07:58 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> I revisited the very old spectator cursor pr
07:58 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> got it to a barely bearable state. i think i might just pr that
07:59 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> "interpolate in teeworlds challenge! SHOCKING / IMPOSSIBLE"
08:01 < bridge_> <matodor> can you send a link?
08:01 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> let me just pr this
08:01 < bridge_> <matodor> old pr i mean
08:01 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> #3262
08:01 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3262
08:03 < bridge_> <matodor> pls no, i think you can broke my static camera feature with that thing üòÑ

08:06 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
08:06 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> what static camera
08:06 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it doesn't show anything in free view

08:08 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> is this in ddnet currently
08:09 < bridge_> <matodor> and on any 0.6 version, maybe and in 0.5
08:09 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> is this a server mod
08:09 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> you'll be fine. spec cursor is a new protocol. you'll need to implement it in server side
08:10 < bridge_> <matodor> it's cool, because as you can see there no cursor now xD
08:10 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> and you can just, not implement this. client doesn't show anything if the server does not supports it
08:11 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it's not like it was always there, and i just draws it. the client have no idea what cursor is actually.
08:12 < bridge_> <matodor> it's good that the server in this case is the source of the cursor, i like it
08:13 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i would perfer avoid extra bandwidth just for sending cursor actually lol. but ye, it is a new server protocol
08:15 < bridge_> <matodor> for ddnet maybe, but for custom gamemodes any new client protocol features its cool
08:15 < bridge_> <matodor> for ddnet maybe, but for custom gamemodes any new client protocol features it's cool
08:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> oh no, protocol abuse alert
08:16 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> maybe a tutorial cursor or something lol
08:17 < bridge_> <matodor> @tsfreddie bro make protocol for snap custom quads or sprites from server side ‚ù§Ô∏è
08:17 < bridge_> <matodor> @tsfreddie bro make protocol for snap custom quads or sprites from server side (from the map) ‚ù§Ô∏è
08:18 < bridge_> <matodor> sprite id, position, rotation, color
08:20 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> nah
08:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i want to make a mod which adds the gun from the game portal :frozen:
08:24 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
08:32 < bridge_> <animepdf> Add twerking twinbop to the protocol

09:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> This should look a lot better than the old pr
09:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> but probably still not perfect but i think the "perfect" solution does not exists

09:08 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> if anyone have better idea for interpolation, please let me know oof
09:11 < bridge_> <totar> @tsfreddie are player cursors not already in the protocol?
09:11 < bridge_> <totar> I linked on the PR
09:11 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> Bruh, since when
09:11 < bridge_> <totar> I am also rendering them already xd
09:11 < bridge_> <totar> since like 2 years I think
09:11 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> well the old pr is 4 years old
09:12 < bridge_> <totar> I thought it was excluded because they look bad with only 25tps
09:12 < bridge_> <totar> I thought it was excluded from rendering because they look bad with only 25tps
09:12 < bridge_> <totar> it's used for accurate hookline
09:12 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
09:13 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i mean speccursor is per player instead of per player character
09:13 < bridge_> <totar> wdym "spec cursor"
09:13 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> the new protocol
09:13 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> in my pr
09:13 < bridge_> <totar> but what does that mean
09:13 < bridge_> <totar> what is a spec cursor
09:13 < bridge_> <totar> isn't that a normal cursor
09:14 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> that's just what I called the netobj called
09:14 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> that's just what I called the netobj
09:14 < bridge_> <totar> but what does it have to do with spectating?
09:14 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> cuz it sends only when you spectate
09:14 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> well not true, but that is the idea
09:15 < bridge_> <totar> well we already send full cursor every tick for all players
09:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> one player only gets one spec cursor instead of 64 (if the server is full)
09:15 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> but spec cursor sends two cursors
09:16 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i mean i can extract the target info from DDNetChar and add a protocol specifically for missing info at 25tps
09:16 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> but that doesn't sound fun
09:17 < bridge_> <totar> I don't understand why we need extra protocol
09:18 < bridge_> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1278252234374647891/image.png?ex=66d020a9&is=66cecf29&hm=f856ac63538ff79f2e867b59f252ee682f68e8bb957fae5ae13a721e809f3130&
09:18 < bridge_> <totar> I already render them fine
09:18 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> to show cursor at 50tps
09:18 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ...
09:18 < bridge_> <totar> ah
09:18 < bridge_> <totar> is it worth it?
09:19 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> who knows
09:20 < bridge_> <totar> 50tps can be done with sv_high_bandwidth
09:20 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ye but that doubles everything up
09:20 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> server still sends at 25, cursor displays at 50, that's the whole point
09:21 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it was probably worth it in 2020
09:21 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i didn't know you guys added new stuff
09:21 < bridge_> <totar> idk I think deen might be open to using high_bandwidth anyway. It's a pretty noticable increase in quality
09:21 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> chn can die
09:22 < bridge_> <totar> bandwidth is low?
09:22 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ye, like 5Mps per server
09:22 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ye, like 5Mbps per server
09:22 < bridge_> <totar> it's not a 2x increase tho because the snapdiffs get smaller, but it's probably nearly 2x
09:23 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> probably
09:23 < bridge_> <totar> this seems kinda low ngl
09:23 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i didn't say it wasn't low
09:23 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it is extremely low
09:23 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> and expensive
09:23 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i hate it
09:23 < bridge_> <totar> you mean the server is sending that, or it's the cap?
09:23 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> cap
09:23 < bridge_> <totar> hmm
09:24 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> we bought dedicated server with higher bandwidth at 30Mbps and 50Mbps
09:24 < bridge_> <totar> can you tried spline smoothing for the cursor at 25tps
09:24 < bridge_> <totar> have you tried spline smoothing for the cursor at 25tps
09:24 < bridge_> <totar> the math is very simple
09:24 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> not really
09:24 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> and i kinda don't want to now
09:26 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> maybe someone else can do it
09:26 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> but those ranges from 175cny to 306cny per month
09:27 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> :kek:
09:27 < bridge_> <totar> why not?
09:27 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> cuz i don't want to?
09:28 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 is that better?
09:28 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1278254806422655036/image.png?ex=66d0230e&is=66ced18e&hm=834b2a426e1ca326015a82266c59b7b2d5c10a38ac1cdc98e04c40b243b0d8fe&
09:28 < bridge_> <totar> but you can just plug the ``m_Snap.m_aCharacters[i].m_ExtendedData.m_TargetX`` data into your PR and it works instantly?
09:28 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> not really, it snaps differently
09:29 < bridge_> <totar> you mean it's too low tps or actually different
09:29 < bridge_> <totar> you mean it's too low tps or actually different?
09:29 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> actually different. i'm not snapping for all characters
09:29 < bridge_> <learath2> Did you forget to hit recompile?
09:30 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> is it as bad is before?
09:30 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> is it as bad as before?
09:30 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> you are basically asking me to remove most of my PR and cut it down to about 5 lines. which is fine but i'm not nuking my PR for that. we can open another one
09:30 < bridge_> <learath2> No it's pretty clean but either my mental assembler is wrong or this isn't that code
09:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> `2` was from previous code
09:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1278255602270863370/image.png?ex=66d023cc&is=66ced24c&hm=dc5ce181aaa4be53d43070bbfcbce473deb1ef887f1828926662d06bd9bc46e6&
09:31 < bridge_> <learath2> That makes more sense üòÑ
09:32 < bridge_> <learath2> Looks great gjgj. Try more complicated stuff though. Very easy to get this wrong
09:32 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> now I have to pass these labels all over the place but I guess it's worth it
09:32 < bridge_> <learath2> Your old solution also had labels iirc, no?
09:32 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> what is that background btw
09:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://www.behance.net/gallery/38228477/-Painterz-
09:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> white one
09:34 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> by we i mean someone else of course, cuz i don't know how to interp at 25tps and i don't actually want to. showing every input is kinda important to me at least.
09:34 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> They were generated only in the place where the logical operators were handled(it's ugly https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/c2bcefa4e7f52fc00374f9fb8c3601ba261e313d/src/codegen/codegen.rs#L396-L444)
09:35 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> But to generate pretty stuff I have to pass them
09:44 < bridge_> <oskoler3131> Hi, how do I reset in ddn?
09:45 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> return to the starting point?
09:45 < bridge_> <oskoler3131> I apologize for the bad spelling, I write through a translator
09:45 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> you can press K or use /kill
09:46 < bridge_> <oskoler3131> Screen Resolution Settings
09:46 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ah
09:48 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> you can open `config_directory` or `config_directory.bat` file in the game's folder. Then you can delete `settings_ddnet.cfg` so your settings will reset. (this includes your key binds and skins tho, maybe backup the file and use a text editor to transfer the settings you want)

10:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well actually, maybe even ok
10:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3 months is still common i guess
10:26 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> it is 30 days in chinese labor law but no one cares about that apparently
10:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
10:26 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i should've been let go july 9t
10:26 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i should've been let go july 9th
10:27 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> after that i kept taking longer and longer leave, i would just not come in because i don't feel like it, i would just be rude to everyone
10:27 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> but they still feel like it was worth it to keep me around
10:27 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> like wtf. i'm trying my best to impose higher risk for the company and they just don't care
10:29 < bridge_> <learath2> this is much better than the sete mess, there was lots of no-op branches there
10:29 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i told them i don't want to be here anymore, doesn't work. i sent my resignation notice, doesn't work. i stop showing up they just called police for missing personal and i have to show up
10:29 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
10:29 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i hate my life lol
10:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it wasn't even necessary, it was there because of how comparison operators worked
10:29 < bridge_> <learath2> What the fuck?
10:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> they did nothing xd
10:30 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i mean sure, they are scared that i was dead, fair, and i'm moved. but they still keep schedule meetings to ask me to clock-in normally
10:30 < bridge_> <learath2> Can't you just tell the police you aren't missing and you just quit? What is this slavery?
10:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> also, there's 2 repeating parts, and idk where it's coming from -.- ```
10:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat>     cmp byte ptr [rbp - 1], 0
10:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat>     je .L0
10:31 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ```
10:31 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> that is a good idea, i'll do that the next time they call the cop lol
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> be there, but dont work, just play games
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> play teeworlds
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw insane situation makes no sense xd
11:01 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> i made some PR
11:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> well two
11:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why u do try to be respectful to ppl that dont respect you
11:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> I'm a nice guy
11:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> :kek:
11:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nah thats called being a punch bag
11:02 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> ikr
11:08 < bridge_> <.laxa> Made a small python script to get latest map finishes and compare players for maps to finish that were unfinished as well as heuristics for next maps to finish. Nothing extraordinary but I thought I would share if anyone wants to use it: https://pastebin.com/SdNit7KG

11:26 < bridge_> <.laxa> here it is
11:28 < bridge_> <learath2> Nah, we are a space age autocracy now, we use cutting edge deep packet inspection
11:29 < bridge_> <.laxa> What, how are you analyzing encrypted trafic though?
11:30 < bridge_> <avolicious> Is Turkyie for real doing DPI now?
11:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> The CHN Great Firewall does something similar, its a pain
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats DPI
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a deep packet inspection
11:40 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> we are not so different afterall
11:56 < bridge_> <learath2> SNI is not encrypted. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs what they are looking for
11:57 < bridge_> <learath2> I can connect to the server pastebin is hosted on if I request a different website
11:58 < bridge_> <.laxa> Hope its the default host then üòÑ
11:58 < bridge_> <.laxa> I guess they filter direct IP connection through HTTPS too ?
12:26 < bridge_> <learath2> They don‚Äôt seem to
12:26 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:27 < bridge_> <learath2> https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-08.html ECH seems rather shit to me. It seems they only really considered the case where you are behind some protection cartel
12:27 < bridge_> <learath2> They introduce 2 topologies, then they proceed to never talk about the topology where you aren‚Äôt behind cloudflare or fastly or some other service
12:30 < bridge_> <learath2> What SNI am I supposed to have in my ClientHelloOuter even?
12:49 < bridge_> <.laxa> Well, their filtering is shit then. When doing audit at clients, when they wanna filter, they just strictly forbid hostnames with IP for HTTPS
14:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Support for the ‚ÄúRealtimeSanitizer‚Äù was added. RTSan can be used to detect real-time violations e.g. calls to methods that aren‚Äôt safe for use in functions with deterministic runtime requirements. d010ec6.

15:14 < bridge_> <blazulite> hey
15:14 < bridge_> <blazulite> uhh
15:14 < bridge_> <blazulite> I'm going to start a new project, which is a ddnet/tw client specifically for fng
15:14 < bridge_> <blazulite> with a ton of features and stuff
15:14 < bridge_> <blazulite> so uhh
15:15 < bridge_> <blazulite> what do you recommend me to use as the code base? the ddnet client, the teeworlds client orr just working it out of zero
15:15 < bridge_> <blazulite> what do you recommend me to use as the code base? the ddnet client, the teeworlds client orr just making the code from scratch
15:19 < bridge_> <blazulite> with a ton of features, qol changes and stuff
15:19 < bridge_> <avolicious> Making the code from scratch - ||I recommend to use the DDNet Client Codebase, to get actual support||
15:21 < bridge_> <blazulite> I was considering making the code from zero with the only purpose of making it organized on my own way and porting it to raylib
15:21 < bridge_> <blazulite> but yeah, I think using the ddnet client codebase would be a great idea
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cya in 2 years
15:22 < bridge_> <blazulite> my obsession with organization's getting too far I thinküòî
15:26 < bridge_> <avolicious> But why not re-using existing? Maybe you can contribute to upstream DDNet then
15:26 < bridge_> <avolicious> If you find something broken
15:30 < bridge_> <blazulite> idrk
15:30 < bridge_> <blazulite> it's also to train myself when it comes to coding yk
15:31 < bridge_> <blazulite> tbh my main idea is making my own take on the teeworlds' fng experience but also bringing something brand new at the same time, and I acknowledge many MANY players aren't big fans of changes / new stuff so I prefer just making it a separate thing, if it makes sense(?
15:32 < bridge_> <blazulite> idrk how to explain it
15:32 < bridge_> <blazulite> but ig you get my point
15:32 < bridge_> <avolicious> But then start with something more easy
15:32 < bridge_> <blazulite> I mean I have started already
15:32 < bridge_> <avolicious> Try to refactor the ddnet client codebase
15:32 < bridge_> <blazulite> not a looOOOng time ago but
15:32 < bridge_> <blazulite> I did
15:39 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: Do you have required code to connect a tee to server not in assembly?
15:59 < bridge_> <gumbatw> ChillerDragon: How do u finance ur full-time github influencer lifestyle?
16:00 < bridge_> <gumbatw> And how shall we tag u in chat?
16:09 < bridge_> <gumbatw> Other question: I want to write a ddnet python client as a fun side project (prob headless, just chat etc). However, im complete noob in game programming, network etc (only do data science). Where should I start with it, i guess i have to figure out what the client sends to the server and what it gets back?
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> start by doing simpler things
16:19 < bridge_> <gumbatw> üò†
16:20 < bridge_> <melo∆û> :kek:  @gumbatw learn rust
16:20 < bridge_> <melo∆û> trust
16:46 < bridge_> <louis> i think chillerdragon or someone has a python ish client
16:46 < bridge_> <louis> maybe start by looking there
16:48 < bridge_> <melo∆û> chiller just wrote a client able to connect to the server in pure assembly :kek:
16:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @gumbatw try implementing the teeworlds huffman coding in python
16:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u will need it anyway for the client networking
16:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @gumbatw try implementing the teeworlds huffman coding compression in python
16:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also the int packing

16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/libtw2-doc/int/
16:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and if u have doubts or cant get it, u can check <https://github.com/edg-l/TeeAI/blob/master/engine/huffman.py> but i recommend u dont until u tried hard enough
17:08 < bridge_> <0xfaulty> And when approximately do we plan on increasing this size? I would be extremely grateful. I can do a separate PR on this if needed to make it work now, not when the 128 server support PR is accepted since it might not be anytime soon
17:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
17:17 < bridge_> <zaerin__> what about after learning the compression algorithm
17:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do that first then we talk
17:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
17:24 < bridge_> <learath2> You are sending 16KiB of serverinfo?
17:25 < bridge_> <0xfaulty> I send more then 16kb, as we have 128 max clients, and too many players with long nickname and clan
17:26 < bridge_> <0xfaulty> here are details
17:29 < bridge_> <0xfaulty> as I said before for temporary workaround I hard limited with 102 (approx value) max players that will be send to master, but waiting for size increase
17:30 < bridge_> <zaerin__> the plan is making a chat bridge btw
17:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> i just saw the concrete lang repo and the Alan Kay quote
17:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> so i had to frantically look back in commit history to see when it was added and to my relief it wasn't by ryo
17:44 < bridge_> <Peakies> https://edgl.dev/blog/ui-code-ddnet/
17:44 < bridge_> <Peakies> `More to come soon.`
17:44 < bridge_> <Peakies> we are waiting üòç
18:14 < bridge_> <avolicious> Damn, master server traffic goes stonks
18:31 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Game server traffic is way more üòÑ
18:39 < bridge_> <avolicious> But if the server count increases = more traffic for the master
18:39 < bridge_> <avolicious> Right?
18:42 < bridge_> <chairn> that sounds logical
18:47 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Of course, you can see the traffic here: https://ddnet.org/stats/server/#master2.ddnet.org
18:48 < bridge_> <0xdeen> ~4 TB/month
18:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> 4 TB is a lot
19:11 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you think there's a way to make c function pointer syntax less ugly?
19:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> Macros
19:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I ask for my language xd
19:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Steal go's
19:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Mhm, they use func keyword and it makes sense because they use it for function definitions as well
19:41 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Can I ask you a question?
19:42 < bridge_> <patiga> sure :)
19:42 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> which phone can I get for a new ddnet client?
19:42 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> up to 11 thousand
19:43 < bridge_> <patiga> in chinese currency?
19:43 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> ouch
19:43 < bridge_> <patiga> any semi-modern phone should be able to run ddnet though
19:43 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> I'm from Russia, I forgot
19:44 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> sorry
19:44 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> I know, just which phone do you recommend?
19:45 < bridge_> <patiga> I can't help there sorry :/
19:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> When port ddnet to nokia?
19:45 < bridge_> <patiga> though my advice would be to buy a refurbished phone (not sure if that is also a thing in russia)
19:45 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Okay, thanks for responding.
19:45 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> Yes
19:46 < bridge_> <lockzeee_95860> any phone number is accepted here üôÇ
19:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Well there is a reason all the newfangled languages flipped the function definitions around
19:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I can do it as well xdd
20:13 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I'll use smth like `void(u8, u16*) foo;`
20:16 < bridge_> <zhn> rust's function pointer definition looks saner
20:17 < bridge_> <zhn> rust's function pointer definition looks more sane
20:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Ye, if i was defining functions like `fn foo(...) -> ret_type` it would make sense
20:18 < bridge_> <zhn> never look at c3-lang function definition syntax
20:20 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I think fn keyword before type looks ass

22:55 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> @diariesvexar hi i do this one exactly and the command didnt work https://edgl.dev/blog/chat-command-ddracenetwork/
23:01 < bridge_> <deathgood> ok but like it's a real question though why can't they just do that
23:05 < bridge_> <gumbatw> because its a *distributed* denial of service attack, meaning the malicious traffic comes from a multitude of random ips drom a botnet etc? Hard to distinguish real traffic from fake without impairing gameplay for players on the server
23:06 < bridge_> <deathgood> ok multiple ips makes sense
23:06 < bridge_> <deathgood> so then you just have to blacklist more than one ip
23:06 < bridge_> <deathgood> super shrimple
23:09 < bridge_> <gumbatw> but ips are redistributed after a certain time, so the pcs of the botnet which are unknowingly infected with malware will not be blacklisted anymore, but random people will be
23:09 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> and if you dont ban ip but matherial ban
23:09 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> and if you dont ban ip but matherial ban ?
23:10 < bridge_> <gumbatw> There are definetly ways to implement a better ddos protection/get more bandwidth to deal with those packets, but that involves money which is hard to get as ddnet is only donation based funded
23:10 < bridge_> <deathgood> ok maybe after a certain amount of packets blacklist it but for like 10 minutes
23:10 < bridge_> <deathgood> yea i kinda see howit's not as simple as i first thought it was tho
23:11 < bridge_> <gumbatw> yeah, i don't have the best overview either, but i know that there are very capable people on this project who havent found a doable solution in all those years
23:12 < bridge_> <gumbatw> Maybe this blog post by @0xdeen is interesting for you: https://hookrace.net/blog/dos-attacks-update/
23:14 < bridge_> <gumbatw> I think not much information about hardware is transmitted in those malicious packet
23:16 < bridge_> <gumbatw> I mean, ger10 works quite well, it works kind of the other way around: You have to whitelist ur ip on ger10.ddnet.org and all other traffic has low priority/gets not through. Even though i dont understand how the dossers not just do that aswell. I guess paid services dont offer this extra wish
23:16 < bridge_> <.lepinpin> like if at the install you create a variable and this variable is = to the matherial and throught the packet you put this variable and  if to much you block this pc
23:17 < bridge_> <patiga> you can't just "block a pc" as a server
23:17 < bridge_> <patiga> same here, blacklisting doesn't solve the problem
23:17 < bridge_> <gumbatw> I think me & you don't know enough about networking xd
23:17 < bridge_> <patiga> there is still too much traffic
23:18 < bridge_> <patiga> there are just so many malicious requests, so that if you 'ignore' one, you still have too many malicious requests to handle/ignore
23:18 < bridge_> <patiga> the packets of the normal players just disappear with all that traffic
23:21 < bridge_> <gumbatw> do accounts help with that problem btw? Like uou do an authenticity handcheck on first connection and then have a different channel to handel that traffic?
23:21 < bridge_> <nouaa> if you want, @reitw made a *working* ddos protection for tw, feel free to learn some stuff on his blog: https://reitw.fr/blog/aya-xdp-pcap/
23:26 < bridge_> <gumbatw> are u stating that BW is 100% ddos free? Fully stable?
23:27 < bridge_> <nouaa> technically yes, it's juste that ovh blocks legitimate traffic
23:27 < bridge_> <nouaa> technically yes, it's just that ovh blocks legitimate traffic
23:28 < bridge_> <nouaa> well never say 100%
