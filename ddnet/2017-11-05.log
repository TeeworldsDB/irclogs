20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> Hey, since my topic about this (https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=5821) has not recieved any answer, i thgought i might ask here...
21:16 <+Learath2> there might not be a way to make deepfly 100% without breaking some other physics element, you'll need to wait for someone who actually knows that part of the code for a definitive answer tho
