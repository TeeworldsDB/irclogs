07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> Hello @deen  I wanted to ask why people like @fokkonaut are allowed to continue working on your DDNET  project knowing that he is acting like a child and deleting everything as soon as he does not get what he wants. Well my question is why such a person is not getting punished if he sells Teeworlds mods for a price of 150 ‚Ç¨ and makes the source accessible to everyone afterwards
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the person i sold it to suggested that price.
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is allowed to sell open source software, also this guy did not stop asking, why shouldnt i do it then?
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> nice scam
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why make people pay money for something ur just going to give everyone for free afterwards
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not stonks
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @LickouT usury is definitely not nice, and I'm disappointed people in this community would do that. From what I know @fokkonaut only has access to the ddnet7 project, which he started and is the main guy working on. For DDNet itself the quality of the changes matters, not who made them and how much we like them or whether we approve of their behaviour.
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i believe he is talking about a separate mod that fokonaut made, not ddnet7
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShootXen> üçø
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShootXen> Well I still dont know why ppl are selling their mods, ofc it's time they spend but in a opensrc game
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @ShootXen wanna buy a fng
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I sold a copy of my F-DDrace mod, which I am working on for almost a year now. I started it in 0.6 and ported it to 0.7 and continued the work on it after I ported ddnet to 0.7
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 150‚Ç¨ is definitely not too much for the amount of work and time I put into the mod.
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and yes: it is open source now. But there is no problem about it. It is my choice whether I publish it or not, no matter whether I sold a copy before
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> scummy af
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye its a bit weird
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> it just depends what he sold
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if just A copy of The mod
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> or the ownership or telling the person he is going to be The only one
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if nothing like that happend the guy is just retarded for buying
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> and not talking about it with him
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Exactly. I just sold a copy, not the ownership. Also, I never said anything about he will be the only one or anything like that.
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <frizoluszek> gay move
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye its shitty
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> selling a copy as an owner of that partnership? without the known of other people? fucked up imo
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but we know you are a greedy untrusty guy like that
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but we know now you are a greedy untrusty guy like that
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> unless you work alone, that incase why the fuck we care bout that
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nice move fokko. retard doest deserve his money
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Cellegen i work alone
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Im 'corneum xd
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah it seems the buyer is the guy who didn't used his brain:monkaS:
15:52 < ***> Buffer Playback...
15:52 <+bridge> [13:45:26] [ddnet] <tea> guys its ‚Ç¨150 im pretty sure half of y'all would suck a dick for ‚Ç¨20

17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this is not how you play economy
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :lol:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Cha lol, 150‚Ç¨ is nothing for me
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i even brought a house out of nothing, this is no big deal
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> kid
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm did i just brag about money:justatest:
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This is ridiculous... @yee is the guy, blocked me now on Discord and changed the modname to BW, uncredited me everywhere possible, changed some command output to worse english, left some the same, still has most stuff as i had it before...
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have no idea how one can be so ignorant and stupid. Sorry.
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @fokkonaut <a:DansGameVomit:597002177336311808>
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> he can modify it how he wants. You are the last person to complain scammer
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noob, deletes message
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you calm down, both?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> U
