00:18 < Java> Hello.
14:16 < pixel_> Hi, i need an administrator!
14:22 <@heinrich5991> what's up?
14:25 < pixel_> Hey ... what is the phpBB version from the forum.ddnet.tw? :P
14:25 <@EastByte> I think deen recently updated it to the newest version
14:25 < pixel_> 3.1.8??
14:25 <@heinrich5991> why do you ask?
14:25 <@EastByte> probably because of vulns
14:26 < pixel_> because my site looks different ... is it because deen programmed a lot alone??
14:26 <@EastByte> oh?
14:26 < pixel_> and didnt jist copy
14:26 <@EastByte> do you mean the forum design?
14:27 < pixel_> nah ... all buttons
14:27 <@EastByte> I don't the a difference
14:28 < pixel_> ...???
14:28 <@EastByte> I don't see the difference*
14:29 < pixel_> hm ... if anyone meets dean, can ask for the version?
14:32 <@EastByte> hm I probably can look it up somehow
14:33 <@deen> most recent version, 3.1.8, but our theme is probably weird
14:34 <@deen> because i made the theme based on some old version and it's probably not updated
14:34 <@EastByte> ah
14:34 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/phpbb/prosilver-ddnet
14:35 < pixel_> thx :)))
14:36 <@deen> but i would not recommend using our theme, it has some bugs, probably exactly because it is old
14:37 < pixel_> ^^
14:38 < pixel_> other question ... i always get an error in my ACP  it says 
14:39 < pixel_> Das ausgewählte Such-Backend hat keinen Sichindex, Bitte erstelle den Index für 'phpBB Native Fulltext' im Bereich *Such-Indizes"
14:44 <@deen> dunno
