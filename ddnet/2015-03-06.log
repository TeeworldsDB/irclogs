00:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #160: Make the secure random stuff platform-independent (DDRace64...pr_ddnet_random_windows) http://git.io/xAjT
01:57 <@deen> the token stuff doesn't help against clogging the servers, right?
01:57 <@deen> one block server is full with 64 spoofed ip clients right now
02:32 < eeeee> deen: if we drop vanilla compatibility then it will help :P
02:33 < eeeee> so, no
02:33 < eeeee> didn't you have some other clogging protection with pings
02:34 <@deen> pings?
02:35 <@deen> right, we had something but I removed it recently because it didn't work well with http map download^^
02:35 <@deen> and it was never enabled on DDNet anyway because of problems
02:37 < eeeee> i guess we'll have to fix that too someday :/
02:37 <@deen> probably soon
02:38 <@deen> they're still blocking the entire server =/
06:50 < eeeee> okay i found a bug in tokens
07:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #161: fix timeout protection with tokens (DDRace64...timeout_protection_token_fix) http://git.io/xpcV
07:39 < eeeee> other than that, seems to work
08:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #162: fix missing size_t definition on mac (DDRace64...mac_build) http://git.io/xpze
10:40 <@EastByte> deen: that still is the easiest way to dos a server
10:41 <@EastByte> eeeee: no need to drop vanilla support?
10:44 <@EastByte> we could add an additional client array with dynamic size as a pre state for clients connecting

11:55 <@deen> EastByte: well, they even finish connecting and just stand around ingame
12:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: what's your current vanilla client share?
12:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: on ddnet servers or where?
12:18 <@heinrich5991> yes
12:19 <@deen> i don't have any real statistics
12:19 <@heinrich5991> I could imagine only allowing 1/2, 2/3 or 1/3 vanilla
12:19 <@deen> i just sometimes open f2 and look at "status"
12:19 <@heinrich5991> that would allow people with ddnet client to still connect
12:19 <@deen> heinrich5991: that would probably work on the ddrace servers, but not the block ones
12:19 <@deen> and in some locations people really don't use ddnet client
12:20 <@deen> hm
12:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: I could try to port this to the vanilla client and then you can tell people to either get the modded vanilla client or ddnet client if they can't join the server due to flood
12:21 <@deen> nono, they use some other custom clients
12:21 <@deen> with bots and stuff, not vanilla :P
12:21 <@deen> or with chinese language support
12:21 <@heinrich5991> then tell them to ask the modder to apply the patch
12:21 <@heinrich5991> I'd say
12:22 <@heinrich5991> e.g. reserve 1/3 of the slots for clients that can do token stuff
12:22 <@heinrich5991> that shouldn't hurt too much
12:22 <@deen> yeah, should be totally fine
12:22 <@deen> otherwise just show a message "Only DDNet client can connect"
12:22 <@deen> but people would think it's just a stunt to get more to use ddnet client :P
12:22 <@heinrich5991> also show an explanation, otherwise people will get mad
12:22 <@deen> indeed
12:23 <@deen> but i'm still not sure
12:23 <@heinrich5991> make a forum post with the patch
12:23 <@heinrich5991> additionally
12:23 <@deen> it's still bad if they can fill every one of our servers to 2/3
12:23 <@heinrich5991> so people can apply it to their fancy bot clients
12:23 <@heinrich5991> maybe they'll stop doing it once people can get around it
12:23 <@heinrich5991> because it's no longer effective
12:23 <@deen> they aren't really doing it yet at all
12:24 <@deen> last night seemed like a test run
12:25 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I guess the token stuff doesn't yet work allocation-less until the client responds?
12:25 <@heinrich5991> that's kind of the pre-condition for reserver 1/n of the slots for clients that can do it
15:00 <@EastByte> deen: yea, before clients get ingame there has to be a check against ip spoofing of course
15:04 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: we don't need to drop vanilla support in any way, there already is an anti ip spoofing protection
15:04 <@EastByte> it just needs some tweaking
15:11 <@heinrich5991> I was just proposing to reserve some slots for clients that support the token protocol
15:11 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: ^
15:11 < Learath2> heinrich5991: wouldnt your pullrequest for vanilla fix all this ? :D
15:11 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:12 <@heinrich5991> but Oy doesn't like it really if I get it correctly
15:12 <@EastByte> okay
15:14 < Learath2> maybe we should reimplement the spoof protection deen removed
15:15 < Learath2> it was badly written serverside thats why it didnt work well with http download
15:18 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I doubt such a patch will be applied by many coders :/
15:19 <@EastByte> for example the unmaintained closed 13x37 client is still one of the most used since 2 years
15:19 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: oh I'm sure someone will do something once they can't connect to ddnet when a spoofing attack is in place
15:19 <@EastByte> and barely anyone will notice the fix since not everyone can run such an attack
15:20 <@EastByte> ah, that way
15:20 <@heinrich5991> anyone who bothers can run that attack
15:20 <@EastByte> ip spoofing?
15:20 <@deen> heinrich5991: really? is it that easy to get a server that can spoof any ip?
15:21 <@heinrich5991> I think so
15:21 <@EastByte> I think windows vps often are vunerable for that
15:21 <@EastByte> openvz won't work at all
15:21 <@heinrich5991> KVM works?
15:21 <@heinrich5991> or why windows VPS?
15:21 <@EastByte> badly configured, yes
15:22 <@EastByte> hmm
15:22 <@EastByte> because some hosters rely on old windows hosting solutions and stuff?
15:22 <@EastByte> it's windows...
15:23 <@EastByte> and pikotee once told me about that
15:24 <@heinrich5991> I know at least one server that can spoof but does not run Windows
15:28 < Learath2> how do you even search for a 
15:28 < Learath2> provider that doesnt implement BCP38
15:29 < Learath2> even if the packets leave the physical machine how does it make it out of their network is what boggles my mind
15:30 <@EastByte> ^
15:30 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: it's a lot cheaper if you don't have to check the source address in routers
15:31 <@heinrich5991> my proof-of-concept implementation of IP that I produced for a course also didn't have spoof protection
15:31 <@EastByte> but ip spoofing attacks e.g. causing reflection attacks are really heavy and should be prevented in any way
15:31 < Learath2> i think profit > cost here
15:34 <@heinrich5991> it's tragedy of the commons
15:34 <@heinrich5991> you don't benefit if you do this, it only costs you
15:34 <@heinrich5991> you only benefit when everyone else does it

19:53 < Spyker> deen! maybe i created a multy editor!!!!!!!
19:54 < Spyker> wait.... for the moment it is  very buggy!
19:54 < Spyker> but mb i can fix bugs!
19:54  * Spyker slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
19:55 < Spyker> but waiting multiplayer map editor, you can have fun with rank 1 in just fly! and mb put it on ddnet start page?

20:06 < eeeee> yeah wouldn't be terribly hard to be allocation-less before the client replies back with token
20:07 < eeeee> but i hoped we could have spoof protection that also works with vanilla
20:24 < Learath2> eeeee: there was a spoof protection which worked with vanilla 
20:26 < fstd> i wrote one too few years back
20:26 < fstd> was kind of a hack though
20:32 <@EastByte> the one that was implemented in ddnet made a handshake by simulating a mapchange
20:32 <@EastByte> I guess by forcing the client to request the right number of chunks... not sure
20:33 <@deen> right
21:01 < Learath2> should test autoupdate with other platforms and actual update data
21:01 < eeeee> i don't see how reserved non-vanilla slots would solve anything
21:02 <@EastByte> encourage people to use a fixed client
21:02 < eeeee> kidz will still fill vanilla slots, flood the chat and funvote
21:03 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: will allow people to play that are using a client which doesn't have that problem
21:04 < eeeee> if you hide chats, leave/join/namechange msgs from vanilla clients and disable voting then maybe
21:06 < Learath2> should re add that spoof protection or some other kind of spoof protection
