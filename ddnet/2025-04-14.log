09:06 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> morning
09:29 < bridge_> <0xdeen> @gorp_tw Thanks! ^
09:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ofc, thank you for taking the time to hear us out. üôÇ
09:36 < bridge_> <Assa> good morning ‚ù§Ô∏è
09:37 < bridge_> <Assa> and others :kek:
09:49 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> @gorp_tw where are those servers hosted exactly
09:49 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> cuz im wondering where i would get the best ping
09:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> European players that want to play with us would get the best ping on USA2 which is on the east coast (Virginia)
09:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> East Asian players would get decent ping to USA4 which is on the west coast
09:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> @alw5 now you can LARP as an American more easily, gg
09:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> everyone was complaining about usa3 but i got the best ping there xd
09:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i had like 120-130 usually
09:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> while on other its closer to 160
09:59 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i mean you would, it's farther north
10:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> USA1 is south
10:03 < bridge_> <always> ez
10:04 < bridge_> <always> i could always argue im a west coast player and thats why i get 100 ping
10:04 < bridge_> <always> or like alaska
10:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i actually don't think ive met a single Alaskan player
10:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> not one that is outted as Alaskan anyway
10:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> probably not very American of me but I think of Alaska like some other country :kek:
10:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> imagine trying to play DDNet in Hawaii though
10:36 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
10:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> static auto s_ReadLine = [pFile](char *pBuf, int Length) -> bool {
10:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(!std::fgets(pBuf, sizeof(pBuf), pFile))
10:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
10:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> pro programmers, spot the mistake
10:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> spoiler: ||sizeof(pBuf) == 4||
10:49 < bridge_> <Assa> Watch out with static and pFile
10:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> should be &
10:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i think
10:51 < bridge_> <Assa> yes but static lambdas are only initialized once, this was the issue last time with mine
10:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and an issue i was debugging as you said that
10:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i also wansnt closing the files
10:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> dangling fd!!!
10:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> &pFile = stack use after return
10:57 < bridge_> <learath2> Why are you staticing all the lambdas?
10:58 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont know
10:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> pro programmers, spot the mistake
10:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> spoiler: ||sizeof(pBuf) == 4||
10:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> spoiler2: ||static == explosion||
10:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Then just don't static the lambda
10:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> thats what i did
11:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> how do lambdas/closures look in assembly? :thonk:
11:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Like a function mostly. With a this argument that points to the closure object if it's capturing
11:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Like a function mostly. With a first argument that points to the closure object if it's capturing
11:06 < bridge_> <Assa> They get very often inlined
11:12 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> interesting
11:12 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361267773321379891/image.png?ex=67fe22e8&is=67fcd168&hm=45b1d1f5e5b20e0b26f6c787c9bc0f5c4ec95ec20dcd9373319b48fc31df0783&
11:14 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> does anyone want to hold hands in the code maybe üò≥
11:14 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> show me around
11:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i want to get involved with ddnet stuff directly instead of just memeposting on issues
11:17 < bridge_> <Assa> try again with -O2
11:18 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> might jsut get reutnr 0x67
11:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It will remove all the code xd
11:18 < bridge_> <Assa> oh yeah üòÇ
11:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I wanted to see generated code for lambdas
11:20 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if life is determanistic it would be constexpr meaning it would be optimized to just a return value meaning life wouldnt be exist
11:20 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> thus life is not deteramistic
11:20 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> take that dermatologists
11:32 < bridge_> <Assa> you assume the universe get's optimized
11:33 < bridge_> <Assa> maybe we it is but we are in the compile step currently trying to optimize us
11:33 < bridge_> <Assa> maybe it is but we are in the compile step currently trying to optimize us
11:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> woaw
11:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> thats deep
11:41 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> so no one wants to hold hands... ok
11:42 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i will buy the big o Reilly book with a squirrel on it or something like this to learn cpp
12:46 < bridge_> <Assa> @gorp go on github, search for issues good for beginners, implement PR, profit
12:48 < bridge_> <Assa> @gorp_tw  go on github, search for issues good for beginners, implement PR, profit
12:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> There are tons of minor things you can fix
12:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> Just don't do them all at once with no regard for the reviewers time like me
13:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Is that not mostly what I said? Perhaps I was wrong about the first argument, holding the closure object. It might be using rcx in an hope to avoid clobbering the callers arguments
13:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It is. I'll learn more when I'll try to make closures in my lang.
13:36 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, make them small chunks, incoming maplayers-5
13:41 < bridge_> <teero777> make them volatile xd
14:17 < bridge_> <Assa> @gorp_tw here a beginner issue, should be easy for you ^.^
14:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Phy changes are end game
14:36 < bridge_> <Assa> this is no change, it's just an addition :justatest: :justatest: :justatest:
14:38 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @gorp_tw: you could add accounts
14:39 < bridge_> <A Moderator> can you remove 0.7
14:40 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oh yea good idea drop this legacy 15 year old 0.6 protocol
14:41 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> implement 0.9
14:41 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> MODULAR SKINSSS
14:41 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if no one wants to touch it, i might
14:42 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Touch what
14:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> modular skins
14:42 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> We already have them
14:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> 0.7 are eeeeh

15:34 < bridge_> <ar1gin> anyone knows what causes these weird fps spikes?
15:34 < bridge_> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361333871458648084/image.png?ex=67fe6077&is=67fd0ef7&hm=38ca8e32e26c9fcbfb6063f22a473ac34f3de691b29618008772253a6b7f458c&
15:35 < bridge_> <ar1gin> vulkan renderer, amd gpu, vsync on (75hz)
15:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably vsync xd
15:36 < bridge_> <ar1gin> but vsync should keep it stable? :P
15:36 < bridge_> <ar1gin> also turning it off doesnt seem to help
15:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What's your max fps?
15:37 < bridge_> <ar1gin> 75 hz monitor, refresh rate 75 too
15:37 < bridge_> <ar1gin> oh and its linux forgot it say
15:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah but what's your max possible
15:38 < bridge_> <ar1gin> if I uncap?
15:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I could imagine `cl_refresh_rate` could do weird things like this. Did you set a value for it?
15:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
15:39 < bridge_> <ar1gin> hmm, it was 150 but I uncapped tps and it 1k now
15:39 < bridge_> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361335008136007760/image.png?ex=67fe6186&is=67fd1006&hm=28320f6f024f7e521724b597f311724a47c2f90bba441c463c10a1a05260e97d&
15:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Was `cl_refresh_rate` non zero?
15:39 < bridge_> <ar1gin> yes, 150
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then I assume it was that. Does only turning on vsync also show this behavior?
15:41 < bridge_> <ar1gin> no? vsync affects nothing
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What?
15:42 < bridge_> <ar1gin> wait, what "behavior" are we talking about? fps spikes?
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
15:42 < bridge_> <ar1gin> vsync does not help nor remove it
15:42 < bridge_> <ar1gin> seems like its only affected by tps
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `cl_refresh_rate 0; gfx_refresh_rate 0; gfx_vsync 1; gfx_asyncrender_old 0`
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Should give you 75 fps
15:43 < bridge_> <ar1gin> yes yes, it does
15:43 < bridge_> <ar1gin> thanks for uhh resolving it then..
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah sry, do you expect a technical answer?
15:44 < bridge_> <ar1gin> still, tps cap shouldn't do that..
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `cl_refresh_rate` is simply a weirdo
15:44 < bridge_> <ar1gin> oh okay then üòÑ
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think it makes sense.
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cl_refresh_rate sleeps independent of FPS
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So If you are unlucky you get a bad frame time, and then render again and get a good frame time and then you get some weird graphs like above
15:45 < bridge_> <ar1gin> thought it probably should adjust its sleep times to account for lost frames or something
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `gfx_refresh_rate` does that
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd recommend using that to limit fps
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except you have major heating problems with your CPU
15:46 < bridge_> <ar1gin> yeah, would be preferable to limit both fps and tps..
15:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tps = ticks per second?
15:48 < bridge_> <ar1gin> yes, cl_refresh_rate
15:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Use this then
15:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then your CPU has to wait for vsync
15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> wasnt there a dedicated config for that in the old versions?
15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> something like cl_limit_fps
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not that I am aware of, maybe in teeworlds client. But the cmds above should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è do what arigin wants
15:51 < bridge_> <ar1gin> oh, seems like the issue has resolved! ‚ù§Ô∏è
15:52 < bridge_> <ar1gin> forgot to put in the last command it seems
15:58 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> aah ye i checked it seems to be vanilla thing
15:58 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> theres `gfx_limitfps`
16:36 < bridge_> <Assa> soon to be more fps üòé
16:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C++ is such a meme

17:18 < bridge_> <avolicious> why dont alias cat to bat?
17:22 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> why would they? cat is still cat
17:22 < bridge_> <avolicious> bat > cat
17:23 < bridge_> <avolicious> https://ohok.org/bat-is-the-better-cat/
17:24 < bridge_> <avolicious> also switched my ls to https://github.com/eza-community/eza
17:30 < bridge_> <Assa> ü¶á > üê±
17:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still use cat sometimes for what it is for: concatination
17:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> could alias less to bat 
17:33 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> well seems like bat should do concatenation just fine
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah fair
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but also i dont mind typing "bat" i see no disadvantage over typing "cat"
17:34 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah
17:34 < bridge_> <avolicious> muscle memory
17:34 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm not a huge fan of replacing standard utilities
17:35 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> even though I know it makes sense to do
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rewrite in C!
17:35 < bridge_> <avolicious> In rust I trust
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in C we segfault!
17:35 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like rg is cool for example and makes sense
17:36 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something like fish is a no no for me
17:38 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I wouldn't replace the old ones though because they're almost never fully compatible with the flags that the original takes
17:42 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I use both rg and grep
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I use cat | grep
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and chiller feels offended
17:45 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for maximum redundancy :gigachad:
17:45 < bridge_> <louis> any nanoers
17:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am a microer

17:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> nanoer here
17:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> @essigautomat sure I can give that one a shot

17:57 < bridge_> <Assa> cat gep nano, vi, whatever is needed atm
17:59 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i tried to use micro but my puny brain couldn't deal with the 2% added complexity
18:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> aye
18:20 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> DDNet builds in 8 seconds for me. is that good
18:22 < bridge_> <louis> for complete compile its pretty good
18:22 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> do you expect it to be slower
18:22 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i figured it would be
18:22 < bridge_> <louis> what s ur cpu
18:23 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 12700kf :greenthing:
18:23 < bridge_> <always> for a complite compile???
18:23 < bridge_> <always> dude it takes me like 1 min
18:23 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i didnt even use dev flag
18:24 < bridge_> <always> on release or debug
18:24 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> whatever default flag is probably debug
18:24 < bridge_> <always> yea it is default debug
18:24 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> still tho
18:25 < bridge_> <always> debug compiles slower
18:25 < bridge_> <always> i think?
18:25 < bridge_> <always> are u building all or just the client
18:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> idk man i havent compiled ddnet in a long ass time, all defaults
18:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> dude im just trying to find where the speedup layer is üò≠
18:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> also to whoever did the xy flipping for speedup. i love u so much
18:35 < bridge_> <always> probaly ass
18:36 < bridge_> <always> assasin
18:36 < bridge_> <always> assa
18:38 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i have been looking for the +/- buttons for like 10 minutes
18:39 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> oh i just thought of an issue i might try, adding a server setting should stick it under the cursor position, if set
18:40 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i like to sort my server settings by tune and i normally use a ton of them, so its a pain to smash the up button
18:40 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> or just in general, a button to sort them
18:41 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ass ass in
18:44 < bridge_> <Assa> I only did the new speedtiles, xy flipping was already present, don't credit me on sb. elses work
18:47 < bridge_> <Assa> rendering? In the Map? Physics? Editor? Depends on what you need to do
18:47 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> starting with the editor right now
18:51 < bridge_> <Assa> You just need to understand, that maps are basically stacks of 2D arrays of tiles
18:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> maybe this is the line of interest https://github.com/kaitlynia/ddnet/blob/3267a94259079177d5830f1d4b382e9eb7d29201/src/game/editor/mapitems/layer_speedup.cpp#L300
18:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> sorry its on my fork üòõ
18:53 < bridge_> <Assa> this looks already good üëç
18:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i haven't changed anything XD
19:08 < bridge_> <Assa> yeah but like a good place to look
19:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ok i spent like 40 minutes trying to find +/-
19:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> gg
19:27 < bridge_> <always> it all makes sense
19:27 < bridge_> <always> kaitlyniagorp
19:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> already giveth up
19:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> maybe i try again another time
19:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i mean like i found that when you fill/draw with a brush it would allow you to put zero force
19:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but the thing that updates it back to 1 if u go under i couldnt find
19:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i tried grep -RH with force
19:32 < furo> @gorp_tw Search for `"Max Speed"` and you will find the possible min/max for each fields.
19:42 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> thank you üôÇ
19:43 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> that should be the only thing needed, now need to test the behavior to see if it is expected

19:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> is it using 100% cpu
19:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> try ctrl-z
19:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> no 9%
19:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> weird
19:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> or just killall -9 DDNet
19:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i have another instance of ddnet open so using top is not easy in this case
19:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> teehee
19:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ah
19:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ill close game
19:50 < bridge_> <Assa> i bet there will be an issue in placing and displaying the tile
19:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> force 0 is considered valid in other areas
19:51 < bridge_> <Assa> also MapIO might be an issue
19:52 < bridge_> <Assa> As the gui who refactors rendering.... there WILL be an issue
19:52 < bridge_> <Assa> As the guy who refactors rendering.... there WILL be an issue
19:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (gui is funny here)
19:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (good pun)
19:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i really wish you had just kept that
19:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> im upset

19:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> u would be faster at this than me...
19:58 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the point is ur learning how to do it
19:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ddnet doesnt even want to run tho
19:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> WSG???
19:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> tell me your issue now
19:59 < bridge_> <Assa> yes but its about learning

19:59 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i do want to learn
19:59 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> puppy
20:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> gorp
20:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you live in like canada or some shit bro
20:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> colorados
20:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ohh
20:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> have u been to portland
20:01 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> and if so, how do u feel denver compares
20:01 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> cus my family REALLY wants to move to denver
20:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i haven‚Äôt been
20:01 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> sorry Assa i will keep trying but let me procrastinate first
20:01 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> with mindless conversation
20:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wonder whats the issue
20:01 < bridge_> <Assa> You know that you now need to program 20% more @mpft ? okay lets not open that rabbit hole
20:01 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> dude i have no idea it hangs after OpenGL init
20:02 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i have all the deps
20:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> what OS

20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> distro
20:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> all included
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> i mean
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> can u play other games
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> without hang
20:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yessir
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> do u have gdb installed
20:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> uuuuh
20:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> probably not
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> well
20:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> apparently i do
20:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
20:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I can just change first `else if` to `if` and remove that statement completely, right?
20:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> bounds is already checked elsewhere
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> u changed some stuff?\
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> i cant read
20:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i changed a single integer literal so far
20:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> from 1 to 0 lol
20:07 < bridge_> <Assa> I would check for both, 0 speed and 0 max_speed
20:07 < bridge_> <Assa> both should never be 0, same for the editor slider
20:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but in this case we don't want to set `Index = 0`
20:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 0 force is now permissible
20:08 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I just got bamboozled by rust error so hard, it showed an error in wrong place and I couldn't understand what's wrong
20:08 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361402786448937082/image.png?ex=67fea0a5&is=67fd4f25&hm=54e995bcc959b07eed856853d16dbcad28facacacd1228df85ec0779f70c69b4&
20:08 < bridge_> <Assa> 0 force and 0 max speed is just a stopper, please don't allow that
20:09 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> its already in the game as i said before xD
20:09 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> do u want me to record demo
20:09 < bridge_> <Assa> also 0 max_speed is a special value for 'unlimited'
20:10 < bridge_> <Assa> I am on vacation, cant Start the game xD
20:11 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ill post
20:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea like hwat filw
20:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk if it's opengl related if it worked before this
20:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe a race condition
20:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> on something that'll never happen
20:16 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i love when roby closes my issues ><
20:16 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont have enough buttons to do bgdraw with
20:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> WHEN GORP WILL POST

20:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> for any max speed, you cant start accelerating in the direction of the arrow if you stop
20:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 1,1: can move against arrow even from 0 speed
20:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 2,1: can only move against arrow if you had some run speed before
20:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 3,1: can only move against if you had more than usual run speed from before (hook, other source, good floating point run speed) otherwise

20:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> discord embed breaks, you can see it fine locally
20:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> for any max speed, you cant start accelerating in the direction of the arrow

20:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> for any max speed 1, you cant start accelerating in the direction of the arrow
20:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 1,1: can move against arrow even from 0 speed
20:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 2,1: can only move against arrow if you had some run speed before

20:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> so its still a stopper in the direction of the arrow, and 255 is virtually a bidirectional stopper
20:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> so requesting that 0,0 is checked and considered invalid is a meaningless venture
20:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> unless now you want to ban 1 max speed too...
20:41 < bridge_> <Assa> hmm 0/0 would be meaningless, 0 max_speed is unlimited, so this is mostly equal to air
20:41 < bridge_> <Assa> 0 is a special case for max_speed
20:42 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah i guess if you try to place 0,0 it wont do anything, but is it necessarily invalid?
20:42 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you can have 0 force and max speed 0 separately
20:43 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> its like if you place a tune with no tune_zone
20:43 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> there is no harm, but obviously its bad style
20:43 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> (i guess you can exempt from global tune, but this is a bit niche)
20:45 < bridge_> <Assa> yes spereately is fine, both is the issue
20:45 < bridge_> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src%2Fgame%2Fserver%2Fentities%2Fcharacter.cpp#L1512
20:45 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> consider also that 0 switch number is permitted, just not by the use of buttons
20:45 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 unordered_map cant be constexpr
20:47 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> seems that would do nothing as you say, but i guess it's pointless math
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 unordered_map cant be constexpr
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10060#pullrequestreview-2762112122>
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> `static constexpr std::unordered_map<const char *, const ColorHSLA> NAMED_COLORS = {`
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> Constexpr variable cannot have non-literal type 'const std::unordered_map<const char *, const ColorHSLA>'clang(constexpr_var_non_literal)
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> unordered_map.h(109, 11): 'unordered_map<const char *, const ColorHSLA>' is not literal because it is not an aggregate and has no constexpr constructors other than copy or move constructors
20:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
20:48 < bridge_> <Assa> it's not pointless, it's just a much higher speed limit, the highest possible speed to be exact
20:49 < bridge_> <Assa> but very pointless to map
20:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ah does it use different ramp rules than non-speeder
20:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i guess that makes sense bc u get crazy speeds sometimes
20:49 < bridge_> <Assa> no, the same
20:49 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, that what this does
20:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i guess im confused, are you saying it bypasses normal speed limits to map with it
20:52 < bridge_> <Assa> DDNet has a global speed limit, if you go faster you will get slower. Meaning: your velocity vector gets longer, but your actual speed slows
20:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> ok we fixed opengl :brownbear:
20:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> im so helpful
20:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> no?
20:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i used my normal client
20:53 < bridge_> <Assa> The new speedtiles don't accelerate over the global maximum
20:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i found with speeders i couldnt get more than ~185 y and ~75 x speed
20:54 < bridge_> <Assa> 79 but yeah
20:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> huh i guess i was using bad values xd
20:54 < bridge_> <teero777> no? xd im pretty sure it is 75 bps
20:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i was under the impression that new tiles didnt give speed penalty for going over?
20:55 < bridge_> <Assa> bps? bits per second?
20:55 < bridge_> <Assa> blocks
20:55 < bridge_> <teero777> blocks per second
20:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> 118 and 255 gave same speed?
20:56 < bridge_> <Assa> idk
20:57 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> unrelated but i was unable to figure out why tees always lose some speed in blue tele for a tick even if there is no friction or gravity anywhre
20:57 < bridge_> <Assa> point of the new ones was to have comparable numbers , so 20 force on old is 20 force on new
20:57 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> you actually dont move at all in ddnet, the map moves instead
20:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/746534464984973323/1361415300813160691 wtf i clicked wrong channel
20:59 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> is movement evaluated at TP destinations before collision is checked?
21:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> just seems like blue tele will skip checking speeder on tpto sometimes
21:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> may be 1-tick specific

21:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
21:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> can someone explain the crack rust plp were on when doing this
21:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> these are not tests, theyre comments, they have played us for fools
21:10 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> probably someone was like huh my tests are not passing, but i know the code works so, fuck this test
21:16 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> they are actually tests
21:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> roby too powerful now, he scares me
21:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> maybe i should cut my losses and stick to fixing the website
21:18 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> then i can become purple again
