15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yo [timakro](https://matrix.to/#/@timakro:matrix.org)  what exactly did you do now to not land in ms spam?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org)\: Nothing ^^
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hax
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and it works?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think I'm still landing in spam
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Idk haven't tested it again
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, when you highlight eachother on matrix we get a link on discord which generates an annoying embed
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/issues/652
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, see also https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/issues/631
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't like the autogenerated pictures for issues from github
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Too big, no?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they seem like they mostly take space, don't provide valuable information
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Replies would actually be kinda tricky to do btw, proper replies would need the bot to keep track of a mapping between messages on discord and messages on matrix
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be an ever growing mapping that needs to be optimized for both directions
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can probably attach custom information to matrix messages
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you onlyâ„¢ need a mapping from matrix messages to discord copy IDs
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yay, I halved the space requirements
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> put the links in < >
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> <https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/issues/631>
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the header is okay (where they give the first few words of the issue)
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly half of infinity is still infinity :P
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can only delete the whole embed, not just the image
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could have a bot watching for github links, deleting the embed and generating a new one without the image :P
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 having lunch, I realized that the mapping already needs to exist somehow
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> while*
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> message deletions are synchronized between discord and matrix
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For simplicity lets say this would only work for new messages
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wait, you said it already exists for deletions?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how they do it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could keep a mapping for recent messages
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and use some API to correlate older ones
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> search for the same message content on the same day
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Recent you could yeah, limiting the range seems to be the only viable solution. Searching for message content is ew
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is the only implementation of GSL microsofts?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ ?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, you always end up with the wrong acronym, I meant Guidelines Support Library
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u always use too many acronyms imho
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/microsoft/GSL
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't elaborate on the acronym because we were talking about gsl like yesterday, assumed people would remember
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe i got this entire search engine for me https://search.marginalia.nu/search?query=ddracenetwork
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (its a search engine that favors quantity of text)
