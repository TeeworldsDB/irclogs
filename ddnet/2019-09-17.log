14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Peekabooo> btw can you still register 0.5 servers at the master server?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Peekabooo> or are they completely shut down by now?

14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how can i apply your two pull requests to my repo?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use `git cherry-pick`
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the commit IDs
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut ^
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> says error
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bad object
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> even tho i added ddnet7 and ddnet as remotes
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah nvm
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> forgot the fetchj
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut how cleanly does it apply?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> quite
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just some stuff from my mod makes around 5 conlficts
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not hard to solve tho
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the relative performance of a syscall vs a virtual function (function pointer) call?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 did u ignore my comment on purpose?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which comment do you mean?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1904#discussion_r325169589
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I didn't. your comment prompted me to review the PR and after reading it I accepted it. sorry :/
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see np
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lEARTH> guys pls help me
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 why did bors time out?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know, is it configured for this repository?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki did you see stallman resign from MIT CSAIL and FSF?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did. what was the issue there?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He defended an old MIT professor that had sex with an underage girl at epsteins private island and said something along the lines of the girl being 17 was only a minor detail
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 yes
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 there is lot of media shit involved tbh
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he has always been weird related to non software stuff
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where do you guys get ur stallman news? i didnt hear anything baut it xd
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reddit
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the fsf should be able to move on and survive without stallman, since movements should not rely just on one person being alive
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder who will they put tho xd
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon u can also idle on #fsf on freenode xd
