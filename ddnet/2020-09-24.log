07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi you're welcome
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've heard about a skins DB cleanup recently.
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I understand that right now people can choose any skins from ddnet skins DB and use that on any server or mod.
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So for example if someone will upload a skins that's only appropriate for his mod (like a skin of a tank) that could lead to everyone will use that in DDRace and other mod and it will look inconsistent and lame.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> What I propose is adding to a skin a special flag (that could be a part of skin name for simplicity) that will ensure that this skin could only be used on server which want it.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> For example we can start those skins from underscore like `_tank`. I am sure it will be super easy to add validator to client info parser that will reject that skin and default it to something for servers that don't have allowed those type of skins allowed explicitly on their servers. Also that will be a simple patch for old mod servers owners that they could apply if interested in filtering.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have wanted to add some special skins to be used in my mod that will be 100% inappropriate in other mods like: door, car, platform to use them as player interacatble tiles. But I think that right now those skins will not be accepted for the reason players will use that in ddrace and it will looks crappy. So I suggest this workaround.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks @Soreu for telling me about a cleanup

10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> sorry for editing here. Can't stand re-reading my lang errors
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd suggest the prefix to be `x_` like it is done with `x_ninja` & `x_spec`, so for INF mod that could be `x_zombie1`
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and such flag for not autodownloading skins would be good idea in general, as discussed already at the beginning of cleanup plan
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> to be honest I am not much interested in filtering at all as my players are not allowed to choose their skins as it will break the game. Server assigns skins to them now based on a game class
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *on a player class, e.g. Soldier, Zombie etc
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Do we have an issue opened on that?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck in the end your server decides which skins are allowed. You can modify the server to forbid some skin names
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > and such flag for not autodownloading skins would be good idea in genera
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> client will download a skin once he will see another character in a game. But only if server allows that character to set that skin at the first place
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The client will respect what the server tells it
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Oh, that is proposed and already is on roadmap, @deen ?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *was
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why? we don't need it for ddnet-server
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can add it in the code of your own mod
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I can make anything on my server right. But first the skin should appear in skin db.
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> The problem is that skin will not make it there if it could be abused on ddrace servers.
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have filters already (I don't allow client skins at all, but I want to be able to choose skins serverside from ddnet skin DB to assign to characters)
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But ddrace servers don't have any filtering system AFAIA
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see, true
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do we need to forbid soldier and zombie? do they look bad?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No, I am about adding newer skins to the DB that could be inappropriate, like skins of door, of visual FX of a platform, of a tank
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't think you will like people running with a skin of a wall on ddrace servers 😄
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or even with a skin of a tank or a part of a tank even
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, easiest solution would be for server to tell client where to download skins, but we probably don't want that
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not sure how it works with the x_ skins
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That will be awesome soluation. But I understand it will require MUCH more effort
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> x_ right now is excluded in client level, not server-side
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The problem is if we do it server-side, many run old servers
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we'd end up with doors on all other mods and KoG etc
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It will work like that:
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * server is loading and have something sv_allow_x_skins
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * if he sees a client wants to set skin to a skins which body starts with x_ it should not allow that setting a default skin instead of sv_allow_x_skins is not set to 1
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * players on server with sv_allow_x_skins enabled will be able to set skin and will download x\_ skins when they will see a character with a skin set (is that a way skin downloading works now?)
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * players on a server without sv_allow_x_skins set will not be allowed to set x\_ skins and thus will not see any characters with such skins set on the server and so they will not download it
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I don't want to maintain a list of skins allowed by mod in client
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think that after adding that to ddnet server code (client skin validation) the only additional thing you will do is to tell a person pushing a skin to db to rename it as it is too wild to be used freely.
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> In a case the skin is not appropriate ofc
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> For all server owners who don't change anything it will just be as if there are no x_ skins
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> which is like now, because "wild" skins are not accepted to a db I think
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but server owners who want to use special skins will be able to do that
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that doesn't work since the server is not the one forbidding x_ skins, it's the client
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am proposing the server to do that. I can give you lines of code for that. I've already prohibited all client skins in my server as only server should assign them. But I can make it conditional.
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (in zombie mods server assigns skins)
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But we can't modify all the old servers running
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hmm...
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> you're right
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've got this. Let me think about it
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess we could create a new network message that the server sends to client to inform it that the server will do skin filtering
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if no such msg is sent, as on old servers, the client does the filtering. otherwise client allows any skin server sends
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh... we should add a server info flag that server will do skin validation
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, something like that
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and disallow client to use x_ skins on a server without it
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though it could be easily hacked
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hacked?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as everything that's done clientside
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> abuser could remove clientside validation
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and server will accept x_ skin
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> a server without serverside validation I mean, old one
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but that's fine since the server sent the flag to indicate that it will do the validation on its own
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I would say that's a case of "works as intended"
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but we want to protect old servers without validation mechanism and a flag
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> old server would never send that flag
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> a hacked client will ignore absense of that flag on old servers
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hacked client? I don't follow, sorry
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How are we getting hacked?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean that a player could remove client side validation that checks for a server flag and will hardcode to allow x_ skins on any server
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so absense of such a flag will mean nothing as old server will accept any skin
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> By modifying the client source code and recompiling?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Of course everyone can do that 😄
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how is that hacking?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can modify the source code right now to allow x_
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok let's call it abusing 😄
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't see what that would abuse
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you just see more skins on your own client, nothing else
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no one else would see the skins
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> We want to protect old servers without serverside skin validation, right?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not protect, there is no attack 😄
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And we do that by adding to a client a check that will search for a server info flag
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it will be much easier for me to just implement this than explain to you why it's no problem, sorry 😄
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, if you don't care that a door could be used as a skin on old ddrace servers then it's perfect for me
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, that can not happen...
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or if you think it will not be abused
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it can't be abused with what I proposed
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hm...
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the client only decided which skins itself can see, not which other clients see
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you want to implement the feature or should I?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I expect you to do that for many reasons.
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just still don't get why this is not a problem
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 1. We add x_ to inappropriate skins like a dunno penis
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 2. Old servers will accept any skins client will request
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 3. An old client which can set any skins (for example he downloaded a skins manually from database) sets x_penis
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4. He logs into an old server and sets his skin
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 5. Newer clients will see his skin as they will download it and nothing will stop them from doing that
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> am I getting it wrong?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, old client can *not* set any skin
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Old clients ignore all skins with x_
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Wdym? Is x_ filtering is already there?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> new clients will ignore the x_ skin too if the old server doesn't say that it does any filtering
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> of course it's there already
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 😮
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Then it's much simpler
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks for explaining wasn't aware of that
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but the x_ filtering is in the wrong place so that's why we need the update path
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to move it from client to server
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It should stay both on server and both on client I think
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Didn't read it all, but client has set download link for the db
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> once you will release any client with no x_ filtering there will be no way back
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as I explained a few times, client should only check x_ if server didn't say that it will do the check
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> could the link contain also exclude of specific skinpack?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck what do you mean by no way back?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen ah, yes, Riht
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry, but this discussion is leading nowhere
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then we could just set skinpack to i.e. `MOD`
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu that's not flexible enough. We want server to be able to set any skin
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> server yes, but not the client
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and skins with prefix of x_ are not selectable by the player
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > what do you mean by no way back?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... I just liked how x_ magically appeared to be alreay in a client. If it wasn't there we would have a bigger problem
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I realised it's not a problem as client side validation will reman there just will become conditional
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> x_zombie in skinpack MOD
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu yes, they are selectable with f1, player_skin. and they are accepted by server. But in the end the c lient doesn't render them but replaces wiht default instead
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so that is kind of a solution though
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> not best one ofc
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ~~can't wait to make a game of penises fighting tanks~~
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lol
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Can't wait to give a real transport to my mod's players
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and destroyable walls not made of walls too
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and destroyable walls not made of lasers too
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also maybe to use zombie skins from that pack too
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 help, GameInfoFlags can't be extended any more 😄
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks for listening me, explaining and finally accepting this @deen
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> by a chance will you add allow zoom flag to it?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have ALLOW_ZOOM already
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> right now ifcity devs are enforcing clients to use k-client just to use zoom
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are doing that because they want people to use their client, not because DDNet client doesn't support it
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as they don't want to rename their mod to contain "race" in their game type
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what their reason is for enforcing their client I don't know
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> As far as I know vanilla client checks if Race is in the name of a game type
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that is not required, they just have to set ALLOW_ZOOM bit in GameInfoFlags
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and then decides if it should allow zooming
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, that is just the fallback for old mods that no one updates
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> new mods can use ALLOW_ZOOM, as I just said
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... so they could just set that flag serverside? only ddnet supports this, right? not 0.6 and 0.7 vanilla clients?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (which is fine too)
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will advice my players to tell ifcity devs to set that flags then
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and thay they don't really need k-client
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'm sure sure they don't even know K-Client is often autobanned
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think they don't care
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or are seeing this as a holy fight against bans
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *bot bans
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kingston> Why is my ddnet getting deleted randomly.
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kingston> Why is my ddnet getting deleted randomly?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck it's the gameinfo@netobj.ddnet.tw net object they need to implement
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Kingston probably your antivirus solution mistakenly auto-detecting it as malware, happend to many
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> please report to your AV vendor that that is a false positive, and add an exception
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 if I need more flags, can I just make m_Flags2 for GameInfoEx, right?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kingston> Maybe my WS detects it as virus or smth
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kingston> I have no AV atm
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen GameInfo is one of those versioned netobjects, so yes you add an m_Flags2 and you bump version/add a size check
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually don't even need to do anything with the size, we already disabled size checks for that one
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Kingston AV = Antivirus
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, i noticed
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what are you adding?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I will advice my players to tell ifcity devs to set that flags then
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Pure_luck kclient has probs some backdoor or some shit
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Support for server to allow client to use x_ skins
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then mod-specific skins can be added to DDNet's skin DB
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We can also just hardcode support for zooming out in city mods, because I don't like them enforcing their client for no good reason
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> won't hardcoded solution no longer work if they happen to add like more letters to the name? xd
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> to mod name*
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, they could do that, but then it's obvious they're doing something shady to enforce their own client
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and are not just too lazy to implement the proper net object
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is their own client?
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> k-client
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, already checked that
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No bitcoin miner 😦
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha, would be super easy to hide in a game btw
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since many games run at high cpu load for no good reason anyway 😄
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so no one would wonder why cpu is at 100% while gaming
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could probably even run it on the gpu with a game like tw
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe they use the gpu
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758621539557048320/unknown.png
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or maybe you just set no vsync and it's rendering 100 frames and only 1 gets shown
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im at 60-80 fps
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure we have a combination of settings that gets our cpu usage more sane, I couldn't figure it out
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> black desert online has rly demanding graphics
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen do you want me to open an issue to keep track of it?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck nah, implementation is nearly done
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 cl_refresh_rate 480
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> best dev team ever 😄
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is what I play with, ~20 CPU usage
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> By the way, do you think that allowing a server to set position for motd will be hard?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Will it require breaking changes or could be implemented easier way?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I want to make an onboarding (interactive help/tutorials) system for my mod. Movable MOTD window would be sufficient, no need to make any complext and separate netgui.
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Broadcasts are not well suitable for this as they're not very readable and are at the center too.
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Chat is even less visible.
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think that's how my players feel when they request something to find out that I am about to deploy changes already 😉
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen I like that this solution allow a server owner to decide how skins filtering system will be implemented.
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohhh
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie @louis Just so you know: #2917
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2917
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can also build the official releases/rcs/nightlies on my normal computer instead of my home server now. 8 min instead of 34 min is much more comfortable. rcs and nightlies will also have a proper version number showing like "15.0.5-rc1" or "nightly20200924"
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I'm confused. I can't get CPPFLAGS to work in my Debian 6 chroot
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works everywhere else
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cmake 3.9.2
16:20 <+Learath2> have you checked that whether the flags get to the actual compilation lines?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they don't get there
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> upgrading cmake also didn't work
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm really confused why cmake is not looking at CPPFLAGS on Debian 6
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do you use debian 6?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u tried CXXFLAGS
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, same problem
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll do it another way now
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I use Debian 6 because building a portable executable for Linux is the ugliest thing in the universe
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do we need such downward compability for linux
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You need to choose a distribution with super-low libc and libstdc++ version to stay compatible with all the weird ones
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think centos used some 12 year old libc on a still-supported version last time I checked
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah, thats sad then xd
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They made progress! Centos now only supports 9 year old glibc!
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> debian wiki only says that CPPFLAGS isnt supported
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Notes for packages using CMake
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah no, RedHat 5 from 2007 is still in support and uses glibc 2.5 from 2006. So we're at 14 years we need to support atm
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how this stayed this horrible for this long
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but why should we support redhat 5 users from 2007?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, I use Debian 6 with glibc 2.11 for  building, so RedHat 5 never worked
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because some people run that on their servers and can't recompile on their own
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find that to be a rly weird and rare case
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did someone complain in the past?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really rare
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well its just like windows xp
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> every time I updated glibc version
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We had someone here a month or so ago running on a container where you can't replace the kernel so you can't get above a certain glibc version
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and why they dont update their server
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we also can't use musl, since we have c++ additionally
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some weird-ass hosters living in 199X I guess
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OpenVZ doesn't let you touch the kernel
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OpenVZ is much cheaper for the hosters
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh right, and without new kernel you often can't update userspace
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to know what my vps uses?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Capitalism dictates that upsell shitty cheap stuff
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki your kernel is usually a giveaway
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does that mean
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use hetzner and u can upload ur own distro iirc
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hetzner doesn't do OpenVZ
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they use something kvm-based
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think i've seen openvz used for years actually
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The latest OpenVZ kernel is something like 2.6
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so much images
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758711477431173140/unknown.png
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can install anything on a hetzner vps/dedi. I use debootstrap to install devuan from the rescue system
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yes, ur battle against systemd
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wanna try nixos
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some day
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I also bootstrapped netbsd in the oddest way possible. Writing the live usb image to a hdd
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would you say systemd on such a nice day? Now I need to go sleep it off
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is there a alternative to runit
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are many, how simple do you want it to be?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there one made with rust?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably not, but given PID1 is supposed to be dead simple, you can be the first one to write one
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://www.fpcomplete.com/rust/pid1/ see this is how you not do it
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> might be a interesting project to do
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> come on, what's wrong with systemd? 😄
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Comrade dont start!
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this wont end good
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ok
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i know 😄
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> minit, runit, busybox init are all good examples of what one should be doing in pid1
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Since 2015, the majority of Linux distributions have adopted systemd, having replaced other systems such as the UNIX System V and BSD init systems. systemd has faced mixed reception from Linux users, with arguments that systemd suffers from mission creep and bloat, as well as criticism over software (such as the GNOME desktop) adding dependencies on systemd—frustrating compatibility with other Unix-like operating systems
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess this is the main complain
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unix philosophy about doing 1 thing only and doing it well
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what about OpenRC
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Systemd is a monolith, a blackbox absorbing projects at a staggering rate. It's sole intention is to make it so impossibly hard to replace it that you just have to use it
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The person that invented it even said so
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've used OpenRC for quite some time, it works splendidly
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For a desktop you really do want something more comprehensive than minit/runit
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758714185613574174/unknown.png
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aw apparently nixos uses sytemd
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly want to try a non systemd next
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's mind boggling how someone could think fragmentation is bad in this context
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You want more options, not less
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And for the absolute troglodytes that argue systemd helps with compatibility across distros. How you initialize your system and what you have running as PID1 has squat to do with compatibility
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u join this creed https://systemd-free.artixlinux.org/
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's systemd absorbing other projects that actually help with this and create a vendor lock-in to create this illusion
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm only using arch so people can't use the "you never used systemd, you can't have any opinion" on me anymore
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll be going back to gentoo when I'm back in italy
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why gentoo?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Learath2 and I should preorder some CPU fans for inevitable replacements
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love that I'm not locked into any software with gentoo. It also has a great way to patch software I'm installing with ebuilds
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I've been test-compiling ddnet all-day because of this stupid debian6 issue 😄
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also love that I can strip features that I don't need from software
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen what cpu u have btw?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i7 6700k
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How long does it take to compile with a 6700k?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can we time it?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to know how well my ryzen does
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 100€ cheaper xD

17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i love it
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i get errors compiling using bundled

17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One day we will get a nice way to compile for old glibc and nice package management for C/C++
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast I hope
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the package management for c/c++ are distro package managers
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> fully static build?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 for glibc there is a nice way I think, but stdlibc++ is harder
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Comrade glibc might also depend on kernel versions, not sure
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `Executed in   24.77 secs`
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> executed?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like mac
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep mac
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> everyone has at least 3.2 kernel today, so don't worry
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mac cross-compiling is much slower to me
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade just a month or so ago we had someone with 2.6, stuck there because OpenVZ
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on 5.8.10
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> OpenVZ is broken thing 😄
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> living on the edge
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> nobody should use that
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are still many hosters selling OpenVZ vpss and many users that just don't know any better buying them
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki does that have wireguard built in yet?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how do i know that
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe it's rude, but it's only their problem if they pay for some OpenVZ trash
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wirefilter?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah they added it in 5.6 so you have it
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wireguard is high performance low level tunnels
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Comrade sure, but we still try to help them as well as they can
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and for Linux in my opinion you should use your package manager or build yourself
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I never download prebuilt binaries online
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah thats a rare thing to do on linux
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is why I don't really like flatpak
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well that and it's part of the global conspiracy to turn linux into hacker windows
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 r u familiar with ddnet editor code?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 could you review https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2918 please? I need it for my automatic builds script changes
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen what about including a small git hash if u built it on ur own
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> commit*
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by default
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki you could do that, I spent enough time already on this thing 😄
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok maybe ill try after this gets merged
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there any concern with the version string getting too long?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> CMake supports only major.minor.patch.tweak
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, for cmake I still used the one from version.h
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's still in that format, we just add a suffix for our own version string, as far as I can see
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 nah, you can also replace it totally with -DVERSION=nightly20200924
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and is cmake okay with that?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> how does it obtain these https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR.html ?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if you use "nightly20200924" instead of "1.2.3.4"
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It still reads them from src/game/version.h
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so those will still be 15.0.5
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, I guess I could also switch to only allowing a suffix
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and use 15.0.5-nightly20200924
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is that better?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think it makes sense
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to use version there
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean the "15.0.5"
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only thing that would give more info would be replacing the date with a commit hash
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its probs easier for your RC to allow fully change the version
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 but not so easy to understand for average players. they'll understand 20200924 is the date
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> definitely
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ i think for rc appending -rc1 etc is enough
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2884#issuecomment-696691153> do u know how to prevent scrolling from affecting the editor zoom when used on a scrollbar?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki in the editor zoom location check if a popup is hot/active/something like that
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> agh
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 15.0.5-20200924
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shorter and better  imo
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really want `SnapReplaceItem` but it's a marathon to code that and I don't really feel motivated enough
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nightly is redundant
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki are you looking into the git hash? Otherwise I'll create an issue I guess
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im fixing the scrollbar rn
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, dissecting interleaved connections is soooo hard
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure if it's supposed to be dissectable actually
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2884
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fixed
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should also fix any other scrollbar scrolling we add in the future xd
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (in the editor)
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how should i indicate/know "built on ur own"
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u already can know the hash with GIT_SHORTREV_HASH
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can shorten it to 7 chars tho
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:

19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Does anybody know why ddnet and teeworlds are setting display mode even when I am on my native display resolution and the game is set to use it too? It makes my display turn black and blink a led for 2 seconds. That's annoying and seems to be unnecessary.
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (in fullscreen mode)
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> DE?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> gnome
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck different color mode?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 🤔 wdym?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> aren't any program use 24-bit nowadays?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen he means the display turns black like when u change resolution
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also I am still annoyed to get 5 second freeze on exit. But that's another story.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That's DDNet only
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> debug it?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> compile your own debug build, run with gdb
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and check where ith angs for the 5 seconds
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> What signal I should send to it?
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> how would u check where it hangs with gdb?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no signal, run inside of gdb, when you hit quit and it hangs, press ctrl-c in gdb
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then check `backtrace`
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will try
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But still that resolution change annoys me too.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It was there for ages I guess. That's the reason I use borderless window. But it has lower performance.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Much lower
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19636832/find-out-where-my-c-program-hangs-with-gdb
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> did u try gfx_resizable 0 @Pure_luck?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh... sorry
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I feel so stupid
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, we should definitely ignore resizing events when fullscreen is enabled
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It uses the same resolution for fullscren and for windowed mode
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> when I set it to 1600x1200 it tries to set it in fullscreen mode too
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though I'd prefer it to use native resolution in fullscreen mode as lower resoluations don't make sense
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I sometimes set it to windowed to be able to read some server debug while testing
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> still black screen for you with native res?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no, it's gone
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> sorry for that
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I still get it, weird 😄
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Well, I have black screen for ~300 ms but that's nothing
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's ok
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> not 2 seconds
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> depends on your screen probably
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or CPU maybe
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have rather recent one
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so I don't notice it now
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this a gnome thing?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't have problems now with screen resolution change
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen why do the news dont use the full space? e.g the last bulletpoint
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758740360813215785/unknown.png
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it wasn't native
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I cannot debug in GDB as it's hanging entire DE for 5 seconds on exit
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it intentional?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I cannot debug in GDB as it's hanging entire DE for 5 seconds on exit
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Pure_luck :monkalaugh:
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe I should send it segstop idk
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will make a console script that will print which process is using cpu on ddnet exit
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, just a problem with my window manager
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki so it fits in 5:4
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> eh, got crash just ingame
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> eh, got crash just during game
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> try to remember what u did
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> nothing, i guess
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> just played
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4Head
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r u using a official release or did u compile from master
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've made a simple script. No need to debug DDNet. It's Xorg and gnome-shell processes going 100% on DDNet exit.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It have started after last system update.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I cannot tell if that's DDNet code fault. Just no other program is affected.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've made a simple script to monitor processes in background.

19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <✨Astral|Crying🌙> :6168_Kim_Jong_Un:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @Ryozuki steam client
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think DDNet is calling X/WM something and then is waiting for it to complete something.
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It was instant before, but not now.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am glad I am not epileptic but that emoticon is still annoying.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Too bad it doesn't deletes on user block.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kids that just got discord nitro use it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Oh.. I still haven't sent a SIGSTOP to gdb'ed DDNet with a background script
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I might know what it is calling
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Does it help?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758744536830312448/Screenshot_from_2020-09-24_20-39-40.png
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Turning off V-Sync does not help. It happens in windowed mode too.
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's that 5 seconds delay with 100% cpu on Xorg and gnome-session before DDNet exits.
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Guys, I have problem with one player - @Pak gets his client frozen every single time we're at the end of `[School] Hook` and he falls in speedups
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758745046526328872/unknown.png
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> his client is frozen, he can't do a thing, but only hears sounds
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> his console shows nothing though https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/757166272122454076/758745033720463410/Stuck_3.jpg?width=908&height=536
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe this map contain tiles his client doesn't support? is he using ddnet?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean recent one
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> DDNet, latest, from Steam
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Yeah
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> DDNet
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xyloae> Try to zoom in
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> what will happen if he will spectate to that point of a map from the start?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> he can go thru the part
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> I still have the game open, cant do anything
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> problem starts when he falls in & gets dragged by speedups
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it's already 4th time, his friend had same problem two days ago when we played together
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> same map, same place
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> there's not a single unused tile in this place, just checked in editor
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also, somehow I don't get this problem
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pak I just saw you hitting 3 times before leaving
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so seems like something worked at the end
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Nope xD The thing is the game doesnt freeze, i can hear the sounds and everything, but my screen gets stuck
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> It was stuck at this screen, but i could hear all the sounds
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758746289848188988/stuck_2.png
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> and move as well probably because i heard it
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> well, I was seeing you at the beginning on part
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> of*
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> probably because i died here when it "froze" and my controls are working, and i hear everything, but my screen is locked to this image
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> version platform old gpu? opengl3 on?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord slow damn

19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ his btw
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it exactly that part on the screen?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> What do you mean Jupstar?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> If you mean if its that part i get stuck on yeah.. I have a screenshot for when i got stuck the fist time as well.. let me send the pic 1min
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758752867703324752/stuck.png
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> This was the first time
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> henlo
20:16 <+MalwareTele> hi
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> this channel is much more active
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> full of discord doods
20:18 <+MalwareTele> why you have to type /notice Nimda I am not a bot to join
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> when do you return from wild true-ascetic life
20:20 <+MalwareTele> oh
20:21 <+MalwareTele> ok its boring now i should go bye
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i valgrinded, we have quite some invalid reads and writes but only in the server browser,
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also cant reprod any frame drops
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pak can you send me ur ddnet_settings.cfg privatly
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ I happened 4 times in total, with Pak & his friend, alway in this part, and always only to the player that felt in the speedups
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> though to make it weird, their screen freezes right before that
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> almost sounds like a bug in prediction xd
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> on the screen from them they are in air, so looks like out of nowhere screen freezes in ~middle of this part, and due to this they fall in speedups
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do they all have background maps active?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and entites
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but I have totally no idea why or how, since I'm not affected when playing with them nor when doing it alone
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> For sure entities, but on first ocassion Pak didn't have custom entities bg, I explained him later how to do that
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> (I think)
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> idk about his friend Drakii, because he played that map only once
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but I doubt not, since he knows even less xd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but I doubt he could have it somehow*
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> sorry, brain half dead rn
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, so many possibilities .D
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could be a NaN or some overflow
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/24/new-c-features-in-gcc-10/
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ but then how does it happen every time to Pak, but not a single time one to me? :c
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd bet something with drivers, since that's lately hot topic xD
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe his setup, his CPU, his GPU
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could be anything
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> the only weirdness is that we have played several different maps, and it didn't occur on any of them
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> only on [School] Hook and only in the last part ._.
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats why i think its something with floating points
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it needs some position on the screen to hapen
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it needs some position on the screen to happen
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but really hard to tell
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i cant type any passwort in passwort protected servers anymore
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh, about passwords and servers... if I have password set in the config, could it just connect to the server automatically without the need to still click ok to join? The pw is autofilled, just still requires confirmation to join
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes that was made bcs of security reasons
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. passwort steal
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> @Jupstar ✪ where do i find that file?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pak DDNet client directory -> double click `config_directory.bat` -> will be in directory that will pop up
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> i have a file called settings_ddnet
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> is it that one?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes ty
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> enabled floating point exceptions now... instant crash xD
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> absolutly cant find anything, but the x coordinate on both pictures is the same
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats insanly suspecious
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck I saw some mesa bugs about this, for example https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=56377
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ what do you mean by typing pw? in f2?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the password field
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> where is that field?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, when connecting
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> go on password protected server
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quixe> hola
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quixe> alguien juega
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quixe> someone play?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> can server's ip become an admin on join?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> im about situation when you are testing stuff and reload it quite often, so, you are hosting it on localhost
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @Quixe #general
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > absolutly cant find anything, but the x coordinate on both pictures is the same
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ oh lol, indeed, didn't even notice o.0
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Quixe ask in #general, not in developer's channel ^^
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quixe> soooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOrrY
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @gerdoe F2 `reload` doesn't log you out
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also, if you find it helpful: on my local server I set rcon pw to be single letter/number, so it's not annoying to login often, and you can also do bind with `rcon_login <pw>`
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe if you connect to 127.0.0.1 and are logged into rcon map reloads automatically when you save it in editor
