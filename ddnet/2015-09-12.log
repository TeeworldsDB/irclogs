17:39 < nameless_tee84>  Hey guys! i was wondering, i have a demo here, of we playing in team, it was a 7 player team or so, and someone killed, i have the demo right here, but there are 2 names of tees who didnt appear on the right corner, so i was thinking if there is any killing log? or something to see who killed us :D
17:39 < nameless_tee84> and the game was more than 30 mins, so it was needed to write /kill to do it,

21:06 <@EastByte> [18:45:34] we have the same issue with the dedicated game server in GRA
21:06 <@EastByte> [18:45:40] it works when game filters are disabled

21:06 <@heinrich5991> [18:46:00] !twp 
21:06 < Nimda> [18:46:00] Usage: !twp <player>
21:06 < o_be_one> [18:46:02] i'm preparing host
21:06 <@heinrich5991> [18:46:03] !twp a
21:06 < Nimda> [18:46:03] No a found online.
21:06 <@EastByte> [18:46:08] okay, then it's strange
21:06 < o_be_one> [18:46:20] and i want to play with filters before moving my servers
21:06 < o_be_one> [18:46:39] i'll disable game firewall to begin i think, to get some tcp dump and give them to the dev
21:06 < o_be_one> [18:47:03] but i've 8 ips so i'll be able to test them
21:06 <@EastByte> [18:47:13] okay
21:06 < o_be_one> [18:48:21] i mean to test servers on differents ips
21:06 <@EastByte> [18:53:52] o_be_one: I also prepared some teeworlds protocol characteristics (for my bpf filters), this information is probably needed in case there will be tw support in ovh game filters
21:06 <@heinrich5991> [18:56:37] EastByte: what format are "protocol characteristics"?
21:06 <@EastByte> [19:00:01] Just some information about how teeworlds traffic usually looks like (e.g. headers and certain flags which need to be set/unset)
21:06 < o_be_one> [19:00:51] EastByte, dev told me that i just have to give them sources of TW, so ill just give them DDNet GitHub, they will be able to do a special filter
21:06 <@heinrich5991> [19:00:54] EastByte: like a text document, or a program?
21:06 < o_be_one> [19:01:02] but when ? 1 week ? 1 month ... we'll see ..
21:06 <@EastByte> [19:01:17] just a document, I will upload it the next days
21:06 <@EastByte> [19:01:36] o_be_one: wow that's interesting
21:06 <@heinrich5991> [19:01:50] o_be_one: I hope that won't restrict further protocol changes
21:06 <@heinrich5991> [19:02:12] (like e.g. the extended server info thing that isn't merged yet)
21:06 <@EastByte> [19:02:19] I hope it'll be updatable
21:06 < o_be_one> [19:05:32] heinrich5991, as far i'll be in TW and OVH, dont worry ...

21:06 < Learath2> [20:32:07] need someone to play with :P
21:40 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: we could play later this evening
21:41 < Learath2> heinrich5991: how much later ?
21:42 <@heinrich5991> dunno yet. when I decide stop being social in real life :)
21:42 < Learath2> well social life is overrated come here and play with me
23:43 < o_be_one> EastByte, what is the ip of the game server with tw filter prob ?
23:44 <@EastByte> dunno, give me some of your ip:port so I can check
23:45 <@EastByte> or do you mean WolfAlex's dedicated server (where we disabled gamefilter on tw port)?
23:46 < o_be_one> EastByte, talking about WolfAlex's DS yes
23:46 < WolfAlex> hello :o
23:47 < o_be_one> hey WolfAlex whatsup :D ?
23:49 < WolfAlex> playing super mario maker :D
23:51 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: what servers weren't available with game filters?
23:55 < WolfAlex> EastByte: only ifcity because of the server city-master communication
23:56 < WolfAlex> and it was not possible to add the ip to internet and teeworlds D:
23:56 <@EastByte> huh?
23:56 <@EastByte> what about the problem were servers will simply not reachable?
23:57 < WolfAlex> i think thats a ddnet problem
23:57 < WolfAlex> token
23:57 <@EastByte> e.g. I couldn't connect to teerpg until you disabled the gamefilters
23:57 < WolfAlex> ah the ovh filtersß
23:58 < WolfAlex> well seems like if someone is already connectet to ssh, the game filters are ignored
23:59 <@EastByte> the game filters won't simply block stuff
