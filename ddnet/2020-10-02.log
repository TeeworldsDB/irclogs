11:19 <+ChillerDragon> bro fstd u ok?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki Did you get teewebs working btw? Do you want to add a keyboard input support to make it work on mobile devices? Would be great if you can share the build instructions so I can build new versions
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki i have turned on websockets support on ger1 servers again and plan to enable on more later
12:54 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: hm?
12:56 <+ChillerDragon> u reconnected like a lot fstd 
12:57 <+ChillerDragon> Do games still use this tilde thing where the angle of the phone controls players? Does that work on mobile browsers? Imaging doing edges by flippin ur phone :D
12:58 <+ChillerDragon> btw @deen im on the hud scale thing im kinda stuck tho and get a bunch of crashes
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupeyy u made this PrepareHealthAmoQuads() function that gets run once on client launches hm? I have to re run that to update the scaling when the config is changed so i hooked in a config chain. But it gets called on client load and crashes at https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/blob/40ecc259db45015f10db3ed8dfe601734804e0f2/src/game/client/components/hud.cpp#L665
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> idk about this graphics stuff is there any order or setup code i have to care about?
13:06 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: but not tonight, right?
13:12 <+ChillerDragon> 1 oct
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> oh and also tonight ye
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/kr
13:13  * fstd checks when.pr0.tips
13:14 <+fstd> yeah alright the one tonight was expected
13:14 <+fstd> by ISP doing their usual thing
13:15 <+fstd> i believe they have a highly trained monkey running through their data centers, periodically power cycling their customer-facing ports
13:15 <+fstd> only once have i been forgotten by said monkey and had a stable connection for almost a month
13:19  * ChillerDragon didnt get the /me
13:20 <+fstd> 13:13:54  *     fstd  checks when.pr0.tips
13:20  * ChillerDragon ye i mean it arrived but i dont know what u mean xd
13:21 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupeyy ok seems like a ``if(Graphics())`` did the job :)
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: what's a hud scale thing?
13:21 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: host -t TXT when.pr0.tips
13:21 <+fstd> gives the date of my last disconnect ^^
13:21 <+ChillerDragon> its solved the thing u requested didnt u @deen
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and i can't help debugging with something like "get a bunch of crashes" ðŸ˜„
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah that, scaling, ok
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> i provided a line that crashed^^
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> btw i doubt a config is wise
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> maybe a gameskins_old and a gameskins directory should be used
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why?
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> u cant make the user open console everytime he changes gameskin
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> bad ux
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or have a convention of the filename?
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> or that
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> but that would force gameskin names
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> which is meh
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like if it has _07.png suffix use 0.7 scaling
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> i would go with _06 suffix
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> new should be the new standard
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> but yea lets ship a config for now shall we?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we are on 0.6
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> dont merge yet lemme dilate it
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> isnt the plan to update to 0.7 protocol at some point?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Dunno just delete the HUD container and call the stuff from oninit again
13:37 <+ChillerDragon_> Yea I tried some resetting but now it worked fine checking the graphics pointer but thanks :)
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know what the plan is
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But it doesn't dealloc the vram
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It also misses the sprites from oninit
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hi guys
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> maps creators worked for making maps enjoyments and beautiful
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but players not see that because everyone are use entities
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so i advice making custom entities
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like this (Just an examples)
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761579154457100288/ea8cafe215e15069.png
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what client is that ðŸ‘€
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats photoshop
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> more likely paint
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :brownbear:
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...but you can edit your entities?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 how do you plan to tell what tile layer corresponds to what game tiles?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and you can enable original background with `%current%`
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the original background already works, you can set %current% as background map
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yes i do it thisXD
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but no want more and more XD
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but i  want more and more  now XD
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Soreu   still did not learn  the programming don't ask me how:)
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it's not programming, you can do it even in paint
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just edit entities_clear.png file
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> paint?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i can what  in paints?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @deen  still did not learn  the programming don't ask me how:)
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh you mean background :brownbear:
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> no, entities
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @deeni am bad in this but i think if you able put background original soi think you can enable everything other
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, rest is impossible
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only background is possible
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok i am at least tried:bluekitty:
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why do all physics layers have auto mappers?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> physics layers?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> game, front, tele and so on
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i dont see how they should ever use one
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly have no idea how the automapper works at all, but could it maybe use tile layers as a data source?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> always on steam client start
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761626182935642122/unknown.png
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @gerdoe hm, that seems to be a steam issue
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the auto mappers are for designing the tile layers properly
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> there is the fill tool to set for example freeze to all tiles where a specific tile layer has blocks
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> though that should have nothing to do with auto mappers i think
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (off for now tho, dinner)
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> add single player plys
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @herik you can play single player on Solo & Race servers. Join any non-Perma DDNet server and you can vote the game type to Solo and then select a 1 star map to play alone
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @herik you can play single player on Solo & Race type. Join any non-Perma DDNet server and you can vote the game type to Solo and then select a 1 star map to play alone
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Dummy type has maps you can play with the in-client dummy.
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you have a bad connection and can't play on online server, you can download all maps and run your own server locally: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> but there is a connection error even on the server alone
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What is the error?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> the host
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> Eu moro longe do host do servidor
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> I live far from the server host
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> will add single player?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> OK hadn't read everything you wrote
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I told you how to play single player locally. Where do you live?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <herik> sorry
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> You can host your own server in main menu
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> woah PNG read errors fix
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe it will read flag icons with metadata not stripped at last
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WojMen> Yo i have problem with fps. I've bought a new laptop  with 1050ti and when i want to play Teeworlds. I have only 300fps and very laggy game, in others game i don't have this problem i can normally play wither 3 .. But when i turn to integrated i can play normally with 1k fps without lagging. The problem is my laptop is warming up very much when i want to play Tee.
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @WojMen 2 independent problems: 1. disable power saving for DDNet application in your dGPU settings
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2. set cl_refresh_rate 480, gfx_refresh_rate 480 to reduce heat (lower values to reduce further, but at the cost of increased input latency)
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WojMen> not working
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my eyes demanded a dark theme :monkalaugh:
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761681609040330782/unknown.png
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> one of the new things says: Fix laser_damage tune with 0.7 client [pure-luck-999]  
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> isnt that tune Unused anyway?
