00:00 < eeeee> uh looks ugly in chrome
00:04 < eeeee> okay doesn't work in chrome at all
00:05 < eeeee> there are problems with window size and keyboard input doesn't work
00:05 <@deen> yeah, no iframe then i guess
00:07 < eeeee> it looks kinda cool though, i'll see if i can adapt my js to make it embeddable without an iframe
00:07 <@deen> or maybe i can force focus on the iframe
00:08 < eeeee> not sure it'll solve chrome problems
00:08 <@deen> and yeah, i like the idea that people just go to ddnet.tw and suddenly can play directly
00:10 < eeeee> should announce it like "NEW: a video of YOU playing, in real time!"
00:10 <@deen> haha
00:11 <@deen> well, in my browser profile it actually never works, but that's expectable since pentadactyl fucks with all inputs
00:11 <@deen> and much more fps in chrome
00:12 < eeeee> oh wait, yeah if i actually focus the iframe it actually works in chrome
00:12 <@deen> I'm just trying that on index2.php^^
00:12 <@deen> how do you do that?
00:12 < eeeee> just tabbed into it :D
00:13 < eeeee> for some reason clicking it doesn't focus it
00:13 <@deen> ok
00:13 <@deen> $(document).click(function() { $("#jsclient").focus() };
00:13 <@deen> is what i tried, doesn't seem to work
00:14 <@deen> ah, syntax error^^
00:16 <@deen> hah, seems to work
00:17 < eeeee> guess you can also focus on $(document).ready
00:18 <@deen> buggy in chrome =/
00:18 < eeeee> i'll try to fix the size
00:19 < eeeee> can you do the .ready thing?
00:19 <@deen> yes
00:22 <@deen> when i move the mouse too far with iframe in chrome, it jumps
00:22 <@deen> apart from that it seems to work
00:23 <@deen> (and the tee sometimes blinks)
00:26 < eeeee> even without iframe if you move your mouse too fast in firefox it'll escape the pointer lock
00:28 <@deen> well, the normal client does that for me as well :P
00:57 < eeeee> seems to work now
00:57 < eeeee> (the resizing)
01:08 <@deen> if i resize the window, mouse doesn't jump
01:08 <@deen> if it's full size mouse jumps, any idea?
01:10 < eeeee> full size as in max iframe size?
01:10 <@deen> nono
01:10 <@deen> in the index2.php page, i make the browser fullscreen and it jumps
01:10 <@deen> but with a smaller window it doesn't jump
01:15 < eeeee> dunno, tried chrome/windows and chrome/mac, fullscreen and smaller window, index2.php and teewebs
01:15 < eeeee> didn't see any mouse jumps :/
01:15 <@deen> ok, then it's just my window manager being stupid i guess
01:15 <@deen> so, the iframe works fine, great
01:16 < eeeee> lags a bit even in chrome when fullscreen
01:16 < eeeee> guess 1440p monitor is still too much for browser gaming :)
01:18 <@deen> that's another advantage of the iframe, it's smaller ;)
01:52 <@deen> eeeee: there we go, all servers restarted, ready for iframe and announcements whenever you are (except that I'm sleeping the next hours)
01:54 < eeeee> great
01:54 < eeeee> i've pushed all the codez i have to github
01:54 < eeeee> too bad i didn't manage to finish #ifdefing it all, so can't pullreq into ddnet yet
01:55 < eeeee> also needs a tiny patch against emscripten to fix some of their bugs, i'd have to report them later
02:15 < o_be_one> hi all
02:15 < o_be_one> hey deen there is too many noobs online, i think there is a way to try this no ?
02:28 < eeeee> try what
02:34 < o_be_one> the new feature for tomorrow
07:37 < eeeee> kay, posted the post
11:13 <@EastByte> eeeee: great
11:35 <@deen> eeeee: hm, is it intentional that there are ddnet fake servers?^^
11:35 <@deen> DDNet [EU]
11:44 <@EastByte> questionable :>
11:45 <@deen> They do only have 1 map and it's a nice one, but still :P
11:46 <@EastByte> atleast you can't connect
11:47 <@deen> of course, they don't have websockets compiled in
11:47 <@deen> so it probably shouldn't be in the list

14:42 <@EastByte> deen: an only js-client tournament would be funny
14:43 <@EastByte> all players are less skilled; properly no bots/custom clients
14:43 <@EastByte> a lot of laggs...
15:05 < laxadedi> EastByte: let's all play with gloves on hands too
15:33 <@EastByte> nah
16:15 <@deen> EastByte: not fair though :P
16:20 <@EastByte> deen: what's not fair?
16:24 <@deen> js client tournament
16:25 <@deen> people with bad connections or weak gpus have even more disadvantage than with regular client
16:25 <@EastByte> because the client does not run with the same performance on every system?
16:25 <@EastByte> yea okay
17:39 <@EastByte> deen: did you already work on the dummy connect delay?
17:42 <@deen> no
17:44 <@EastByte> okay, I made a simple fix
17:45 <@EastByte> well first I need to fix my commit...

18:11 <@EastByte> ty
18:11 <@EastByte> I guess now I have to return studying :)
19:13 < Spyker> hi
19:13 <@EastByte> hello Spyker 
19:13 < Spyker> some testers online?
19:18 <@EastByte> unsigned char*: Wow very nice! with something of work and time this can be awesome wink... P.S: Thx for discover me Emscripten :B
19:18 <@EastByte> eeeee unleashed the pointer
19:19 <@EastByte> that guy once implemented a non webgl map rendering engine and teeworlds physics in javascript
20:25 < laxa> I have a chrome plugin idea, that should be pretty easy to do I think, though, I don't know the main technology very well, maybe that idea would interest one of you.
20:26 < laxa> My idea is : a chrome plugin that blocks every social network button outside their website that allows them to track you on the internet
20:26 < laxa> facebook/twitter/g+ etc...
20:27 <@EastByte> I'm pretty sure there are such anti tracking addons
20:28 <@heinrich5991> laxa: most ad blockers can do that, specifically that and nothing else
20:28 <@heinrich5991> e.g. adblock's antisocial list (or something like that)
20:28 < laxa> nice
20:28 < laxa> thanks :)
20:44 < laxa> nice, I have set-up ABP instead of adblock, and it works :)
20:44 < eeeee> laxa: ublock is better
20:44 < eeeee> ABP makes your browser slow as hell
20:45 <@deen> ABP inserts multi-MB css into each tab and each iframe or sth like that. does ublock not do that?
20:45 < laxa> hummmm, thanks for the tip eeeee, I'll look into that if I have issues ^^
20:50 < eeeee> didn't dig into such details but it really feels much faster
20:50 <@deen> i know it is, i use it as well
20:50 < laxa> I am using it now
20:50 < laxa> will see how it works
20:50 < laxa> my computer at work is pretty slow :s
20:57 < Spyker> deen
20:58 <@deen> Spyker: ?
20:59 <@deen> EastByte: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/195#issuecomment-94520868
20:59 <@EastByte> oh crap
20:59 <@EastByte> one sec
21:00 < Spyker> i tryed to test with saavik, we tested 30% betweeen idiot, insults and others stuff... im so bored of her, she is so unpolite and kid, i have demo if you want to read how she is bad, and she stayed afk some mins too
21:00 < Spyker> i hooked her 2 times when she was afk and quit because i thouched her, so are we joking? really ddnet have this kind of shit testers?
21:01 < eeeee> well, most teeworlds players are kids, so what did you expect?
21:01 < eeeee> just have to deal with it somehow... :/
21:03 < Spyker> everyone have problem with her...
21:03 < Spyker> and im so bored about kid testers, mb she is on his period but no reason for write fucking idiot for every bugs
21:04 < Spyker> and after fix she write idiot because it was right and no need fix, or just she stay 10 min afk
21:04 < eeeee> yeah that sounds pretty annoying
21:04 < Spyker> 3 weeks for ask a fucking test, no one tester want to, or all offline... if ddnet have this staff is better to play lan servers
21:04 < eeeee> do you have any ideas how ddnet can find and recruit better testers?
21:05 < Spyker> i dont know... i just know the most of they afk or kids
21:05 < Spyker> saavik is doing nice work with ddmax maps
21:06 < eeeee> maybe mappers themselves could be testers? like you have to test a couple maps if you want your map released?
21:06 < Spyker> but she cant talk like this to other people, expecially if i am polite with her, and ragequit because i hooked her after 4 min afk without say nothing in middle of test
21:08 < Spyker> if you guys want i have demo of this shit, just for show how good are ddnet testers
21:10 <@deen> I'd be glad to have more testers, but no one wants to test usually
21:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #196: Fix dummy connect on servers without security token protocol (DDRace64...ddelay) http://git.io/vfT0k
21:12 <@EastByte> deen: is there a special way to fix a pullrequest?
21:12 < Spyker> deen i like test
21:12 < Spyker> but you remember me 2 years ago when i was a beginner...
21:13 < Spyker> 3*
21:13 <@deen> EastByte: don't think so
21:15 <@deen> Spyker: so, want to become a trial tester?
21:15 < Spyker> yes
21:16 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: what do you mean, "fix a pull request"?
21:16 < Spyker> im just saying i dont like saavik behavior
21:16 <@heinrich5991> rename it, change content, change commit content?
21:16 <@deen> Spyker: neither do i, but she's the most active tester by far
21:17 <@deen> Spyker: about 50% of all ddnet maps are tested by her personally
21:17 < Spyker> i know but i just dont like how she talk with me and she go afk in middle of testing
21:17 <@deen> Spyker: and sorry for all the insults from her =/
21:18 < Spyker> i ve nothing aganist you... or ddnet, im just angry with saavik, she cant talk to others like this, im talking with itachi, novo, pistro, cryonic and others and everyone said this
21:19 <@deen> Spyker: there you go, you're a trial tester
21:19 < Spyker> ok thanks deen, what i can do with this license? test on test server?
21:21 <@deen> you can download maps from forum, upload them on test server, test maps on test server
21:21 <@deen> report your results in forum
21:21 < Spyker> okay
21:21 <@deen> thanks for the help =)
21:22 < Spyker> so, for tournament map i ll ask 645654, he is friendly and we played a lot, he know me... the problem is just to find him online
21:22 <@deen> also, read the PMs i write you :P
21:22 < Spyker> okay
21:24 < Spyker> no pm, im waiting

21:26 < Spyker> okay, i go watch a film, bored of tw today... and angry ahah.. tomorrow i ll start testing and doing others stuff, bye!
21:34 < Spyker> Deen, I thought pm on ddnet forum, not here, thinked about that now ahah, can you send again..!? 
21:40 <@deen> ^^
21:40 <@deen> there you go Spyker 
21:44 <@deen> Now I know why South African servers are down so often: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout#South_Africa
21:46 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I thought about a pullrequest "reopen" and add/fix some commit
21:46 <@EastByte> but it was merged already anyway
21:46 <@deen> And great, GER2 has high ping now too for Deutsche Telekom...
21:46 < eeeee> D:
21:47 <@deen> all our pings just jumped from 20 to 70
21:47 <@deen> I guess we'll have to move out of Frankfurt to get more stable pings =/
21:48 < eeeee> gonna be hard to get both stable pings and at least "not getting kicked immediately"-class ddos protection
21:48 <@deen> indeed
21:48 <@EastByte> if not impossible
21:49 <@deen> and cheap of course
21:49 <@deen> because i know 3 perfect hosters with 400 € / month servers
21:49 <@deen> AWS uses telia, that explains it
22:07 <@deen> oh yeah, i also complained to my isp, which just resells Deutsche Telekom (DT ignores my mails always) They say a ping up to 200 is totally fine and not a problem
22:08 <@deen> but they just reply with default mails anyway
22:09 < laxa> deen: you should try to tell them you are changing ISP if they don't do something
22:09 < laxa> believe me, as a hardcore gamer, I would never let an ISP bully me into their bullshit
22:09 <@deen> laxa: i did that in another discussion with them, was totally useless
22:09 < laxa> hm
22:09 < laxa> well, you need to ask for "better" technician
22:09 < laxa> to have someone that can actually understand your problem then
22:10 <@deen> that was funny too: the only way for me to switch from 16mbit/s to 50mbit/s was to cancel my contract and make a new one, because their system says it's impossible to switch me over...
22:10 < laxa> hahaha
22:11 < eeeee> maybe now you have to cancel and switch to 16mbit and then cancel and switch back to 50mbit
22:11 < eeeee> to reset your contract and fix the ping issues
22:11 < laxa> well
22:11 < laxa> if you want some bullshit too
22:11 < laxa> my parents have the same ISP for like 10 years
22:11 < laxa> and they sent us a new modem and said "your modem is too old, we give you a new one and you have 1 month to replace it"
22:12 < laxa> I replaced it finally, we went from 7000 kbps to 5000 kbps
22:12 < laxa> isn't it amazing ?
22:12 <@deen> haha
22:12 < laxa> :D
22:14 < eeeee> man, russia is kinda a shitty country but the internet there is amazing for some reason. my parents have a no-bullshit, no-pppoe or anything, just flat 100mbit ethernet connection
22:14 < eeeee> with ping as good as it gets in russia, and only for like $15/month
22:15 <@EastByte> heard about that
22:15 < laxa> that would explain
22:15 < laxa> why all those russians play on Europe server
22:15 < laxa> cause they have such a good ping
22:16 < laxa> can't play a dota 2 game without russian...
22:25  * javascript_tee_ slaps eeeee around a bit with a large fishbot
22:26 < javascript_tee_> @eeeee hellu
22:27 <@deen> eeeee: javascript_tee_ wanted to know whether vsync can be deactivated
22:28 < javascript_tee_> Aye sir!
22:31 <@deen> This might answer it: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/14590/disable-v-sync-in-webgl
22:33 < javascript_tee_> Should try it out without ^.^
22:34 <@deen> i don't think it would make a difference
22:36 < eeeee> i dunno javascript_tee_ 
22:37 < eeeee> why would you want it deactivated?
22:37 < javascript_tee_> Mhh alright :0 
22:37 < javascript_tee_> Just an idea to maybe get more fps
22:37 < eeeee> it might be possible, but certainly not as easy as flipping some variable
22:38 < javascript_tee_> Mhh alright then~ If it's much work then it doesn't matter that much ^.^
22:38 < javascript_tee_> Was just an idea, nothing more :'D
22:38 < eeeee> currently js client uses the window.requestAnimationFrame api
22:38 < eeeee> it essentially just calls the javascript function that draws a frame, for each frame
22:39 < eeeee> and it automatically manages the frame rate, should default to your screen refresh rate if you have enough cpu/gpu power
22:39 < eeeee> drawing more frames than your screen refresh rate is just a waste of energy in most cases
22:40 < javascript_tee_> Mhh well I think I do. I mean I'm used to play with way more than 60 fps so my eye kinda notices the difference.. even if it isn't that big
22:40 < javascript_tee_> but 49-50fps is kinda unplayable for me >.<
22:41 < eeeee> are you using google chrome?
22:41 < javascript_tee_> Aye :0
22:41 < fstd> last time i checked, typical displays would refresh with 60Hz.  do you have something more fancy?
22:42 < javascript_tee_> Not really
22:42 < fstd> then "my eyes notice the difference" is pure imagination :)
22:43 < javascript_tee_> Nah it really isn't :'D
22:43 < javascript_tee_> After you get used to it you really notice the difference
22:43 < javascript_tee_> Idk it's kinda hard to describe I guess
22:43 < javascript_tee_> When I played with my laptop I used to play LoL with 15-30fps
22:43 < fstd> your display can not draw more than 60 fps, even if the software attempts to.
22:43 <@deen> fstd: on some windows machines i notice visible delays with vsync on, but not on linux, so it's weird
22:44 <@deen> maybe that's some triple buffering 
22:44 <@heinrich5991> what deen said
22:44 < fstd> deen: okay i'm of course assuming the case where vsync works :)
22:44 < javascript_tee_> Well.. I'm not even talking about more than that :0 Just saying that I notice a difference between 60 and 49-50 :'D
22:44 < fstd> okay, sounded like you were talking about >60.  fair enough
22:44 < eeeee> yeah vsync would increase latency a little bit, but shouldn't matter in js client
22:44 < javascript_tee_> Alright then :'D Was just an idea.
22:45 <@deen> i could never play with the screen tearing of vsync off anyway
22:45 < eeeee> js client still hits the screen refresh rate on my computer though, i guess your computer is not powerful enough
22:45 < javascript_tee_> Mhh
22:46 < eeeee> you can try running it in a smaller window, see if that helps
22:46 < javascript_tee_> I have 8gb ram, xeon e3-1230v3 and R9 270x oc..
22:47 < javascript_tee_> Shouldn't that be enough?
22:47 < eeeee> sorry, the min system requirements is gtx titan x sli
22:47 < eeeee> :P
22:47 < javascript_tee_> haha :'D
22:47 < javascript_tee_> I agree. A friend of mine bought a titan to play minecraft.. was fun 
22:47 < eeeee> it's hardcore photorealistic graphics, you know
22:47 < eeeee> not some cartoonish game
22:48 < javascript_tee_> ikr! Way better than those "realistic" graphics on GTA and such
22:49 <@deen> I would guess it works better with nvidia than amd
22:49 < eeeee> well it actually works okay-ish even on intel
22:50 <@deen> that's my experience on linux: nvidia and intel run fast, amd slow
22:50 < eeeee> yeah i don't have an amd to test
22:50 < javascript_tee_> afaik amd cpu is slow
22:50 < eeeee> but that is possible
22:50 < javascript_tee_> but gpu shouldn't rly matter.
22:50 < eeeee> because the rendering is kinda fucked up, has way too many shader switches
22:51 < eeeee> text and ui elements use different shaders, so for each button and label the renderer makes 2 switches
22:52 < eeeee> maybe that is less optimized on amd because it's a really retarded way to draw things
22:52 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: and there's two texture switches for one text rendering
22:52 <@deen> javascript_tee_: on linux it's mostly a driver problem
22:52 < eeeee> yeah
22:52 < javascript_tee_> I see
22:53 <@deen> talking about drivers: the latest nvidia driver (ready for gta5) breaks teeworlds for some people
22:53 < javascript_tee_> I don't have it
22:53 < javascript_tee_> :0
22:55 < eeeee> worry not, soon nvidia will add a feature to their "geforce experience" to download the best driver for each game
22:55 < eeeee> why not? it's only 300mb.
22:55 < javascript_tee_> Tbh I can't really answer that haha. I just didn't think of it.
22:56 < javascript_tee_> -Goes and dowloads it now-
22:56 < eeeee> oh and you'll need to reboot after playing each game. but why not? computers reboot fast these days.
22:56 < eeeee> http://www.quickmeme.com/img/a3/a3e74e84b75879442f73df18e67c1e0c8cb93e5919a4b3f1baba511bfa3e6cb8.jpg
22:57 < laxa> nimda should announces ddmax releases now
22:59 <@deen> we will see in 12 hours
23:00 < laxa> it will
23:00 < laxa> just checked my modification on rubular :)
23:00 < javascript_tee_> I'm out here :0 gnight guys
23:00 < javascript_tee_> bai bai laxa
23:00 < javascript_tee_> ily
23:00 <@deen> bye javascript_tee_ 
23:05 < laxa> Wow, when all people are crying about their privacy and their liberty
23:05 < laxa> I wasn't aware that all internet was already spying on us...
23:06 < laxa> When I see all the tracking that is done on the internet without most people even knowing about it...
23:10 <@deen> laxa: it's much worse and many forms of spying can't be blocked that easily
23:10 < laxa> Yeah, I wasn't even aware
23:10 <@deen> like facebook having profiles of people who have never even used facebook
23:11 < laxa> and people are wondering why browsers are taking so much RAM
23:11 < laxa> no wonder, with all the bullshit being loaded on every pages
23:30 < eeeee> ur government does all the spying. corporations don't have nearly as much spying power
23:37 < laxa> eeeee: I guess everyone has a different opinion about those things. I don't think my country (France) has the power to do mass spying right now. Especially since it's not really hard to hide yourself with private VPN, TOR etc.
23:39 < eeeee> my point is that it's easier to hide from corporations
23:39 <@deen> everyone has a different opinion about whether governments spy on their and other people? I thought that was pretty obvious, it's just that many don't care
23:39 < eeeee> at least they don't inject backdoors in your encrypion and hardware
23:41 < laxa> Hum...
23:42 < eeeee> just google "fbi tor" or sth :P
23:44 <@deen> there was this fun conspiracy about Bank of America a few days ago: "Bank of America’s online banking app requires you to accept microphones and cameras. McAfee called Bank of America and asked why they require microphones and cameras. They replied that – if you emptied all of the money in your account and said “it wasn’t me”, they could check, and then say: Well, it certainly looks like you. And it 
23:44 <@deen> certainly sounds like you. In order to do that, B of A’s app keeps your microphone and camera on for a half hour after you’ve finished your banking."
23:46 < eeeee> kek
23:47 < eeeee> certainly sounds fun, is it legit tho?
23:47 <@deen> Who knows, McAfee's stories always sound crazy and unbelievable
23:48 < eeeee> there's no fuken way you can keep the camera on for half an hour and not drain the battery to 0
23:48 <@deen> no camera light on most phones?
23:49 < eeeee> there is a camera light, and i guess apps are not supposed to be able to override it
23:50 < eeeee> but that is not impossible, maybe they found some way to escalate or sth
23:50 < eeeee> keeping the camera for half an hour without user noticing that the phone is suddenly veryhot and no battery, is not possible
23:53 < fstd> taking one pic ever so many seconds would probably suffice
23:53 < eeeee> might be, but that not what article says
23:53 < eeeee> so it's inaccurate at best, but most likely just bullshit
23:55 < fstd> also wouldn't work on my phone, since i installed an inofficial cyanogenmod build yesterday and now my camera doesn't even
23:55 < fstd> and neither the wifi, hurrah
23:56 < eeeee> should be happy, u haz so much privacy now
23:56 <@deen> oh, and microsoft reads every message you send through skype. at least I sent a few links and received visits from microsoft ips shortly after
23:56 < eeeee> yeah that's a known "feature"
23:57 < eeeee> why would you use skype anyway, it's horrible even without spying
23:57 < fstd> ^
23:57 <@deen> there used to be another skype feature, where you get used as a proxy for other people's calls if you have a nice connection, back when it was more p2p
23:58 < eeeee> back when it was not microsoft, maybe
23:58 <@deen> I use skype for ddnet communication with mappers and testers, because most people just have skype
