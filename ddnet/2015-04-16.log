18:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #191: added /r, /rescue: teleport yourself out of freeze (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vvirS
19:20 <@EastByte> eeeee: I can do some rocketflying using your js client :D
19:22 <@deen> and I helped some noobs with a few parts^^
19:22 <@deen> works well enough
19:22 <@EastByte> yep
20:14 < eeeee> /r ? in my ddnet? it's more likely than you think.
20:31 < fstd> offer /r as a pay2win feature!
20:31 < eeeee> pay2fail feature would be more profitable in tw
20:32 < eeeee> where you pay for someone else to fail
20:33 < fstd> would prolly generate infinite profit on block servers
20:42 <@EastByte> ^ probably
20:45 <@EastByte> block has such a bad influence
20:47 < fstd> has generated a lot of skill, awesome tricks and drama, too
20:47 <@EastByte> yes, that's true
20:49 <@deen> and causes the nicest ddos attacks!
20:49 < fstd> everything comes at a cost!
20:56 <@EastByte> deen: when we have a new GER we can get rid of block right? :3
21:03 <@deen> hm, why?
21:05 <@EastByte> well since you are asking I don't want to argue anyway :P
21:09 < o_be_one> hellow
21:10 <@deen> hi
21:19 < o_be_one> oh deen idk if you know, but freezehammer is available event if we are not in sv_test 1
21:19 < o_be_one> even*
21:20 <@deen> o_be_one: is that not ok?
21:22 < o_be_one> deen, im able to do freezehammer ID/all/me on all ddnet servers
21:22 < o_be_one> its a cheat no ?
21:22 <@deen> it slows people down
21:23 <@deen> i don't think you can use it to make a faster time or help anyone, so i wouldn't consider it a cheat
21:23 < o_be_one> oh ok so you see that like an admin command ?
21:23 <@deen> yes
21:23 < o_be_one> oh ok i understand
22:19 <@deen> eeeee: is that ok with you if I run DDNet GER2? Too many ping problems on GER recently =/
22:44 < eeeee> deen: GER2 can't hold the load for too long in the present state, but i can upgrade it
22:44 <@deen> i hope it won't get much load
22:44 < eeeee> then sure, go ahead
22:45 < eeeee> just keep in mind that if it does get too much load it will start lagging horribly
22:46 < eeeee> i'll keep an eye on it and upgrade if seems necessary, but that might incur some downtime
