05:06 <+Konsti> I would like to get my Map Intercepter rerated from 1* to 2* Brutal. Its very long and definitely does not fit a 1* map. This was already suggested right after release but didnt happen back then, i think because it didnt work somehow, so far i remember. Thanks
05:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> change OldschoolAdventure from 1* solo to 2* solo before u do anything else lmao
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to make a patch for ghidra, the integration tests have been running for the last 14 hour
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently I need more cores then a macbook has
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you work on a large project which is probably mission critical, are your tests this extensive? There are more then 3500 integration tests here, it still didn't end ðŸ˜›
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think they add tests for everything they add
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw it on a blog post
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hookrace.net/blog/hana-cpp-development/
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Hundreds of developers from all around the world are developing on about 10 million lines of C++ code and 15 million lines of Python tests."
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what kind of beastly computers they run these kinds of testsets on
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/appliances.html#categories=certified&order=MemoryDesc
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why wonder, when it is in the blog post
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt >16h is acceptable for tests
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I need a cluster ðŸ˜›
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 you wouldn't believe the amount of testing we do. we have a first stage of unit tests for our team (many thousands, takes a few seconds), a second stage of integration tests (takes 1-2 hours), a barrier to get into the main branches (takes 12-24 hours distributed among many systems with dozens of cores each) and then conti tests that only run weekly with the really extensive performance tests
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the perf tests for the barrier run in parallel on a pool of quad socket 22 core machines (176 threads each) with > 350 GB of RAM. For larger tests we also have bigger machines with > 1 TB RAM
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the perf tests for the barrier run in parallel on a pool of quad socket 22 core machines (176 threads total) with > 350 GB of RAM. For larger tests we also have bigger machines with > 1 TB RAM
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but yes, test times are a problem. removing tests is also bad, so you have to improve the tests to run faster and still test the relevant stuff
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and yeah, customers have even crazier systems than we have internally, see @Ryozuki's list
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so much ram
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/705349054929960980/unknown.png
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 24 Teras of ram
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's always horrible when a customer has a performance issue on a large system, hard to reproduce those numa effects
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> numa?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> non-uniform memory access
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some memory is closer to one cpu than to the other, so it matters where you put your data
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh god
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki There are larger systems as well, but maybe not off-the-shelf. At least PayPal already had a single 48 TB machine on HANA 4 years ago
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 why not just make a test push and let their infrastructure test it?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I never ran our full integration tests on my machine, always just the ones I think are relevant, and the rest can be done centrally
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They don't run their tests on a public CI, not even sure they run the tests until before a release
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried all the relevant tests on my own computer and created a PR, guess they'll let me know ðŸ˜›
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen when you have a minute you should rebuild the dmg file on ddnet.tw, it's still built with curl that has ssl disabled
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I guess I should also rebuild the libs first?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well at the very least you'll have to rebuild curl
13:39 <@Learath2> the output of configure should be telling you whether it is building with ssl
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @Learath2
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> demo can save in fields>
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I added the osxcross_conf requirement, we used to hard code darwin15 which is wrong, it depends on with which version of the sdk you build osxcross with
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, still doesn't work though
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> linker error now
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I should use darwin17 for my lib builds?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, setting darwin17 still fails the same way. any suggestions?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @deen
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> demo can save or no?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean in file based server? no
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> in field
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's a field?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> in folder
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> without other programms
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> save as a video or as a demo file?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check out config_directory.bat
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there is a demo directory
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> ?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @deen
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> how see this
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> where you have the DDNet.exe there is also a config_directory.bat
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> ok
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @deen
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> i cant
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> its in pause
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> i cant
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> wiew it
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @deen
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 with this it builds, but not sure if it actually works: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/e8bd8459a6f556594f48f33f4d145033bc89d46f
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can try https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-13.1-osx.dmg
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, @deen you need to build compiler rt in osxcross too
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a script included in osxcross to build compiler-rt
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then rebuild libs and everything?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, that should resolve the undefined symbol without relying on weak linking
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think only libcurl uses the os version check
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you could also use osxcross_conf so you dont have to hardcode dawrin17
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it passes CFLAGS?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to configure calls?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also isnt darwin17 10.15? I think we still cant update that far because of the sdl peoblem (it should be fine in sdl 2.0.13)
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i have 10.13, so no idea
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah 17 is 10.13, sorry the 5 different versionings get confusing
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Re: osxcross_conf thing. I think its fine like this, nvm my earlier remark
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> opinion on whether I should just force-push ddnet-libs and ddnet?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't want to add more useless megabytes of mac libs
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mind force pushing ddnet-libs
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you need to force push ddnet too?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesnt ddnet just track ddnetlibs through a commit id?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, and you have to make a commit to change that
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ye, but you can just push a new commit, but I guess that'll make the previous commit unbuildable
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I wouldn't do that
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I think it's close enough to the previous commit
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It shouldnt be too bad
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would you like me to test it before you push?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> still the same failure with compiler-rt
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah no
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> this one linking error is gone
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just 5 others left!
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you show me, I probably already came accross them, I built this in osxcross
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2156
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, the notifications ones I can fix myself
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just the ssl ones are interesting
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen you could have a tag for the old tip of ddnet-libs
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I hadn't built it with notifications
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you show me the configure output from curl?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/705497613088194610/curl-build.log
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I'm lost there we are building for 10.9 builtin_available should be dropping that call to _SSLCopyALPNProtocols
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe the 10.9 build is not communicated properly from osxcross-conf
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try entering it manually in CMakeLists.txt
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET set correctly?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> never seen that
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> where to set it?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well if you aren't setting it it's being set to 10.9
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so that's not it
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay building libcurl
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry you have to do it again :/
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have no idea why this mac building is so hard
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you are not the one that has to be sorry, I'm the one that keeps breaking it ðŸ˜›
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> According to https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/2835 we need -mmacosx-version-min=10.13
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or 12
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or linking against Security.framework: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/7260
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems like we are already
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or use SDK 10.13.4: https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/241268
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that call to _SSLCopyALPNProtocols is protected by __builtin_available, it shouldn't even appear in the final curl static library :/
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when compiling, if the deployment target is lower then the builtin available, clang should just optimize that out
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was doing it just fine a couple weeks ago when you "fixed" that libcurl issue by changing the deployment target
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then I should set the deployment target explicitly?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah maybe try setting it explicitly
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with the cmake thing?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe cmake is messing up
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the cmake thing should be setting to 10.9 just fine
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe just pass --mminblabla like we used to?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but this is something wrong with the compilation of curl then ddnet I think
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i tried that already, didn't work
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think this has the right explanation: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/2835
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Probably we use 10.13 SDK lower than 10.13.4
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> afk
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, apparently clang doesn't optimize that out, even on macOS
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I'm an idiot, that's the whole point of @available, it's to be able to target old macOS but still use newer functions if available
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but still, it shouldn't be trying to hard-link it
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you are right that we need a newer sdk, that availability being wrong in the SecureTransport.h is messing with clangs mind
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can you provide one for me? ðŸ˜„
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can but I need to download the xcode image that'll take a while with the shitty internet here
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no hurry
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 5gb wow ðŸ˜„
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go take a shower while that downloads
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think `c9dfcb2b` should have instead renamed notifications.mm to notifications.m as it no longer uses any Objective C++ features, but either is fine
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (as Objective C++ is a superset of Objective C)
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't understand
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It was .m before, that didn't link
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know details about Objective C/C++
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, we don't have it extern c so calling it from C++ has mangled names
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this is fine in that case
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> right, I was always thinking about putting extern c
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we had some mm files already, so meh
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> could also rename system.c to system.cpp while we're at it
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well why mess with it now? We can do that rename when we actually want to use a C++ feature in system.c no?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because C++ has more reasonable semantics and Microsoft only supports C89 which is even worse
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like declaring all variables at the start of scope
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or the thing where in C a function "void x()" accepts any parameter
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep forgetting msvc only does c89
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One thing I'll miss from C will be the implicit cast of void *
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I noticed
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I'm also close to getting my commit into ghidra, I'll have officially helped the NSA conquer the world by fixing a small UI oddity ðŸ˜›
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice
