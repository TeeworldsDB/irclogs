00:13 < nadsfy> Hey, is there a way to activate /showall automaticly if you join the game?
00:13 < nadsfy> *automatically
00:22 <@deen> nadsfy: there used to be, but they removed it!
00:22 <@deen> also annoying me
00:22 <@deen> as an alternative you can do bind minus "zoom-; say /showall 1"
00:28 < nadsfy> thx :)
04:51 < Learath2> hmm maybe we should add on join auto chat
04:51 < Learath2> or onjoinddnet to avoid spamming vanilla servers

22:31 < necropotame> Henningstone, thanks a lot for your patience and to backport this bugfix :)
22:32 < Henningstone> necropotame: well at least I tried...
22:36 < necropotame> As long as it leads to a solution, it means that it was useful :)
22:37 < Henningstone> Right... I guess it's just bugging me that I haven't messed something up that badly since quite some time
23:47 < Learath2> Henningstone: sorry if i sounded nitpicky :/
23:51 < Henningstone> Learath2: Oh didn't mean to say that, you were right about everything. Actually; thanks for pointing out all the things that I oversaw there :o
