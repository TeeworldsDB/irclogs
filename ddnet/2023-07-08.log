06:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> i hate the kog accounts system
06:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> weeks ago i went out of my way to reserve a name and create an account and stuff
06:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> login and whatever
06:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> now i join and am trying to play after already having been logged in prior and it says i have to /login to join the game. it says to do `/help login`; this is all it says
06:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127089064810643526/image.png
06:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> how do you fuck it up that badly
06:21 < bridge_> <totar> @mpft you need to go to the website then it gives you a login code
06:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> i logged off
06:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> i need a login code for one session?
06:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> im glad kog did it first so ddnet can know what not to do if/when they make their impl
07:00 < bridge_> <Vappy> Bind it, and then join a server just click it
07:00 < bridge_> <Vappy> Just click the key :D

07:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> and it let me in the game on map change lmfao
07:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> w/o loggin in
07:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can also chat
07:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> unless a mod did something but idk
10:39 < ChillerDragon> how can one random dude spam so massively? Is quakenet so small or unprotected? I get pings in multiple irc channels and dms on almost a daily basis from 1 ip
10:46 < ChillerDragon> @Ewan yea i also full on raged about /help login so many things it could mention. That its not your password but a code from the website. Where to find it. And so on
10:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127159024589209670/image.png
10:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is related to rust lmfao
11:04 < bridge_> <deen> The way that IRC works means you can't remove messages after they have been sent. Makes it perfect for spamming
11:13 < ChillerDragon> ok sure deen but what about banning or ratelimiting a ip that spams the entire network?
11:56 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious bro what k3s is epic it took me multiple hours to get vanilla k8s with kubeadm working. It took me a few minutes to do the same with k3s wtf thanks for the tip. I knew k3s is widley used but never set it up didnt expect it to be that much smoother
12:16 < bridge_> <avolicious> Its super small ðŸ¥¹ But nice
12:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> @ravie_ravie Progress spinner design (in sound settings just for testing)
12:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127184042987622490/Progress-Spinner.mp4
12:41 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> honestly I don't think the gradient look fits the ui, also it's quite pixelly so maybe let's just spin some quad with texture?
12:44 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> ah also it looks too big to fit on a button
12:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127190215770001528/Progress-Spinner-2.mp4
12:58 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> @robyt3 I feel like you're overengineering it ðŸ˜„ this would be more than good enough

13:00 < bridge_> <patiga> looks cool though :D
13:17 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> we can also do it more fancy like this
13:17 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127196781726420998/image.png
13:19 < bridge_> <astramast> what is nightly client
13:19 < bridge_> <astramast> @vy0x2 Thank you my lord for multy spec view
13:20 < bridge_> <gerdoe> build compiled of current master branch
13:20 < bridge_> <astramast> why it's called nightly ?
13:21 < bridge_> <patiga> many development teams have daily compiled version of the software in its newest state, with stuff in it which isn't tested sufficiently yet
13:22 < bridge_> <patiga> so its "nightly" probably because they usually compiled during the night and have the unstable version of the software to try on the next day

13:57 < bridge_> <learath2> Ew k8s user
14:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> @robyt3
14:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127208821794820147/gif.gif
14:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> hmm, I like the 80% circle more, this feels a bit old to me
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> make sleeping tee, or walking tee
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> as loading indication
14:13 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> it fits the tw ui, we're not trying to make a generic modern javascript ui
14:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> you are not trying to do it* xd
14:13 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> true I'm trying to prevent it
14:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if u want tw ui, make it look teeworlds related
14:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> right now it just looks like someone forgot it in 1999
14:14 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> nah it's about matching the style, not slapping tees on everything
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we need a tee loading
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> icon
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats it
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a tee showing the emote with 3 dots
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and each dot animated
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> make a 3d UI.. that would be hipster
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 2d game, 3d ui
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 3d game, 2d ui
14:18 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> 4d ui
14:43 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, I like Ravie's more the 80% circle needs a little more transparent tail and needs to be less pixelly, needs some aliasing, might be too much work
14:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Making it not pixelly is the only hard part unless you use FSAA for the entire client
14:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Or just prerender the image and only rotate it in the client
14:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah, idk how to clean up just that either. Maybe aliasing it by hand?
14:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah I guess this is the only easy way
15:21 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I have some other suggestions since you guys dislike the other one
15:21 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127228030281076837/gif.gif
15:44 < bridge_> <Iza> the left is best
15:44 < bridge_> <Iza> and your first suggestion looks too old
15:57 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> the middle one looks the most fitting to me
15:58 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> no it's a timeless design
15:58 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> the classic look fits tw ui but I rest my case
15:59 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i didnt see this either
15:59 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> yea this can work!
16:01 < bridge_> <Iza> yea i bet windows xp looks also timeless
16:02 < bridge_> <Iza> i like the idea of transitioning an applications design language to something more modern and simplistic over time
16:02 < bridge_> <Iza> it's like watching it evolve
16:03 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> a simple and clean design doesn't get "old"
16:04 < bridge_> <Iza> your first suggestion is rather complex to todays standards
16:04 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> we dont need to reinvent the wheel tho
16:04 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> pun unintended
16:09 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> nah it just has an outline, not everything has to be a flat color against a flat color
16:09 < bridge_> <Iza> its not what i meant
16:09 < bridge_> <Iza> it is too detailed for something thats supposed to be small
16:10 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> it's not that small
16:10 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I gave up on the idea of putting it on a button, better put it in the middle of the window that is loading
16:12 < bridge_> <Iza> i think i have an idea that is universally agreeable
16:12 < bridge_> <Iza> what if we make this icon right here rotate as its loading
16:12 < bridge_> <Iza> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127240761675616256/image.png
16:13 < bridge_> <Iza> with a smooth f curve it would look very neat i think
16:15 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> we can't rotate text and also this is gonna be used in other places
16:16 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> like loading assets or demos
16:16 < bridge_> <Iza> make it an image, or some sort of gif
16:17 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> yeah it's gonna be a rotating image
16:21 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious how do you mount maps into the tw server pods?
18:26 < bridge_> <louis.place> right one best
18:26 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> that's my favorite as well
18:27 < bridge_> <louis.place> u can try make it a slight gradient too
18:27 < bridge_> <louis.place> a little less alpha per dash
18:27 < bridge_> <louis.place> well maybe it'd look weird if it's a full circle
18:27 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> gradients don't really fit tw ui imo, and it's just a rotating image
18:28 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> or do u mean like in the first one I made?
18:29 < bridge_> <louis.place> yes
18:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I tried, looks strange when it's spinning tho
18:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> the first one used the fade to fake a rotation
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> first but with different circle size
18:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://materializecss.com/preloader.html
18:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> under section circular
18:39 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> that's too thin
18:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> then make it thicker xd
18:39 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I'd like something that has this chunky feel and an outline that the text and icons have
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/spinner#usage
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but these are more interesting
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> then simply spinning
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> than simply spinning
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> same with adding different shades
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or variable dot sized
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or variable dot sizes
18:42 < bridge_> <louis.place> for menu UI loading buttons i think simpler is better
18:42 < bridge_> <louis.place> maybe for like loading in a map u can have something that looks cooler or idk
18:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just make a terminal and remove all GUI, back to the 90'
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well chrome uses this
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> when pressing f5
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> in the icon of the tab
18:50 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> we don't need anything interesting, you will see this for 0.5s, we need something that you can recognize in such short time
18:50 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> so the simpler the better
18:52 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I like the 6 dashes best, the Â¼ missing circle is a bit boring and unbalanced looking to me
18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> we need smth that looks fancy af for 0.001 seconds, so you know some dev wasted 20 hours implementing it even tho you will never ever see it
18:57 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> yeah overly complicated and superfluous seems to be the ddnet way
19:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I found something even better than 6 dashes, presenting 5 dashes
19:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127284314271404134/gif.gif
19:11 < bridge_> <Iza> looks like a minimalistic flower symbol
19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> hate me or not but it just looks ugly af xDD
19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> how can u like that more than the spinners i showed
19:14 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> how can you like some generic flat website looking spinner over something nice that fits the tw style
19:14 < bridge_> <Iza> what spinners?
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> bro what tw style xD
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> u always say tw ui style, have u ever looked into vanilla 0.6 client?
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> there is no tw ui style
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it was simply glued together bcs nobody was motivated to do smth
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1127277604408393850
19:15 < bridge_> <Iza> for me its still this one that is the best by far
19:15 < bridge_> <Iza> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127286897371254914/image.png
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if u want tw style, why do u disable background maps?
19:15 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I mean the way stuff is rounded, has outlines etc, you can't slap some random flat thing on it and say it fits
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> that is tw style
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> u can give the spinner an outline if thats so important
19:16 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> that it's not gonna look good with an outline
19:16 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> is*
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> even from these i still find the round the best
19:16 < bridge_> <Iza> looks just like the windows loading symbol
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> its a pretty common loading circle yes
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i just looked, even egui uses it
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://www.egui.rs/
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> under "ProgressBar"
19:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Add freeze particle effects on it and boom
19:19 < bridge_> <Iza> interesting website
19:19 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> most boring
19:19 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Does anybody know how i catch a mouseclicked in this area? spectator.cpp
19:19 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Or is there anything about that documented?
19:19 < bridge_> <vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127287826866774198/image.png
19:19 < bridge_> <Iza> most boring is the most commonly like by the mass
19:19 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> well not by me
19:20 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> simple doesn't have to mean boring, the other ones I made are fun
19:20 < bridge_> <Iza> loading symbols are something that shouldn't be complex by any means, they should just fit the flow
19:20 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> they're not complex by any means
19:20 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> none of them
19:20 < bridge_> <Iza> like i said, they're too detailed for something small
19:20 < bridge_> <Iza> especially in todays modern design
19:21 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> apparently design is not something I'd know a thing about
19:21 < bridge_> <Iza> me neither, i'm just an art school student
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well if u look at two websites, u can have an opinion on which looks nicer
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> u dont need to be an artist for that
19:22 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> @jupeyy_keks I'm not saying the ones you posted are ugly, they're just not good in this context
19:23 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> they're good in the context of a generic minimalistic modern website xd
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> why is teeworlds not allowed to look sexy tho <.<
19:23 < bridge_> <Iza> less is more
19:23 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> it's not sexy to put a thing which has a style that totally doesn't fit
19:23 < bridge_> <Iza> especially with something small like this xd
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> then do animated dots
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> jumping up and down
19:24 < bridge_> <Iza> that screaam 2000s design
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> xd
19:24 < bridge_> <Iza> that screams 2000s design
19:24 < bridge_> <Iza> and ye i agree with ravie that your suggestion isnt fitting for the ddnet look
19:25 < bridge_> <Iza> its too thin, too animated
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well anything is too animated
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> bcs we didnt use any animations yet
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> except maybe the hover effect for the top buttons
19:26 < bridge_> <Iza> because we don't wanna end up with a goofy client that has performance issues with older pcs
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> animations wont kill the perf i guess
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> animations are often simply annoying
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> the smooth scrollbar for example, costs time
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> that is actually something i dislike
19:26 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> that's why a simple spin is perfect
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno why we added that xd
19:27 < bridge_> <Iza> really? i love the smooth scrolling
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but to me it looks ugly and doesn't fit
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> on your 60hz screen maybe xD
19:27 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> what should it be then? static? you can't get a simpler motion
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> on 240hz its completely useless
19:27 < bridge_> <Iza> 144
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or just make a small animated line under the button
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> and dont do anything spinning at all
19:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> we actually already have this
19:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127290219134201866/image.png
19:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> in the server browser
19:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> u just never saw it bcs its only if the old tw protocol is used (not http server browser)
19:30 < bridge_> <Iza> i don't think we should make the loading bar that appearent, because for most people the loading doesnt even take a second
19:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well i meant under the button
19:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> not here
19:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or inside the button
19:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> like the buttom of the button xD
19:31 < bridge_> <Iza> or like a transluscent progress bar that is filling the button
19:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or simply no progress indication
19:31 < bridge_> <Iza> go back to stone age
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> disable the refresh button
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> while loading
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> visually
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ez as that
19:32 < bridge_> <Iza> that is a simple but a strong function
19:32 < bridge_> <Iza> not bad
19:33 < bridge_> <Iza> but i think Ravie mentioned that he wants to make loading spinners that can be used universally in ddnet
19:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but its funny how there is more discussion about a button than accounts xd
19:33 < bridge_> <Iza> xdd
19:36 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> daily stupid idea of tsfreddie: iirc someone had some idea of generating a id or key pair of some sort to use as identification instead of use any credentials. what if we did do that and added steam cloud config so steam users (a lot of them) get automatic account backup
19:36 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> i remember steam cloud doesn't require any implementation and was setup through steamwork console?
19:37 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> or have a config backup before the id thing would be nice i guess?
19:38 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> like config, friends and fav backup, might need to separate graphic config to a separate file tho.
19:38 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> like config, friends and fav in cloud save, might need to separate graphic config to a separate file tho.
19:44 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> It would be great to add unfreeze to rcon tele just like the practice tele
19:44 < bridge_> <Iza> if you use /tp, it unfreezes you
19:45 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> It's what I just said
19:45 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> /tp is for practice tele
19:45 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> for the sake of context, this is the idea (so it's not tiny)
19:46 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127294522322325675/a.png
19:46 < bridge_> <Iza> ah didnt understand you
19:46 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> ðŸ˜„
19:46 < bridge_> <Iza> still looks like a flower
19:47 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> why flower?
19:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> a tee reading a book to represent "server lookup"
19:47 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> odd amount of dashes looks more fun which fits
19:48 < bridge_> <Iza> those 5 short leafs growing out of the center
19:48 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I think you smoke too much minimalism if any radially symmetric thing resembles a flower
19:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> can it never make sense for testing that smth is freezed to emulate some behavior?
19:49 < bridge_> <Iza> i'm sure im not the only one to see the resemblence of a flower in it
19:50 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> odd amount does look more oragnic but I wouldn't just to calling it a flower
19:50 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> odd amount does look more organic but I wouldn't jump to calling it a flower
19:50 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I can't think of a case where it would be a problem
19:51 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Rcon tele is often used to teleport around, unfortunately you have to be in practice + rcon to test decently not to have to super unsuper after each rcon tele
19:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> mh ok, also cant really think of when it would be useful
19:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> at least not for normal freeze
19:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> deepfreeze would be different
19:59 < bridge_> <Iza> this is the closest i could find for now, just imagine the center part were invisible

20:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i mean a flower is not too bad :lol:
20:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> the leaves have to pulse
20:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> in size
20:01 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> so if you add a few things, it looks like the most minimal flower possible :thonk:
20:01 < bridge_> <Iza> not really
20:02 < bridge_> <Iza> the most minmalistic would probably be just a plain dot
20:02 < bridge_> <Iza> but yeah
20:02 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> nah a dot is a dot
20:02 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> unless you add other flower context which this doesn't have either
20:02 < bridge_> <Iza> minimalism crosses the line between what is defined and what is undefined
20:04 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> so anything can be anything if you want it to be, got it
20:04 < bridge_> <Iza> welcome to symbolism and its meanings
20:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> that's not how it works
20:05 < bridge_> <teero777> i made the mona lisa guys!
20:05 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127299471882080276/image.png
20:05 < bridge_> <Iza> i don't know but that thing looks like a flower and im standing by it
20:06 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> if it doesn't have any context that would suggest it's a flower despite not looking like one, then it's just your imagination ðŸ˜„
20:07 < bridge_> <Iza> :jaouis:
20:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> vanilla vs ddnet
