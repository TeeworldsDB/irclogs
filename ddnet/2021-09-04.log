11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i think it predicts deep hammer wrongly when it's not enabled? i use latest upstream code

11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don't move btw
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> oops
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye you are right
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if this wasnt before and you have a bit of time, you could do git bisect and open an issue
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it was before
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> this is a sv_config, right? so the client may not know about it
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I mean, the client most likely doesnt know if hammer in deep is enabled or not on the server
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> actually i can't say anything
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but situation is - sometimes you can see this bug, sometimes not
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 please merge before^^
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @HamidReza yo, i deleted the issue (for the editor bug) cause i used your version of ddnet (this one https://github.com/HamidReza585/ddnet). with the official version it works perfectly so if u want to fix it ðŸ™‚
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Well I don't think there's anythingto fix, that fork is just created for contributing to main one so maybe it was not just fetched when you downloaded it
