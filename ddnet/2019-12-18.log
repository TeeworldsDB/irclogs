00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen this somehow never happened until today 😛
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> help, how to open the ddnet server log on linux?
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> where i can see all the commands and stuff
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rn when i open the exec it shows nothing but still runs somewhere
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis run it from a terminal window

12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Longer release description this time? ^^
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/656831924911865887/screenshot_2019-12-18_13-11-58.png

13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i asynced the sdl poll
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> makes the FPS and prediction much more consistent
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen might be interesting for u 😄
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> indeed, do you plan to merge that to DDNet?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but is it really better btw?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i mean you still have the poll latency, you just don't see it
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am currently not sure if that breaks other SDL stuff but u can always try my things at my repo
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/test_async_msg_poll
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and i thought async polling isn't possible in sdl in general
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it isnt
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except u move all initalization to another thread
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and thats what i did
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its bit hacky rn, and i dunno if other SDL calls would be need to be called from that thread too
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu that's not the release desc, it's at https://ddnet.tw/downloads
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen do you know why the travis mac build fails? it shows missing sdl2, opusfile, etc. (don't need to investigate if you don't know)
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, no idea
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i guess the easiest approach would be to just install the missing packages
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but it wouldn't continually test that you can build it on a mac without doing so
13:22 <@deen> then fetch ddnet-libs I guess
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh there is no need on mac to install dependencys?
13:26 <@deen> we should be bundling them
13:27 <@deen> I guess some git submodule update would help
13:27 <@deen> in the .travis file
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so it worked at some point i guess
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, submodule is there
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cant watch teehistorian demos anymore with new client 😢
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://travis-ci.org/ddnet/ddnet/jobs/626663065#L64
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like backward-compatibility broke @Learath2
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/656835312223256586/unknown.png
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, it's a bug, should be fixed
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well that didnt work https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/blob/test_travis_submodule/.travis.yml#L14
13:32 <@deen> you could ls -lha ddnet-libs and check what's going on in there :D
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is it a bug with the demos you generate or is it a bug with my code?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug with your code when it encounters demos without sha256s
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it sounds like you search for a map with zero sha256 if there's no sha256 in the demo
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> demos without sha256 should be fine as long as they are not marked the newest version
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All my old demos work fine afterall
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. then it might be my fault
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you add the map in the demo?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     Crc = m_DemoPlayer.GetMapInfo()->m_Crc;
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     SHA256_DIGEST Sha = m_DemoPlayer.GetMapInfo()->m_Sha256;
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     pError = LoadMapSearch(m_DemoPlayer.Info()->m_Header.m_aMapName, &Sha, Crc);
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it tries to extract the map, and that leads to a 0 length map
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like you unconditionally search for the map with the sha256, even if it's not present
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even if the sha256 is not present
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/656837381936250890/unknown.png
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> leet
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 oh, does LoadMapSearch not handle SHA256_ZEROED?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `LoadMapSearch` searches for a zero sha256 in that case
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pass a null pointer if you want to ignore the sha256 hash
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IIRC
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, so a `Sha == SHA256_ZEROED ? nullptr : &Sha` there should fix it
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also a check for 0 length maps
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you put 0 length right?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's in there already I think
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1939/files#diff-3a2c6461bb00c0df0869a493e7b743baR795
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I was thinking ahead 😄
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I should add a return though, so I can check whether a map was extracted
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you think I should check that the map actually hashes to the hash provided? currently I just trust the hash added
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I should given I'm saving the map and demos could be used to inject maps otherwise
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, I looked at it and it looks like an vulnerable file system write as well
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't really check that the file is an actual map
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not too bad as long as it's confined to the maps/ directory
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> overwriting with wrong maps is not *too* bad either, the loader will discard the map if the sha256 doesn't match
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's still a bit bad for the demo to effectively delete maps out of the downloadedmaps/ folder
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, one more thing, I'm not sure if it's bad or not, but you can craft a demo where size is wrong
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk what will happen then if the size is too large
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing too bad either
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it will write out a short demo in this case
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or maybe dump some uninitialized memory. hm
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is no easy way to figure out if the size is right though :/
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I'll fix the bug for now
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao if you aren't busy you can give this a try
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> works

15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen dont wanna push but are there any issues with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/pull/39 ?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Faketuning should be gone @ChillerDragon
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was in 0.6 because we didnt want to break backwards client compatibility
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not used in this pr
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its just a placeholder
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then remove it
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this would break compatibility
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it expects to read something
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i could rename it to FakeTunePlaceholder
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but meh
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just remove it from thr string
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what string
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Where does it expect to read it?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> from the save blob i guess
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.6 and 0.7 savegames are incompatible anyways
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least its deactivated
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why are those incompatible?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/656866887975698464
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but do you really thinking breaking the format is the way to go?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you even set it and readded the variable
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just remove it and dont set it
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I mean currently you can save a 0.6 game and then load it in 0.7 and then save again and load in 0.6 without messing up fake tuning
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so where is the problem
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It is disallowed anyways
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> currently yes
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also ammocost is unused in 0.7
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if it should be activated at some time, then there will be another solution for it. It gets fucked up, for example if you go to another part where in 0.6 you would get faketune_jetpack, you wouldnt get it in 0.7, if you then load in 0.6 again you dont have the correct faketuning
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> true
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so use completley different formats for 0.6 and 0.7 saves :/
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds like work
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course it is work
15:41 <@deen> loads and saves between 0.6 and 0.7 should never be compatible
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oke
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 👍🏼
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Vanilla will add simple race support
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It will show the timer correctly
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they did already
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We should adapt to it when ite released
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut y but its not yey rlsed
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> y
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guesd they will rls it on 24
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Shit mobile
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ok i removed the 0.6 stuff from the savegames
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> hey guys. i have problems with cursor when i'm using graphics tablet
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why are u playing teeworlds with a graphics tablet
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> teeworlds handles cursors oddly its hard to play with touchscreen/tablet like you would expect
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> bcs i prefer to use the tablet like a main device
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mathan> and it's fun to play with tablet xd
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, never tried this or heard anyone else do it
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what kinda problems do you get?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> ❄
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> @Mathan my tablet has a mouse mode in its driver settings, which i use for playing tw
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> I played tw with graphic tablet long time ago
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> I made it compatible on my client, its very cool to play with it, fng zcatch and block, but i dont prefer ddnet
