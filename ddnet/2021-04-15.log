00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> dont make me throw up pls
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wow shots
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gores community is the 2nd biggest
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> It just happend communities build around them gametypes and thats really it
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant be that boring
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :PepeLaugh:
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> "boring" is kinda rude to gores players...
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> well its my opinion
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ddrace seems to only host mods that add something new to the game
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> gores is just diff style of map and it's not ddnet-style
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean to contrast, i think of unique  there's really interesting ideas on unique, but i think it's cool that they are separate
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and i dont feel the same way about kog for some reason xD
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean to contrast, i think of unique, there's really interesting ideas on unique, but i think it's cool that they are separate
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gores is for tryhards like me
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> race is boring too but at least it's fast paced
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> race is also for tryhards
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yea
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> or oldschool ppl
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah xd
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idk i like race kinda
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but you're right it can get boring
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Race is just really hard to get into i think
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i feel like race being boring is only because of the maps. there are good solo maps on ddnet so there could be better race maps naturally
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Its way to hard to get a decent time In most maps
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Same with gores, racing ins/hards is also hard üôÇ
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> for me the hardest modes to get into are fng/vanilla
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> fng is easy to get into
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> cus there's very little way to show progress
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u just aim and shoot
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Gores can only be played with a ping of about 20 and No lags
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or feel gratification for anything lol
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yea thats what i hate about it
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> lag once = u die
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> otherwise its decently fun for a chill gamemode
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> even if its kinda boring
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> o i dont mean difficulty, just my willingness to play it
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> vanilla is hard to get into on a good level czu theres a bunch of useless tech u need to know but otherwise its neat to fool around with
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> imo
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> but you'll play gores :lol:
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> but you all play gores :lol:
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> I dont play kog As the leaders are a bunch of dickheads
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yes i play it cus theres no good recent ddnet maps o_o
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wait lets talk in #general or smth shouldnt we
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sure
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Yh lets move
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> client-side anticheat is impossible in general, this has relatively little to do with being open-source
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> It will just slow down official clients, if ddnet would be closed source since beginning it would be another topic
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. see huge games with companies with lots of money failing to fight against e.g. aimbots
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> eventually a game big enough gets hypervisor based clients and then you have to rely on heuristics
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Thats because most of them dont wanna waste that much money into their anti-cheat solutions. Check VALORANT, imho the best anti-cheat yet, pretty aggressive thats why i cant play it
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's a mess
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Same thing with DRM, most games removes DRM after ~1 week/month or after a game has been cracked
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's because fundamentally impossible. you can only slow people down
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's because it's fundamentally impossible. you can only slow people down
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> @heinrich5991 im sure you've never seen a client close to that for ddrace, right?
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Well, cant deny that... but valorant uses client & server-side anticheats
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i cant imagine someone would spend that much time making a cheat client for ddrace lol
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> lol valo client side is very intrusive but seems to be pretty good apparently
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Their concept is pretty solid, but they done a lot of research in that topic
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Well, they're banning hypervisors by default... sadly i cant play üòê
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn I can't imagine someone spending so much time making a anticheat as comprehensive as these that are built by companies with lots of money
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Dont forget Man power & research
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah same lol
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sashpub is probably like, the most involved thing i have seen
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and i doubt it's that complicated though closed-source
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh that's banned word?
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't mention bot clients, thank
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> s
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ok sorry
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that client is just a ripoff of allthehaxx with some small lua scripts on top of it (lua support added by allthehaxx)
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ah yea then probably not
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think public tw bot scheme is that developed
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> private bots may be powerful though, nobody can tell for sure
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> btw you may want to revise this...
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> #8 Don't promote or encourage illegal activities - Includes botting/cheating.
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ...to read as...
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> #8 Don't discuss illegal activities - Includes botting/cheating.
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but maybe that is too strict
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> since people often report botting and that wouldnt work
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> making cheat clients easily searchable is the problem
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anticheat is just a cat and mouse game
08:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> how can a button like this be buggy ?
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/
09:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone tested ddnet with a 64 core threadripper :PepeA:

09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> By not respecting your existing config values but just resetting them to the default again
11:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> lmao
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Hi guys would it be ok with ddnet to make a nft ?
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> NFT?
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok, blockchain stuff. Do what you want, but I won't promote it
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Its pretty much trading cards but digital
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and you want to trade graphics or maps?
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Trade is a strong Word As this wont be worth any money just funny cards
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> I dony think anyone would pay for them
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Just Little graphics of tees
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> I know that if I would like to sell them then i would need all creators of skins to allow me to use their work
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> `Someone who creates an NFT using someone else's work should ensure they have permission from copyright owner. Copyright law provides a ‚Äúbundle of rights‚Äù which are exclusive to the owner of the copyright in a work.`
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Isnt the whole point of NFT's to make digital art unique. So if you claim a NFT of something, you are guaranteed to be the only legal owner of it.
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Unique collectibles will always be worth something
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> But I support the idea of an online teeworlds trading card game. Would be cool
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Isnt the whole point of NFT's to make digital art unique. So if you claim an NFT of something, you are guaranteed to be the only legal owner of it.
15:25 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> tbh i dont get NFTS
15:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Imagine you buy a painting by someone famous. How do you know it is real and not a replica? You don't. NFT's on the other side are digitally signed by the author
15:59 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and how do i know the author is the author?
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You basically dont
16:00 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> So nothing stops me from using the name Leonardo and claming mona.jpg ?
16:00 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> And what happens if two authors claim the same thing?
16:01 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I just dont see how any of this works
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> I dont know how this works in practice :4Shrug: But I can imagine there is some sort of validation, would be stupid otherwise
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> It's probably just a buzz word that everyone trying to jump on atm.
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> But I did see things selling for 60 million dollars ü§î
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah Elon Musk ofcourse sold a NFT video lol
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Easy money
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who would be the verifying authority even?
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Good question
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Maybe its a blockchain ID you get assigned
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Let's Encrypt :monkalaugh:
16:03 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i feel like its the same as signing stuff with gpg
16:04 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but without gpg partys :D
16:04 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i should probably look NFT's up before talking about it
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> I think it could be great for music and movies, since there is so much piracy
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Yeah seems to be blockchain. Apparently NFT standard for Non-Fungible Token
16:06 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> how would it remove piracy
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Yeah seems to be blockchain. Apparently NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token
16:06 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> why would i pay for stuff if there are still free copies
16:07 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yea that far i also am @SPYRES xd
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> You get whitelisted and then verified
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the ethereum chain they are just a special smart contract that can have a single owner. There technically is nothing stopping you from making an nft on your own
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Most nft are made by companies known before
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there is any regulation it's on the marketplace level
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> There is nothing stopping you from doing your own looking the same
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> But it will not be in the same batch
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Just like fake pokemon cards
16:09 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> still would watch fake movies
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing stopping you from making an nft out of someone elses art either
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> whats nft have to do with trading cards
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> cant u just call it trading cards
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the legal system is there but is the artist really going to pay for a lawyer to sue something with no precedent?
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Eh I rather pay for something tangible. Has more sentimental value. Dont want to be like that man who locked himself out of his 200 million dollar worth of bitcoin.
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> If you buy some fake shit you are at fault not the marketplace
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> I dont see value in it either
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> But i doubled my money put into it in 2 days haha
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no intrinsic value in it just as with any art really
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly enjoy the trading before it all blows up :P
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> It will just go up
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> As massive companies are getting into it
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> MLB and topps are starting On the 20th
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> investing in what?
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> In june funko pops are starting an nft
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might, but as I said, no intrinsic value in it, so it only has value as long as people have a demand for it
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like bitcoin, it goes up when its popular, it goes down when its not
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Aha so you think bitcoin is popular right now hahaha
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Has never been this popular
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, it's extremely unpopular and everyone hates it. That's why there is insane demand for it....
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Bitcoin is up because of the stockmarket crisis in march 2020
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Showing the flaws in the stockmarket. Thus making bitcoin more popular
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not magic
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Most countries started printing money because of it
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Which leads to a price increase
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Bitcoin also lost in march 2020 but it bounced back higher just like gold did
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Ok lets move to nft again because we moved to bitcoin for No reason
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Paper money also has no value intrinsically. The entire economic system is one huge house of cards just waiting to collapse :P
16:17 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yea sure but NFT's are not directly comparable with currency are they?
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> paper money has value as long as the government producing them stays stable
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> They are digital assets so they are comparable
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> But theres a marketcap for cryptos
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well nfts are pretty close to real art, the only guarantee you have that an nft is the real deal is the marketplace where you got it
16:19 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and those marketplaces are some central authorities then?
16:19 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so its a normal marketplace with a blockchain as database
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Close, paper money has value as long as people are willing to trade for it. Russia is a fairly strong and stable government but when eu started to boycott them the ruble went down all the same
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> chillerdragon: blockchain is what guarantees that only one person can hold the nft at a time, you can trace it back to the original author
16:21 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yea sure a blockchain is nice as a public database so you can see whats going on
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean the marketplace whitelists and verifys sets and then you see the creators name and everything next to your card so they have a fingerprint
16:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i think i slowly get it
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could take the same pic and make an nft out of it but no respectable marketplace would let me trade it, and if I sell it to someone under the table they can check my story about it
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Wax.atomichub.io  is the place i use
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If you find Satoshi Nakamoto, pls give me a ring.
16:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Ama u sell stuff?
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> I bought packs that went up 2x in 2 days
16:23 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh yikes u buy
16:23 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> maybe i should gamble some money too :D
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> But you have to find a buyer first to really profit the 2x right?
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I made like 50‚Ç¨ on dogecoin yesterday :P
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Volatile markets are fun to gamble with (as long as you are only using money you are willing to lose completely)
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Dude I wished I invested in dogecoin, I didnt believe in this meme. But XRP and Etherum blew up aswell
16:25 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Learath2 you shouldnt enter any market with money you cant lose
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> You see the marketplace and how many sell
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, I also extend that rule and never loan money that I cant afford to completely lose either
16:26 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> So I know i can sell them for 2x now but i will wait so more People open packs
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> It's never too late. All the tiktok and Instgram reels say it's going up linearly :justatest:
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Nah im fine, I make good profits with my portfolio as is
16:26 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Ama you would buy my NFT's right?
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> But yeah I elon tweet = 10% increase lol
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Index, dividends focused,..?
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> But yeah 1 elon tweet = 10% increase lol
16:26 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i make some quality teewoods nfts they go stonks i promise
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> No i wouldnt  chillerdragon
16:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> rude
16:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ur loss
16:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> time to sell the Linux Kernel code and claim i am the author
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> @ChillerDragon I'll buy chillerbot.png as NFT
16:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> nice
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still remember the day josh offered bitcoins for fixing teeworlds bugs. Like 3btc each or sth like that
16:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ill tell u when its for sell
16:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> lmao
16:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> who is josh
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, old teeworlds guy
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like back in 0.5.2 iirc
16:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> though bugs i assume
16:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> probably not worth it
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bitcoin was like 10$ or sth back then. Max 20$
16:29 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wow 30$ is nice moni
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> 3000x that is nice money too
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3 years ago I was paying for a server using bitcoin when it was around 10k$ now when I look my past transactions I get a bit sad :D
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> You can make some amazing nft ddnet i think
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> Thats why i would like to make them just for fun
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> And if People trade them later you get a percentage
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Whitelist me for skin x_spec thanks
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wait i dont understand
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> are these unique online "trading" tokens
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> and u buy them if u just think they're cool or whatever
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Lol "get a percentage"
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can use it on my server
17:08 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yea lets make ddnet.tw some nft market place for tw skins
17:08 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> then skin creators can sell them for real moni and ingame they are marked as real skin :D
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> fstd: mind if i publicly talk about possible pstd attack vectors? :D
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> ah ur on quakenet might as well slide in ur dms
17:52 <+fstd> -QuakeNet ChillerDragon fine by me i guess
17:52 <+fstd> -QuakeNet might be a better idea to fix it first though
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> yes
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> u have matrix?
17:53 <+fstd> whoops
17:53 <+fstd> no
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> sad
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> go irc private then
17:53 <+fstd> huh?
17:53 <+fstd> oh
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> ye :D
17:54 <+fstd> thought you said public
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> to not spread rumors pstd is still stable and best 0 vulnerability paste tool everybody should use
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> it is a issue with my deployment
18:36 <+fstd> lmao "0 vulnerability" [x] doubt
18:41 <+Learath2> do we need a pstd CVE? :D
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen what about changing the ger flag on ranks to eur?
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not german ‚òï
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> change to earth flag
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> preparing for interstellar ranks
19:35 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> As there are polish servers too its useless. And with the same argument you could change ger flag it to chinese flag if a chinese person finishes a map on ger servers
19:35 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> They are located in germany so german flags makes sense. If there would be multiple different locations for GER1 und or GER2 a flag even for Hessen (Frankfurt) or Bayern (N√ºrnberg) would make sense
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki yeah, we can consider just using EU flag for NLD/GER/POL finishes at some point.
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ger is like in the center of europe
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china is as big as europe
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
19:41 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> On the other hand you are right, people play on all those servers that are near them (low latency) the dont care for the country flag.
19:41 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> hm Lots of players in europe play on russian server and vice versa
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> imagine being concerned with ping in EU when you like in the northwest US and have friends in western Canada
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like, bruh
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you have like 3-4 different choices depending on where you live, pls lmao
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :(
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> imagine being concerned with ping in EU when you live in the northwest US and have friends in western Canada
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ddnet usa is in texas right?
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> also text selections should be highlighted, seems like an easy task?
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> dallas
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wait if it's an NFO server isn't there technically a ddnet mumble server xd
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hello i want to know if i am wrong or not, the red circle = passive tile and the image mean where is the "160" number
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832349175773265930/unknown.png
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 16x10 = 160 so i guess the 160 tile is here
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> its in the same line as the lower part of the credits
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> but yea
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> its the first tile in the tenth line
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> wait im stupid
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> its in the eleventh line
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ?
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> so the line beneath the credits
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> why 11
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> first tile in the first line = 0
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ho ok
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ten lines deeper => + 10 * 16
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ten lines deeper -> + 10 * 16

22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :CH_KirbyAngry:
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> thx patiga
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> yw :)

23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> definitely like dark dimmed the best üòÑ
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> when add proximity VC :feelsamazingman:
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> OMG
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i want teeworlds among us...
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like normal movement but really big maps
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and fog of war so you cant see all the map
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> @Headshot is this a stupid idea or do you like it xd
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i really need to stop mapping so much and just learn c++ so i can try dumb stuff like htis
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i really need to stop mapping so much and just learn c++ so i can try dumb stuff like this
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> How is your current coding knowledge @lynn?
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> my general CS knowledge is pretty good, i just dont know c++ specifically
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have worked more with python java and javascript
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> one goal of mine is to implement ddnet server in another languages that's easier for newbies to learn and read
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so they understand how the server works better or can contribute easier
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> one goal of mine is to implement ddnet server in another language that's easier for newbies to learn and read
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Well I hope it becomes a reality :)
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have a lot of tw-related ideas/goals, most of which probably wont happen lol
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Yup. Just like all the 1000+ ideas I have lol. We need to extend time!
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes... well just add time to days
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> after work i spend so much time but i feel like 4am just feels like 8pm now lol
