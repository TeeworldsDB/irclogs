13:19 < laxa> deen: thought you never wanted to use C++ features for ddnet ?
13:19 < laxa> I am looking at compilation warnings right now
13:20 < laxa> https://github.com/Laxa/ddnet/commit/c9d70ed81bf952254ca69b82c82de00a5d187844
13:20 < laxa> gamecontext.cpp l943
13:20 < laxa> using new
13:26 <@deen> laxa: so? is that any different than in vanilla TW?
13:26 < laxa> Haven't checked
13:26 <@deen> i did, it's the same :P
13:27 < laxa> but I remember you telling me to never use any C++ feature beside classes
13:27 < laxa> You know which script is generating server_data.cpp ?
13:28 <@deen> nope
13:29 < laxa> src/game/generated/server_data.cpp(510): warning C4838: conversion from 'double' to 'float' requires a narrowing conversion
13:29 < laxa> that's a new warning from VS 2015 compiler
13:29 < laxa> I have C++ projects starting monday for school, so, dealing with those things would be a good exercise for me :)
16:03 < laxa> Well
16:03 < laxa> I dunno what is going on with ddnet/tw build
16:03 < laxa> but why do we have dynamic AND static libraries at the same time ?
16:04 < laxa> and curl.lib and opus.lib are x86 and not present in others
17:02 < laxa> 1 ligne PR to fix some VS 2015 warnings : https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/383
17:08 < laxa> No more github hook on the channel ?
