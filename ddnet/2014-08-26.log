00:01 <@deen> laxa: it mutes players' messages
00:01 <@deen> good, _KinG 
00:04 < laxa> deen: well, I am asking cause EryX is back, and I can see his messages.
00:05 <@deen> laxa: mute him again!
00:05 <@deen> when he reconnects he's unmuted of course
00:05 < laxa> ...
00:06 < laxa> Does the mute remove whisps too ?
00:07 <@deen> prooooobably not
00:09 < laxa> deen: ok mute blocks whisp. But there are no messages for the sender to say he is blocked, dunno if it's intended.
00:09 <@deen> the block is client side
00:09 <@deen> server still sends you all messages
00:10 <@deen> your client just discards them
00:10 <@deen> it's best if the other doesn't know
00:10 < laxa> hum yeah, that would be a pain in the ass to implement it then
00:10 <@deen> otherwise he can just reconnect
00:10 < laxa> can I ask you a permanent mute feature ? xD
00:10 <@deen> but you could write "ERYX OMG I BLOCK YOU!!!!"
00:10 <@deen> eh, mute*
00:11 <@deen> don't want a permanent mute
00:11 < laxa> Hum
00:11 < laxa> That's bad...
00:12 < Savander> permament mute is useless
00:12 < Savander> you can change nickname
00:12 < Savander> or ip
00:12 < laxa> Client doesn't have the IP anyway.
00:12 < Savander> always send ip
00:13 < laxa> so, if I want permanent mute, I have to code it myslef, merge with ddnet on my own fork and merge all your commits ? :D
00:14 <@deen> or just don't mute people
00:17 < laxa> Well I guess I can live without it.
00:17 <@deen> good
00:17 < laxa> But I could argue that every game has this kind of feature xQD.
00:18 <@deen> I don't know
00:18 <@deen> don't play any games except this
00:18 <@deen> there is always the alternative
00:19 <@deen> to only allow messages from friends
00:19 <@deen> or to use /dnd
00:19 < laxa> dnd is quite brutal solution
00:19 < laxa> can you allow only message from friend ? But I won't use this anyway.
00:19 < laxa> I'll just ignore the guys.
00:19 <@deen> laxa: yes, it's in the client settings somewhere
00:20 <@deen> Settings -> General -> Show only chat messages from friends
00:20 < laxa> Hum yeah.
00:20 < laxa> Hard to make friends with this xD.
00:20 <@deen> haha
00:20 <@deen> yeah, i never use these things either
00:20 <@deen> i just disable sound for messages
00:20 <@deen> only highlighted messages i hear
00:21 <@deen> so i don't care about all the other chat
00:21 < laxa> Who asked you this feature oO ?
00:21 <@deen> that feature was in ddrace before ddnet
00:21 <@deen> or which?
00:21 <@deen> the sound one?
00:21 < laxa> No.
00:21 <@deen> the sound one was my own creation, also before ddnet
00:21 < laxa> The only friend messages.
00:21 <@deen> that's ddrace
00:21 < laxa> Well, as I recall, there was no option to enable it before.
00:21 < laxa> Just a console command I guess.
00:22 <@deen> nope, was always tehre
00:22 < laxa> Wtf xD.
00:22 <@deen> maybe it's even default vanilla
00:22 < laxa> Hum, I have a new idea !
00:22 < laxa> Wanna hear it xD ?
00:22 <@deen> nooo, not another one!
00:22 < laxa> xD.
00:22 <@deen> yes, it's in vanilla
00:22 < laxa> For people that uses multiple client.
00:22 <@deen> delete other clients!
00:22 < laxa> When you use another client, you loose all specifics configuration about ddnet.
00:22 <@deen> use ddnet client only
00:23 <@deen> laxa: yeah, evil clients delete ddnet stuff, grrr
00:23 < laxa> So my idea is : make a config file just for ddnet, so you don't loose anything.
00:23 <@deen> you don't lose all settings
00:23 <@deen> just some and i'm not sure why
00:23 <@deen> but someone should look into it, bug report^^
00:23 < laxa> I had to check what was the client which had my weapon switch thing the other day...
00:23 < laxa> Lost configs :'(.
00:23 <@deen> even vanilla client deletes some config stuff of ddnet
00:23 < Savander> deen: 
00:23 < Savander> sushi client has
00:23 <@deen> Salamander
00:23 < Savander> multiple configs
00:23 < laxa> Well you can't do shit on ddnet client about this, except making another config file for this.
00:23 < Savander> oh fuck off xD
00:39 < KinG1_> hi deen 
00:39 < KinG1_> deen: where should i extract the maps?
00:39 < KinG1_> and how should i add the votes?
00:40 <@deen> in your maps directory
00:40 <@deen> and exec votes.cfg in your config
00:40 < KinG1_> how exactly?
00:40 < KinG1_> i'm noob at tee sry :P
00:40 < laxa> %APPDATA%\Local\Roaming\Teeworlds\Maps
00:40 < laxa> If I am not mistaken
00:40 < laxa> Open that patch in a cmd
00:41 < laxa> if you don't know to open a cmd
00:41 < laxa> do Windows button + R
00:41 < laxa> Type in : cmd
00:41 < laxa> press enter
00:41 < KinG1_> i know it dude
00:41 < laxa> copy the path
00:41 < KinG1_> or
00:41 < KinG1_> i can just shift+rightclick in dir
00:41 < laxa> Yup :).
00:41 < KinG1_> well next
00:42 < KinG1_> where is votes.cfg?
00:42 < KinG1_> hello?!!
00:42 < laxa> G:\Users\laxa.neath\AppData\Roaming\Teeworlds\maps
00:42 < laxa> maps there
00:43 < laxa> and add the votes in this file : G:\Users\laxa.neath\AppData\Roaming\Teeworlds\autoexec.cfg
00:43 < KinG1_> how should i add them?
00:43 < laxa> or add this line into autoexec.cfg : exec votes.cfg
00:43 < laxa> and put votes.cfg in the same directory
00:43 < KinG1_> where is votes.cfg?
00:43 < laxa> download it from github
00:44 < KinG1_> link :)
00:44 < laxa> deen already gave you the link ffs...
00:44 < laxa> In the repo with all the maps, there is a votes.cfg.
00:44 < laxa> Download it.
00:44 < laxa> Or you should even have it in the .zip he gave you.
00:44 < KinG1_> i downlaoded master.rar
00:44 < KinG1_> all maps there
00:44 < laxa> No votes.cfg ?
00:44 < KinG1_> wait
00:45 < laxa> Anyway, if I understood correctly, you'll have your vps with DDnet in 2 days, can't you wait oO ?
00:45 < KinG1_> actually tommorrow night
00:45 < KinG1_> but
00:46 < KinG1_> for tonight
00:46 < KinG1_> :)
00:46 < laxa> Roflmao.
00:46 < KinG1_> and i want to learn it
00:46 < KinG1_> just
00:46 < laxa> I think deen takes time to set up servers, not sure it will be tomorrow xD.
00:46 < KinG1_> deen?
00:46 < KinG1_> what you do that take time?xD
00:47 <@deen> Come watch Snake, KinG1_ 
00:47 < bor> deen: should i give the clean vps to you to set up ddnet , or should i first set up everything else than give you the vps ?
00:47 <@deen> search for deen in teeworlds
00:47 < KinG1_> ddnet.tw?
00:47 <@deen> ingame
01:03 < laxa> Well, folks, already late on my schedule to go to sleep.
01:03 < laxa> So have fun and good night.
01:05 < laxa> deen: maybe broadcast about the steam poll on the forum !

11:06 < Savander> i know
11:06 < Savander> but didn't saw
11:06 < Savander> the option
11:07 < laxa_work> Best way is to reinstall, you just lost 30 minutes or less.
11:07 < laxa_work> Personnaly, at online.net, installation of my server took me only 2 minutes :).
11:07 < Savander> i know
11:07 < Savander> but now
11:07 < Savander> i need to instal it myself
11:08 < Savander> always it was pre installed
11:08 < Savander> :o
11:26 <@deen> Good morning
11:27 < laxa_work> deen: Way to go, 11:30 to wake up omg !
11:28 <@deen> at least I added a new feature at 4 am
11:28 < laxa_work> Nice which one ?
11:28 <@deen> "Record server name into sql table record_race"
11:28 < laxa_work> You changed 2 lines of code xD.
11:28 < laxa_work> Why is that usefull anyway ?
11:28 <@deen> so I can soon show on which server someone plays
11:29 < laxa_work> Oh nice !
11:29 <@deen> and I can compare which server is how active
11:29 < laxa_work> More information on website, I love it.
11:29 <@deen> yeah
11:29 < Savander> yeaaa
11:29 < Savander> im pro
11:29 < Savander> xD
11:29 <@deen> Savander: debian installed?
11:29 < Savander> ye

11:30 < Savander> ye, im pro :P :D
11:31 < _KinG> hi deen hi all
11:31 <@deen> good morning _KinG 
11:31 < laxa_work> Hello.
11:31 < _KinG> good morning to you too deen 
11:31 < Savander> Hi :0
11:32 <@deen> Soon Kobra 2 will have 10000 finishes!
11:32 < laxa_work> Wuts !
11:32 < _KinG> deen: i slept 3 hour and they waked me up bye calling me 10 times i don't KNOW WHY and now i can't sleep :((
11:32 <@deen> _KinG: haha
11:32 <@deen> _KinG: had fun on chilean block server?
11:33 < _KinG> deen: with 500ping i actuaklly did nothing but i could block all of them up there without antiping just feeling the moment xD
11:33 < _KinG> actually*
11:33 < _KinG> but at all my block in royal is so much better than my ddrace
11:35 < _KinG> deen: we paid for the serer and i don't know why they think that we didn't and they waited for today to check the account payment in iran really sucks :(
11:35 <@deen> _KinG: when i bought a server in iran
11:35 <@deen> they said it would take less than 24 hours
11:35 <@deen> and i waited 3 days and asked why nothing was happening
11:36 <@deen> but it was currently Iranian newyear, which I didn't know^^
11:36 < _KinG> we paid 3.50 dollars more to get sure that server gets online by tonight
11:36 < Savander> fuck yea
11:36 < Savander> all works
11:36 < Savander> ;]
11:37 < _KinG> to be sure omg not sleeping is just doing it's job on me
11:37 <@deen> _KinG: =/
11:38 < _KinG> deen: vps got some problems so they called me but ican't even think about what's goin on finally i found that the pagefile size is too much
12:01 < Savander> deen: 
12:01 < Savander> can you join to me for a second?
12:01 < Savander> i'll test smth
12:03 < Savander> CookieMichal:  :P
12:04 <@deen> Savander: was afk
12:06 < Savander> thanks ;]
12:50 < EastByte> deen: I got an idea and I like it
12:58 < tw_> hi
12:58 < tw_> xD
12:58 < EastByte> hi
12:58 < tw_> .
13:02 < Savander> meh
13:04 < EastByte> static.62-113-205-186.customers.filemedia.net
13:04 < Savander> :D
13:04 < Savander> ye
13:04 < Savander> :D
13:04 < EastByte> so where is it located?
13:05 < Savander> frankfurt
13:05 < Savander> join to me
13:05 < Savander> on teeworlds
13:05 < Savander> can you for a second?:D
13:06 < Savander> XD
13:07 < Savander> no no, i just testing
13:07 < Savander> and i didn't saw your ping
13:07 < Savander> meh :/
13:22 < EastByte> Savander: I'm back :D
13:22 < EastByte> my ping was at 40
13:25 < EastByte> GeoIP Country Edition: DE, Germany
13:26 <@deen> EastByte: yes?
13:27 < EastByte> I guess you already thought about that, it would benefit the future of ddnet and even hookrace
13:27 <@deen> Never assume I thought about something
13:27 < EastByte> Once we were talking about that everyone can host their own ddnet server with the ability to upload its ranks to the database (you can cheat there of course)
13:27 <@deen> yes
13:27 < EastByte> but what if the servers wouldn't just upload its rank data
13:28 < EastByte> instead it could upload the whole race demo as proof
13:28 < EastByte> then a program could analyse the demo and get the actual race time
13:28 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, i thought about it
13:28 < EastByte> it also could check for invalid physics to prevent cheating
13:28 <@deen> EastByte: but the problem is, demos can be cheated
13:28 <@deen> you just try each part a few times and cut the demo together
13:28 < EastByte> that's why you need to analyse it
13:28 <@deen> nothing physically impossibel happens
13:28 < EastByte> hm
13:28 < Savander> east, where you from?
13:28 < EastByte> ger
13:29 < Savander> okay
13:29 <@deen> but it's still cheated, similar to Tool-assisted speedruns in other games
13:29 < EastByte> I think it's still worth it
13:29 < EastByte> it's not easy too produce these cut demos
13:30 <@deen> and so many demos =/
13:30 < EastByte> also players can watch the demos and verify for strange behavior
13:30 < EastByte> what's the matter?
13:30 <@deen> where to store them?
13:30 <@deen> If I had stored ddnet demos it would be a few TB by now
13:30 < EastByte> we can reduce the size of demos
13:30 < EastByte> by removing the map data for example
13:30 <@deen> I meant without map data^^
13:31 <@deen> hmm
13:31 < EastByte> it's tiny :D
13:31 <@deen> Yeah, the idea is pretty good
13:31 <@deen> maybe we should do that after all
13:31 < EastByte> and I would like to work on a demo analyser :D
13:32 <@deen> I really have to get working on Hookrace!!!
13:32 < Savander> not really
13:32 < Savander> xD
13:33 <@deen> Savander: why not?
13:33 < Savander> just joking
13:33 < EastByte> just don't listen to laxa and you've got enough time :P
13:33 <@deen> EastByte: yes, i know
13:33 < Savander> I have a bug! i have a bug! ~~ laxa
13:35 < Savander> ;d
13:40 < EastByte> hm from april to know I got about 1000 demos and 1gb data
13:40 < EastByte> without map data it would be about 300mb
13:40 < EastByte> also we can remove old and verified demos
13:49 < Savander> from aprilo i got 2700 demos
13:50 < Savander> 3 gb data
13:50 < Savander> lol
13:50 < Savander> i format was in april
13:52 < EastByte> okay you are racing a bit more
13:53 < Savander> i didn't play 2 months 
13:54 < Savander> I don't know when i did that demos
13:54 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/players/Alucard/
13:54 <@deen> Favorite Server
13:55 < CookieMichal> Hai ho
13:55 <@deen> hi CookieMichal 
13:55 < CookieMichal> I don't have favorite server :c
13:56 < EastByte> pff just store all the ddnet demos at home :D
13:56 < Savander> me too
13:56 < Savander> :(
13:56 <@deen> Savander: only counts when you make a new rank^^
13:56 < Savander> ah..
13:56 < Savander> xd
13:56 <@deen> didn't record server so far
13:57 < Savander> i go to the chile server
13:57 <@deen> ^^
13:57 < Savander> on solo server
13:57 < Savander> xD
13:57 <@deen> but you need to make a new record
13:57 <@deen> better than your last time
13:57 < EastByte> does ddnet have rocketfly only maps?
13:57 <@deen> EastByte: yes
13:57 < EastByte> which one D:
13:57 <@deen> Just Rocketfly?
13:57 < EastByte> oh
13:57 <@deen> 1 + 2
13:57 <@deen> i would just do /map rocketflx
13:58 <@deen> y*
13:58 < EastByte> too obvious couldn't find it
13:58 < Savander> ah
13:58 < Savander> fuck :P :D
13:59 <@deen> But I think it works, someone on RUS server: http://ddnet.tw/players/Abasall/
14:00 <@deen> South Africa: http://ddnet.tw/players/Senseless/
14:00 <@deen> Not sure where else I should put the flag =/
14:00 < Savander> eh!!
14:00 < Savander> :(
14:00 < Savander> not fair
14:00 < Savander> i finish hotrun
14:00 < Savander> on chile server
14:00 < Savander> ( i don't have rank before)
14:01 < Savander> and still no favourite server! :P :D
14:01 < CookieMichal> My frist map was GlassBox 2 ;-;
14:02 < CookieMichal> If I finished For Idiots 1, eight times does it mean something?
14:02 < EastByte> you're an idiot
14:02 <@deen> CookieMichal: yeah, you love playing with noobs
14:02 < CookieMichal> I mostly play with Alex ;-;
14:02 <@deen> Better don't look how often i finished novice or solo maps haha
14:02 < EastByte> ^ :D
14:02 < EastByte> you are too busy to play pro maps
14:03 <@deen> I remember when I was on ddnet all day
14:03 <@deen> just playing novice maps with noobs
14:03 <@deen> so they stay on the server and learn the game
14:03 < Savander> solo map
14:03 < CookieMichal> DEEEEEEEEN
14:03 < Savander> Joyride -> 49 finishes
14:03 < Savander> nice
14:03 < Savander> :P :D
14:03 <@deen> I killed before finish line mostly
14:03 <@deen> would've been a few hundred finishes^^
14:03 < CookieMichal> deen: For Idiots 1 - 19 times
14:03 < CookieMichal> xD
14:04 < Savander> CookieMichal: , mozesz do mnie przyjsc na chwileD:
14:04 < Savander> ??D:
14:04 < Savander> na teeworlds
14:04 <@deen> At least I got a nice video out of Joyride: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LggaeXL66eA
14:04 < CookieMichal> Savander 20 min
14:04 < Savander> ok
14:10 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/players/Savander/
14:10 <@deen> Happy?
14:13 <@deen> yay
14:13 <@deen> I'm speeding up /points
14:14 <@deen> and top5points
14:14 < EastByte> whaat?
14:14 <@deen> they are soooo slow
14:14 <@deen> i will just store them in a table
14:14 <@deen> and not recalculate every time^^
14:14 <@deen> it's pretty stupid to traverse your entire database every time^^
14:14 < EastByte> lol
14:14 < EastByte> bitcoin style
14:15 <@deen> well, it was reasonably fast when we just had 1000 players
14:15 <@deen> but now it's 20000
14:15 < EastByte> xd
14:15 <@deen> and i always planned to make it faster once it's needed
14:15 < EastByte> it's a single sql query right?
14:15 <@deen> yes, a huuuuuge one
14:15 < EastByte> ughh
14:15 <@deen> oh , wait, it's not that bad
14:16 <@deen> select Rank, Name, Points from (select (@pos := @pos+1) pos, (@rank := IF(@prev = Points,@rank,@pos)) Rank, (@prev := Points) Points, Name from (select Name, sum(Points) as Points from (select distinct Map, Name from %s_race) as l left join %s_maps on l.Map = %s_maps.Map group by Name order by sum(Points) desc) as l2) as l3 where Name = '%s';
14:16 < EastByte> ehem
14:16 <@deen> Hahaha
14:16 < Savander> thans deen :p ;D
14:17 < CookieMichal> I don't like SQL :D
14:17 < CookieMichal> I would store everything in JSON format xD
14:18 < EastByte> in files?
14:19 < CookieMichal> ye
14:19 < EastByte> hm good luck
14:20 < EastByte> depends on how you store the data or how you access it
14:20 < EastByte> meh just rocketfly1 is tooo hard
14:21 < EastByte> I don't even need to use /save since I don't pass the second part
14:21 < CookieMichal> It would be cool if it would be possible to save and if I fail load again
14:21 <@deen> CookieMichal: cheater!
14:21 < EastByte> actually no
14:21 < CookieMichal> :P
14:21 < CookieMichal> I've haxed Teeworlds Code :D
14:22 < CookieMichal> I can play .mp3 :D
14:22 < EastByte> we all haxed on it atleast once
14:22 < CookieMichal> Nah
14:22 < CookieMichal> U don't play mp3
14:22 < EastByte> meh
14:22 < EastByte> I don't want to actually
14:22 < CookieMichal> I want :>
14:23 < CookieMichal> Now tell me what to type to download file from web and store it in memory ^^
14:23 < CookieMichal> without saving :D
14:23 < CookieMichal> Just kidding, I will google :)
14:23 < EastByte> you just take the bits and store it in the memory :D

14:28 < CookieMichal> I am too lazy to install printer drivers so I use phone to print stuff xd
14:28 < CookieMichal> #Lazy
14:31 < Savander> co?
14:32 < Savander> ProTeeGy 
14:33 < Savander> a co?
14:34 < CookieMichal> a nic :D
14:35 < Savander> mam ten serwer w filemedia
14:35 < CookieMichal> https://www.sendspace.com/file/kvgzkm take it :D
14:35 < Savander> wpisz ddforce w przegladarke
14:35 < Savander> i powiedz mi jaki masz ping
14:35 < Savander> ok?:D
14:35 < Savander> znaczy wejdz na serwer
14:35 < CookieMichal> ok ;p
14:40 < laxa_work> deen: wtf is that idea about demo stuff you wanna check from other servers to use their rank into your database...
14:40 < laxa_work> Well, I won't say it's stupid, but I don't like it
14:40 < laxa_work> if EastByte really wanna make a demo analyser
14:41 < laxa_work> Then, just make a upload demo feature !
14:41 <@deen> laxa_work: for hookrace only
14:41 < CookieMichal> deen: what's the chat cmd to see server's version?
14:42 <@deen>  /info
14:42 < laxa_work> No one plays hookrace wtf
14:42 < EastByte> laxa_work: remember that something like this is the only why to let people host their own ddnet servers
14:42 < EastByte> way*
14:42 < EastByte> with official ranks
14:42 < CookieMichal> check DDForce servers D:
14:42 < CookieMichal> it seems that they are fake version of ddnet D:
14:42 < laxa_work> EastByte: deen just said it's for hookrace, not ddnet.
14:42 < EastByte> I'm just talking about the idea
14:43 < Savander> fuck you
14:43 < EastByte> would be too much work in the tw branch anyway
14:43 < Savander> not
14:43 < CookieMichal> hookrace is in beta? :D Or something I may test? :D
14:43 < CookieMichal> I just want it! :I
14:44 < EastByte> deen is already able to draw vector graphics :D
14:44 <@deen> hookrace is mostly an idea and a fe files so far
14:44 <@deen> nothing that really works
14:45 < laxa_work> wtf is the mod with really strong hammer then ?
14:45 < laxa_work> isn't it hookrace ?
14:45 < EastByte> isn't it hammerparty?
14:45 < laxa_work> no
14:46 < laxa_work> I am talking about 2 players mod where you need to choose a partner
14:46 < laxa_work> it's kind of like ddrace
14:46 < laxa_work> without freeze
14:46 < laxa_work> and really strong hammer
14:46 < Savander> HP Race?
14:46 < EastByte> well it's a teeworlds mod
14:46 < laxa_work> HP race yeah
14:46 < laxa_work> HP stands for ?
14:46 < EastByte> hammerparty
14:46 < EastByte> I think
14:46 < EastByte> heinrich needed to recode it for 0.6
14:47 < Savander> but
14:47 < Savander> One server is with this mod
14:47 < Savander> duZi
14:47 < Savander> with hp race maps
14:48 < laxa_work> So, tell me more about this hookrace mod
14:48 < Savander> it's not mod :D
14:48 < Savander> it's a another game
14:48 < EastByte> it might be the new or first game of deen 
14:49 < laxa_work> Lulz...
14:49 < laxa_work> Code it well then, cause teeworlds code sucks !
14:49 < EastByte> take a look at nimrod ;)
14:49 <@deen> laxa_work: http://hookrace.net
14:53 < laxa_work> Well then
14:53 < laxa_work> Distribute it to steqm
14:53 < laxa_work> steam
14:54 < laxa_work> Become rich
14:54 < laxa_work> enjoy your life
14:54 < laxa_work> buy a yacht
14:54 < laxa_work> invite us on a cruise
14:54 < laxa_work> !
14:54 <@deen> you all with your weird ideas
14:54 <@deen> like the guys in the steam poll
14:54 <@deen> thinking about 100000000 players
14:54 <@deen> as if that would happen :P
14:55 < EastByte> and as a developer you only enjoy the first months of coding :D
14:55 < Savander> xD
14:57 < laxa_work> deen: hypothetically, if teeworlds 0.7 goes out, you won't adapt ddnet to it ?
14:57 <@deen> laxa_work: i don't know
14:57 < laxa_work> if so, I guess ddrace/ddnet is going to die
14:57 <@deen> i had a 50% working server that kind of worked with 0.6 and 0.7 clients at the same time
14:58 < laxa_work> I don't see anyone who would be capable of adapting ddrace gametype to 0.
14:58 < laxa_work> 7
14:58 <@deen> and i had promises that 0.7 would come out a year ago
14:58 < laxa_work> make hookrace in C#
14:58 < laxa_work> I'll help you then
14:58 < laxa_work> xD
14:58 < EastByte> in this current state tehre actually is no reason to progress on 0.7
14:58 < EastByte> teeworlds is finished
14:59 < laxa_work> EastByte: Wtf ?
14:59 < laxa_work> 0.7 will come out some day
14:59 < laxa_work> Does someone has the link of the repo of matricks of the 0.7 ?
14:59 < EastByte> but their won't be any new features
15:00 < laxa_work> I know that, but code will be 100% object, much cleaner
15:00 < EastByte> laxa_work: do you mean matricks experiments?
15:00 < laxa_work> Hu, dunno !
15:00 < EastByte> bluesky (the name of his resource thingie I think)
15:00 < laxa_work> Allrighty !
15:01 <@deen> China 19 players!
15:01 < laxa_work> Well, I remembered that bluesky name
15:01 < laxa_work> but can't find the repo of it.
15:02 < Savander> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/tree/bluesky
15:02 < laxa_work> isn't it private or something ?
15:02 < laxa_work> my bad...
15:02 <@deen> last update 2011
15:02 <@deen> nice
15:02 < EastByte> well it was an experiment
15:03 < EastByte> matricks is not even interested in hobby coding anymore xd
15:03 < EastByte> he is flying
15:03 < Savander> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds
15:03 <@deen> yeah, i stopped reading teeworlds channel when there was more discussion about flying than teeworlds
15:03 < EastByte> ^
15:03 < laxa_work> xD
15:04 < laxa_work> I am on it, but never read anything on it, or don't remember doing so
15:04 < laxa_work> just remember that I was once ban-life from teeworlds-dev xD
15:04 < EastByte> there is not much talk
15:04 < laxa_work> For asking people to join a chan to have Q
15:04 < CookieMichal> Hey! :D
15:04 < laxa_work> Well then, where is 0.7 repo ?
15:05 < EastByte> on /teeworlds
15:05 < Savander> teeworlds 0.6.2 is last version  i guess :p
15:05 < EastByte> the master branch
15:05 <@deen> laxa_work: http://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
15:05 < Savander> 0.7 will never release
15:05 < CookieMichal> Join and test my zCatch server :))
15:05 < EastByte> is it grenade?
15:05 <@deen> is it 64 player?
15:05 < EastByte> both?
15:07 < laxa_work> Soooooo, teeworlds dev is really dead atm ?
15:08 < laxa_work> Thanks god we still have people developping for 0.7
15:08 < laxa_work> major change coming up :
15:08 < laxa_work> Commits on Aug 05, 2014
15:08 < laxa_work> BeaR
15:08 < laxa_work> Rename 'coala' to 'koala'
15:08 < Savander> hahahhaa
15:08 <@deen> I don't think BeaR knows he's a ddnet mod^^
15:08 <@deen> someone should tell him
15:09 < laxa_work> I think he went to australia
15:09 < laxa_work> that's why he made that pull request
15:09 < laxa_work> obviously, I don't see another possibility
15:17 < EastByte> deen: I won twice :)
15:17 < EastByte> with laggs
15:17 < EastByte> I'm good
15:17 <@deen> EastByte: nice
15:22 < CookieMichal> What was the command to see list of players on server?
15:22 < CookieMichal> rcon command *
15:22 < EastByte> status
15:22 < CookieMichal> Thanks
15:24 < laxa_work> What's irssi command to show users in current channel ?
15:25 <@deen>  /names
15:31 < EastByte> oh it's the same on weechat
15:34 < EastByte> 15:36:35      @matricks | I dunno why so many people like instagib
15:34 < EastByte> hehe
15:35 < EastByte> 15:36:53         @minus | because it's easy
15:35 < EastByte> 15:36:58       Dunedune | it's more acessible
15:35 < EastByte> 15:37:24      @matricks | *mumble* *mumble* YOU DARN KIDS, GET OFF MY LAWN!
15:36 <@deen> instagib is fast, i like fast
15:36 < EastByte> with grenade it's even more fast, and I like more fast :)
15:36 < CookieMichal> When I use nice command -20 is the most iportant process?
15:36 <@deen> yes
15:37 < CookieMichal> oki
15:37 < CookieMichal> thanks
15:37 <@deen> fast kills i mean
15:37 < EastByte> k
15:37 <@deen> you see someone and 50 ms later he is dead
15:37 < EastByte> I don't like that because everything is dependent on ping and timing
15:38 < EastByte> wow the backround of map 'Nasa' is truly awesome
15:51 < laxa_work> deen: nice thanks, you use irssi too I guess ?
15:51 <@deen> yeah
15:51 < laxa_work> Well, I am running putty on my laptop at work, so laxa_work will be there 24/7
15:51 < laxa_work> putty to my ddracepro server !
15:52 < laxa_work> Well, gotta make a release before going back home, let's get to work, shall we ? :D
16:05 < EastByte> deen: when will 4.8.3 be online?
16:05 <@deen> EastByte: never?^^
16:05 <@deen> EastByte: i just make a version update so i can see which servers restarted already, haha
16:05 < EastByte> ah okay
16:08 < laxa_work> This deen...
16:08 < laxa_work> A big kid xD.
16:09 < laxa_work> deen: join #laxa, go on ddracepro.net finis a random solo map on watch
16:09 < laxa_work> tell me what you think about that !
16:10 < laxa_work> fuck me : join #laxa, go on ddracepro.net solo server, finish a random very short map (you have to beat your best time if you have one) then watch the chan !
16:10 < EastByte> I don't think he is going to fuck you
16:10 < EastByte> but nice html/css skills on your page <3
16:10 <@deen> i'll just wait until someone else finishes
16:11 <@deen> EastByte: better than the initial ddnet.tw design^^
16:11 < EastByte> ah
16:15 <@deen> laxa_work: but is it the same as on ddmax?
16:21 < laxa_work> deen: yeah, noother gave me the plugin for his bot.
16:21 < laxa_work> I changed it for the solo finisher since ddmax had never any solo server
16:21 < laxa_work> but you could use a bot to announce new releases
16:22 <@deen> on IRC?
16:22 < laxa_work> Yes.
16:22 < EastByte> everyone would be notified :D
16:22 <@deen> for the 3 people who are here
16:22 < laxa_work> I love noother's bot xD.
16:22 < laxa_work> I am always following finishes on my own server.
16:23 < laxa_work> https://github.com/noother/Nimda3
16:23 < EastByte> would be a different thing if the ddnet client interacts with irc
16:24 < EastByte> ^ same second
16:24 < Chicken_> ^-^
16:24 < laxa_work> I dont have seconds on irssi
16:24 < laxa_work> Well, unsigned char client's has a IRC client inside it
16:26 < EastByte> I woudn't prefer a full irc implementation
16:26 < EastByte> more like for notification things only
16:26 < EastByte> or a simple global ddnet chat
16:27 <@deen> I can already imagine the global chat
16:27 < EastByte> the chat could be rendered half transparent ingame
16:27 <@deen> 300 people spamming stuff
16:28 < laxa_work> http://hclient.wordpress.com/
16:28 < laxa_work> deen: maybe you could take some features from it, though not sure it is open source...
16:28 <@deen> sure it's open source
16:29 <@deen> i fixed +showhookcoll and gave it back to h-client
16:29 < EastByte> hehe
16:29 < laxa_work> deen: it's not completely fixed hehe :D !
16:29 <@deen> what?
16:30 < EastByte> it can't be perfect
16:30 < laxa_work> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/19
16:30 < EastByte> because the server doesn't send your 100% accurate position
16:31 <@deen> EastByte: for yourself it is accurate
16:31 <@deen> EastByte: because it uses your own position, not what the server sends
16:31 <@deen> for others it's off a bit, yeah
16:31 < EastByte> sure?
16:32 < EastByte> how can the server use the position from the client?
16:32 < laxa_work> well, yesterday's bug I found, it wasnt just off by a bit, but by all distances...
16:32 <@deen> EastByte: yes, sure
16:32 <@deen> laxa_work: aaah, that
16:32 < EastByte> iirc the position was int(float/256)
16:32 <@deen> EastByte: float*256?
16:32 < EastByte> ah yes xd
16:32 <@deen> but anyway, the server only says "show hookline"
16:32 <@deen> and the client does the rendering
16:33 <@deen> and the client decides to which position to render it
16:33 < EastByte> afk
16:35 <@deen> – AutoUpdate works again (thx to DDRaceNetwork community for improve it)
16:35 <@deen> nice^^
16:35 <@deen> There also is another mod bases on ddnet
16:35 <@deen> ddrace+64 i think
16:38 <@deen> http://www.cysddrace.de.vu/
16:38 < laxa_work> deen: think it comes from eeeee no ?
16:38 <@deen> laxa_work: nono
16:38 < laxa_work> autoupdate from h-client ?
16:38 <@deen> autoupdate was from h-client but it didn't work
16:38 <@deen> i guess it was never finished
16:39 <@deen> 64 player client by eeeee also didn't work
16:39 < laxa_work> the thing you link is from h-client's blog right ?
16:39 <@deen> no
16:40 < laxa_work> Where does it come from then ?
16:41 <@deen> don't understand your question
16:41 < laxa_work>  - AutoUpdate works again (thx to DDRaceNetwork community for
16:41 < laxa_work>               improve it)
16:41 < laxa_work> Where you read that ?
16:41 <@deen> yes, from h-client
16:42 <@deen> laxa_work: nice of you to advertise your own server on ddnet forum and telling mappers to release their maps there instead
16:42 < laxa_work> Well, host a race server then
16:42 < laxa_work> but short maps with rocket deserve to be on race
16:42 <@deen> ddnet solo has many race maps
16:42 < laxa_work> hotrun
16:43 < laxa_work> I don't know why you host such maps
16:43 < laxa_work> you'll never have the level of competition of race servers obviously
16:44 <@deen> then we should never have hosted ddrace maps either, because we would never have the level of competition of ddracemax servers
16:45 < laxa_work> you are comparing same mods which is different
16:45 < laxa_work> than comparing two different mods
16:46 <@deen> race is a subset of ddrace
16:47 < laxa_work> deen: I edited my post to please you !
16:47 <@deen> there are active race servers?
16:47 < laxa_work> yes, all of them
16:48 < laxa_work> but afaik
16:48 < laxa_work> no more race players xD
16:48 <@deen> haven't seen any
16:48 <@deen> recently with > 100 players
16:48 <@deen> or at least a full server
16:48 <@deen> and are there any global race servers?
16:49 <@deen> hi _KinG 
16:49 < _KinG> hi deen  what's up
16:50 < _KinG> deen: when i ask my phone what's up it says the sky :|
16:50 <@deen> ^^
16:52 < laxa_work> deen: you don't know about teerace ?
16:53 < laxa_work> I told you about it, cause it has a feature I would like to see on ddnet !
16:53 < laxa_work> http://race.teesites.net/
16:53 < laxa_work> The project is even hosted in France xD
16:54 <@deen> how do i find teerace servers?
16:54 <@deen> outside of europe
16:54 < _KinG> u can search for utown or sun city
16:58 < laxa_work> what do you mean deen ?
16:58 < laxa_work> http://race.teesites.net/servers/
16:58 <@deen> laxa_work: i asked for a race server network with servers worldwide
16:58 <@deen> and you said teerace
16:58 < laxa_work> Well
16:58 < laxa_work> It was "worldwide"
16:59 < laxa_work> but don't know what happend to USA servers.
16:59 <@deen> I know, they were replaced by ddnet
16:59 < laxa_work> Ah xD.
16:59 <@deen> Broken paid for them and now he stopped
16:59 <@deen> and pays ddnet
16:59 <@deen> > 10 players on every server!
16:59 < laxa_work> 10 players on every server ?
17:00 <@deen> every country*
17:00 <@deen> 10 players on every tw server would be 1200 players
17:00 < laxa_work> You are amazed by all those people playing on your servers
17:00 < laxa_work> and yet you are against ddnet on steam...
17:01 < laxa_work> it would be 12000 players
17:01 <@deen> I'm against it because it's work and I'm not sure it would have any benefit
17:01 <@deen> if someone else wants to do that work for me, sure
17:01 <@deen> ah, and also the money-making thing
17:01 < laxa_work> if I understood it well enough, you have no work to do at all, you don't have to implement their player steam profile at all.
17:02 <@deen> laxa_work: then that would be interesting
17:02 <@deen> just difficult to find any information
17:02 < laxa_work> you can choose wether you want to implement any of their API or not.
17:02 <@deen> and i don't think it would bring any new players
17:07 < laxa_work> I don't know either, but I don't see what bad could happen with it
17:07 < laxa_work> just cost 100 dollars though
17:08 < laxa_work> and I dont know what you were refering to with the "ah, and also the money-making thing"
17:08 <@deen> well, steam is commercial. don't think ddnet should support that
17:09 < _KinG> deen: if u place ddnet on steam u'll get so many players i promise
17:10 <@deen> _KinG: first it's just steam greenlight and it will probably never get to real steam store
17:10 < _KinG> i'm using steam for over 4 years and every one download free games or the cheap ones
17:11 < _KinG> if u'll be able to place it on store u'll get 4x players
17:12 < laxa_work> xD
17:12 < laxa_work> going back home, cya in 1 hour.
17:12 <@deen> bye laxa_work 
17:15 < CookieMichal> Hey! :D I need quick help :P How can I change: "Error! (%d) %s\n", result, errorName(result) to smth like "Error! (10) Init failed\n"? What was the command for that? :D
17:15 <@deen> str_format?
17:16 < CookieMichal> but how to use it? D:
17:16 < CookieMichal> It doesn't work for me :P
17:16 <@deen> look somewhere else where it's used
17:17 < CookieMichal> Found it :) Thanks :)
17:26 <@deen> ddnet.tw:8314 hasn't been empty for a few days. i want to update to new version
17:27 < _KinG> deen: i have some new ideas for ddnet u want to listen?
17:27 < CookieMichal> xD
17:28 <@deen> _KinG: sure
17:28 < CookieMichal> _KinG I want :)
17:29 < _KinG> deen: dude there are many boters these days i wanted to ask u if u can make block servers running abit diffrent like not allowing the users with bot clients to join or just by disabling their bots(i think it's impossiable)
17:29 < _KinG> impossible:|
17:29 <@deen> _KinG: how can you bot in ddrace?
17:29 < CookieMichal> Spinbot xd
17:29 < _KinG> deen: it's possible
17:29 < CookieMichal> and that's all xd
17:29 <@deen> what does the bot do?
17:29 < CookieMichal> You really don't know it?
17:29 <@deen> CookieMichal: not yours
17:29 < _KinG> like when we are falling from a high placa ane some one want to catch u
17:29 <@deen> _KinG: what do iranian botters do?
17:30 <@deen> _KinG: ah, hookbot
17:30 < _KinG> deen: iranians mostly use bots in block liek spam bots hookbot aimbot in fng or some else
17:30 <@deen> i don't think we can do anything against it
17:30 < CookieMichal> Maybe someone is pro and can hook really fast :D
17:30 < _KinG> no
17:30 <@deen> there are also movement bots
17:30 < _KinG> i know the pro ones in iran
17:30 <@deen> so you can fly through everything
17:31 <@deen> without touching freeze
17:31 < _KinG> deen: but i think we can do somthing
17:31 <@deen> write evil words?
17:31 < _KinG> n
17:31 < _KinG> no
17:32 < _KinG> just add a function in block servers that no one can join server until he or she got the ddnet client or original tee worlds client
17:33 < CookieMichal> so noone would play
17:33 < _KinG> so the guys with other clients will be auto kicked
17:33 < CookieMichal> That's mean
17:33 < CookieMichal> It makes server "closed"
17:33 < _KinG> with message disable bots a message from antibot xD
17:33 <@deen> _KinG: they can make their bot client fake ddnet client
17:33 <@deen> it works for a few days or weeks maybe, but then no more
17:33 < _KinG> shit
17:34 < _KinG> so there are no ways?
17:34 <@deen> i don't think there is a way
17:34 <@deen> if there were accounts and it would cost money, then you could ban botters and they lose their money
17:35 < _KinG> why do people even make bots
17:35 <@deen> but we don't want that for ddnet
17:35 < CookieMichal> For fun :D
17:35 <@deen> _KinG: to be better
17:35 < _KinG> deen: is there a way to ban the mac address of their modem not the range the modem mac address?
17:36 < CookieMichal> You can change mac address :)
17:36 <@deen> _KinG: mac adresses can be faked
17:36 < _KinG> but no one in iran kows that xD
17:36 <@deen> haha
17:36 < _KinG> all the boters are new noob players
17:36 <@deen> just kick them?
17:36 < _KinG> pros never use bots
17:36 <@deen> with reason "bot"
17:36 <@deen> or you don't notice that pros bot because they are so good :P
17:37 <@deen> i think in instagib over 50% bot
17:37 < _KinG> 1kicked them 3 times in servers i have but they return and when i ban them they restart modem and again and again
17:37 <@deen> see, that's why i prefer ddrace =)
17:37 <@deen> botting is not so useful in ddrace
17:37 < _KinG> deen: can u come and see the pros in iran?
17:37 <@deen> no
17:38 < _KinG> not the iran the servers i mean ^^
17:38 <@deen> haha
17:38 <@deen> still no
17:38 < CookieMichal> Why? D:
17:38 < CookieMichal> That's mean
17:38 < CookieMichal> xd
17:38 <@deen> busy
17:38 < CookieMichal> Oh :)
17:39 <@deen> Old /points: 0.64 seconds, new /points: 0.03 seconds
17:39 <@deen> looks good
17:39 < _KinG> many people think that i use spin bot but my mousesens is 1000 and mouse_max_distance is 300 and i can't tell them that ^^
17:39 < CookieMichal> Indeed noone cares that much about speed deen :P
17:39 <@deen> CookieMichal: it creates a lot of load on the servers and they lag because of it
17:40 < _KinG> cpu lag?
17:40 < CookieMichal> _KinG: I have 148 (or 160, depends) as mousesens ;-;
17:40 <@deen> _KinG: high memory bandwidth can also cause delays
17:40 < CookieMichal> deen: I think that you are first one who really cares about performance :) I like it ;
17:40 < _KinG> CookieMichal: i get used to 1000 in block but in ddrace i always play with 300 mousesens
17:40 < CookieMichal> :D *
17:41 < _KinG> CookieMichal: do you have free time to play?
17:42 < CookieMichal> _KinG: I will play with my friend in some minutes :P
17:43 < _KinG> CookieMichal: will u be available in 1 or 2 or until  tommorrow? xD
17:43 < CookieMichal> whaaaat? :D
17:44 < _KinG> i was sleeping until now and i'm online until tommorrow 10 am (your time) xD
17:44 < CookieMichal> woah
17:44 < CookieMichal> we can play at 20:00 +0200 UTC
17:44 < _KinG> oh hi Savander 
17:44 < CookieMichal> Savander hax0r
17:44 < Savander> :D
17:44 < Savander> Hi :]
17:45 < _KinG> CookieMichal: do you have team speak?
17:45 < CookieMichal> Nah. I am too lazy to install it XD

17:45 < _KinG> c'mon
17:45 < CookieMichal> eh
17:45 < CookieMichal> ehhhhhhhh
17:45 < _KinG> deen: i always go there and i see it's empty
17:45 <@deen> _KinG: i know^^
17:46 < _KinG> deen: the germany is the only country that gamers don't use ts
17:46 < _KinG> go see the us server list u can't blieve how many people are talking thre
17:46 < _KinG> there*
17:47 < _KinG> CookieMichal: just pm me when u are available i'm gonna play

17:54 < bor> hi
17:54 < Savander> hi
18:20 < laxa> deen: no new client release yet ?
18:20 < laxa> deen: and I have found a new idea to improve ddnet client while coming back home !
18:48 <@deen> laxa: "yet"?
18:48 <@deen> laxa: no release planned
18:48 < laxa> well
18:48 < laxa> repo is at version 4.8.4
18:48 < laxa> I expect a release for all new version xD.
18:48 < laxa> So about my idea
18:48 <@deen> i just increase the versions to see whichserver updated
18:48 < laxa> Here it is
18:49 < laxa> make that favorite tabs saves favorite server by domain name instead of IP !
18:49 < laxa> So no more favorite changement when a host change !
18:49 <@deen> laxa: doesn't work with masterserver unfortunately
18:49 <@deen> it's planned for 0.7
18:49 < laxa> it's client sided
18:50 < laxa> 0.7 will never be released as we said
18:50 <@deen> yes, but masterserver only sends ip to client
18:50 <@deen> not domain
18:50 < laxa> well send you make a dns lookup from client
18:50 < laxa> to get the domain name
18:50 <@deen> no
18:50 <@deen> not going to do that
18:51 < laxa> You say no to all my ideas..
18:51 < laxa> .
18:51 < laxa> Even if they are good !
18:52 <@deen> i can't even get reverse dns working for all my servers
18:52 <@deen> so it wouldn't work on all
18:52 <@deen> and all these dns requests take time
18:53 < Savander> deen: why /spec command works like /pause with sv_pausable 1?
18:53 <@deen> Savander: i switched them
18:53 <@deen> so pause is always what people expect
18:53 <@deen> and spec puts you into spectator mode
18:54 < Savander> but it's cheatable? 
18:54 <@deen> ?
18:54 < Savander> eg. tunnel 1x10
18:54 <@deen> ?
18:54 < Savander> maybe 1x10
18:55 <@deen> what?
18:55 < Savander> 1 height 3 width
18:55 < Savander> when you go spec, someone can go to your position
18:55 <@deen> Sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about
18:55 <@deen> Savander: yes, that's why sv_pauseable is 0 in all maps don't require 1
18:56 < Savander> so it enable on few maps?
18:56 < Savander> its*
18:56 <@deen> yes
18:56 < Savander> weird
18:56 <@deen> what?
18:57 <@deen> 12 maps on ddnet have 1
18:57 < laxa> deen: I am helping people to cheat a map, is that allright ? xD
18:57 <@deen> laxa: no
18:57 <@deen> fix the cheat instead
18:57 < laxa> Well, they took me as a bait
18:57 < laxa> it's not a proper cheat
18:57 < laxa> they just put tee everywhere in the map to pass the part to someone
18:57 < laxa> everyone in team 0
18:57 < laxa> like in Artkis video with Orange 1
18:58 < laxa> Rank 1 done xD
18:59 < laxa> That's bad thing, they are kicking everyone that is not helping them lulz.
19:10 < EastByte> that's the reason why team 0 ranks are pointless
19:14 <@deen> well, team 0 is fun
19:14 <@deen> and cheating team 0 ranks is fun too
19:14 <@deen> but kicking multiple players because they don't help you cheating is not
19:14 <@deen> and they knew because they wrote "deen is so going to ban us all"
19:14 < EastByte> haha xd
19:15 < laxa> deen: xD !
19:49 <@deen> these intelligent blockers are really annoying
19:49 <@deen> joined someone elses team, used /spec to not be visible, locked the team and killed
19:54 < laxa> EryX business !
19:54 < CookieMichal> ranks? D: What are you talking about? D:
19:55 < laxa> deen: you'll be happy to know you are not the only one being ddos, Heroes of the Storm is being ddosed too.
19:56 <@deen> no, that does not make me happy
20:15 < EastByte> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/23
20:15 < EastByte> I noticed that too
20:16 < EastByte> when I added ~32 clients using my bouncer, only about 8 timeout msgs came through
20:16 < EastByte> I thought it was packetloss or something
20:17 < EastByte> but msg packets are flagged as vital I think
20:25 <@deen> EastByte: =/
20:26 < EastByte> is udp packetloss on localhost even possible?
20:28 <@deen> i have 2 other guesses
20:29 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/23
20:37 < EastByte> hmm
20:47 < laxa> deen: ddos ?
20:55 < _KinG> what's this all about deen ?
20:56 < _KinG> shit my internet is kiling me i'll be back deen 
20:59 < laxa> deen: what's imp's nickname on ddnet ?
21:01 <@deen> imp
21:01 < laxa> hum
21:01 < laxa> it's not online :(
21:01 <@deen> laxa: why ddos?
21:01 < laxa> ping went to 150 for all servers for most players (but not all)
21:02 < laxa> maybe a short routing problem, I don't know...
21:02 <@deen> yeah, sometimes happens
21:02 <@deen> doesn't sound like ddos
21:02 < laxa> so question, could I change the start of the new solo map called speedster ?
21:02 < laxa> before the start line
21:02 <@deen> why?
21:02 < laxa> there is only 1 rocket
21:02 < laxa> and when multiple players take it
21:02 < laxa> you don't always get it
21:03 < laxa> it's fucking annoying
21:03 <@deen> wtf?
21:03 < laxa> when come on server and test
21:07 < laxa> deen: done
21:07 < laxa> I mean, uploaded.
21:07 < laxa> moved the start a bit to the left too, to avoid running left :p
21:07 < laxa> tell me when it's done, so I can fucking finish it :)
21:08 <@deen> laxa: done
21:08 < laxa> Thanks a lot man !
21:08 < laxa> Just for the record
21:08 < laxa> "My" feature would be extra cool on this map
21:09 < laxa> you press 4 only once
21:09 < laxa> then you never has to do it again
21:09 < laxa> -has +have
21:09 <@deen> i added "your feature"
21:09 < laxa> Yes I know
21:09 <@deen> i just haven't released client^^
21:09 < laxa> but not released yet
21:09 < laxa> I'll compile my own client
21:09 <@deen> meh, i'll release it
21:09 <@deen> 15 min
21:09 < laxa> you told me better performance if I compile my own client
21:09 < laxa> so I'll do it
21:09 <@deen> i told you that?
21:10 <@deen> can't remember
21:10 < laxa> let me browse my logs xD
21:13 < laxa> [00:42:06] <@deen> laxa: less false virus detections, better performance, smaller size
21:13 <@deen> yeah, with visual studio
21:13 < laxa> [00:41:47] <laxa> What do you think VS will add to your teeworlds binaries for windows oO ?
21:13 < laxa> I have VS 2010
21:13 <@deen> well, i still don't have it
21:13 <@deen> i stopped when i saw that it was multiple GB big
21:13 < laxa> crack it !
21:13 < laxa> xD
21:13 < laxa> It's a real factory that software !
21:14 < EastByte> "What do you think VS will add to your teeworlds binaries for windows" it will add everything microsoft needs for tracing the developer back
21:14 <@deen> EastByte: hm?
21:14 < laxa> EastByte: :).
21:14 < EastByte> adding signatures to the binary is a good way to find malware developers? :D
21:15 < laxa> deen: I can provide you binary made with vs 2010 right now if you want
21:18 < laxa> deen: new bug ! xD
21:18 <@deen> laxa: no, i prefer to build it myself
21:18 < laxa> When you compile your own version of ddnet
21:18 < laxa> it asks you to update
21:18 < laxa> to older version
21:18 < laxa> ...
21:19 <@deen> sure
21:20 < Savander> deen: n
21:20 < Savander> how to make solo server
21:20 < Savander> on ddnet mod?
21:21 < laxa> deen: is it normal behavior or should I make an issue about it ?
21:21 <@deen> laxa: normal behaviour
21:21 < laxa> wtf...
21:21 <@deen> the client doesn't know about what version number means
21:21 <@deen> it just sees that the number is different
21:21 <@deen> if you want, you can make an ordering
21:22 <@deen> but if you compile your own client, you should not use autoupdater anyway
21:24 < Savander> deen: , how to make solo server?
21:24 <@deen> Savander: hm
21:25 < laxa> Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
21:25 < Savander> on ddnet server
21:25 < Savander> im testing smth :P :D
21:25 < laxa> Savander: you have 2 choices to make solo server
21:25 < laxa> either you use the tune on RCON
21:25 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/solo/flexreset.cfg
21:25 < laxa> or you use the entities associated with solo
21:25 <@deen> or you just set sv_team 3
21:26 <@deen> (forced solo teams)
21:26 <@deen> then switches work for every player separately
21:26 < Savander> a
21:26 < Savander> ok, thanks :)
21:27 <@deen> You guys have done most ddnet development in 4.8.4
21:27 <@deen> awesome
21:27 < laxa> commenting out 1 line isn't really development for me
21:27 < laxa> but I'll take that as a compliment xD
21:28 <@deen> mostly east & Savander
21:28 <@deen> not you,  laxa
21:32 < Savander> ya
21:32 < Savander> yay xd
21:34 <@deen> Released
21:37 < CookieMichal> I have question :)
21:37 < CookieMichal> Is it possible to compile teeworlds on linux for Mac and Windows?
21:37 <@deen> no
21:37 <@deen> i use virtual machines
21:37 <@deen> i mean, maybe it's possible
21:37 <@deen> but it would be a lot of work
21:38 < CookieMichal> virtual machine for mac?
21:38 < CookieMichal> D:
21:38 <@deen> yes
21:48 < laxa> deen: new bug...
21:49 < laxa> deen: come on the server I am, I'll show you
21:54 <@deen> laxa: tell me when you put it back to how it was
21:54 < laxa> I changed otherwise, changed the spawn point to tele to the rocket
21:54 < laxa> is that ok ?
21:56 <@deen> I really don't know why you make it so complicated
21:56 < laxa> I am just trying to improve the gameplay of the map, nothing mroe
22:01 < CookieMichal> in 4.8.1 client and zCatch server each time u type console it starts other admin session ;-;
22:01 <@deen> CookieMichal: yes, i know
22:01 <@deen> CookieMichal: ip spoofing protection
22:01 < CookieMichal> Fixed, yet?
22:01 < CookieMichal> D:
22:02 <@deen> the server is supposed to log you out after each command
22:02 <@deen> otherwise other people can send any rcon command they want
22:02 < CookieMichal> I start typing status and I see 10 of them :I
22:02 < CookieMichal> 10 of them as suggestions
22:02 <@deen> ooooh
22:02 <@deen> that's bad
22:02 <@deen> maybe i should only do that for ddnet server type then
22:03 < CookieMichal> ye

22:14 < laxa> demo could help ?
22:15 <@deen> i'm trying to create a situation where it happens
22:15 < laxa> and what about I showed you on Speedster ? Is it a bug ?
22:15 <@deen> instructions how to do that would be best
22:15 <@deen> laxa: maybe it's fixable, but i think it's easier not to
22:15 <@deen> because that would have the danger of making it buggy in the other direction
22:15 < laxa> I don't have instructions, it just happened -_-
22:15 < laxa> map uploaded then ?
22:16 <@deen> yes
22:16 < laxa> ok
22:20 <@deen> laxa: is the map download issue with vanilla client as well?
22:21 < laxa> deen: I'll try when I finish this fucking speedster
22:21 < laxa> remember me to save my ddnet conf xD
22:21 < laxa> everything is in config.cfg right ?
22:24 < Savander> in settings.cfg

22:26 < EastByte> hmm
22:27 <@deen> EastByte: objections?
22:28 < EastByte> hmmm

22:30 < laxa> deen: same bug happens on 0.6.1 vanilla client
22:30 <@deen> laxa: and 0.6.2 and 0.7?
22:30 < laxa> 0.7 not released
22:30 <@deen> tw master*
22:31 < laxa> so I have to test with 0.6.2 and 0.7 ?
22:31 <@deen> you don't have to, but it would help me
22:31 <@deen> i thought they fixed that in vanilla
22:31 < laxa> repo of 0.7 again please ?
22:31 <@deen> but couldn't find anything
22:31 <@deen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
22:35 < laxa> deen: how to compile 0.7 ?
22:35 <@deen> laxa: too late, fixed it already
22:35 < laxa> bam: target 'client_release' not found
22:36 < laxa> hm k
22:36 < laxa> but still xD
22:36 < laxa> What's the correct bam command to compile 0.7 ?
