00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im sleeping
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> u are not
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> troll.pdf
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im trying to
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> u gertroll
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> fapnighter
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> u
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i still want to see an anti ping feature where you can input an ms delays value
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> so lets say people who were adapted to 40 ping can play with "40 ping" on higher or lower ping servers
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> without any problems
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i still want to see an anti ping feature where you can input an ms delay value
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is there a way to spec only a specific team in free spec mode
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> /specteam ?
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh in free spec mode
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :thonk:
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Something like /specteam 40 would be nice
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Something like `/specteam 40` would be nice
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I dont know the code for specteam, but doesnt it already do it?
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Filters out only 1 team
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how protocol words and why all my code there disappear after compile ðŸ¥º
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why does sv_high_bandwidth effect emoticon smoothness?
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> sv_high_bandwidth makes the server send snapshots 2x as much
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i guess that affects emoticons
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> shouldn't the animation be client side
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> agree
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> seems like a good thing for a github issue
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> EEEEEH, many technicalities cause us to rely on the server snaps for a smooth-ish gametime
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think TsFreddie and Jupeyy investigated it further once upon a time
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A consequence of the new masterserver is that it's a bit annoying to follow people across servers, can anyone think of any interesting ways to remedy that?
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 a new protocol msg to share a sv to chat which u can join on click, which would be abused
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could limit it to some ips via config and have a longish cooldown
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how can i get value if character have jetpack(client side) 
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `m_pClient->m_aClients[m_pClient->m_LocalIDs[g_Config.m_ClDummy]].m_Jetpack` somewhy gives me false all the time
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `m_pClient->m_aClients[m_pClient->m_LocalIDs[g_Config.m_ClDummy]].m_Predicted.m_Jetpack` works but when i self-kill it gives true even if i dont have jetpack
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> || bruh i sent this message to #wiki somehow ||
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Ryozuki help pls :3
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @uwu are you on a ddnet server when testing this?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> yes
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, can you test something for me? I think I see the bug there
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ye ofc
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In gameclient.cpp, after L1369 add `pClient->m_Jetpack = pCharacterData->m_Flags & CHARACTERFLAG_JETPACK;`
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> now working perfectly xd
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah figures
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll commit it in a minute
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @uwu do you know a map I can test some jetpack on?
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i used deathpack
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> u dont get jetpack immediately so its good for testing
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, there is a mac bug again ðŸ˜¦
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never get to do the things I want to do lately
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> mac is big bug
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to work on a new bot, the old one breaks every other day. I want to fix a small bug I end up having to either mess around with cmake or some opengl bug that jupeyy will blame on the vendor

10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª https://paste.pr0.tips/ju
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I bet I'm on some spam mail list now
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any idea?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just by being on github you are on spam lists
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> What is your vendor BTW and is that on Linux?
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar âœª\:  can I load images with LoadTextureRaw in ddnet code and expect the result to be the same as in teeworlds code?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's on macOS
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 10.15
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Chiller: except for compressed textures I guess yes
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> And what gpu vendor
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> F1 shows
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```[2021-08-08 11:27:41][sdl]: SDL version 2.0.15 (compiled = 2.0.14)

10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry ircppl
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i want to load normal pngs and they look real messed up so maybe its the render not the load code then
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I force it to create a 3.3 context it does work
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Why does it even use gl2.1
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A 1.x context also works
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3.0 is default
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk why it wants to use 2.1
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> That's already sus
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Xd
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Especially if 3.3 works
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can try removing my config though it doesnt have anything looking related in there
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, 2.1 should also work I presume, so maybe a slight deviation from the spec somewhere?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I checked all possibilities with 3gpus and software renderer
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> A memory crash should be detectable
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe the other vendors being safer by initializing some data or being more agressive with their flushes?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe, but would that be useful?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Already from the software renderer I would expect useful information
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Also why does it crash on accessing a register
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe a buffer that gets deleted accidentally? I can see some implementations keeping it around for longer letting it be ub
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> My really weird crash but dunno what to search for
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> If you can go around in the stack race find address 0x8
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Or check what memory this could be in
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> How fast does it crash btw
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Directly?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It loads the map then it crashes
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe out of memory?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see no window
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean system memory? I have plenty and I'm running on 64bit
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wonder if it copies me message everywhere
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wonder if it copies my message everywhere
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nvm sorry
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Mhh if it is  reproducible it should be ez to find with open source drivers
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anyway, I guess Learath has to do it. someone is using a self not to repeat my messages in krx style
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> bot*
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> check off-topic
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it is very possible that it's a quirk of macOS implementation of gl
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But to be fair every opengl before ogl4.5 or something is a mess and before 3.3 it's even worse
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me check where that 8 is coming from
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how to get @Dev role? do i need to commit bunch of bug fixes or new things?
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thanks learath
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @uwu if you get a couple bugfixes in. There really isn't an official line
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I remember you adding a bit of opengl debugging in there, how was it enabled?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Dunno gfx debug 1
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How can `GL_AMD_debug_output` be true and `glDebugMessageCallbackAMD` be `NULL`???
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª send help please, how can I check if my driver has support for the extension?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I dunno. Did glew activate that extension properly ?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe it's not implemented by glew
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Just look in their source how they load functions
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I also cannot say if all ati cards have amd extension. In the past they probably weren't directly the same
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay I checked the opengl lib itself and it doesn't have any debug functionality
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I check inside `CCommandProcessorFragment_OpenGL2::Cmd_RenderTileLayer` before anything happens, there is a single `GL_INVALID_ENUM` error before anything else happens, and if I put a dbg_break after each gl call it never breaks
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so my guess is whatever causes that INVALID_ENUM is the issue
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Sounds possible yeah
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I somewhere have a closed PR that checks all gl calls
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> ðŸ«‚
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ðŸ«‚
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are so many gl calls that happen before the crash :/
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <conny> Is there any way to allow tees to open/close their own doors in solo parts? It works on solo maps why not in normal races? Maybe with server-settings?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this doesn't seem like intuitive behavior. there are probably maps that exist already that depend on pushing buttons in solo parts for other tees
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't think this exists yet. while imo your version is much more intuitive, it is very problematic to implement: What happens if two tees have a switch in a different state and they both leave the solo part? -> in which state is the switch
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <conny> chad programmer solution is letting creators map door rand(9999999) instead of door 1,2,3
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <conny> ðŸ˜„
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <conny> but yes seems much more intuitive that a solo part is like an enclosed race. Wasn't even aware it didn't work that way.
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah, its a bit whack
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> wrong reply
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't understand ^^
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª `CMD_CREATE_BUFFER_OBJECT` seems to be the command with the issue
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Mhh maybe it somehow does not have vbo support
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I'll later look in the code
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER` is the enum that's unknown
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think it's more intuitive the more you realize solo is just a switch, it's nothing special really
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i do see the value in what you mean though, i just dont think there is a solution
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im a bit curious what use switches are in solo race parts though
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yep you are right, its not in the spec before 3.1 apparently
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> HEH, so apple is the one following the spec
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 can you compile on that mashine?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tonight, am out for the night
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ðŸ¥º
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> hi could there be a way to play solo maps on a ddnet verified local server with 0 ping and achieve ranks?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> same for dummy maps
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeeesh, very very cheatable
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe if you record the actual input, like a demo just for input data
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A teehistorian file would be very close but you can craft them
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doubt many people have the skills for it or would take the time for it, but you can
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> just putting the idea out there, i think it would be so preferrable for so many people
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah. Just very very hard to make it possible. It'd require something like the setup speedrun.com has. Requiring handcam or sth to make sure
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://youtu.be/FvT-YxhaHB4
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> nobody react in #bugs  so i guess that better to put that here, there is a bug with "Blockworlds" entities.
