00:50 < Learath2> deen: how do stars work in rating a map are they server independent?
00:52 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: I think it displays how hard a map is
00:54 <@deen> Learath2: no, points are server independent
00:54 <@deen> stars are just a finer rating of difficulty of a map
00:55 <@deen> so novice 1 star is easiest, then novice 2 stars, ... 5 stars, moderate 1 star, ... mod 5 stars, brutal 1 star, ... brutal 5 stars
00:55 <@deen> when you vote for a random map you can write the number of stars as a reason, then you just get random maps with that number of stars

03:47 < Sadale> good morning :3
10:51 <@deen> Good morning Sadale 
10:51 < Sadale> deen, it's good afternoon now :p
10:53 <@EastByte> well I'm still waking up
12:08 < Nimda_6518> World of Magic by Captain just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-15 12:00
12:08 < Nimda_6518> Xeno Race #1 by Xeno just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-15 12:00
12:08 < Nimda_6518> Yin&Yang by Knight :3 just released on Ddmax at 2015-07-15 12:00
12:09 <@EastByte> that was all?
12:13 <@heinrich5991> no maps with Z :)
12:13 <@EastByte> Z?
12:14 <@heinrich5991> W X Y
12:14 <@EastByte> oh, right
12:21 < Sadale> When will the maps be available in github? :3
12:22 < laxadedi> afaik, the maps repo is updated something like every night
12:22 <@deen> Sadale: the cronjob runs every 24 hours
12:22 <@deen> EastByte: yep, that's all
12:23 < Sadale> deen, wait. There's a cornjob for pushing to the repo? :o
12:23 <@deen> now time for race server, but Index, who was supposed to prepare them, is on holidays^^
12:23 < Sadale> That's actually pretty cool
12:23 <@deen> so I probably have to prepare the race server myself
12:23 < Sadale> deen, The index should also be automated :>
12:23 <@deen> Sadale: what index?
12:23 < Sadale> deen, The vote index
12:23 < Sadale> deen, by index, did you mean the vote index?
12:23 <@deen> no, the player "Index"
12:23 < Sadale> the vote.cfg thingie
12:24 < Sadale> what's that?
12:24 < laxadedi> the vode.cfg is dynamic
12:24 < Sadale> I wonder which script generates vote.cfg :S
12:24 <@deen> wait, let me update the scripts repo
12:24 < Sadale> Currently, I just take the one from ddnet-maps
12:39 <@deen> Here we go, this script updates the ddnet-maps repo: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/build-maps.sh
12:40 <@deen> This creates the votes: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/create-votes.py mostly
12:45 <@heinrich5991> import sys
12:45 <@heinrich5991> reload(sys)
12:45 <@heinrich5991> ^^
12:45 <@deen> ehm, some copy paste stuff^^
12:45 <@deen> can't say my scripts are clean at all
12:46 <@heinrich5991> ^^
12:46 <@deen> ah no, that part is ok: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3828723/why-we-need-sys-setdefaultencodingutf-8-in-a-py-script
12:46 <@deen> it's necessary to make utf8 default encoding work
12:47 <@deen> had some trouble with this an weird player names so i guess i put it into every script
12:57 <@deen> hi executline 
12:57 < executline> hi
13:24 <@deen> Learath2: sounds like another problem with http downloader, maybe you can help debug: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1765&p=18855#p18855
13:48 < Learath2> deen: how does that look like http downloader issue
13:48 < Learath2> ?
13:49 <@deen> "Other shit happening just now: cant join new maps, updater wont work"
13:53 < Learath2> well its quite hard to debug on forums but ill try
14:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #235: Save server settings within the map (DDRace64...pr_ddnet_map_settings) http://git.io/vmWUb
14:13 <@deen> Learath2: you could also talk to him ingame
14:13 <@heinrich5991> deen: my attempt at that settings stuff, feel free to nitpick or ask me questions about it
14:14 < Learath2> its fun watching circleci compile :D
14:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: cool, you set up CI!
14:20 < Learath2> I just cant compile client_debug on windows anymore
14:21 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: you want to modify mapfiles on load?
14:21 < Learath2> well renaming json.c to cpp works
14:21 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I don't modify map files, I modify a copy
14:21 <@EastByte> Learath2: oh that might be my fault :P
14:22 <@heinrich5991> if that was your question
14:22 < Learath2> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/7f8ce3c8dd6ebe587f42c6792baa8d2902342047
14:22 < Learath2> seems to be deen
14:23 < Learath2> anyways json.c -> json.cpp was never a fix it just worked for mingw client_debug
14:25 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: what was your question? :)
14:25 <@EastByte> so on mapchange you are loading the map cfg, putting it into a new mapfile
14:26 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:26 <@EastByte> so you can load it correctly afterwards?
14:26 <@heinrich5991> so the map file the client downloads is complete
14:26 <@EastByte> ahh
14:26 <@heinrich5991> i.e. also contains the configs
17:11 < Learath2> how could two servers on DDNet GER have different ping for me ?
17:12 <@deen> Learath2: too intelligent devices on the internet that prefer some ports over others
17:12 <@deen> they shouldn't look at the ports, but they do
17:12 <@EastByte> yup, it's pretty funny sometimes
17:13 <@EastByte> had similiar problems with ddmax back then
17:13 <@deen> not much fun debugging problems like that
17:13 <@deen> oh, now i can't connect to 10 ports, have ping 150 to 10 others and 20 on the other 10...
17:13 <@deen> you might notice that some ddnet servers start at port 7303 instead of 8303
17:14 <@deen> i started with that because some of the 83* ports didn't go through the chinese firewall...
17:16 <@EastByte> Chinese Firewall, Custom Rule: udp dst port >8300 drop // comment "Block Teeworlds"
17:16 <@deen> yes, Teeworlds is very dangerous
17:17 <@deen> can't even write in chinese in it, but still dangerous
17:18 < fstd> given how much abuse and ddos teeworlds attracts, they might have a point there ;)

21:33 < Learath2> deen: is the +1 jump tile not giving you a jump if you dj in it intentional ?
21:34 <@deen> i think so, yes
21:34 <@deen> but feel free to try around with improving it
22:15 < Learath2> eeeee: teewebs is dead
22:16 < eeeee> oh noes
22:18 < eeeee> choked on some unicodez :/
22:19 < fstd> serverlist related?
22:19 < eeeee> yeah. problem is somewhere in js code tho
22:19 < fstd> ah, okay
22:19 < Savander> weird, i clicked "update" game has restart and then
22:19 < Savander> my config just gone
22:19 < eeeee> or maybe not, not sure
22:19 < Savander> o.O
22:20 < fstd> eeeee: maybe someone tried the iphone message preview bug ;)
22:20 < eeeee> either node.js has a buggy json decoder or ur scripts somehow generated invalid json
22:20 < eeeee> or both
22:21 < fstd> do you have that invalid json object saved?
22:22 < eeeee> nope, but i'll make it save the json when it gets rekt
22:23 < fstd> good plan
22:23 < Learath2> Savander: im pretty sure the updater cant even touch your config
22:23 < Savander> it's weird because
22:23 < Savander> i had config
22:23 < Savander> clicked update, don't have config
22:24 < Savander> replaced by this official
22:24 < fstd> pull it from your backup :)
22:24 < Savander> i had, but it gone too, wtwf
22:24 < Savander> wtf
22:25 < Learath2> deen: why do you add stuff to both remove and download on update.json
22:25 < Learath2> just download should suffice to replace them
22:25 < fstd> if that was actually caused by the update, then it's a bug
22:25 < fstd> (news at 11)
22:26 < Savander> i had, because i did backup after last "config bug"
22:26 < Learath2> well i dont think even if we wanted we could hunt down your backup with the updater
22:26 < Savander> i don't have problem with it, i can fast back this config by hand
22:26 < eeeee> also given the ratio of how often geoshit breaks to how often it worx it seems likely that it was just a random bit rot
22:27 < Savander> but, i don't think its updater problem
22:27 <@deen> Learath2: i remove different things than i download
22:28 < Savander> because my config just gone few times without update
22:28 < fstd> Savander: it would be useful if you could reproduce the problem, so someone can debug it
22:28 < Savander> i have no idea how to do that :D
22:28 < Savander> i just pressed update :D
22:28 < fstd> like, create a recipe how to cause the bug, and you've done half the work of getting it fixed
22:28 < Savander> ooka 
22:28 < Savander> recpie
22:28 < Savander> run the game
22:28 < Savander> press update
22:28 < Savander> results
22:28 < fstd> that's vague and useless
22:28 < Savander> but, it's all what i did
22:29 < fstd> and it doesn't nearly contain all relevant information, or even any of it.  start with what version, what platform, does it happen when you run it with a clean config dir, etc
22:29 < Savander> + it's random
22:29 < Learath2> deen: 7.9.1 those look same
22:29 <@deen> Learath2: no, they have typos^^
22:30 < Learath2> ohhh forground :D
22:30 <@deen> and doodas instead of doodads
22:31 <@deen> Learath2: what happens when 7.9 downloads doodas and 7.9.1 removes it, but you currently have 7.8.2. will it be there or not?
22:31 < Savander> Windows 7 64 bit, DDNet 7.9.1, My config - edited values by game in settings tab, additional mappres.
22:32 < Savander> nothing more :P
22:32 <@deen> Savander: someone in forum reported a similar problem a few days ago =/
22:32 < Savander> deen, and few weeks ago too
22:32 < Savander> you told me too
22:32 <@deen> Savander: i don't know what could cause it and no idea how to debug if it just randomly happens sometimes for some people =/
22:32 < Savander> ^^.
22:32 <@deen> yeah, the same guy had it again, and you too
22:32 < Savander> weird.
22:32 <@deen> so maybe it really is updater related?
22:32 < Savander> cause of 64bit?
22:32 < Savander> maybe?
22:32 <@deen> no, he has 32bit i think
22:32 < Savander> i has 32bit client 
22:32 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1765
22:33 <@deen> ah, i have an idea, maybe we should write the config into a temporary file and then overwrite the old config with that
22:33 < Learath2> well you wont have it 
22:33 <@deen> less chance of something dying midway
22:33 < Learath2> but you will unnecessarily download it
22:33 <@deen> Learath2: but it downloads it? ok^^
22:33 <@deen> not that terrible, can be fixed at some point thouhg
22:34 < Savander> i shoudl compile it to debug mode
22:34 < Savander> and gdb 
22:34 < Savander> xD.
22:34 < Savander> all the time.
22:34 < Savander> xD
22:34 <@deen> Savander: it's terribly slow, unplayable
22:34 < Savander> playable for me
22:34 < Savander> i tested it
22:34 < fstd> you could also have the file keep a backup of the config just in case
22:34 <@deen> but you can run in release mode with gdb and enable core dumps on linux at least
22:34 < fstd> one that the updater doesn't know about
22:34 < Savander> fstd,  i had
22:34 < fstd> s/file/client/
22:35 < fstd> Savander: I mean something different
22:35 <@deen> fstd: the updater doesn't know about configs at all and doesn't touch them
22:35 <@deen> fstd: i just think something makes the client crash while saving the file so it ends up empty or half-empty
22:35 < Savander> deen,  but now
22:35 < Savander> the file just was replaced
22:36 < Savander> previously, file was unreadable
22:36 < Savander> when i had this bug
22:36 < fstd> deen: okay, but suppose the client would write the config to another file, one it never removes (but overwrites).  just so that in case of a fuckup (until the bug is found and fixed), there's a copy of the config around for manual restoration
22:37 < Learath2> deen: should only be one function that needs patching
22:37 < fstd> Savander: unreadable, as in, contained garbage?
22:37 <@deen> fstd: that's fine too, i think my solution would work better though as it doesn't require manual restoration
22:38 < fstd> hm, i didn't know you had a solution yet
22:39 < fstd> ah, that.  yes, that's (bug or not) always a good strategy
22:39 < Savander> yes
22:39 < Savander> squares, weird characters
22:39 < fstd> write the file, then rename() it to the target
22:39 < fstd> that cant(TM) fail
22:39 <@deen> fstd: yeah, that's what i do with all my scripts on server
22:47 <@heinrich5991> fstd: that would assume that you do error checking while writing :P
22:47 < fstd> and you obviously should
22:48 < fstd> but i don't see why that assumes that
22:50 <@heinrich5991> write() -> ENOSPC
22:50 <@heinrich5991> rename(truncated, old) -> success
22:55 < fstd> there's no way the config file is "gone" in the end, though, and in the scenario you describe, it's clearly the fault of not error-checking library functions
22:55 < fstd> the program could also #define rename(A, B) unlink(A)
23:07 <@heinrich5991> fstd: I was just describing the current situation in TW
23:07 <@heinrich5991> it does no error checking, so simply slapping a rename at the end won't help
23:08 < fstd> oh. okay.  then that should probably be fixed :)
23:08 < fstd> (i know it's against the spirit of TW to do error checking, but well, that's pretty silly IMO)
23:19 < Savander> what can cause screen shaking?
23:19 < Savander> in teeworlds?
23:20 < Savander> 1600 fps, 28ping
23:20 < Savander> and screen shaking
23:20 < Savander> looks like, desynchronize frames beetwen game - monitor
23:21 < Savander> fullscreen/borderless (doesn't matter)
23:22 < Savander> wihout v-sync because of delay of input
23:24 <@heinrich5991> what do you mean, "shaking"?
23:25 < Savander> just shaking
23:25 < Savander> when i move
23:25 < Savander> and i change direction
23:26 < Savander> of moving, screen shaking
23:26 < Savander> like antiping does
23:26 < Savander> with other tees
23:26 < Savander> thinks "oh, he should be there"
23:26 < Savander> but NO, he isn't
23:30 < Savander> or better explanation. It looks like, client render too much. Move to left and stop, client render a bit left then back to proper position.
23:32 <@deen> Savander: sounds very strange, maybe some video interpolation of your screen
23:32 <@deen> i would disable everything in monitor osd settings
23:35 < Savander> weeeeird
23:35 < Savander> sometimes i don't like computer
23:35 < Savander> xD
