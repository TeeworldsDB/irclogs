08:52 <+ChillerDragon> o.O cc0ing maps is nice make sure to set the license in the map metadata @konsti
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 did you see my pr?
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> @louis @Cellegen does someone of you has a nice high res tw wallpaper for me?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> sometimes I write long msg and someone changes map before I send it and my msg is gone! Is it possible to keep my unfinished msg after loading new map?!
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> agree, thats annoying xdd
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> upgrade to 0.7 there you even keep chat history or can play during typing a message
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> as a 0.6 hack you can using local console and type "say [long message]"
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @ChillerDragon for you? do you want me to make a wallpaper?
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> you do not have to make one for me just send me one you already made. Didnt you create the blueish mountain tree thingy?
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> I need a background for my windows machines my current one is so ugly
12:00 <+ChillerDragon> @Cellegen ^
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> tbh i want to remake that one instead
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and make it wallpaper friendly
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i think 1 day or 2 is more than enough to remake it, so you can get it in no time ðŸ˜„
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> love u
12:15 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: I did, don't quite have the time to look into it
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> just merge its good stuff
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> but i could not fix the windows build but at least linux
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> does it even build on ur mac?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It did when I pushed
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> yea those new c++ thingys seem to be very compiler dependent
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> @Learath2 hi, why is cagih name permbanned?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he replay botted
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its not perma banned
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> How long?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not sure
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Hes been banned for longer than other botters
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Why not unban him already
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe he botted multiple times
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> So u gonna keep him banned as long as u r too lazy to check his other ranks?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Qywinc> Its not jaos fault that he bottet lel
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Who said that
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Other botters received fair amont of punishment
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Cagih has been banned much longer than others
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but cagih botted after he was already banned once, so its fair to ban him longer than botters who stopped botting after the ban
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> right?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Did he? Im close friend if him and im pretty sure he stopped botting after ban
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Can u say what map he botted?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ravillion
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he botted, got banned, botted again next day
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so first ban is 2/3 months, second ban is 6 months
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that makes at least 8 months
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hes banned since march
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so there is still some time
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> Ok thanks
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> @jao i asked him and he said after his first ban the client got banned on servers so its impossible he did it after
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i say something else
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ìˆ˜ê·¸ë¦¬ë‹ˆ> Is there a reason practice is still disabled globally?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> i think they are waiting on zwelf to stop breaking solo before re enabling it
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @heinrich5991 was the solo practice bug fixed?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ìˆ˜ê·¸ë¦¬ë‹ˆ> yes it was
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i cant import record_race.sql and record_teamrace.sql because the file are to big xD i want only to use one map, is the server create a map dont exist in this sql file self? or i have to create it self xD?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ìˆ˜ê·¸ë¦¬ë‹ˆ> if u want only the ranks of one map, i guess its best to write a query in the sql tool
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ìˆ˜ê·¸ë¦¬ë‹ˆ> https://ddnet.tw/stats/sql.js/
