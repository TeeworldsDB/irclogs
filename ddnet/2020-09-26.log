00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck Soreu, louis, Ravie
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen could you try `BreakConstructorInitializers: AfterColon` to fix the ultra long line in `CDemoEdit::CDemoEdit`?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems to match the before style better, anyway, e.g. in `http.cpp`
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also video.cpp
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in src/engine/server/databases/connection.cpp, the string literals' indentation should be fixed by putting the indentation into the string literal
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> put a few spaces into the beginning of each string literal that should be indented
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `AlignEscapedNewlines: DontAlign`
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pelase
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the `} while` of do-while bothers me, but the option to fix that only comes in clang-format 12
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, one line enums can also only be done with cf12
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the colon helps
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the colon?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> BreakConstructorInitializers: AfterColo
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> n
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but seems to increase the diff size
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm interesting
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I only saw this style in the diff because the other style didn't get changed
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still tending to `AfterColon`, works better to not create long lines
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for fixing the includes btw, that was probably a pain
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wasn't too bad
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could look into using something like iwyu, but i had bad experiences, needed lots of fine-tuning
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, interesting tool
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably needs to be aware about system headers though
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> right
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where it cannot assume that what's there currently is also available on all other systems
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pushed again
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> crapnet.cpp has misaligned comment after reformatting
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I made it through!
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just 50k lines of unified diff
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i used git diff -w and just skimmed
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the beginning I was more diligent until I realized that vim showed me that I was at 5%
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't really need the scripts/fix_style.py anymore, do we?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now that simply every file can be formatted
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how should people fix the broken formatting that they introduce? just run clang-format on the entire dir?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I'll write a script that runs clang-format on the entire dir
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lemme do that now
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's faster to run it only on changed files
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I adapted fix_style to do that
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it was a source of confusion, it's hard to pass the correct arguments to fix_style
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> true, would probably be easier
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but takes a few seconds
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I'll make it look at the last ten commits?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, no, that seems too random
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by default
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let's just change fix_style.py to look at all files?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can do that since I changed it around anyway
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if that's ok for you
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's fine
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe keep the dry-run parameter for CI
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, actually I'm probably going to sleep 😄
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night, thanks for resurrecting the clang-format PR
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think you have permissions to push on my PR, or you could merge it and make a new PR to change it
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i have fixed all that you wrote
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> including crapnet?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, I just removed the comment's indentation
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, that's good
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the alternative would be // clang-format off
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but didn't want that
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> demo still has issues right?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not for that
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen great, thank you 🙂
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll probably merge the PR then and make a new one
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can try to fix some conflicts in other PRs tomorrow morning
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we just hit 3 000 000 teehistorian files 🙂
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 🥳
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen is the code/client release already ready for mod-specific skins in DB?
04:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also what in case of the skin being updated in DB? will it replace once-downloaded one in the client?
04:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or there's no any kind of hash checking
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't know how in C++, but in ruby world we have rubocop.
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It works like that: first time it should be run with a special key.
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Then it creates rubocop.todo file with all style offences.
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Next time it run it will only report on those which are not in rubocop.todo file.
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This way there are no chain-reactions appears when you change something in a file and then have to fix more and more affected lines.
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also it has a caching mechanism, so second time it run on the same machine it checks only files which hash sums have been changed after the last ran.
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This makes it possible to run it on all files regardless the size of project.
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen
09:10 <@deen> simpler to just keep the style clean I think
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu yes
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The downloadedskins directory is actually not used at all for reading skins. Skin is always redownloaded on each client restart
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ^ sounds very interesting
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So a client will change preinstalled tileset based on the game type?
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or is this affects editor only?
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can start caching if it is an issue
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck if u mean my pr:
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1. it already changes preinstalled tilesets based on game type
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can now select entities, etc. without overwriting the data stuff
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and you can do it on fly, so no client restart
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck if u mean my pr:
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it already changes preinstalled tilesets based on game type
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can now select entities, etc. without overwriting the data stuff
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and you can do it on fly, so no client restart
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its only a client side feature
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Every client side feature is huge for me 😃
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And that's nice. One more step towards downloadable tilesets for pickups and projectiles.
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And maybe to custom additional ones.
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ you're still on fire
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is there such a thing as client recognition in scoreboard? F-client has this feature but I never seen it working.
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Would like to implement it on my server to distinguish 0.6 and 0.7 clients at least without changing anything in player's name and clan name or skin or score.
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Originally I've thought it is a ddnet server feature. But now I have ddnet codebase in my mod and it's not there. 
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Not very important just curious.
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe officual ddnet client has this too.
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> F-client probably detects some clients that set some player flags (like chatting, showhookcoll)
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've thought initially that snapshot of a player info contains version. Then my guess was that some client uses whitespace combinations in name to encode version for clients supporting it.
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> F-Client detects skin parts
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> F-Client sends skin parts that are default as `!f-client`, which can be detected by another f-client
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hmm... so I can send 0.7 client's character's body name as 'f-client' from a server and it will be defaulted to default skin when drawing it and still f-client will mark it in scoretable?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice, I'd wanted to see who actually uses 0.6 or 0.7 at a glance on my server while testing. It would help me a lot.
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Rcon status is a bit harder as I have to switch from a game to rcon first
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will experiment with that, thanks!
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-Client/blob/cb29ee3746263352fee8fd091b4f118193cc674e/src/game/version.h#L11
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is the string thats sent
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Clefairy' You also have access to the skinDB, right?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Mokuz & Skyrel seem to not even be in this discord
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen add also @Clefairy' to this list (and thanks for listing us :heartw: )
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> playerflags are way more restrictive in 0.7 @deen sadly
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> @Pure_luck there is also !gamer and !zilly
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i see
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion:music: 
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> maybe making update like this:what: 
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> for see how many time win  for players:ninja: :justatest:
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759367695375532052/ed6eb14b066a4a56.png
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eskaro> Interesting
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> How many times they have finished the map?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> no how many times they won XD
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ww:  yes
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> +1 from me, but that should be rather shown in scoreboard
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> What this -9999 even means?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> exactly -9999 of something or at least -9999 of that? and is this much worse than -999 or -99 so anyone should care about it?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and why people care about negative score anyway?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> nothing this just screenshot for you know what i mean
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just thing this -9999 occupies 60% of the screen and means nothing
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but this tiny "5" proposed uses 5% of space and more important
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Soreu  yeah everywhere , /rank-/top5 / ......
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (60% of score baloon)
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> of you know what my suggestion this ok don't  focus  about screenshot
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> can I suggest skins to the db by pr?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> -9999 = unfinished map
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> choose f3 or f4⬆️ 👆
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Pure_luck -9999 only shows up in non-ddnet clients I think
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Clefairy'> yep @Soreu, but as I remember Mokuz was on this discord server
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I still want a little padlock icon to show whether the team is locked or not but oyu didn't want to add it! :C
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> and wiking tee when taking a screenshot xd
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> and winking tee when taking a screenshot xd
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Lady Saavik https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/198
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that could include your idea
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> me too?:brownbear:
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lady Saavik if you find where to put the padlock, you can have it right now 😄
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> OMG YES NEXT TO TEAM NUMBER
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> ah now ait
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> wait
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> wasn't it like a small "Team 60" before?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Lady Saavik  for me wanna two things

15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> sure (deep) too
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @hussainx3 download ddnet client
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Question regarding automapper: Can you do anything fancy with NoLayerCopy that you can't do with NewRun?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @jao this ddnet
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Ama don't make llogo HD on your #👶jp map
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Ama don't make logo HD on your #👶jp map
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @hussainx3 cl_ddrace_scoreboard 1
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> what this?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in f1
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen @deen regarding PR: can we have a key combination to release mouse grab? Like alt-shift or shift-shift in VMWare?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> f1 works for that
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... it works for moving windows. But not for taking screenshots with a selector
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *partial ones
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or... maybe teeworlds have a hotkey for screenshot already?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> F10
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> sorry, wasn't aware of it. Ok at least I can screenshot a window contents
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though I cannot make a screenshot of 2 ddnet windows side by side with rectangular selector as ddnet doesn't release the mouse
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, it seems that this case is rare and nobody else will need it
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> would be also nice if there would be Alt+Enter hotkey that will change windowed window of for example 1024x768 to full native resolution and make it fullscreen and remember windowed resolution
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *windowed mode game window to fullscreen
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but it seems that more likely I will implement it myself in some distant future 😅
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lady Saavik I guess it'd be useful in the scoreboard
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @hussainx3 Settings > map background > `%current%`

16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> @deen did you re-enable that you are moving when pressing ctrl shift d ?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Brokecdx- do you?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> i do
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn, that's what the 2 modifier binds broke then
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> much better if i dont move because i spam this bind literally always when playing
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I knew there was an edge case we were breaking by adding them, just couldn't figure out what
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Brokecdx- can you create an issue for it on github so I don't forget to look into this?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> sure
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> same broke
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hah, not going insane
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought the tee wouldn't move on ctrl-shift-d, but it did
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then I thought we never had that after all
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe as a work around you can bind ctrl + shift + d to something
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try `bind ctrl+shift+d ";"` maybe
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> no
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> bind debug
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you bind debug it will toggle twice I think
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which means you get no debug
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> i did it with bind lol
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we can remove the hardcoded bind and replace it with a normal bind?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> bind 7 debug
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does `debug` toggle?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> `bind x toggle debug 1 0`
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does `debug` alone even toggle anything? 😄
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, the issue at hand is that ctrl+shift+d now moves you, which is a regression
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thats pretty weird cuz I always moved me
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thats pretty weird cuz it always moved me
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> lol
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> murpi
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> xkcd workflow
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> you had to press strg+shift and then d
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I usually press f1 before opening the debug
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, it's completely broken 😄
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it triggers both binds, not the most specific bind
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How should the binds work anyway?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do we want binds to repeat if you hold them?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> <a:ismejao:758062579888422952>
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> why would you want that
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I bet that's macOS messing with it actually 😄
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can one of you check if that happens on windows or linux?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> sheep confused
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi bind something to a key, hold down said key, does the bind trigger multiple times?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, we should be checking `Event.key.repeat` when we get a KEYDOWN
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 yes it does
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It probably shouldn't 😄
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @fokkonaut thanks, reused client recognition to distinct 0.6 vs 0.7 players in scoretable. Nice feature!
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Will help me to debug issues as I will know at a glance who uses which protocol on my server.
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it will only recognize zillywoods, gamer and fclient
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not Vanilla 0.7
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> many people use vanilla 0.7
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just use f2: status
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't use it as you have intended it.
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just set it to f-client body part for SixUp clients
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would kill to have `SnapReplaceItem` so we can finally extend the ddnet player object
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't care if comeone uses f-client, zilly or gamer
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @hussainx3 Go to settings, custom map background, write here ` %current% ` - then you have entities with current map's background
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> By the way, does 0.6 or 0.7 or ddnet extensions support some sort of player flags which tells client predictor that this character is hookable or not?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have a global tune, but in my mod hook protection can be turned on and off for each player.
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> in original infClass they just set player_hookable global tune to 1 for every client and then server will tell with the next snapshot was it hookable back then
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it works ok, but if someone tries to hook me while I am hook protected the prediction race starts
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as my client thinks that every client can be hooked, but server knows that I am protected
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh... it seems that I should set flags NO_COLLISION and NO_HOOK for protected characters...
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but what clients respect that?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> is that ddnet feature or 0.6 and/or 0.7 vanilla supports it too?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet is the only 0.6 client to support the extended player flags I think
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 clients by fokkonaut and chiller probably also support it given they support the protocol extensions
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> character flags?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean this
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759426777818202142/Screenshot_from_2020-09-26_17-50-38.png
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah. Yep they are character flags
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Soreu  where  write?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are a part of the ddnetcharacter though, so it's definitely of no use to vanilla
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @fokkonaut I don't think your or chiller's client support those?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We tried our very best to keep these extensions generic enough but seems not many people even make clients, let alone implement our extensions :D
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 what will happen if only one of character seets NO_HOOK and other is not? which can hook other?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'll have to take a look at the code. It's been a long time
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> My bet would be that neither one could.
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, I will check next time. Just too bad 0.7 doesn't support it
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to get the protocol extensions into 0.8
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe even 0.7 since it's not a breaking change
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I could send faketunes to 0.7 knowing which clients are in range and direction ofc.
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but that's just too much hassle
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think 0.7 clients should just cope that their predictor will fight with a server
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Faketunes are how we handle it for vanilla 0.6 I think
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 my protocol extensions? 😊
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, I'll also try to make them a little more flexible
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Are you checking a potentially hookable character every tick for each player and update faketune PLAYER_HOOKABLE?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's so much work
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean for 0.6
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> how it works there?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't update faketunes very often
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.6 just gets a worse experience
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For netobjects I want snapreplaceitem to be there before anything
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nice, yea
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we kinda lack that in ddnet
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah ddnet is getting it first
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was wondering if I should build a hashtable tbh, but not sure if I want to bother benching it
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 nice
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Welf did u cry enough to admins?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> what?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah its heinrich
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> what do you mean
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Welf Just don't mind him. It's pointless due to hate rampage
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> alright
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> especially when the best argent is "nobody asked you to be here, just leave" because we could say that about nearly every single player out there
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> well i wanted to understand what he was talking about, so i asked here ^^
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> why not dm
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I don't understand when to use it
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> #off-topic
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> fine, I better shut up and leave
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> . . .
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Soreu can u add my skin to db
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Send it, I will forward it to rest of the crew and then we will see
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> [2020-09-26 16:18:29][client]: offline error='You have been banned for 10 minutes (VPN detected, try connecting without. Contact admin if mistaken)'
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> meh
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> 139.59.215.82
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> stop using vpn
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how is that mistaken
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> looks like a proxy ip to me
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> try connecting without it
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> also 149.202.127.134 and 51.210.171.47 pls
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> its not a vpn
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > looks like a proxy ip to me
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> how do you check it?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g.  149.202.127.134 is registered to AS16276 which is OVH Hosting
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> RIPE record says OVH further allocated this block to servercompass.com
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, but that doesn't mean it has open proxy or a public VPN service isn't it?
19:00 <+ChillerDragon> yes two are OVH(servercompass) and one is digitalocean they currently run no proxies and are owned by me
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if they run no proxies then how are u trying to connect to tw thru them
19:00 <+ChillerDragon> just on the vps directly
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ctrl + shift + d always made me move
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > if they run no proxies then how are u trying to connect to tw thru them
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why not?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Living in some countries enforces you to use VPN for your daily internet life to be secure or it to work at all.
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Censorship in Russia for example is so huge that some RANGES are banned by goverment.
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So to use linkedit, telegram, github one have to use a VPN of some kind.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> You cannot expect one to turn it off just to play a tw. There could be background network processes that require a VPN.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also ok, I can understand why you guys are banning open proxies and open VPNs/
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> More or less I can understand why you ban cheap paid proxies.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But please, let people use their own VPNs that nobody else use.
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's not to cloak their IP. It's to make internet work in some countries.
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Those IP's are static. People paid with their credit cards to rent a VPN. It's not for illegal actions.
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Pure_luck you can contact an admin to get them unbanned AFAIK
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/87e86834c3afd61b01de8c96a77e0e116e4ea34e/src/game/client/components/binds.cpp#L146 why do +xxx binds always activate regardless of modifier
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> i think thats why you move even when pressing ctrl and shift
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > you can contact an admin to get them unbanned AFAIK
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I play on my server only last 3 months so it's not my problem anymore.
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But to hear all those "just don't use VPN" triggers me. And I'd wanted to tell me that it isn't that simple
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> there is no actual reasons to ban VPS providers IP ranges
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's one, people use it for ban evasion
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> VPS/VDS != VPN
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess we'd need a provider that can tell us VPN ranges from VPS ranges
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> do you have a provider which just tells you that IP is suspicious?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that was my original question about
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have a provider that tells us whether they think an IP address is a residential one or not
