00:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I'm clusterssh'ing it to all servers so hopefully no bamboozle ðŸ˜›
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i remember my pr added the settings to the .cfg but i guess the ddnet sv ignores changes to .cfg
00:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> yep

01:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> alice bob mallory
01:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> the game hackmud has so many references :)
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> what does moderate do?
01:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/977
05:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> @Ryozuki moderate is kinda broken in some aspects
05:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> it shouldn't force new votes by the mod instantly
05:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> it should allow the mod to vote even when they are not in the involved team
09:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> I think it should force votes whwn the mld.votes
09:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> I think it should force votes when the mod votes

10:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> this change makes the mutes remain after reconnect?
10:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> that would be good
10:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> yes
10:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> now i still need aio and opengl3 fixes and I could release new version
11:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> <3
12:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> can somebody explain what the point of tee historian is, please
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> can somebody explain what the point of tee historian, please
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> it saves everything that happens on the server, tees joining where they move etl
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> for what will that be useful? what can read / analyze the file
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> can somebody explain what the point of tee historian, please
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> it saves everything that happens on the server, tees joining where they move etc
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> for what will that be useful? what can read / analyze the file
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> admins can access them and reconstruct a demo from player inputs to check whether someone cheated a map
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> heinrich has some rust programs on github for that
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> i don't think it's used for anything else right now. in  the future we could also provide demos of any specific run
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> (just movements, chat is not recorded)
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> thanks ðŸ˜ƒ
13:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I think heinrich's current tool just uses the position data to construct the demo, but in the future the input data will be ran through the server to get an actual proper demo
