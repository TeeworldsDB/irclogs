17:32 <+Ryozuki> i guess those are timeouts
17:32 <+Ryozuki> or smth
21:23 <+SPYRES> Hi, is something wrong with the servers?
21:26 <+SPYRES> SA servers dont come up in my browser. Funnily i can connect using direct ip. Also its strange to see the vps idle on 0%-2% with 63% of 1gig of ram being used with no cpu activity? (https://ddnet.tw/status/)
21:26 <+SPYRES> Furthermore, when i join the server the times come us as -512 instead of the format 1:52 or whatever it is
21:26 <@deen> SPYRES: we're getting a DoS attack on all servers
21:27 <@deen> someone or some system is probably blocking too much on South Africa
21:27 <+SPYRES> @deen ahh okay. This has been happening for awhile im assuming?
21:27 <@deen> well we've been getting DoS attacks for years
21:28 <+SPYRES> Ive seen and read it on forums. Oh well.. i guess we just have to wait... Thanks for the quick reply :P
21:42 <+SPYRES> I do not think there is a ddos on SA server atm? I can connect and everything is fine. Perhaps it needs a restart? There is no packet loss, ping spikes etc
21:42 <+SPYRES> im on zaf.ddnet.tw:7311
21:43 <@deen> the firewall is filtering it out
21:43 <@deen> along with all legal info requests
21:48 < garry> @deen can you restart the ZA servers? Do you have access to the VPS?
21:52 <@deen> garry: yeah, but that won't restart the firewall i believe
21:53 <@deen> ah no, ssh is blocked as well
21:53 <@deen> no access
21:53 <+garry> :/ that sucks we seriously need a team leader for SA that can handle this stuff
21:53 <@deen> ?
21:54 <@deen> what's a team leader and how can he restart servers without ssh access?
21:54 <+SPYRES> xD
21:55 <+SPYRES> i think garry is thinking of two separate things
21:55 <+SPYRES> not related to server stuff
21:59 <+garry> Back in the day when I was an admin for MWEB, we had a command if you had admin level(rcon) you could type shutdown and it was the same as restart
21:59 <+garry> it shut the server down and brought it back up with default settings etc.
21:59 <@deen> yeah, well that does no good about the firewall rule
22:00 <+garry> well we clearly do not have a reliable hoster then
22:00 <+garry> he is not available when we need hikm
22:00 <+garry> him*
22:00 <+Ryozuki> ddos is the main problem
22:01 <+Ryozuki> and protection cost thousands
22:01 <+Ryozuki> it's so unfair :c
22:01 <+garry> I know :(
22:01 <+Ryozuki> you can ddos with 5â‚¬ 
22:01 <@deen> garry: wtf are you talking about?
22:02 <+garry> :/ leave it deen you are not thinking like I am hahahahaha
22:02 <+Ryozuki> ?
22:02 <@deen> yeah, i don't get it. Most hosters kick you out when you get DoSed hard enough
22:03 <@deen> you might notice that RUS and Chile are also permanently down
22:03 <+SPYRES> How is GER up?
22:03 <+Ryozuki> i wonder where comes so much hate
22:03 <+garry> I saw RUS is down
22:04 <@deen> dunno, east might be setting some firewall rules
22:04 <+SPYRES> ah k
22:04 <+SPYRES> how big do these ddos scale up to?
22:04 <+SPYRES> well.. jsut for ddnet on average?
22:05 <@deen> these aren't even ddos attacks, just small application-specific spoofed dos from a single server
22:05 <@deen> something like 100k packets/s per server
22:06 <+SPYRES> okay. clearly im very noob. alright
22:06 < Acordi> deen are you saying one server basically over using the bandwith now affects other servers?
22:07 <@deen> Acordi: don't understand
22:07 <+Acordi> hmm
22:07 <+Acordi> clearly right
22:07 <+Acordi> just trying to make sense of what you telling us
22:08 <+Acordi> i know how these things work and i understand its not going through a ddos attack that i couldive noticed
22:08 <+Acordi> restarting my server fixed the fact that it didnt register correct
22:09 <+SPYRES> sigh..
22:10 <+SPYRES> anyways... just on a side note and out of interest. How is the future of Ddnet development looking currently?
22:10 <+garry> NO FUTURE
22:11 <+Acordi> haha
22:11 <+garry> not for SA anyways
22:11 <+SPYRES> not for you guys...
22:11 <+Ryozuki> u should reread what he said
22:12 <+Acordi> yes i see your point deen and i also know you guys dont do much anymore because i mean atm you have no challenge so why try your best
22:12 <+Acordi> just nicely said
22:18 <+SPYRES> @deen: just to clarify is this normal? http://prntscr.com/cs8ohu
22:19 <@heinrich5991> yes
22:19 <@heinrich5991> if the server doesn't erspond to info requests
22:20 <+SPYRES> Okay
22:30 <+Acordi> no deen thats not normal but its fixed now so shot
22:40 <+SPYRES> cool, sorry for the noobness. Have a great evening. peace
