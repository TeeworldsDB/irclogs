09:43 < Nimda> Translation: Ferier
09:44 < laxa_work> oh, apparently they say public holiday
09:44 < laxa_work> even though it's not really holliday
09:47 < EastByte> haphost still didn't response to my free vps request
09:47 < EastByte> they say it takes up to 2-4 weeks
09:47 < EastByte> 2 weeks now
09:48 <@deen> the ddos protection for GER is also delayed for an unknown time
09:48 < laxa_work> Why do you need a free vps when you already have a kimsufi ?
09:48 < EastByte> I'm collecting cheap servers :D
09:48 < laxa_work> lol
09:49 < EastByte> 1eur vps, 5 eur vps (3gb ram), 5 eur dedicated
09:49 < laxa_work> how is that usefull oO ?
09:49 < EastByte> just for fun
09:50 < EastByte> each server is a node in my private network
09:50 < laxa_work> Roflmao.
09:50 <@deen> EastByte: You know about uberspace?: https://uberspace.de/
09:51 < EastByte> nah
09:52 < laxa_work> can't find any english translation inside it :(
09:52 <@deen> they don't have any
09:56 < laxa_work> http://guhat.com/
09:58 <@deen> bye

09:58 < laxa_work> deen: have a good day !
09:58 < EastByte> deen: cya
09:59 < EastByte> laxa_work: I guess it's just advertising
10:00 < EastByte> at some point kids want more resources

19:09 < pause> laxa: Tu veux le faire ? =D
19:09 < pause> Whoops, french tongue slip
19:09 < laxa> I am pre-registered !
19:09 < laxa> I choosed PHP5 xD
19:09 < pause> C++/Javascript !
19:14 < pause> laxa: I received no mail for pre registration, is that normal /
19:14 < laxa> I think so
19:14 < laxa> No idea, nothing too for me.
19:14 < pause> Ok
19:46 < laxa> pause: bad news, server will be rebooted soon :(.
20:10 < o_be_one> pause, tu parles FR ?
20:30 < laxa> Me and pause are real life friends, and yes we are french
20:30 < laxa> we both did epitech !
20:50 < Nimda> Dummy 2 by Nigel just released on moderate at 2014-10-03 20:48
20:50 <@deen> o_be_one: why should I know Scorpio?
20:57 < o_be_one> cause we have talked about your and i think he knows you
20:57 < o_be_one> but he uses often different nick to stay anonymous -_-
20:58 <@deen> I'd be wary of him, I know he's hurt some people
20:58 < o_be_one> yes he's a little crazy -_-
21:02 < laxa> deen: I'll send you a fix on the latest released map, you can cheat it
21:03 < laxa> deen: uploaded
21:11 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
21:11 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
21:11 <@deen> laxa: a bad bug?
21:11 <@deen> need to reload all maps?
21:12 < laxa> you can shortcut the map at 2 differents places
21:12 < laxa> only 1 server has it loaded
21:12 <@deen> i see it on 7 servers
21:12 < laxa> well, I guess it should be better to reload it yeah
21:18 <@deen> done
21:33 < laxa> deen: oh, I have found another unsorted menu xD
21:33 < laxa> spec menu 
21:33 <@deen> fix it
21:33 < laxa> yeah I will
21:33 < laxa> tell me where it is rendered please :)
21:33 <@deen> spec menu?
21:33 < laxa> when you wanna spec a specific tea
21:33 < laxa> tee
21:33 <@deen> i made it to be sorted in the same way as scoreboard
21:34 <@deen> so you can easily remember at what position someone is
21:34 < laxa> ah yeah it is sorted
21:34 < laxa> but I had problems to find the guy I wanted to spec
21:35 <@deen> that's a problem in the scoreboard as well
21:35 <@deen> but i don't know what to do about it, since we want teams to be sorted, and good times to be on top, right?
21:36 < laxa> maybe just only in scoreboards
21:36 < laxa> well, there is only 1 scoreboard
21:36 <@deen> no, i like it in spec too
21:36 < laxa> well, then no change :)
21:36 <@deen> because then when you use the specnext and specprev buttons, you get the people in the same team first
21:36 < laxa> About that
21:36 < laxa> I feel like spec next / spec prev is too slow
21:36 < laxa> can it be changed ?
21:37 <@deen> once per second?
21:38 < laxa> Too slow for me :p.
21:38 < laxa> Just a minor thing, I should just use spec menu.
21:38 < laxa> But yeah, I think you should be able to spec next/spec prev without waiting at all.
21:39 <@deen> might be abusable to create a lot of traffic
21:39 <@deen> or high server load
21:39 <@deen> which is why it's spam protecte
21:39 <@deen> d
21:39 < laxa> ok
21:41 <@deen> once every 0.25 seconds is fine?
21:41 < laxa> It's better than 1 second.
21:41 < laxa> I guess it's enough yeah.
21:41 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/svkImg
21:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8c45d88 def: Allow 4 spectator mode changes per second
21:44 < laxa> WTF
21:44 < laxa> I think I am being ddosed !
21:48 < laxa> weird
21:48 < laxa> it was indeed detected as ddos
21:48 < laxa> everyone was thrown out of teamspeak
21:49 <@deen> hope it's not because you're hosting ddnet TS
21:49  * laxa slaps laxa_work around a bit with a large trout
21:49 < laxa> it only lasted 10 seconds
21:49 <@deen> but the protection isn't good enough either?
21:49 <@deen> @ online
21:49 < laxa> I really know what happened
21:50 < savander> ger have ddos?
21:50 < savander> or smth
21:50 < EastByte> deen: I still don't think there is a proper working ddos protection
21:50 <@deen> yes
21:50 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
21:50 <@deen> FRA was ddosed twice today
21:50 <@deen> guess now it's TS and GER on the list
21:50 < savander> woah
21:50 < savander> ye
21:50 < savander> but ts works
21:50 <@deen> and down gow the 150 players =/
21:51 < laxa> http://postimg.org/image/8kr51lra7/
21:51 < EastByte> udp misuse what?
21:51 <@deen> Not mitigated?
21:51 < EastByte> missuse sounds like ip spoofing or something
21:52 < laxa> Dunno, on my network activity, it only went to 30MB/s and lasted 10 seconds
21:52 <@deen> I think "misuse" just means "attack"
21:52 < EastByte> hm
21:52 < laxa> But maybe it was mitigated after that, no idea
21:53 < laxa> well
21:53 < laxa> I think no one can connect to my servers and teamspeak
21:53 < laxa> ok
21:53 <@deen> ts.ddnet.tw has 50% packet loss for me
21:53 < laxa> I am getting ddosed for real
21:53 < laxa> now
21:53 < laxa> lost ssh connection
21:53 < laxa> I saw a 1913.17MBit/s
21:54 < laxa> This one isn't detected yet
21:55 <@deen> which is a bit weird since i have 70% packet loss^^
21:55 < EastByte> well the link might be overused
21:56 < laxa> it's detected now
21:56 < laxa> ddos over
21:59 < laxa> well, I will know in 2 minutes I guess if their ddos protection is good
22:00 < laxa> but the first attack was so short it wasn't mitigated, but udp traffic was fucked apparently, don't know what happened
22:06 < laxa> !trace 188.26.121.252
22:07 < laxa> nimda broken cause of ddos :(
22:08 <@deen> poor nimda
22:10 < laxa> Wtf, the bot doesn't wanna load anymore
22:19 < laxa> hum
22:19 < laxa> I feel like my DNS resolution is fucked since DDOS
22:20 <@deen> maybe they still block udp
22:20 < laxa> dns resolution is UDP ?
22:20 <@deen> sure
22:21 < laxa> nimda doesn't reload, TS3 is down
22:21 < laxa> but teeworlds servers works
22:21 < laxa> and I can't ping anything
22:21 <@deen> try changing your dns server
22:21 < laxa> how to do that ? :p
22:21 <@deen> google?
22:21 < laxa> yes I do
22:21 <@deen> they say TS works again btw
22:21 < laxa> it's not launched
22:21 <@deen> they're on it
22:21 <@deen> speaking
22:22 < laxa> Wut ?
22:22 <@deen> maybe they just imagine it and ddnet.tw/status imagines it as well
22:23 < laxa> ok
22:23 < laxa> it's working
22:28 < savander> deen: 
22:28 < savander> come to us! :)
22:28 <@deen> never!
22:29 < savander> why?
22:29 < savander> :)
22:29 < savander> Cmon! 
22:32 <@deen> don't like teamspeak
22:33 < laxa> ok, my dns resolution is fucked, even with changed DNS server
22:33 <@deen> then probably online has some kind of dns/udp block active
22:34 < savander> deen: 
22:34 < savander> who cares, cmon!!
22:35 < savander> please! :c
22:36 <@deen> get laxa instead, he likes teamspeak
22:36 < savander> no
22:36 < savander> i want you :D
22:36 < laxa> lol
22:36 < laxa> deen: how come my teeworlds can work if udp is blocked ?
22:36 <@deen> "some kind"
22:37 <@deen> maybe they just block udp from certain ports, from which the attacks originated
22:37 <@deen> DNS and NTP I'd guess
22:46 < laxa> fuck, I can't find back their IRC server, I don't wanna be fucked till tomorrow...
22:54 < EastByte> lol
22:54 < laxa> ok fixed it thanks to their help
22:54 < EastByte> connected to ts and my client crashed
22:54 < laxa> !trace 188.26.121.252
22:54 < Nimda> 188.26.121.252's location: Targu-mures, Mures, Romania
22:54 < laxa> apparently the ddos was coming from here
22:55 <@deen> sounds like someone bought a cheap server in Romania
22:56 < laxa> Oct  3 21:56:12 laxadedi kernel: [828331.952744] UDP: short packet: From 188.26.121.252:38241 32121/608 to 195.154.72.184:80
22:56 < laxa> this is what I get in /var/log/kern.log
22:56 <@deen> that doesn't mean much
22:58 < laxa> still don't get why dns got fucked after the ddos
22:59 < laxa> they made me add their dns to /etc/network/interface
23:00 < laxa> can anyone try to connect to any ddracepro server and tell me if it works for them please ?
23:02 < o_be_one> !crach 8101 -f -t 20
23:02 < laxa> seems to work for me
