12:39 < Ryozuki> ddos
12:39 <@EastByte> yup
13:32 <@heinrich5991> it's usually only from a single machine, right?
13:50 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: most likely, one dedicated server is more than enough to trigger the "null-routing"
14:19 < grenadepro> hi guys , i need a little help about compile , how to build 64bit client on windows ?
14:20 < grenadepro> i mean whats the command ? like bam client_release
14:22 < Henningstone> are you using MinGW or Visual Studio?
14:23 < grenadepro> vs
14:24 < grenadepro> i have vs 2010 , 2012 , 2013
14:29 < Henningstone> Ok first of all, to compile 64-bit using VS you need to have a professional (payed) version of it
14:29 < Henningstone> the community version won't let you do that
14:30 < grenadepro> i have
14:30 < grenadepro> then ?
14:31 < Henningstone> Great! I have no clue how to tell VS to use a 64-bit environment, but to tell bam, you need to "set TARGET_PLATFORM=win64" and "set TARGET_ARCH=amd64" in your cmd
14:31 < Henningstone> I suppose these two variables can be set somewhere in VS's GUI, too
14:31 < grenadepro> ok
14:32 < grenadepro> For 64 Bit PCs: %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86
14:32 < Henningstone> sure it's 'x86' at the end there? Not x64 maybe?
14:33 < grenadepro> source : https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=9541
14:33 < grenadepro> im not sure
14:34 < Henningstone> Ah heh, yea that's a little bit confusing. This guide only aims towards compiling 32-bit teeworlds. If your Windows is 64-bit, you'll have two seperate Program Files folders, so that is why he mentioned that
14:35 < grenadepro> i dont know why there is no video on youtube for this :D !!!!
14:35 < grenadepro> so what ? i got confeused
14:36 < grenadepro> ok maybe its (x64)
14:36 < grenadepro> so what is next step ?
14:36 < Henningstone> I'd just try that, propably it does the trick already
14:37 < grenadepro> ok np im waiting
14:37 < Henningstone> so so you have set the 2 vars for bam and you have set up the 64-bit vs env. Now it would only be bam client_release left
14:39 < Henningstone> and maybe you want to put these 4 commands into a batchfile to simplify the process
14:39 < grenadepro> o_O are u sure ?
14:39 < Henningstone> it doesn't work?
14:39 < grenadepro> i remember somthing different
14:39 < grenadepro> like amd64 or ia32 ...
14:40 < grenadepro> i didnt test yet im learning
14:40 < Henningstone> I only remember vaguely, the last time I compiled Teeworlds using VS was 2 years ago... 
14:40 < grenadepro> i think it was like this %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" amd64
14:40 < grenadepro> haha :D
14:41 < Henningstone> just give it all a try, it won't explode :D
14:41 <@heinrich5991> grenadepro: you *could* try out the new cmake build system
14:41 < grenadepro> Henningstone: you use MinGW
14:41 <@heinrich5991> I can't guarantee that it works on 64bit windows though
14:41 < grenadepro> ?
14:41 < Henningstone> grenadepro: yap, I'm using MinGW
14:41 < Henningstone> don't have a paid VS...
14:41 < grenadepro> heinrich5991: i dont know what is that !
14:42 < grenadepro> Henningstone: i dont know how to compile with MinGW
14:42 < grenadepro> is there any toturial video ?
14:42 < grenadepro> and did you build 64bit version with MinGW ?
14:43 <@heinrich5991> grenadepro: download https://cmake.org/ and execute it. select the ddnet directory as source dir, and some new (empty) folder as build dir. then click generate and you'll have a VS project
14:43 <@heinrich5991> (that is, if it works)
14:43 < grenadepro> cool heinrich5991 
14:44 <@heinrich5991> feel free to ask questions, if you need help with any of the steps
14:44 < grenadepro> heinrich5991: another question is : is there possible build 64bit client in windows 32bit ? or its need windows 64bit too ?
14:45 < grenadepro> tnx heinrich5991 
14:45 <@heinrich5991> grenadepro: is there still 32 bit windows somewhere?
14:45 < grenadepro> :D
14:45 <@heinrich5991> (I haven't seen one in a while)
14:45 < grenadepro> i have windows 98 tooooooooooooooooo :D
14:45 <@heinrich5991> :o ddnet runs there??
14:46 < grenadepro> i dont think so i have cd installer
14:46 <@EastByte> microsoft wants you to pay to compile a program for the arch windows is running on?
14:46 < grenadepro> :P
14:46 <@heinrich5991> I don't think so
14:47 <@EastByte> I think it was like this a while ago
14:47 < grenadepro> Henningstone: are u there ?
14:47 <@EastByte> but they should have fixed that
14:47 < Henningstone> grenadepro: still here
14:48 < grenadepro> did you build 64bit version with mingw ?
14:48 < Henningstone> grenadepro: yes I do
14:49 < grenadepro> hmm is there any tutorial video how to compile teeworlds with mingw ?
14:49 < Henningstone> you basically just need to install it, it will work pretty much the same for 32 and 64 bit
14:50 < Henningstone> I think someone from the ddnet team can help you better there, though. They are also using mingw to compile 64 versions afaik
14:50 <@heinrich5991> if cmake works, it's probably easier
15:02 < grenadepro> which vs better i have install ? Microsoft Office Plus 2013 , Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Final, Microsoft Visual C++ 2013, Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
15:02 <@heinrich5991> install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
15:30 < Henningstone> wow, windows is being really weird
15:30 < Henningstone> I have tried doing a cmake for VS15 although I don't have it installed, and now the ddnet/build folder is completely locked, I can't even access it with an administrator cmd anymore (says "Zugriff verweigert")
15:38 < Henningstone> uhm ok, something appears to be really broken. I can't even access the folder with a system-user shell. Let's just... restart it? xd
16:21 < Ryozuki> Henningstone, visual studio it's free
16:21 < Ryozuki> even the enterprise version
16:22 < Henningstone> Oh, nice to hear... since when?
16:22 < Ryozuki> always?
16:22 < Ryozuki> vs community has been always free
16:22 < Ryozuki> and it ofc can comile
16:22 < Ryozuki> compile
16:22 < Henningstone> even 64 bit?
16:23 < Ryozuki> yea
16:23 < Ryozuki> it would be ridiculous if it couldn't xD
16:23 < Henningstone> I know VS community is free, but I though it couldn't compile 64 bit
16:23 < Ryozuki> it can
16:23 < Ryozuki> also debug and release versions
16:23 < Henningstone> yea that of course
16:23 < Henningstone> well I'm sitting here on my linux machine not giving a shit about VS, so don't judge me please ;)
16:24 < Ryozuki> well then you shouldn't say smth about it if you don't know c:
16:24 < Ryozuki> (sry if it sounds rude, i didn't mean to say that way)
16:25 < Henningstone> True, I have used windows and VS a couple of years ago, so I told him everything I remembered
16:31 < grenadepro> Ryozuki: im still dont know how to build 64bit
16:31 < grenadepro> do you know how ?
16:37 < grenadepro> guys comment this line https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L112
16:57 < grenadepro> maybe i need to download bam 0.5 and compile it with make_win64_msvc.bat ?
16:57 < Henningstone> that doesn't make a difference
16:57 < grenadepro> ahhhhhhhhhh
16:58 < grenadepro> if you can explain me how to compile 64bit with mingw , i will downlod it.
16:59 < Henningstone> I can even send you the batch script that I'm using for it
16:59 < grenadepro> gooood
17:00 < grenadepro> ok i try to find a download link
17:01 < Henningstone> https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download
17:02 < grenadepro> tnx
17:05 < grenadepro> i must install it with default settings ?
17:06 < grenadepro> what version architecture and threads i must choose ØŸ
17:09 < Henningstone> I have installed it with i686/posix (default settings)
17:09 < Henningstone> but maybe someone here things that's a bad idea and x86_67/win32 would be better...?
17:10 < Henningstone> *thinks
17:10 < Henningstone> *64 
17:16 < grenadepro> ok
17:16 < grenadepro> its done
17:16 < grenadepro> next step ?
17:17 < Henningstone> have you got something like "C:\mingw-w64\i686-6.2.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0\mingw32\i686-w64-mingw32\bin" now?
17:18 < grenadepro> yes also i have added it to the windows path
17:18 < grenadepro> using this tutorial https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11811
17:19 < grenadepro> do i need bam too ?
17:19 < Henningstone> just to verify it work, try 'gcc --version' in a cmd
17:21 < grenadepro> not recognized
17:21 < grenadepro>  i must run it in its directory?
17:23 < grenadepro>  in its folder command works
17:23 < grenadepro> but in global not works !
17:23 < Henningstone> "C:\mingw-w64\i686-6.2.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0\mingw32\bin" is in your path, too?
17:25 < grenadepro>  i think the path is not added
17:26 < grenadepro>  i must add it in enviroments system variables path ?
17:27 < Henningstone> you must logout and login to your windows account to apply the path changes
17:29 < grenadepro> not work
17:30 < Henningstone> I'll send you my script
17:31 < grenadepro> ok
17:32 < grenadepro> done i added it manully
17:32 < Henningstone> ok
17:32 < grenadepro> manually^
17:34 < grenadepro> what the next step :S ?
17:34 < Henningstone> well have you got success with 'gcc --version' now?
17:35 < grenadepro> ye
17:36 < Henningstone> assuming you have also gotten bam in the meantime, you should be able to do a 'bam client_release' now 
17:36 < grenadepro> http://pastebin.com/6za1fNCF
17:37 < Henningstone> yea that's alright
17:39 < grenadepro> you mean ,,, i must compile 64 bit of bam ? first
17:40 < Henningstone> no, you can use the 32-bit bam that you already have
17:40 < Henningstone> it won't make a difference
17:41 < grenadepro> ok then how i must tell bam to compile it in 64 bit for me !
17:42 < Henningstone> just start my script and call bam from there
17:42 < Henningstone> it will already have told it
17:44 < Henningstone> (you can verify that by doing 'echo %TARGET_PLATFORM%', it should give you "win64")
17:51 < grenadepro> sorrry Henningstone i didnt got right ! can i choose the compiler when running bam release?
17:51 < Henningstone> in the config.lua you can change compiler.driver from 'cl' to 'gcc'
19:14 < grenadepro> Henningstone: tnx for teach me finally work
19:14 < Henningstone> well done
19:15 < grenadepro> im try to compile it with vs (gcc) too its done but i got this error idk why ? 
19:15 < grenadepro> http://pastebin.com/fDLjeQta
19:17 < Henningstone> could be that you run into https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/423 there, not sure
19:22 < grenadepro> idk maybe deen know whats the problem
19:24 <@deen> wrong path?
19:24 <@deen> otherwise no idea
19:27 < grenadepro> i didnt change anything (original source)
19:27 <@deen> oh, i was reading Henningstone's issue, not yours
19:27 <@deen> that means it's a wrong file
19:28 <@deen> you cn check what's going on with libopusfile-0.dll, maybe it's empty
19:28 <@deen> otherwise it might be for 32bit
19:28 < Henningstone> that's why I pointed to that issue, maybe someone just dropped in a 32-bit dll into the 64-bit folder
19:29 <@deen> yeah, that would explain t
19:29 <@deen> it
19:30 < grenadepro> so... ?
19:31 < Henningstone> Give me 5 minutes and I'll try if I can compile ddnet in my windows vm
19:31 <@deen> libopusfile-0.dll:   PE32+ executable (DLL) (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
19:31 <@deen> looks correct to me, not sure
19:32 < Henningstone> oh uhm, grenadepro was that problem now with mingw or VS?
19:34 < grenadepro> mingw
19:34 < Henningstone> ok nice, I'll try 
19:37 < Henningstone> oh wow, I'm getting exactly the same problem
19:37 <@deen> try with another libopusfile-0.dll
19:37 < grenadepro> deen: how i can set vs to compile in x64
19:37 <@deen> no idea!
19:37 <@deen> never used vs
19:39 < grenadepro> any link ?
19:39 < grenadepro> for 64 bit version
19:49 <@deen> don't have one, google or someone here needs to compile it
19:51 < Henningstone> deen: going back an arbitrary number of 50 commits makes it work, so it has only recently been broken
19:56 <@deen> Henningstone: interesting
19:56 <@deen> but we never changed libopusfile-0.dll
19:56 < Henningstone> quite interesting actually, because nobody touched that file
19:56 <@deen> so something in the build system changed
19:56 < Henningstone> yea
20:05 < Henningstone> Oh apologies, I'm an idiot. I reopened the shell at some point, which switched back to 32-bit compiling
20:07 < Henningstone> not even going back 100 commits fixes anything...
20:12 < grenadepro> Henningstone: i have a little headache , i will be back tomorrow , thanks for your time
20:12 < Henningstone> no problem... after all it still doesn't work ._.
20:14 < grenadepro> np we will conitune tomorrow , im not good at  the moment sorry ill go to sleep
20:14 < grenadepro> thanks anyway Henningstone bb
20:14 < grenadepro> thanks deen , heinrich5991 bye
20:22 < Henningstone> deen: must be something wrong with our compiler setup, because cross-compiling the 64-bit version works just fine
20:25 <@deen> or something wrong in bam
20:25 <@deen> using the wrong lib actually
21:29 < Henningstone> Ok, got it. deen: there was nothing wrong with ddnet. I've just installed version of mingw-w64 with different settings (x86_64-6.3.0-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev1 instead of i686-6.2.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0) and now it finished without errors.
21:33 <@deen> yeah, i always used seh i think
21:33 <@deen> and i686 sounds like 32bit
21:34 < Henningstone> unfortunately the latter at the default settings, so if one has no clue what all that means he'll just click continue and install the wrong thing :/
21:34 < Henningstone> *are 
21:34 <@deen> hm, and why is it building with 64bit using a 32bit compiler?
21:34 <@deen> there should be a warning way before linking
