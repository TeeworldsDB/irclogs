14:55 < o_be_one> hello
14:55 < o_be_one> i've to ping again deen EastByte
14:56 <@deen> yes?
14:56 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
14:56 < o_be_one> hello :)
14:57 < o_be_one> well deen as ive said some days ago, i've to move can.ddnet
14:57 <@deen> you only pinged EastByte last time, so I conveniently ignored it :P
14:58 <@deen> I guess I can move CAN to the new server if you think we should keep it running
14:58 < o_be_one> ahah yes, yesterday, but not 5 days ago :p no problem ^^
14:58 <@deen> it's the least popular DDNet server I think
14:58 < o_be_one> there's not mutch players, US works well, but if you think it's useful for DDNet (like telling that we have mutch servers) i've no problem to give you a new can host
14:59 <@deen> sure, it doesn't hurt. the only thing I'm worried about is the cost for you
15:00 < o_be_one> yes i understand, as you like
15:01 <@deen> if you send me the info about the new server, I'll set it up
15:14 < o_be_one> done :). Ok more news about ger2 ?
15:14 < o_be_one> since ive changed arbor settings
15:17 <@deen> the only thing I notice is that ssh still takes 3 min
15:18 <@deen> didn't check anything else, you should ask EastByte 
15:19 <@heinrich5991> 3min to connect?
15:20 <@deen> yes
15:20 <@heinrich5991> if it's the tcp that is behaving poorly, you could try using mosh (uses UDP, except for initial session establishment)
15:20 <@deen> and rewrite all other programs to use udp as well?^^
15:20 <@heinrich5991> no ^^
15:21 <@heinrich5991> just to fight that particular problem :)
15:21 <@deen> it's just a symptom I'd say
15:32 < fstd> deen: i've had similar problems in the past (although not as bad as 3 min) and it turned out to be a problem of name resolving on the remote site.  might wanna check /etc/nsswitch.conf whether it attempts any methods that are not really available
15:33 <@deen> fstd: interesting. I believe it's the firewall doing funny stuff, also dropping my tcp connections after a few hours
15:34 <@deen> nsswitch.conf looks totally normal, same as on other servers
15:34 <@deen> but hey, name resolution doesn't work^^
15:35 < fstd> heh
15:35 <@deen> wait no, it works. I thought you have to restart some service to reread nsswitch.conf
15:35 <@deen> I just disabled dns lookup to test
15:35 < o_be_one> fstd: you right, it's often an issue with name resolve
15:36 < fstd> nsswitch.conf is consulted directly by glibc i think
15:36 < o_be_one> but i get dropped on my own vps on the same host after a while
15:36 < o_be_one> hello fstd btw, do you have some news from XXLTomate ?
15:36 < o_be_one> maybe i'll mail him
15:37 <@deen> fstd: strace confirms :)
15:37 < fstd> :)
15:37 < fstd> o_be_one: no, haven't talked to him in a while
15:38 <@heinrich5991> why do you ask? :)
15:53 < o_be_one> heinrich5991: your question is for me ?
15:53 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:53 < o_be_one> cause XXLTomate is a friend, and he helped me a lot when i've started with blockers :)
15:53 < o_be_one> long time i didnt get news from him
16:09 < Paszczak> hey guys I got a problem. When I compile the lastest ddnet on windows 7 64 bit, this shows 
16:09 < Paszczak> LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'libopusfile-0.lib' bam.exe: 'link DDNet.exe' error 1181 bam.exe: error: a build step failed
16:10 <@deen> you're using the bundled opus libs I guess?
16:10 < Paszczak> yes
16:10 <@deen> I see that the libopusfile-0.lib is missing for windows x86_64, oops
16:10 <@deen> I thought that wasn't necessary, hmm
16:11 <@deen> Or I didn'T know how to get that file because I built it myself?
16:11 <@deen> with win32 it should work
16:11 < Paszczak> yea it works
16:12 <@deen> Ah, you're building with Visual studio?
16:12 < Paszczak> you mean do I use cl or mingw
16:12 <@deen> yes
16:12 < Paszczak> I use cl
16:12 <@deen> ok, that's the reason I don't see that error
16:12 <@deen> Do you know how to get a .lib file?
16:12 < Paszczak> on
16:13 < Paszczak> no*
16:14 <@deen> someone with the same problem: http://www.enchantedage.com/opusfile-0.6-for-visual-studio
16:15 < Paszczak> visual-studio-compatile-opusfile-0.6-win32.zip the name of the attachement suggests thats not what we are looking for
16:15 < o_be_one> hey Paszczak whatsup !
16:15 <@deen> yeah right
16:15 < Paszczak> hey dude, whats up
16:16 < o_be_one> not mutch, it seems that r0x.TW is dying, i'm waiting for a fix from EastByte and have to change server bin to latest DDNet
16:16 < Paszczak> deen, I can stay on win32 but just asked if there's any fast fix or if you even know about it
16:17 < Paszczak> obeone what about baam?
16:17 <@deen> Paszczak: I'm just checking my logs, I built that 64bit opus myself, so I think no .lib file was created. My guess is that someone would have to compile these with cl and then get the .lib file
16:18 < o_be_one> Someone just doesnt care, he stole the map and hosted it. Maybe he didn't know that this map was made for r0x.TW ... originally, from Bip.
16:18 < Paszczak> deen: okay, i'll stay on 32 bit version
16:18 < o_be_one> but  when i'll have the time and motivation to get back r0x.TW to the top, i'll do it, actually i'm just a little too busy ^^
16:19 < Paszczak> o_be_one: yea that sucks,i don't know why it's more popular than original baam
16:19 < o_be_one> oh, it's just cause i have some bugs on the ddr0x bin i think so they exploit it to drop players
16:20 < o_be_one> no mutch people is really fair on TW x) they dont care, they just want to think that they are so pro and popular with their servers
16:20 <@deen> Paszczak: I made an issue in case someone wants to fix it: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/423
16:21 < Paszczak> deen: nice, thanks
16:24 < laxadedi> deen: all servers are on debian ?
16:24 <@deen> laxadedi: no, a few on CentOS
16:24 < laxadedi> 0day pretty darn violent got releaed, you should update asap
16:24 < laxadedi> https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.fr/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html
16:42 <@deen> ok, thanks
16:42 <@deen> reading that reminds me that I removed a few coredumps from ssh client randomly crashing a few days ago. Maybe I should look closer at crashes, oops
16:53 <@deen> CAN running on new server
16:59 < o_be_one> nice :)
16:59 < o_be_one> so i can kill the old one ?
17:00 <@deen> yes
17:00 < o_be_one> ty
17:02 <@deen> nah, thanks to you for offering the server
17:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timakro opened pull request #424: made fading border in menu more customizeable (master...master) https://git.io/vg5iv
17:15 <@deen> Installing GTK on Windows is becoming weirder and weirder with time
17:16 <@deen> To install GTK+3 on Windows you need msys2 which contains pacman, the package manager from Archlinux
17:29 <@heinrich5991> gtk3's windows support is lacking
17:29 <@heinrich5991> should probably use something different if you want to target windows
17:31 <@heinrich5991> on another note: I like msys2 a lot saner than cygwin
17:31 <@heinrich5991> s/saner/better
17:31 <@deen> heinrich5991: so, what to use?
17:32 <@heinrich5991> qt is good, if you use python or c++
17:32 <@deen> I'm trying to get ghc-vis updated again. Back then I saw no good alternative
17:32 <@deen> Well, it's Haskell
17:33 <@heinrich5991> also used wxwidgets for a small application (from python)
17:33 <@deen> I tried in SDL2 but then you lose all the GUI support and just have a raw window
17:33 <@deen> otherwise html/css/js :P
17:38 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://wiki.haskell.org/Applications_and_libraries/GUI_libraries#HsQML
17:39 <@heinrich5991> also wxWidgets on that page
17:39 <@heinrich5991> however, I have never done any UI in haskell, so I can't comment on how usable they are
17:40 <@deen> too late anyway, don't want to work on that anymore. I'll just submit all the fixes I can find for Windows and OSX gtk and be done with it^^
17:41 <@heinrich5991> yea, porting an existing application isn't worth it probably
17:41 <@deen> I just hope never to write a GUI thingy again
17:43 <@deen> Also, damn compile-times in Haskell!
17:52 <@heinrich5991> go has fast compile times :P
17:52 <@heinrich5991> (i.e. that's what you get if you wish for fast compile times ^^)
18:04 <@deen> Nim has faster compile times than go
18:04 <@deen> :P
18:05 <@deen> so you get some nice compile-time stuff (not rust or haskell level) and still have fast compilation
18:06 <@heinrich5991> nim is faster than go? wow :)
18:06 <@heinrich5991> (in compile times I mean)
18:07 <@deen> doing hindley-milner type inference or borrow checking is probably not so fast
18:07 <@deen> well, depends on what you compile of course, I only ported one Go application to Nim, so my sample size is 1: http://hookrace.net/blog/porting-nes-go-nim/#comparison-of-go-and-nim
18:07 <@heinrich5991> well, C typically has slower compile times than go
18:07 <@heinrich5991> because of the whole header stuff
18:07 <@heinrich5991> afk
