10:41 < bridge_> <meloƞ> ||why did i call my damn wiki account melonew|| - thanks.
10:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> do you use a password manager? I strongly suggest using one. it's safer; and you won't forget your username
10:43 < bridge_> <meloƞ> never really thought about it, i have 5 passwords i would consider pretty strong and for different purposes :D - but i do forget my Username quite often - might want to get one
10:43 < bridge_> <meloƞ> any recommendations? :P
10:43 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @rafael8192 which mod are you working on that has jails?
10:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> bitwarden
10:45 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ i use pass since you are not a windows user anymore its a good fit for you https://www.passwordstore.org/
10:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> irc shaming is strictly forbidden in this channel
10:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the bitwarden server isn't proprietrary btw, ChillerDragon
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didn't we have that discussion before?
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so u dont see melons reactions to your comment on irc chiller?
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's really really sad
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> milky wrote a bridge
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that bridges reactions
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what has this guy not written yet
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> XD
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but idk if he ever wants to finish and ship it -.-
10:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwarden
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heino send backend repo src code
10:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/bitwarden/server
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> <url>
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> trick by teero
10:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did they go open src recently?
10:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, been that way forever
10:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why vaultwarden then?
10:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> maybe you're remembering something else?
10:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because people don't like the technology choices of the official server
10:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no way xd
10:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean its C#
10:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it requires a MS SQL server IIRC
10:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats basically closed source xd
10:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but didnt't we have that convo already?
10:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was it maybe onepass? idk you always were bitwarden fan irrc
10:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure if I'd call it a "fan"
10:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am a "pass" fan 
10:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> fan sounds like someone who couldn't be convinced of a technically superior solution
10:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and proud
10:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes thats me
10:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > 2021-02-22.log:20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 also bitwarden. can be selfhosted, there's a third-party impl for the server
10:56 < bridge_> <rafael8192> wdym?
10:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat u working on
10:56 < bridge_> <rafael8192> like custom gametype ?
10:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u said jail
10:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and db
10:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat u working on
10:56 < bridge_> <rafael8192> oh

10:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont see replies
10:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you were talking about persistence i call it db dont go all details on me
10:57 < bridge_> <rafael8192> like u write jail <id> <reason>
10:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just leak what you are working on -.-
10:57 < bridge_> <rafael8192> player teleports to a jail on the map
10:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
10:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in what project u need that
10:57 < bridge_> <Peakies> I think it's about put players to jail to prevent them from playing on map must be block mod
10:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or city
10:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or something unexpected
10:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats why i am curious xd
10:58 < bridge_> <Peakies> like using jail as punishment
10:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep
10:59 < bridge_> <Peakies> well I did that i thought maybe he want use it in that way too 😄
10:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagawd rafael xd
10:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat u working on 
10:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> :kek:
10:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ffs im on edge
10:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just tell me
10:59 < bridge_> <Peakies> 😄
10:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> XD
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO chiller
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now it looks like heinrich pinged learath
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice scammer
11:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hehe
11:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i worked on command jail which puts a player to a jail on the map. He cant kill in a jail and cant spec. If he leave and join back he will put to jail again
11:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> it is just punishment :kek:
11:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes yes
11:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but which mod?
11:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats the project name?
11:03 < bridge_> <rafael8192> 💀
11:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> shatap
11:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sto mod
11:07 < bridge_> <rafael8192> so i need to open ports?
11:07 < bridge_> <rafael8192> and sv_register 1
11:07 < bridge_> <altesrind> used to
11:07 < bridge_> <Peakies> yes
11:07 < bridge_> <Peakies> you can go with sv_register 0 too it's just for register server on masters
11:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> metin2 player here
11:07 < bridge_> <Peakies> me too now just playing for fun
11:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> don't have much time to play wow
11:08 < bridge_> <altesrind> race, class, lvl?
11:08 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah me too
11:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Rust is also a normal word. I see nothing wrong with these stats
11:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> way more rare word
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> `grep -ri "jupeyy_keks.*vulkan" | wc -l`
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pls
11:13 < bridge_> <learath2> 🙃
11:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> makes sense. you mean n=2 though
11:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 29
11:13 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes typo, sorry just woke up
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> shut
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no way
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> fake stats
11:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `grep -riE "jup(p|e|s).*vulkan" | wc -l`
11:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `588`
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> try Jupstar ✪
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> still no way
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oh wow
11:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats basically all ur nicks
11:13 < bridge_> <learath2> Try jup.*vulkan
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i fall behind ryo so much
11:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jup is also a normal word xd
11:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> only in german
11:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how does this rust no lifer mentioned it 4k times already
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what does it mean
11:16 < bridge_> <learath2> You arent propagandizing effectively
11:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it means "yup" ^^
11:16 < bridge_> <learath2> Yup
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `grep -riE "(jup|jap|keks).*vulkan" | wc -l`
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `633`
11:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> disgusting
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `grep -riE "vulkan" | wc -l`
11:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `1553`
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in rust we trust
11:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> not much 😢
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato mentioned "C" 39053 times xd
11:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in vulkan we tvulkan
11:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in vulkan we tvulkan
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121377
11:16 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: how many times u mentioned bash? Xd
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 296
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.LazyLock.html
11:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> rust is also contained in "trust", probably other words, too
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> crust
11:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wonder why they felt the need to implement it. it's trivially achievable using a `OnceCell` already
11:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why is it in standard anyway
11:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to many global var enjoyers in this world
11:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wonder why they felt the need to implement it. it's trivially achievable using a `OnceCell`/`OnceLock` already
11:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Try with `\bC(?:99|11|20|23|2x)?\b`
11:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat you are top10 neovim enjoyers
11:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Hell yeah

11:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Chillerdragon what's the top5?
11:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> somehow my paste tool is stuck xd
11:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i dont have screenshots on mac

11:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> those are the top10 xd
11:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> thanks for your password
11:19 < bridge_> <learath2> Excellent
11:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what happend to .2
11:20 < bridge_> <learath2> Do the C one properly
11:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 65 Ryozuki

11:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `grep -ri "neovim" | cut -d'<' -f3 | cut -d'>' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr ` is probably flawed in many ways

11:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg heinrich spammer
11:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (from the base64 that ChillerDragon posted)
11:20 < bridge_> <meloƞ> still below jupsi
11:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato how to do C`
11:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean " C "
11:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or word boundaries maybe
11:21 < bridge_> <learath2> I sent the regex
11:21 < bridge_> <learath2> `\bC(?:99|11|20|23|2x)?\b`
11:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does that work with grep -E ?
11:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Good question. Only god himself knows what subset of regex works on what engine
11:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> < Learath2> should be at C:\Python25
11:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> windows enjoyer
11:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
11:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon>  < Learath2> bam -c all; bam client_release does that get you python errors ?
11:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bam enjoyer
11:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> < Learath2> [](){} fits quite well to C++
11:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C++ enjoyer
11:23 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, perhaps \b isn't really the best here
11:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ] <Learath2> c'est un mystère 😛
11:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fromage enjoyer
11:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <Learath2> I want to go from H to A, B, C, D. I understand that there are prescribed forms for figuring out possible A, B, C, D. I'm curious how one figures out one of these themselves
11:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> alphabet
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just try c with spaces
11:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ] <Learath2>     c.acquire().await?.begin().await
11:24 < bridge_> <learath2> But that loses sentences thay start and end with c
11:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then add those too
11:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf is there an emoji?
11:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but isnt on irc the text never at start
11:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and when would u add c at the end of sentence
11:25 < bridge_> <learath2> My favourite programming language is C

11:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that looks smooth
11:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like almost no false positives
11:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the `^` is unlikely to do anything good since the nickname is in front

11:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wtf
11:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> uwu?
11:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `.` is a wildcard, ChillerDragon
11:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this catches `some_identifier`
11:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah right
11:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just like `-.-` matches `automat-o-ton` or whatever
11:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok only 151 ._.
11:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and 279 -.-
11:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 199 uwu/owo xd

11:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and afterwards create a chillerbot that accepts regex requests
11:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😄
11:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and created top10
11:36 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd

11:38 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea idk how to code a non bugged grep
11:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw ripgrep, which is made with rust, is faster
11:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its bad
11:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it always misses stuff
11:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you wanna catch all grep is better
11:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
11:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> probably only because his terminal runs using vulkan vulkan vulkan
11:39 < bridge_> <learath2> You have more btw including replies
11:39 < bridge_> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244223408099561543/image0.jpg?ex=665454d9&is=66530359&hm=935077f0a917066d97f0376e82d15009b7157cd4e9a0283cb62b83ed0bfcfb6f&
11:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have had many incidents where grep would find more while grepping logs
11:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there's also the `mentions:` keyword for discord search
11:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> learath might be the most mentioned person on this server
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ripgrep doesnt do backtracking by default iirc
11:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> interesting
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> can u show a proof
11:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 14k times, followed by ryo with 13k
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller
11:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 10 more times to mention ryo to hit 14k

12:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> last time i got bamboolzed by rg was a while ago
12:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1716717807.png
12:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1716717848.png
12:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> when top10
12:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok it might be gitignore stuff this time but i remember some day my log parser broke i swapped rg with grep and it worked again
12:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ send cmd i run it
12:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> grep top10 ddnet
12:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?xd
12:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude i broke hot reloading again
12:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i am atm cleaning up all those hacks
12:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i may have copy pasted vulkan code without reading it xd
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just code it new from scratch
12:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vulkan? xd
12:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with all new your experience
12:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes that too xd
12:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean ur hot reload stuff
12:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh you mean my thing
12:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is barley any code yet -.-
12:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it worked yesterday
12:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> don't make me sad
12:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i made it work again :D 
12:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was because i copy patasad from some vulkan header
12:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> without reading it xd
12:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also with crypto now
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> imagine touching vulkan headers when doing server side stuff
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
12:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :D 
12:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i liked their visbibilty prepropressor thingies
12:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> propressor lmao
12:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because next up is passing pipeline
12:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so far the state is only works on my machine
12:36 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8318
12:37 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omgawd it has conflicts
12:40 < bridge_> <reitw> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ-25-pRhpY
12:40 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:14 < bridge_> <zhn> could be supported but only for new clients
13:15 < bridge_> <zhn> will break ux for old client/non-compilant players
13:39 < bridge_> <louis> I'm curious to see what the current % of players on updated clients vs non-updated clients is nowadays
13:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> me too, ping deen he has the stats xd
13:46 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> last stats i saw were a high amount of users being up to date
13:46 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that is caused by auto update feature in the client and also the high amount of steam enjoyers
13:48 < bridge_> <louis> the amnt of backwards compatability in this game is kind of insane to me
13:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but tbh ur feature request doesn't sound very trivial. how would prediction work with it?
13:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how does the client make sure it can back up in case wrong tiles were written (network wise this would at least need in-order reliable packets from the server)
13:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what are update limits, can the server just easily dos the client?
13:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's completely useless
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we can easily force players to update by dropping old clients
13:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we have vital messages
13:49 < bridge_> <louis> id imagine tile updates wouldn't take as much data as tee updates really
13:49 < bridge_> <louis> although full map updates would have to be sent so in that case it could get pretty heavy
13:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah tee only has x and y
13:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a tile has x/y/type/layer/group/flags
13:50 < bridge_> <louis> it definitely isn't trivial
13:50 < bridge_> <louis> in my mind most map updates would be triggered by teammates standing on switches, etc. so it would have as much prediction as those actions have prediction
13:50 < bridge_> <louis> and yes i think in-order packets would be the most tricky part of it
13:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vital should cover that
13:51 < bridge_> <louis> ah
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think what you request would work with dd-pg's rendering wasm modules
13:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you see my poc @louis ?
13:51 < bridge_> <louis> x, y, angle, shooting, current weapon, emote etc
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but prediction chilller?
13:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it worked flawlessly
13:51 < bridge_> <louis> yeah ChillerDragon
13:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wdym prediction jupsti?
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without prediction that feature would be a step back
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> client side prediction
13:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it has
13:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you see the clip?
13:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did u already implement luis idea?
13:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
13:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> epyc
13:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> fast boi
13:52 < bridge_> <louis> yeah the poc looks pretty nice tbh
13:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no jupsti im not fast
13:52 < bridge_> <louis> but at the same time i feel like a change to the shape of the mapfile itself would make stuff like this much simpler too
13:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it didnt take me too long but it was not because of louis but because i wanted that since forever
13:53 < bridge_> <louis> maybe that's asking too much 😅
13:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666
13:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here the clip @Jupstar ✪ 
13:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client calls Collision()->SetTile so it has prediction
13:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice so how does the client react if the prediction was wrong?
13:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how does it recover from that
13:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah you mean like if the client hits a wall server side where the client client side thinks there is void?
13:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i don't think it has to recover from such state
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if the client hits a switch and removes tiles but it actually didnt happen
13:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as soon as the server informs it about the tile it should apply the new tile instantly
13:54 < bridge_> <louis> how does prediction work for that with doors
13:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it will bug 
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and if u have 300 ping?
13:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea same as with doors i guess
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> doors can simply be part of the snapshot
13:55 < bridge_> <louis> tbh u can't expect prediction to be playable on 300 ping
13:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your client gets bugged through
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for map files this isnt as easy as it would need the whole map
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> doors are rendered on fly
13:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not buffered
13:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not about seeing others predicted
13:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> client side prediction also is for local tee
13:56 < bridge_> <louis> ah ye
13:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i understand what you mean jopsti
13:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i was not planning it for doors anyways thats a louis thing
13:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i only wanted live map editor and minetee
13:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i like that
13:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nothing that gets into official ddnet rank gameplay so heinrich can not complain about breaking backcompat
13:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's just not trivial 😄
13:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so far the only problem i know is demo skipping
13:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what heinrich pointed out
13:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i am not too sure about the diff format heinrich suggested mapfile chunks
13:57 < bridge_> <louis> hmm i don't see what makes running into a nonexistent tile wall different than a nonexistent door wall
13:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> basically what chiller just said
13:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because it is in the snapshot
13:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u skip demo u need to reupload the whole map file
13:58 < bridge_> <louis> why cant u just send tile diffs in snapshot too
13:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for doors it's simply the current doors in the snapshot
13:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but you skip the diffs
13:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on demo skip
13:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but u need to track ALL tile diffs
13:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that ever existed
13:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> doors are simply a list of current doors
13:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666#issuecomment-1983414934
13:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat you think about dis jopsti?
13:59 < bridge_> <louis> hm true
13:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, maybe demos simply don't work with this kind of games
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do demos exist in minecraft?
14:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> demo skipping*
14:00 < bridge_> <louis> i guess i'm thinking from a ddnet gameplay perspective as in tees won't be adding tiles to the map themselves, everything would already be predetermined in the editor
14:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> except, as always, for the players who can't update easily. android client (in the works), custom clients, unsupported OSs
14:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> minecraft mods have replays yes
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> drop them
14:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk if they have a skip
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 99% of players profit
14:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the others are not important
14:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich supporting the bot devs who are too lazy to solve git conflicts axaxax
14:01 < bridge_> <louis> why not just send lightweight tile changes in the snapshot and heavier ones without predictions
14:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that would actually be a lot easier to support
14:02 < bridge_> <louis> like basically if you just have a switch that toggles a group of tiles active or not active then that's super easy for client side prediction
14:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @louis you mean keep ALL tile changes in EVERY snapshot?
14:02 < bridge_> <louis> but if you're going minetee route, that's definitely not
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah if u know all toggable tiles in advance it's different for sure
14:02 < bridge_> <louis> i was thinking of these tile swaps more as ddnet doors, when you apply it to minetee-like gamemodes i realize its less viable
14:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but at least for minetee it would not work ig
14:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that works, but then it's: we can easily force some players to update and some to stop playing the game by dropping support for old versions
14:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure konsti would love to explore the new possibilties of bugs that happen when you can stuck a tee in a wall xd
14:03 < bridge_> <louis> why not if the tee is stuck in a nonexistent tile or vise versa, the server just resends the updated tile information in a small radius around the tee position
14:05 < bridge_> <louis> or idk. send small batches of snapshots depending on the tee's position
14:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ idk if snapshots even help
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what snapshots?
14:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with prediction
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ?
14:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the make sure that tee and tile positions are sent together yes
14:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the client still predicts in between snapshots
14:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and netmessages should arrive as fast as snapshots
14:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have no context about wtf u talk about xD
14:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you said for prediction the map changes should be in the snap so they are as good as doors
14:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not sure if that is true
14:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think 300 ping is bad either way
14:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and 40 ping is good either way
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i never said anything about network detail for map changes, except that they need to be reliable
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and in order
14:08 < bridge_> <louis> u can never predict if another tee places a tile right on ur face
14:08 < bridge_> <louis> but u should be able to predict for example if a deep'ed tee falls onto a switch that activates new tiles
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes, in a minecraft like mod it's not really ez
14:10 < bridge_> <louis> i definitely don't know tw code esp netcode as much so i'm probably just yapping xd
14:10 < bridge_> <louis> but i dont see whats wrong with if simply re-sending all tile information in like a 10-tile radius to the tee if the client and server are mismatched
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @louis.place ur version where u prepare it in editor is defs realistic
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs then it's just on/off in the snapshot
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's basically like laser doors then
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but we all know terraria 2.0 is a mod of ddnet
14:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> opsi seems like i have a bug in my js somewhere
14:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> webchat completly killed my firefox -.-
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> does it show wrong names again? xd
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
14:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats always annoying
14:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lost all tabs and 2mins of my life
14:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok then lets not put tile diffs in the snap easy
14:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller isnt it super late for u
14:18 < bridge_> <louis> i thought 1 at beginning means positive
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah 1 is negative
14:20 < bridge_> <zhn> then its easy, only problem is what if mapper changes something else (unless game entities i mean) aand prediction ig
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> both working in my poc -.-
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you see the clip
14:20 < bridge_> <louis> wb changing quads
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omaagawd quads xd
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but ye could be done in the same way
14:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller we both know that we need roblox ddnet
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well yea could be cool but also ugly
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too many ppl with bad taste
14:20 < bridge_> <zhn> chillerino dont you remember android mapping tool that was projecting directly onto server
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unsigned char poggies
14:20 < bridge_> <louis> we need like a physics type layer so u can put doodads on top of blocks that get destroyed when the block gets destroyed 😹
14:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no we dont
14:21 < bridge_> <zhn> ye sometimes i think ur unsigned char's second perosnality
14:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> -the skill
14:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bro wrote gta from scratch
14:22 < bridge_> <louis> we do
14:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Finally everything is working smoothly! Epic bot development incoming. Thanks to @Jupstar ✪ and @heinrich5991 for helping a lot. And everyone else for being my rubber duck during the last few days!!!
14:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=hot_bot_hacking.mp4&u=chiller
14:22 < bridge_> <louis> for server side dummies too ofc
14:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> may the epic bot development begin! @fokkonaut check out this poggies hot reloading
14:32 < bridge_> <chairn> the amount of backwards compatibility in this world is insane, but without it, you'd have to change everything every year...
14:33 < bridge_> <nouaa> @patiga was kinda funny tbh :kek:
14:33 < bridge_> <patiga> I'm honestly so confused, but it was hilarious at the same time
14:33 < bridge_> <nouaa> xd
14:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but it also depends on the software type IMO.. a game doesnt require it as much as a operating system.. a driver needs a stable interface, but the driver itself can be rewritten as much as it wants etc.
14:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> minecraft also has no backward compability really and still biggest modded game
14:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in this case it would ofc be a huge change
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but often breaking compat can also be as simple as changing  a data type
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and simply recompile
14:45 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nouaa @patiga ?? xd
14:45 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is this some reply moment wat u talkin about
14:45 < bridge_> <patiga> #general for context
14:46 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> F
14:46 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when bridge #general
14:47 < bridge_> <patiga> some kid ranted about moderators, and wanted help with blockers. he wanted to us to join voice chat to show us. during our chat he blocked multiple other players xd
14:47 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:47 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i could see my self doing something like that <:justatest:572499997178986510>
14:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks for briding patiga uwu
14:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> block should be legal
14:48 < bridge_> <patiga> :3
14:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> banning block is so annoying
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller go sleep
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
14:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1716727476.png
14:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen spammer 
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice ip leak
14:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510> its a vps
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is that the ddnet irc logger? 😄
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it often struggles xD
14:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no missing logs :c 
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> use zwelfs discord logs
14:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is deens main account idk which account he logs from but yea might be it.
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they hotter anyway
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with reactions support
14:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm
14:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tru i never use them xd
14:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they are not live right?
14:56 < bridge_> <chairn> sign bit also retains its positive value into negative
14:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno how live they are
14:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks like daily updates
15:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but with my internet speed they are no fun
15:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the irc logs have better performance
15:26 < bridge_> <0xdeen> now you know GER2's IP, congrats!
15:26 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Yes, I log from my normal account
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks, they call me sherlock for a reason
15:37 < bridge_> <zhn> juplock
15:37 < bridge_> <zhn> sherstar sounds funnier tho
15:38 < bridge_> <rafael8192> Hi guys
15:39 < bridge_> <rafael8192> Can i know how to create a Character from server
15:39 < bridge_> <rafael8192> for example
15:39 < bridge_> <zhn> check SvDbgDummies
15:39 < bridge_> <rafael8192> in Wario Ware they have a cow
15:39 < bridge_> <zhn> theres no default implementation of server side controlled player-character interface
15:40 < bridge_> <rafael8192> where it is?
15:40 < bridge_> <zhn> gamecontext.cpp afair
15:40 < bridge_> <rafael8192> ty
15:40 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i will check now
15:41 < bridge_> <rafael8192> there is no SvDbgDummies at all
15:41 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i all code
15:46 < bridge_> <rafael8192> in all code
15:48 < bridge_> <rafael8192> so how can u do it?
15:49 < bridge_> <learath2> It should be DbgDummies, no sv. But those are implemented in a very weird way. I don't believe there are any open source implementations of a serverside dummy done properly
15:50 < bridge_> <learath2> ChillerDragon was messing around with something of that sort. Perhaps he might have it public
15:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @rafael8192 now you are working on another feature that is already in ddnet++ xd
15:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and F-DDrace which is open source these days too
15:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen using donation money to host his private irc bouncer!!! cancel him!
15:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no but fr deen any chance you could make your irc client more stable? c: otherwise i have to scroll so much ._.
15:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @rafael8192 if you just want a tee from the server its as easy as compiling ddnet in debug mode and using dbg_dummies config varibale
15:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ```mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. && make && ./DDNet-Server "dbg_dummies 1"```
15:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> huh
15:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> can i know how
15:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you want to also make those tees move goto character.cpp OnTick and do something like `m_SavedInput.m_Direction = 1`
15:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i sent you the exact steps @rafael8192 xd
16:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i dont know what is f-ddrace and ddrace++ :Kek:
16:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i dont know what is f-ddrace and ddrace++ :kek:
16:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i just want to do it my self
16:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and if you want epic hot reloading and unittestability for bot controls you can pre order TeeworldsBotLib today
16:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> from code
16:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah
16:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP
16:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/
16:02 < bridge_> <rafael8192> can i have a link to the line with func which spawning tee :lol: ?
16:02 < bridge_> <rafael8192> pls
16:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh thats more than one function
16:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would recommend you to either fully use ddnet++ or F-DDrace or the ddnet dbg dummies
16:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tbh all of them work fine
16:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would recommend against copy pasting all the dummy spawning code from ddnet++ or F-DDrace that seems a bit pointless
16:16 < bridge_> <zhn> ddnetpp (ddnet properly properly) xd
16:16 < bridge_> <zhn> no use mmotee server side character
16:17 < bridge_> <zhn> big W
16:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @rafael8192 here is a 7 year old version of how dummies are done in ddnet++ https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-10.8.6-dummys/commit/2ac9bc2f15c045477fcdeb918d7dc5206faf5d43
16:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i don't recommend looking at it
16:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for all my recent projects i just used ddnet dbg dummies and they worked wonderfully so far
16:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
16:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well depends what you need those tees for
16:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats how the monster mod did it
16:21 < bridge_> <zhn> thats why i proposed structure for pooo instead of macros
16:21 < bridge_> <zhn> pool*
16:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i proposed more than 64 slots and make dbg dummies non dbg xd
16:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but ddnet maintainers don't want that :c 
16:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok now its bed time
16:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good nite
16:30 < bridge_> <rafael8192> Guys, excuse me, but I’m just a beginner and it’s hard for me to understand. Can you please provide a detailed explanation or, even better, a piece of code in which I can understand everything?
16:30 < bridge_> <rafael8192> :owo:
16:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Unlikely, the thing you are trying to do isn't known for being very beginner friendly
16:47 < bridge_> <rafael8192> гр
16:47 < bridge_> <rafael8192> yuh
16:47 < bridge_> <rafael8192> uh
16:47 < bridge_> <rafael8192> okay
16:47 < bridge_> <rafael8192> so
16:47 < bridge_> <rafael8192> how can i create a tee ?
16:48 < bridge_> <rafael8192> i nned this
16:48 < bridge_> <rafael8192> ?

16:56 < bridge_> <rafael8192> but it is an old version
16:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> UHHHHH
16:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> HOW TO DO IT :LOL:
16:59 < bridge_> <rafael8192> HOW TO DO IT :lol:
17:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> where i can find it?
17:00 < bridge_> <rafael8192> can u please give me a name of func or smth like that
17:01 < bridge_> <rafael8192> Iam so sorry for annoying 😄
17:24 < bridge_> <rafael8192> Oh, thanks. I didn't understand shit. I tried to implement it in DDNET++ and it didn’t even compile for me. I compiled it and launched it, but for some reason my server is registered when it’s stupidly not in the config. And even after adding it, the server is still registered.
17:25 < bridge_> <rafael8192> I just cant launch a server on ddnet ++
17:25 < bridge_> <rafael8192> :lol:
17:25 < bridge_> <rafael8192> the best programmer on earth
17:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It already works like a calculator but if calculators didn't support floats and had a performance of a brick

18:55 < bridge_> <lukron55> hi, wondering if theres any way to implement my ddnet server into uptime kuma?
19:05 < bridge_> <meloƞ> isnt uptime kuma just monitoring it? basically feed it the port and it gets what it needs?
19:09 < bridge_> <lukron55> well yeah it is
19:10 < bridge_> <lukron55> but how would i set it up with ddnet as just giving it the ip and port would just say always on
19:10 < bridge_> <lukron55> even if the server is on
19:16 < bridge_> <meloƞ> im fairly sure you can just ping the server every like 5 minutes to check if its alive or not
19:17 < bridge_> <lukron55> right but how
19:18 < bridge_> <lukron55> these are my options
19:18 < bridge_> <lukron55> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244338871542481009/IMG_2400.jpg?ex=6654c061&is=66536ee1&hm=c28c71b7ac87a7befac573996c089751205f2e89e1fd07105885bc25292c2c2a&
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> probably push
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> teeworlds servers don't implement ping
20:04 < bridge_> <lukron55> push just means that i call the uptime kuma url from teeworlds
20:04 < bridge_> <lukron55> push just means that i call the uptime kuma url from ddnet
20:05 < bridge_> <lukron55> is there a script that contsantly runs while the server is up? i could add the command to call it
20:11 < bridge_> <godly13> @blaiszephyr are u find turkey host?
20:12 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i have nothing to do with turkey-servers
20:13 < bridge_> <godly13> :(
20:17 < bridge_> <lukron55> yeah this, but i believe it has to be always running for uptime kuma to detect its on
20:17 < bridge_> <lukron55> similar to if i were to have it open in a browser
20:17 < bridge_> <lukron55> it would tell me the server is on
20:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> gm 🍵
20:54 < bridge_> <ar1gin> morning??
20:55 < bridge_> <naixn> Hey i jsut updated from version 9 to 18.2, really nice new changes and the gui is way better now too. Good job 🙂
20:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😅
20:55 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you didnt update for 9 years - respect! XD
20:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> awesome
20:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> android user?
20:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> or just forgot to update
20:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> welcome in 2024
20:56 < bridge_> <naixn> no i use windows and never updated, thought i was banned because i didnt find any ger server so i had to update after creating a ticket.
21:07 < bridge_> <godly13> XDD
21:07 < bridge_> <egyt> No progress for today 🙄
21:07 < bridge_> <egyt> At least I changed my profile picture. Still should find something better
22:38 < bridge_> <fury0908> Does anyone have a 0.7 skin svg template ?
22:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: nice that it works 🙂
22:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: ger2 is paid for by me. no donation money
23:02 < Loser_> sa türk warmi
23:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > The Internet Archive's cost per TB, with 24/7 online hard drives, is approximately $2000 for forever.
23:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> interesting
23:31 < bridge_> <chairn> uh, there's no running cost ?
23:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think the running cost is factored in
23:44 < bridge_> <learath2> 2000$ per TB? damn, wouldn't expect it to be that expensive
