12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> Hey i have had a bug for like 4 months on blmapchill basically onky on this map my backeound is green wich is not the normal backeound of the map i have asked countless of people even the develipers of maps and they still have no idea i have deleted all my maps and re downloaded them
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> Still doesnt work
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> But on all other maps backround is normal
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> And im not pressing pg down
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> Please help
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> With DDNet client? Happens with different GPU renderers too? (Settings -> Graphics)
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> tubo's krx client has graphic bugs axaxaxaxax
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> stop mentioning this trash
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> hrhr sori
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> np we all know you like bot clients xd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @murpi host a music competition for the background music üòÑ
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> When running DDNet-Server it creates a "ddnet-server.sqlite" in the current directory which is nice for multiple servers with different databases and a proper folder structure. But when I as a non server hoster want to spin up a local ddnet server that i installed via my packet manager by running ``DDNet-Server`` in my terminal I kinda do not expect to pollute my current directory but rather use the
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> more central user dir ~/.teeworlds any opinions on this?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and when you are at it do the same for the log
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and close this issue
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4755
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> isnt it bad style to escape the steam dir?
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> @k2d222 any issue with the CI ?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's even worse style to write user files into steam dir I guess
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> ou
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> idk much about steam practices i was just assuming its supposed to be a closed eco system and when steam is uninstalling the game it should wipe all data
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> Logging by default ends up in the userdir i assume the steam release has a custom storage.cfg to load the ressources from the steamdir
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> steam has steamapps/compatdata/
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it uses it for steamplay, dunno if its used for normal games
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> no, I haven't setup a CI before so I'll trust you on this one üôÇ
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> its no virus i promise :p
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES3_Popcorn:523045515471093770>
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mem leaks
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> With C++20 we would have std::counting_semaphore to replace CSemaphore, so base/tl/threading.h could also be removed then
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> üëç
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 1 year
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we can upgrade
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why is it the more i zoom out the less fps i get? i get down to 10 fps if i zoom out far, i do have a good cpu and gpu
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> has it something to do with opengl?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try vulkan
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye its normal
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i have problems with vulkan
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try modern opengl
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its completly normal
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u see more = more resources
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use entities while zooming xd
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i did
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we could think about clamping the world border in entities
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in design it won't work tho
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yeah wow now i have 300fps when im zoomed out max
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> nice
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> the new opengl is so much better
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not that new
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but lets say its not as ancient as the non modern one
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> as long as its stable
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u were the one with freezing videos?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in vk?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yes
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah weird stuff
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i hope they fix it xd
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its very weird, its like my whole processing power is concentrating on just ddnet so everything other that needs somewhat of "high" processing just freezes
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do you clamp FPS?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not impossible that vulkan can use much more of your GPU
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs thats basically what more FPS means
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but clamping FPS -> more efficient
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> clamping?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe it uses so much gpu that the cpu bottlenecks?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gfx_refresh_rate 1200
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i have it off
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gfx_refresh_rate 1200 should be fine without any input lags
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> im too lazy to switch to vulkan again for testing but if i remember correctly, vulkan did use an absurd procentage of either my cpu or gpu
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well thats sounds good to me üòÑ
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> ddnet standard is 480, does that mean its more input lag?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet standard is 0
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only very old clients used 480
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cl_refresh_rate 480 was it
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> somehow it was 480 standard for me
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> note the CL instead of GFX
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cl = CPU
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gfx = GPU
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> oh okay
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> clamping your CPU power can defs result in input lag
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gaming mice have 1000 hertz polling rate
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so 480 is less
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but tbh just test it out
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> some humans dont notice vsync off / on
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> some die, like me xd
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i dont really notice anything if its not above 10ms input lag
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> does ddnet maybe have an old version of vulkan?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> maybe the fixed it long time ago
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet is new
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> seems like a huge problem
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan is new*
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> hm okay
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since ddnet 16
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> you mean the whole renderer?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i've seen it for quite a while in other games
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it exists since 2016
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its the newest renderer in the industry
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like directx 12
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how did you amend a pr @deen ?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When you create a PR you can give permissions to project owners to push into that branch. I think it's on by default
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I just checked out their branch, created another commit and pushed it to their repo
