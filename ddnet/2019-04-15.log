04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Where are the configs stored when using config_store.exe + config_retrieve.exe? When DDNet/Teeworlds files are deleted (including config_directory), DDNet recalls the previous settings somehow. I'm trying to reset the whole thing.
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> It seems like these two files came with one of the more recent patches
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pathos  inside of the map file
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pathos also, don't ask the same thing twice in different places, then people will also have to respond twice
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @deen What map file?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> And sorry about duplicate question
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Also regarding your post on [this](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1620#issuecomment-4827939770), I just wanted to ask if you were affected by the patch changing the mouse sens. Who else? I know one player that was affected by this. For a fix, I suggested to delete `settings.cfg` and `settings_ddnet.cfg`, but deleting them would not reset anything and would just get old setti <message clipped>
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Also regarding your post on [this](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1620#issuecomment-4827939770), I just wanted to ask if you were affected by the patch changing the mouse sens. Who else? I know one player that was affected by this and I would like to do some more investigation/polling -- seems to affect very few people. For a fix, I suggested to delete `settings.cfg` and `se <message clipped>
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am not affected, I will try some stuff to find the problem. @Pathos, which client did you use when the problem occured? On which client was it okay? Can I have your settings_ddnet file?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I wasn't affected. It was another player Water (WATER OG DAWG 69) here. He said his mousesens was drastically lowered.
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> But it seems that recent patch is affecting some people, according to that Github issue post.
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So 12.1 is affected?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @fokkonaut  Personally, I'm not entirely sure -- I didn't ask him specifically, but my (decent) guess is that he updated to the latest from several versions ago (a month to a couple months old, not sure which patch) knowing his real life situation a bit.
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There seems to be a bug with the mouse somewhere since 12.1
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah, kind fo strange
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have any problem
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Me neither
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah, kind of strange
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Very few people are affected, so I'm trying to poll more people to investigate
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Please send them my way if you know anyone that's affected! I'll ask questions on their system etc. to see if I can find a pattern
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its probably just a config var
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah that's what I was thinking too
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> We chatted over this and test if `inp_mousesens` and `inp_mousesens_old`, but not sure what other vars are avail that would affect mousesens
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Also, where can I get nightly builds?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet.tw/nightly-builds
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://ddnet.tw/news/nightly-builds/
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But deen stopped the auto building
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the current nightly build is from the antiping rework
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, @Pathos 
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=6804&p=67786#p67786
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Oh wow, last nightly build was in 2015, ok
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I see
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Wait, is the nightly build with new antiping up?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> It says 2015
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Ok, so since it seems that those files have to do with maps, then how do you reset client configs (like controls)? I tried telling Water to delete `settings.cfg` and `settings_ddnet.cfg`, but somehow, the settings just came right back without any changes.
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can check out the appveyor build
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @Learath2 thanks -- where is that?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heinrich5991/ddnet/builds/23830027/artifacts this is for the prediction pull request
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @fokkonaut He said it's either 11,4 or 11,9
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> https://ddnet.tw/players/P-228-thos
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> For "Favorite Server" -- how is this determined? Most played during lifetime or more recent data?
14:32 <@deen> lifetime
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Thanks
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure @onby will love that cleints send the server that they are zoozing xd
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> o yeah i like that idea
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :banhammer: ðŸ”­
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats wrong direction zooz xd
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh wait doeskonsti zoozes in all the time ? xd
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/Df8Tn/c3341be9bc.png
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> boiiii my client keeps spamming that
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hard
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `grep -r "invalidated index" src`
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but lazy
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i no -nri btw
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> best flags
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just use ripgrep if you care enough
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `rg "invalidated index"`. faster, needs less options
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> somebody latley recommended me something else forgot name
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ag or something like this
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ag is slow though
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> slower than grep
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> whats ripgrep
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> different defualts but still grep?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not grep, no, reimplemented to be faster
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh im on windows rn so i only have grep -.-
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guress there is no package mangaer for the windows shell unix thingy
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this git bash mingw shell always forget thename
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> invalidated index
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woops wrong window -.-
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon can be downloaded here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/0.10.0
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh cool runs on windows
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never installed any programms on windows xd

20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gameclient.cpp
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt stop yet btw but idk whatthis code thes
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does*
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it even has comments ðŸ˜›
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ..
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon 4 bytes, feels like the new netobj I added
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u!
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why does type end up -1? it should turn up as 0 no?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thought nobody useses debug
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YairBenDavid> Hi ðŸ˜€
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hi!
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YairBenDavid> Xd
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YairBenDavid> I will be top 5 first in my map :lol:
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YairBenDavid> I will be top 1 first in my map :lol:

21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my fpds drop to 2-3 while fastfordwaring demos
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not in debug mode btw
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guess thats caused by this network bug
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it ripped mi whole demo
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> might be related to the cpu issue @deen
