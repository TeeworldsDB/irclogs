09:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sos i have a naming problem!
09:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am crafting a rcon command for moderation that will deep freeze a tee for a given amount of minutes. So like a soft ban or jail.
09:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the argument will be the players id and if the player leaves it remembers the ip and all players joining with that ip will be deep frozen too.
09:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how do i call the rcon command?
09:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think your idea of calling it jail works fine
09:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bbbut its not a jail :c its deep freze
09:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe freezejail xd
10:02 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Does anyone know why windres.exe cant process .rc file?
10:02 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1397489012515536996/image.png?ex=6881e890&is=68809710&hm=1d444ba5cd8d03d82fb014d08a25eb346922e808932ad8fe340c15e41e696b06&
10:03 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> It just said `Failed` , without a more detailed explanation
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> see if you can get the windres output directly
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> llvm-rc is better at some parts of RC processing but they both have major bugs with several rc files I've used
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> certain keywords need to be strings or taken out of strings (I remember one such instance where you couldn't get the file to work on both because they were insistent on opposite expectations)
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> rc.exe has allowed a lot of strange stuff over the years
10:13 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok, i'll try llvm
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> what happened
10:26 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I guess it's because i use ninja to build
10:29 < bridge> <robyt3> I think some versions of clang have this problem with ninja. GCC+ninja should work. Or make instead of ninja.
10:49 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Can't figure out what's happening, I use make, llvm, but it seems that windres.exe never works
10:50 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> wouldn't llvm use llvm-rc directly?
10:55 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok, llvm-rc can read rc file, renaming solves everything
12:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ``deep_jailid`` it is dont let heinrich know i didnt do ``deep_jail_id`` axaxaxax
12:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> Such a great idea
12:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 462 line diff btw xd
12:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> And yeah calling it jail is fine
12:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i thought this would take 5mins smh
12:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> I think there might be some edge cases
12:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> You don't want undeepfreeze to undeepfreeze someone in jail
12:40 < bridge> <pilonpl> Maybe others shouldn't be able to interact with a jailed tee at all?
12:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess being deepfreezed is never an advantage
12:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> So maybe it's fine
12:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah it probably shouldn't be actual deep freeze at all, just display as deep freeze
12:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and making them uninteractable is good too to stop a jailed tee from being a nuisance or a plaything for other players
12:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> I mean it would be funny to toss a jailed tee around lol
12:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok yeah the funny is probably more important than preventing a nuisance
12:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and not like botters or blockers usually play difficult maps where a deep tee in the way is an issue
13:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @inv41idu53rn4m3 i made it actual deep so the undeep tile also works
13:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gotta give cheaters a chance
13:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> Lol
14:23 < bridge> <pathos3005> Spammed a bunch of issues on your repo

16:00 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon do you know, if there is a netmessage to sync animations already? I know it does this sometimes on race start, but this might be a different mechanic related to hitting the start block
16:00 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon do you know, if there is a netmessage to sync animations already? I know it does this sometimes on race start, but this might be a different mechanic related to hitting the start tile
16:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am 97% sure there is no net message
16:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the start line thing got removed too iirc
16:06 < bridge> <Assa> does the sync button still do anything in the editor?
16:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** here my blog post about envelope sync to start tile https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1610#issuecomment-2859025773
16:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it does something yes
16:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** described in my blog too
16:07 < bridge> <Assa> I managed to sync sound and envelopes
16:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** me too
16:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** read my blog
16:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its closed issue
16:07 < bridge> <Assa> but you need to know of #8458
16:07 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8458
16:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just dont delay? xd
16:09 < bridge> <Assa> you can also just add stillness to a sound and sync it like that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
16:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea the whole sync thing is such a big topic so many bugs and features
16:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** int the best gamemode of teeworlds called survival the nameplates are hidden and you can hide behind bushes and stuff.
16:11 < bridge> <Assa> going to fix the sound offset issue and updating the map format, gimme a second
16:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** There i a map with moving clouds in the foreground you can use to sneak behind.
16:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** these clouds would have different positions for different clients
16:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** huge pain
16:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** litereally gameplay affecting graphics bug
16:12 < bridge> <Assa> turns off quads
16:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa luckily i never had offset issues because i never used offets :) 
16:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa <:banhammer:392813948858269696>
16:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats why ddnet is a cheat client!
16:13 < bridge> <Assa> yeah just ban everyone with ddnet client
16:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** based
16:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we neew allow turn off quads flag
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> @essigautomat if you make switchable envelopes you need switchable sounds too btw
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> else cut scenes are not properly possible
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> yeah ofc, added that in the bottom message
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> and sounds like knocking on a door would be nice
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> the issue was for all envelopes, this includes sounds
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> sounds are envelopes?
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> can they be moved??? xd
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> yesn't
16:15 < bridge> <Assa> you can assign sound envelopes to sounds

16:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa did you know about the print screen key on your keyboard? xd
16:18 < bridge> <Assa> no, I only know of the "Druck" key
16:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** üç∫
16:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** druck s-abf
16:18 < bridge> <teero777> holy shit you can move them

16:18 < bridge> <teero777> wow
16:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** dont do it teero
16:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its gonna segfault the client!
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> :(
16:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> you can literally make race cars with this xD
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> so cool
16:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lmao
16:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooooo
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> imagine a civic with some random tee yeeting
16:20 < bridge> <Assa> rotating sounds doesn't work üò¶
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rotating sounds xd
16:20 < bridge> <Assa> you can make sounds square shaped
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go animate sound color
16:25 < bridge> <Assa> you can bezier sounds under 0
16:26 < bridge> <Assa> you can bezier sounds under 0 and over 1 üôÇ
16:27 < bridge> <Assa> should I open an issue? :justatest:
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> my sound system hates what I am doing, the boxes are cracking
16:48 < bridge> <teero777> what sound format does ddnet accept again
16:49 < bridge> <Assa> opus
16:49 < bridge> <teero777> okay im cooking
16:51 < bridge> <Assa> how do I add tooltips to a editor gui element again?
16:52 < bridge> <teero777> @essigautomat when emitters in ddnet
16:52 < bridge> <teero777> i need some fumes
16:56 < bridge> <robyt3> If you mean a new UI element, `str_copy(m_aTooltip, "...");` while the element is the hot item
16:56 < bridge> <Assa> unfortunately it's a editor-property with proptype int
16:56 < bridge> <Assa> I guess CProperty is missing a "description" attribute
16:57 < bridge> <Assa> I guess CProperty is missing a "description"/"explanation" attribute
16:58 < bridge> <Assa> guess I don't try to crash ddnet with weird sound envelops again
16:58 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1397593803984076800/PXL_20250723_145806256.jpg?ex=68824a28&is=6880f8a8&hm=5ce99f29ab5100381b8f88396131e37978d6b815f87595e56ce1e42097fa1122&
17:01 < bridge> <teero777> can't i clone groups??
17:01 < bridge> <teero777> wtf editor
17:17 < bridge> <robyt3> The engine should clamp the volume to 0-1
17:19 < bridge> <teero777> first tee with hearing loss

17:25 < bridge> <Assa> use bezier curves to make the volume curve over 1
17:27 < bridge> <teero777> okay lets see what 500 brings us
17:27 < bridge> <teero777> i hope my headset holds
17:27 < bridge> <teero777> if it even works
17:28 < bridge> <Assa> (it's clipped)
17:28 < bridge> <Assa> (it's clipped, because sb was smart enough)
17:28 < bridge> <teero777> yea it doesn't work
18:41 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs #10551 is yours I believe
18:41 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10551
19:23 < bridge> <vahemaaa> so good teiro
20:39 < bridge> <kebscs> I didn't change doors rendering
20:44 < bridge> <Assa> but the prediction, I only changed the laser rendering, but didn't touch open/closed logic
20:45 < bridge> <Assa> like the rendering only gets a start and end point, no state
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> If you can reproduce it consistently, then bisect
22:15 < bridge> <pioooooo> I would guess the bug is there since the very start :D
23:21 < bridge> <Assa> who is archemede?
