08:42 <+ChillerDragon> ootobers = luke smith da famos ootober
08:43 <+ChillerDragon> cool kids get their mutt setup from tiktok
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I did my own
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk who is luke smith
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does he use gentoo
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> xd nice try

08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> busted
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I didnt rly read the name
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The script is dope ngl
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> tbh i simp his yt videos
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> xd
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> i also checked out his scripts :)
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It just setups connections to the smtp
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> back when i did my mutt and mail stuff
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye ye ik
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> he is based bold influencer
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But i added auto sign and encrypt on reply
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Plus a header with my pgp

08:51 <+ChillerDragon> I love the dude he has like no phone and no internet at home etc
08:51 <+ChillerDragon> giga chad
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lol
08:51 <+ChillerDragon> and a 5bucks laptop
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> and he hates on all the software
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does he write his own
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> i think he said "adobe reader is worse than hitler" or something than that
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well it is
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> he claims to not be a dev
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> i think he is more claiming to be a man of books and shit
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> like flexin his latin skills
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does he have a white beard
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> click da link
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I know a hidden twitch streamer
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> if u wanna face reveal
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> ?
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> He is an old man with white beard, like a wizard, he dabbles on unix stuff uses openbox and has a old part pc pickup place on his home
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> you mean Learath2 weeb gaming vtuber twitch account?
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> He is murican tho
08:54 <+ChillerDragon> MURICA
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> videos like this make me thing of something but ill dump it in offtopic
08:54 <+ChillerDragon> when offtopic bridge
08:54 <+ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaaa
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just say it here
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> #freechiller
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Chiller are you on libera?
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> rn im on quakenet
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> but yes i am connected to libera and in a bunch of libera channels
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U can be on more than 1
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> all new channels i create are on libera
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> i mean this channel here is quakenet for me
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Do u use a bouncer
08:56 <+ChillerDragon> cuz im gamer
08:56 <+ChillerDragon> i run weechat on my vps
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh smart
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is latency a problem?
08:56 <+ChillerDragon> not at all
08:56 <+ChillerDragon> without mosh
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whats mosh
08:56 <+ChillerDragon> im in some cafe with mobile net and i can type smoother than in slack xd
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> mosh fixes bad internet via ssh
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> its antiping for ssh gamers
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Do u run weechat under a screen?
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> yes :D
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill try mosh
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> i have "irc" command in my path which does ssh -t screen -r etc
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> so i type 3 letter and im right in
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> mosh is pretty poggers if your net is unstable
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hackrerman
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> it allows you to type even if you lost connection and then it buffers it and sends it when its back
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> solid for prompts
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> and especially poggers for breaking connections
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Do u have a weechat theme?
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> because even if u drive through a tunnel your ssh connection does not die
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> nah
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> im vanilla boi
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its incrediblu hard to find one
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No one does em
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Theme is just colors bruh
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> yes
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weechat.look
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> i like vanilla colors
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The blue?
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> if i disagree with default look i wont use the software
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> xd
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hard for me to read white on blue tbh
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> for me the chat log is my terminal color
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> only some useless bar is blue

09:00 <+ChillerDragon> yes i pro reader
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> no acrobat needed
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess its cuz my term has some transparency idk
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> also on my trans term it gud
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> go buy gnome terminal

09:21 <+Ryozuki> hello ChillerDragon 
09:28 <+Ryozuki> man gnome might as well be the systemd of desktop stuff
09:28 <+Ryozuki> they are everywhere
09:28 <+Ryozuki> gnome-keyring, no i dont want you!
09:37 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: 🤔 
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> henlo
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> weechat running on my vps does not send me notifications :D i gotta manually check from time to time. Which is actually pretty calming to not be able to get pinged and interrupted.
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> gnome-keyring never popped up for me :D
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> it might do magic in the background that im not aware of

09:41 <+ChillerDragon> yummy
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> crisper
09:41 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: enable notifications from me
09:41 <+Ryozuki> everything i say is important
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> okok boss
09:41 <+Ryozuki> kek
09:42 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: why u back to irc and not matrix
09:42 <+Ryozuki> altho irc is better
09:42 <+Ryozuki> no bloat
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> i do use both also both in weechat actually but everything in matrix feels bugged and bloated even in weechat idk how it managed to do that
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> i use matrix mostly on my phone cuz element is better than every irc client i found for iOS
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> clean irc: https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668156462.png
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> bloat matrix: https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668156449.png
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> as you can see matrix is quite behind in messages :D because its slow af
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 "Chunk num" refers to MapChunksPerRequest right? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668156280.png imo the names are a bit non obvious to me :(
09:51 <+Ryozuki> damn u got ugly colors
09:52 <+Ryozuki> actually its just the highlight color thats ugly

09:53 <+Ryozuki> or maybe its from my nerd font
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> is it the arroe
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> arrow
09:54 <+Ryozuki> look at the image
09:54 <+Ryozuki> ye
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> arrow arrived fine here :) with vanilla debian font
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> yea your screenshot looks sexy

11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I'm gobsmacked
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the first time I've seen someone say they look at the shields
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Yeah, lol...
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The stars I do sort of get, they are right below your tee, easy to look at

12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It died
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> redacted.ch is the new
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U need a itw to join tho
12:56 <+ChillerDragon> Holy shit I just realized 0.6 and 0.7 master servers together only list like 4 "unnamed servers" that used to be waaaaay more on average :(
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly cba to climb up the tracker ladder anymore. I bet you need to be in a decent tracker with great ratio to get a red interview even. Then need to prepare for the interview, then after you get in it's incredibly hard to maintain a ratio on music trackers, so stale
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> dfng 11 :gigachad:
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: make a PR to improve the names and then we can discuss
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> L2 are private, L3 is shared
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> because it's the most performant one. I can't find the graph but it's a U shaped curve with 32 and 64 bytes offering the most performance
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it happens if the writes are not aligned. RISC-V does this
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With atomics? I don’t think that’s sane
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An unaligned atomic would simply have a mutex on riscv to ensure the torn value can’t be observed
14:42 <+Ryozuki> now that i think about it, with my map generator, i effectively found a way to compress maps to less than for example 10 bytes
14:42 <+Ryozuki> just by knowing the seed
14:42 <+Ryozuki> ez
14:44 <+Ryozuki> ill setup a sv that changes maze and fly map every hour
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 meh i just wanted to make sure its referring to the same thing and maybe was hoping for a short sentence from you what it is :D
15:04 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki go build compression algo that spits out a random generator and a seed to compress any kind of data to a very small size
15:07 <+Ryozuki> xd
15:08 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: go try my mapgen
15:08 <+Ryozuki> cargo install ddnet-map-gen
15:14 <+Ryozuki> ddnet-map-gen --seed $(date +%s) -m /usr/local/share/ddnet/data/mapres/ maze
15:14 <+Ryozuki> gg
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Technically possible as far as I understand the theory, but you have no guarantee on the efficiency of the compression. The generator (IVs) + the seed could even end up larger than the original data

17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> interesting
17:19 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki im not in need of a map gen right now but i will keep it in mind
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> lol after reimplementing tw protocol in ruby i realized how many things of my protocol blog are trash xd
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> nobody told me xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im implementing stuff in rust but in small pieces
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: maybe I just named it wrong. correct it pls 🙂
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> Maybe download speed would be a fitting name?

17:57 <+ChillerDragon> I do not feel comfortable chaning ur lingo
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe NumResponseChunksPerRequest?
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> Yes
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> Sounds much better imo? Wat u thinkin?
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> Its super long but its very descriptive
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then rename it 🙂

18:22 <+ChillerDragon> Yikes I have been procrastinating snapshots sooo long
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> Think i gotta actually look at them soon :c
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even without support from libtw2? 😛
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> hm?
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> i red this https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/snapshot.md but that didnt got me far
18:37 <+ChillerDragon> not sure what you mean. Are you making fun of me? o.O
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not making fun of you
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was basically just mentioning that the dissector still can't do snapshots
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> good because if you would make fun of me i would tell heinrich!
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea the dissector would help a lot on that :) last time i said i wont need it but i slowly feel like it would help A LOT
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a flight coming up, maybe I can try doing some of it there
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> poggers
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *maybe*!
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> i mean one annotatet full snapshot as txt should also get me started
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> yea whatever ill rq for now. Next time ill go back to putting dbg msgs all over snapshot.cpp xd
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're trying to encourage me, don't you 😛
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> Im a maniuplative bitch
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> I did get quite far with dbg msgs for all the messages up until snapshots. But the last days building stuff in ruby the dissector was so nice to use. If you don't find time or motivation to build snapshots into the dissector im not blocked or anything its just harder fo rme.
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Snapshots aren't that bad when you notice it's all ints 😄
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the tougher part is handling delta compression
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> most riscv designs don't support atomic extension though
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well our discussion was much higher level than hardware anyway. If one wants to implement a high level language with support for unaligned atomics on risc-v, they'd have to resort to a mutex I guess
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i don't know what's in the atomic riscv extension anyway so...

22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Would need to tweak this more, but would people be fine with replacing V / H with something more readable?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1040742771406942218/image.png
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would be. I'm sure you'll find someone that wouldn't be
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah, but what arguement would they have?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> V and H are really niche ways of portraying layer visibility
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> it means Visible Hidden and you don't have to learn anything could be one argument
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what if u speak not english?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just today someone asked the shield indicator to be back, there is always someone who enjoys niche things 😄
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> LOL
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> idk what they would anwser to that. I quite like the new design
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thanks! i'll tweak the size so its more fitting
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what other Quality of life thing would you want into the editor design?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you're gonna replace these then at least make it something standard that everyone understands like an eye icon, this reminds me more of a brightness icon
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what shield indicator
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also day ? of asking ninja bar to be fixed
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what wrong with ninja bar again? sorry im stupid
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's already fixed but c0d3d3v went missing in action :justatest:

23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only assertions of random people mattered 😄
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Undefined behaviour is undefined. No matter how much we wish it was defined

23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was clear to me that this doesn't have to be the case. I thought it was also common understanding
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> each time you read a undefined value, it can have a different value
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is this better?

23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait shit
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Squish it more vertically, looks like anime girl eyes
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Got it
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Wait, I don't think you can squish font icons. They just look like this.

23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought so too. Especially with everyone saying insane stuff like "undefined behaviour can launch nuclear strikes, summon nasal demons, launch nethack etc"
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I thought you drew it, it's fine then
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Nah. If I were to make my own pack I'd make it much more tee-like
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this FA5?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this is where all the symbols are
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free&s=solid
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also, adjusted the show/hide button so it's more aligned, and so the symbol stays the same size. I hope this is fine.

23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I think it look good 👍
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> old size vs new size
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1040762104048791613/image.png
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think having the edges also line up, like in old, would have the text part of the layer be too small
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is font-awesome still under a free license?
