00:00 < Muttley> hmm ok, what distro are you using
00:00 < Savander> debian 7
00:01 < Muttley_> whoopsie
00:01 < Savander> timeout?
00:01 < Muttley_> to eager on closing tabs
00:01 < Savander> :P
00:01 < Savander> So, Debian 7
00:02 < Muttley> hmm
00:02 < Muttley> im still here :p
00:02 < Savander> am
00:02 < Savander> :,
00:02 < Savander> :PPP
00:03 < Muttley> you generated the dkim key for ddforce.net ?
00:03 < Savander> yes
00:03 < Savander> default.private and default.txt
00:03 < Muttley> could you paste output of the following
00:03 < Muttley> cat  /var/log/mail.log | grep dkim
00:03 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/bKQHkTUR
00:03 < Savander> latest mail
00:05 < Muttley> what are the contents of /etc/opendkim/KeyTable
00:06 < Savander> default._domainkey.ddforce.net ddforce.net:default:/etc/opendkim/default.private
00:07 < Muttley> ok
00:07 < Muttley> try
00:07 < Muttley> opendkim -Q
00:07 < Savander> command?
00:07 < Muttley> refile:/etc/opendkim/SigningTable
00:07 < Muttley> root@ddforce.net/1
00:08 < Muttley> does it give output ?
00:08 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/Qsq1N4hi
00:08 < Muttley>  think there's a bug in the code that loads refiles. Confirm that you have only a single space character between "mydomain.com" and the rest of the line, and no trailing spaces.
00:08 < Muttley> could this be your prolem ?
00:09 < Muttley> hmm hard to not look at the files
00:10 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/AZZVq7vM9308
00:10 < Savander> like that?
00:10 < Muttley> ah wait
00:10 < Muttley> try
00:10 < Muttley> ddforce.net ddforce.net:default:/etc/opendkim/default.private
00:10 < Muttley> single line
00:11 < Savander> in KeyTable
00:11 < Savander> ye?
00:11 < Muttley> ye
00:11 < Savander> still
00:12 < Muttley> restart dkim service
00:12 < Muttley> and then send email
00:12 < Savander> i restarted
00:12 < Muttley> ok
00:12 < Savander> still same problem
00:12 < Muttley> still same error ?
00:12 < Savander> yup
00:13 < Muttley> sorry for the following:
00:13 < Muttley> The following error indicates the filter ran properly however could not match the outgoing email domain with a filter (and thus no signature was generated):  Nov 21 06:59:56 appname dkim-filter[2911]: 81AA7E688: no signature data  Consider changing the domain to a wildcard in /etc/opendkim.conf:  # Sign for example.com with key in /etc/mail/dkim.key using # selector '2007' (e.g. 2007._domainkey.example.com) Domain                  * KeyFile                 /e
00:13 < Muttley> hmm wait pastebin
00:13 < Muttley> http://pastebin.com/kiBTbZuG
00:14 < Savander> i sent you before
00:14 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/gdh8D9s38955
00:14 < Savander> i should delete hash
00:14 < Savander> from KeyFile and Selector?
00:15 < Savander> i don't use mail.ddforce.net
00:15 < Savander> or
00:15 < Savander> ahm, maybe
00:15 < Savander> it's default
00:15 < Muttley> Domain                  *
00:16 < Muttley> keyfile and selector idk
00:16 < Muttley> you should point them to the right files
00:16 < Savander> still :/
00:16 < Muttley> ;-)
00:16 < Muttley> KeyFile                 /etc/mail/dkim.key Selector                mail
00:16 < Muttley> that is default
00:16 < Savander> ye
00:16 < Savander> but
00:17 < Muttley> in the screenshot you send there commented
00:17 < Muttley> #
00:17 < Savander> mail mean mail.private
00:17 < Savander> i guess?
00:17 < Muttley> yes
00:17 < Savander> i have default.private
00:17 < Muttley> remove the #
00:17 < Savander> KeyFile -> don't know what is it
00:18 < Muttley> your private dkim key
00:18 < Savander> so put the path 
00:18 < Muttley> yes
00:18 < Muttley> including the filename
00:18 < Savander> but now
00:19 < Savander> it means
00:19 < Savander> default.txt
00:19 < Savander> or default.private
00:19 < Savander> in default.txt
00:19 < Savander> no
00:19 < Savander> default.private
00:19 < Savander> gad damit
00:19 < Savander> still 
00:20 < Muttley> default.private
00:20 < Muttley> :P
00:20 < Muttley> selector email
00:20 < Muttley> you have
00:20 < Muttley> ?
00:20 < Muttley> send new screenshot please
00:20 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/d02K5ZKB9437
00:20 < Savander> email selector?
00:20 < Savander> don't know
00:20 < Muttley> selector mail
00:21 < Savander> # selector '2007' (e.g. 2007._domainkey.example.com)
00:21 < Savander> i have
00:21 < Savander> default._domainkey.ddforce.net
00:22 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/uf88y0EH
00:23 < Muttley_> ok
00:23 < Muttley_> then this should work
00:23 < Savander> but don't works :DD
00:23 < Muttley> :-)
00:23 < Savander> no idea..
00:23 < Savander> :D
00:24 < Muttley> still same error in log ?
00:24 < Savander> yup
00:25 < Savander> Thanks to all who tried to help.. The issue was a bug with refile in opendkim when there is CR character in Signingtable file.. So, i saved the file in non DOS format to remove the CR character and it worked perfect...
00:25 < Savander> ohom
00:25 < Savander> how to save it in 'NON DOS " 
00:25 < Savander> Lol.
00:26 < Savander> ok i know
00:26 < Muttley> serius
00:26 < Muttley> u edited in a windows editor
00:26 < Savander> ye
00:26 < Savander> but still
00:26 < Savander> nope
00:26 < Savander> in lniux
00:26 < Savander> linux
00:26 < Savander> xD
00:26 < Savander> via ssh
00:26 < Muttley> joe ?
00:26 < Savander> nope
00:26 < Muttley> nano
00:26 < Muttley> vi
00:26 < Savander> rly, via ssh
00:26 < Savander> nano
00:26 < Muttley> strange
00:26 < Savander> but still don't works
00:27 < Savander> mEH :<
00:27 < Muttley> that doesnt affect the format
00:27 < Muttley> but it works now ?
00:27 < Muttley> hmm
00:27 < Savander> nope
00:28 < Muttley> shoot me allready
00:28 < Muttley> :P
00:28 < Muttley> was it a non dos format 
00:28 < Muttley> can you revert te old settings
00:28 < Muttley> as they where before
00:28 < Muttley> maybe that will work now
00:30 < Savander> but
00:30 < Savander> it was dos format
00:30 < Savander> 100%
00:30 < Savander> because i created directly on linux
00:31 < Savander> so how it possible it can be non dos format?
00:35 < Muttley> idk
00:35 < Muttley> :P
00:35 < Muttley> well im off for tonight
00:36 < Muttley> i will create a test vps for myself if you cant figure it out by the 2nd of januari
00:36 < Savander> Thanks for help :)) Maybe i'll fix it tomorrow ! :D

13:27 < Learath2> deen: does client have some kind of tick time of its own ?
14:49 <@deen> Learath2: not sure
14:50 <@deen> what you mean
14:50 <@deen> the client does ticks, yes
14:50 < Learath2> deen: found it its not ticks but its LocalTime
14:53 < Learath2> deen: are you on linux ?
14:53 <@deen> yes
14:53 < Learath2> do you have time to test autoupdate on linux ?
15:17 < Savander> deen:  can i send you 'Test mail"? Because my friend gets my emails in spam:<
15:17 <@deen> Savander: ok^^
15:17 <@deen> Learath2: yes
15:17 < Savander> and i don't know if this works correctly

15:43 <@EastByte> deen: 
15:45 < WolfAlex> deen, 
15:49 < Learath2> EastByte: you on linux ?
15:49 <@EastByte> sure
15:49 < Learath2> would you mind giving this a go https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/tree/autoupdate
15:51 <@EastByte> why did you fork teeworlds/teeworlds and not def-/ddnet?
15:51 < Learath2> i coded teeworlds way before ddnet already had a repo
15:51 < Spyker> guys someone can create a multiplayer editor?
15:52 <@EastByte> Learath2: but for the autoupdater atleast you could have forked ddnet
15:53 <@deen> What's up guys?^^
15:53 <@EastByte> hi deen, I'm back :)
15:53 < Learath2> EastByte: its still based on ddnet/DDRace54
15:53 < Learath2> 64
15:53 <@EastByte> yea, but atleast I don't know how to find out at which ddnet commit it is
15:53 < Learath2> it is rebased on the latest one 
15:53 <@deen> welcome back EastByte, how was it?
15:53 < Spyker> deen wait i ll call others sec :D
15:53 <@EastByte> it was great!
15:54 <@deen> Savander: i didn'treceive anything (not even in spam)
15:54 < Nealson> hi deen wir wollen dich was fragen
15:54 < Savander> deen:  RLY?
15:54 < Savander> WOW
15:54 < Savander> impossible
15:54 < Savander> :O
15:55 < Savander> But still
15:55 < Spyker> deen in the new loop map we failed for bug.... but can save just adding a hookthrough tile
15:55 < Savander> it's weird....
15:55 < Savander> i have NO IDEA
15:56 < Savander> why my email fall to spam
15:56 < Savander> ffa
15:56 < Savander> ffs
15:56 < Savander> :/
15:57 < Nealson> deen are you there? :D
15:57 < Nealson> if yes follow me, Spyker, RedFight
15:58 <@deen> why do you all want something at the same time now?^^
15:58 < Nealson> sry :D
15:59 <@EastByte> Learath2: how can I test it?
15:59 <@EastByte> bam game worked
15:59 < Learath2> aaah didnt think of that when rebasing it 
16:00 < Savander> GRGRRR
16:01 < Savander> Lool?
16:02 < Savander> i changed from text/html to text/plain
16:02 < Savander> (email content-type)
16:02 < Savander> and now Email is not in spam.
16:05 < Learath2> EastByte: client.cpp:L580 changing it with return "test"; should make it work
16:07 <@deen> Spyker: unsigned char* is working on it i think
16:08 < Savander> ITS SO FUCKING WEIRD
16:08 <@EastByte> Learath2: hm can't see anything happen
16:08 < Savander> i get emails
16:08 < Savander> but my friend no
16:08 < Savander> you too
16:08 < Savander> WHAT THE HELL
16:08 < Savander> i don't understand
16:08 < Savander> this shit
16:08 <@deen> now i got it, Savander 
16:09 < Learath2> EastByte: it should say DDNet test is out! Download ? on the bottom of the screen
16:09 <@deen> but i can't write to you: "rejected: User unknown in local recipient table"
16:10 <@EastByte> Learath2: ah

16:11 < Learath2> deen: you need to client.cpp:L580 changing it with return "test"; should make it work
16:11 <@EastByte> Learath2: working together with linux people :P
16:12 < Savander> eh

16:13 < Learath2> curl prolly failed to get update.json because cacert.pem is missing
16:14 < Savander> ah
16:14 < Savander> i know why
16:14 < Savander> my server is dead
16:14 < Savander> AGAIN
16:14 < Savander> LOl.
16:14 <@EastByte> CAPSLOCK YEA!!!
16:14 < Savander> again problem with network
16:14 < Learath2> deen: http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem if you wget this to the root it should work
16:14 < Nealson> deen
16:14 <@deen> what root?
16:14 < Learath2> next to the executable
16:14 < Nealson> Kannst du aip gores fixen?
16:14 < Nealson> man kann die startline skippen
16:14 <@EastByte> wut
16:15 < Nealson> die ersten 4 ranks wurden gecheatet
16:15 < Nealson> ChillerDragon, Nudel, Samu, Dinner
16:15 < Nealson> cheated ranks
16:16 <@deen> Nealson: and yours?
16:17 <@EastByte> wow this is dumb
16:17 < Nealson> my not
16:17 <@deen> Nealson: ok, done
16:17 <@EastByte> better remove all ranks
16:19 <@deen> sure, all 800 ranks
16:19 <@deen> clearly they cheated their good 40 min times
16:19 <@EastByte> okay
16:19 <@EastByte> nvm then
16:19 <@deen> Learath2: yes, now it seems to work
16:21 < Nealson> danke deen
16:21 <@deen> Nealson: english channel btw
16:21 < Nealson> aso sry
16:38 < Learath2> well deen there probably are some bugs and i dont check for errors at all but replacing learath2.info with update.ddnet.tw in autoupdate.cpp should get it in a working state
16:40 <@deen> sounds like it needs some extensive tests now
16:44 <@EastByte> Learath2: basically it creates a thread for every new entry in the queue
16:45 <@EastByte> and every thread is trying to work through all entries in the queue
16:46 <@EastByte> isn't that redundant?
16:47 <@EastByte> ah okay I got it wrong
16:47 <@EastByte> there is only one thread, sry
16:52 < Learath2> EastByte: it spawns a thread when queue has anything in it and goes thru the queue
16:52 < Learath2> when the queue is empty the thread is killed off
16:52 <@EastByte> yea
16:53 <@EastByte> the progress callback is called from thread right?
16:54 <@EastByte> this might be a bit dangerous
16:55 < Learath2> EastByte: in what sense ?
16:55 <@EastByte> when the progress callback accesses sensitive data
16:56 <@EastByte> which is write accessed by the main thread aswell
16:56 < Learath2> well i've made sure my case doesnt create any problem but yeah might create some problem
16:57 <@EastByte> you could simply store a progress value in the task
16:57 < Learath2> thought about that but giving use the entire callback seemt to feel more flexible
17:01 <@EastByte> hm I would rather want to just read the current progress state in every client tick instead of adding a static method
17:01 <@EastByte> wouldn't make any performance difference and is less work
17:01 <@EastByte> also ./src/engine/shared/jobs.h CJob is doing it the same way
17:02 < Learath2> so you are proposing i return a CTask to the user and the user can check the progress with CTask.progress ?
17:03 <@EastByte> yes, like it's done in CJob
17:03 < Learath2> EastByte: and also are you okay with the CompletionCallback ?
17:05 < Learath2> and how do you propose i give the total size to user 
17:06 <@EastByte> atleast all information should be in CFetchTask
17:06 <@EastByte> I don't really care if there are optional callbacks
17:07 < Learath2> the callbacks get us back to the point about critical data
17:07 <@EastByte> yes
17:08 <@EastByte> well, I think callbacks are needed in a system where all threads are sleeping some progress happens
17:08 <@EastByte> but in the client it doesn't matter
17:09 <@EastByte> *until some progress happens
17:10 < Learath2> so you think i should leave in the completion callback because its either that or client checking CTask.done every tick
17:11 <@EastByte> yes
17:11 <@EastByte> deen: what do you think?
17:13 <@EastByte> Learath2: but I was relating to progress and completion callback
17:14 <@EastByte> if the programmer has some special reason to use the threaded callbacks, he might use it
17:16 < Learath2> so should i even bother changing this ? because in this use case it should work fine 
17:16 < Learath2> except is was writing to a variable atomic EastByte ?
17:19 <@EastByte> I don't think you need to bother changing this but adding some file/state information to CFetchTask would be useful
17:20 <@EastByte> and returning the handle
17:20 < Learath2> will do
17:20 <@EastByte> okay :)
17:23 < Learath2> EastByte: anything you see that sticks out ?
17:26 <@EastByte> I only took a look over a part of the fetcher and I'm a little bit busy
17:26 <@EastByte> new year's eve :)
17:27 < Learath2> eh true i normally do nothing so im quite free 
17:27 <@EastByte> I guess deen will check the code
17:37 <@deen> i probably should check the code, yes
17:37 <@deen> and test it on all platforms
17:37 <@EastByte> and fuzz the hell out of it
17:37 <@deen> no^^
17:37 <@EastByte> okay
17:37 <@deen> but that reminds me, they still haven't fixed the terrible security vulnerability in libyaml
17:38 <@deen> maybe i should just make it public =/

17:39 <@deen> buffer overflow in the yaml creater code

17:49 < Savander> ok, i'll send you example mail
17:49 < Savander> sent
17:50 < Savander> i added DMARC and changed rDNS

17:52 < Savander> i sent two messages
17:52 < Savander> and im not in spam 
17:52 < Savander> and i'm on one blacklist?
17:53 < Learath2> you are on this blacklist http://www.spamsources.fabel.dk/
17:54 < Savander> ye i know
17:54 < Savander> I guess, i was there how long i have this VPS
17:54 < Savander> so i don't know what i can do now
17:54 < Savander> ;P.
17:54 < Savander> i think, nothing
17:55 < Learath2> oh well your server looks fine now
17:55 < Savander> question, how to add
17:55 < Savander> break line
17:55 < Learath2> you should not drop to spam anymore after the rdns 
17:55 < Savander> in type/plain
17:55 < Savander> ?
17:55 < Savander> i need to make 2 version of message
17:55 < Savander> Html and plain
17:55 < Learath2> no idea
18:00 < Savander> maybe its  \n
18:01 < Savander> or something
18:04 < coffee> happy new tee
18:10 < BeaR_> Learath2:  src/engine/client/autoupdate:l.37: sizeof(m_Status) sould be sizeof(pUpdate->m_Status)
18:18 < BeaR_> and error C2668:ambiguous call to overloaded function  in json.cpp l.638 and l.664
18:18 < BeaR_> function is pow()
18:31 < Learath2> ehh BeaR_ idk how to fix the second one
18:31 < Learath2> if i make it cpp it compiles fine in mingw
18:33 < BeaR_> hm probably needs typecasts
18:35 < BeaR_> yup changing it to pow(10.0f, .. ) works
18:35 < BeaR_> well curl.lib is missing :D
18:37 < Learath2> BeaR_:  yeah couldnt really find where the lib is as i took the commit which adds libcurl from fisted
18:43 < BeaR_> Learath2: can try to create one from the dll (:
18:43 < Learath2> for that i need msvc no ?
18:44 < BeaR_> y
18:45 < Learath2> BeaR_: could you please do it for me msvc is huge and i have 1 mbps internet 
18:45 < BeaR_> sure, already started :D
18:50 < BeaR_> Learath2: is it normal behaviour when nothing happens when I start the client ?
18:51 < BeaR_> with nothing I mean just normal loading
18:54 < BeaR_> Learath2: how can I send you the .lib ^^
19:00 < Learath2> BeaR_: yeah you need to force it to think its out of date
19:00 < Learath2> client.cpp:L580 changing it with return "test"; should make it work
19:02 < BeaR_> hm works, but crashes /:
19:02 < Learath2> BeaR_: yeah its the https didnt include http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem with it
19:02 < Learath2> as we will use a self signed cert anyway
19:03 < BeaR_> hm?
19:06 < Learath2> its pointed to my server for now which uses a StartCom certificate
19:06 < Learath2> but for update.ddnet.tw we were thinking of using a self signed CA
19:07 < BeaR_> ah ok
19:09 < Savander> i have a question
19:10 < Savander> What i need to do, to get SSL Certificate?
19:10 < Savander> it's for paid?
19:10 < Savander> i know about OpenSSL but
19:10 < Savander> its only for local
19:11 < Savander> and it's not registered in wide network
19:12 < BeaR_> Learath2: Getting an assertion at autoupdated.cpp:l.157 as m_AddedFiles is empty (without the cert, so update.json is empty)
19:12 < Learath2> Savander: i used a StartSSL certificate for everything
19:12 < Learath2> you can get one for free
19:12 < Learath2> yeah thats a bug 
19:13 < BeaR_> well im out, happy new year (:
19:13 < Learath2> fixed it BeaR_
19:13 < Learath2> eh bye
19:31 < Savander> one for free? from where
19:31 < Savander> because now, if i will have one ssls
19:31 < Savander> e.g. on ddforce.net
19:31 < Savander> if you type https://  it will show you it's dangerous website
21:59 < maple> so deen
22:00 < maple> theres this huge skip in mojojump
22:00 < maple> should i ask mapper if i fix it
22:00 < maple> or just fix it
22:21 <@deen> ask mapper
22:31 < Savander> ::33
