00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> o shit
00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> where chiller
00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> filing a missing persons report rn
01:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot ewan im here wat happend
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> o u didnt see my msg
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i just asked for a review on some bash thing i did
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i hardly proofread this but it does work
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/ewancg/spotifyd-notification/blob/master/spotifyd-notification>
01:25 < bridge> <Ewan> well it worked yesterday
01:25 < bridge> <Ewan> now i think it's not saving the key or something
01:25 < bridge> <Ewan> but whatever
01:31 < bridge> <zhn> @chillerdragon why huge afk
01:31 < bridge> <zhn> yo Ewan
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk I wasn‚Äôt gone that long was I?
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bruv ewan I am too lazy to check your entire thing. I found two non problematic things but they are general so you can add them to your bash toolkit.
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 1. don‚Äôt use echo
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 2. handle errors
01:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ewancg/spotifyd-notification/blob/master/spotifyd-notification#L136 this method can throw with exit code 1 but it‚Äôs in a subshell so it won‚Äôt exit the script. And you also don‚Äôt quote it so it might shell expand.
01:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Use `if var=‚Äû$(subshell)‚Äú` to check or use bash strict mode aka set -e
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> o u dont have to read it all
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> if u dont want to
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The reason why echo is trol is it‚Äôs not reliable
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And when you run into its edge cases you will be sad
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> what kind of edge cases
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Run those commands in your terminal
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> echo -a
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> echo -b
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> echo -c
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> echo -d
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> echo -e
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Notice anything unexpected?
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> wher e-e
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> my head hurts
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It gone
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It activated the color mode thingy
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
01:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://youtu.be/lq98MM2ogBk
01:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But ye it‚Äôs rare that you run into it and printf is more annoying to type
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just wanted to let you know. But the error handling thing you should fix
01:41 < bridge> <Ewan> mostly i like the trailing newline
01:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn't know about the  -e thing
01:41 < bridge> <Ewan> hi i missed this
01:42 < bridge> <Ewan> so what did u say i wasnt quoting chiller
01:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ewancg/spotifyd-notification/blob/master/spotifyd-notification#L68
01:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Here you use printf without %s
01:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs also bad practice
01:42 < bridge> <Ewan> o_o
01:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is also echo -n
01:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which sends no newline xd but don‚Äôt use echo
01:43 < bridge> <Ewan> why need %s
01:43 < bridge> <Ewan> this aint c
01:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs like c
01:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Here you didn‚Äôt quote. But more importantly you ignore if that subshell fails with exit code 1. if you get back an error you still continue running here https://github.com/ewancg/spotifyd-notification/blob/master/spotifyd-notification#L136
01:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ewancg/spotifyd-notification/blob/master/spotifyd-notification#L139
01:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im
01:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> On phone bruv so annoying to do this kind of stuff
01:45 < bridge> <Ewan> no need
01:45 < bridge> <Ewan> my head is pounding rn
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why?
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i can hardly intuit ur feedback anyway
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Too much Friday party?
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> no i just fucked up like that i guess
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> im
01:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok time for coffee. Nice that you are bash enjoyer.
01:58 < bridge> <teero777> bash slower than pyson :(
02:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i definitely should have used python for this
02:29 < bridge> <zhn> write in c!

08:57 < bridge> <teero777> im not writing my scripts in rust.
08:57 < bridge> <teero777> please no
09:04 < bridge> <euthanasis> gm
09:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> write them in assembly
09:05 < bridge> <teero777> then it won't work on other machines xd
09:05 < bridge> <teero777> pyson or c is the way!
09:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> i always wondered, why `pyson` ? or is that just a habit :D
09:06 < bridge> <Ewan> why backticks
09:06 < bridge> <teero777> i don't want to directly mention that devilish language
09:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> i didnt know we hate python on here?
09:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> i didnt know we hate python on here :o
09:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> to `flex`
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> is that just a habit

09:09 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/doxyf/StatusLyrics
09:09 < bridge> <teero777> first thing google gives
09:10 < bridge> <ffoundd> The one I was using was by ovalquilter, it broke a few hours agoand so I'm tryna find a replacement :spongebobsad:
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you try out his fixes on his discord? 
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> Some errors that may occur while using Lyrics Status and potential fixes
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> 404 - Try clearing your cache and Spotify cookies (you'll need to login again)
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> 502 - Wait a couple minutes or reload the webpage. It may be a problem with Spotify as opposed to the script.
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
09:18 < bridge> <egyt> It won't be totally incorrect if I translate "Hook collision line" as "Hook trajectory line"?
09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i think u shouldn't change phrasing unless it doesn't make sense otherwise
09:34 < bridge> <egyt> Other opinions?
09:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> its a collision trajectory line, so either we call it `Hook collision trajectory line` if you want to 100% accurately describe it, or leave as is, i dont like `Hook trajectory line`
09:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> (even tho the trajectory under heavy velocity is wrong ingame) ^^
09:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> (even tho the trajectory under heavy velocity is kind of wrong ingame) ^^

11:38 < bridge> <egyt> First of, "Leak IP". Why?
11:38 < bridge> <cyberFighter> because ddnet is ip grabber
11:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no its actually to find the servers real ping or something like that
11:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> because if you dont leak ip or join the server it will just show euro/whatever in the ping
11:39 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246397805954727986/7c5b19753e6f5feb.png?ex=665c3de9&is=665aec69&hm=315350fc0b12247183e0f580d1f43b6726406a26a3f59ef0f6b0e312cae85473&
11:39 < bridge> <egyt> Wrong
11:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> you joined the server before
11:42 < bridge> <egyt> Oh yeah
11:44 < bridge> <egyt> Didn't read careful enough
11:57 < bridge> <Ewan> Wrong!
12:22 < bridge> <egyt> Urgh

12:22 < bridge> <egyt> Another untranslatable string
12:23 < bridge> <egyt> When downloading a map it shows `KiB` and `KiB/s` instead of, in my case, `–ö—ñ–ë` and `–ö—ñ–ë/—Å`
12:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> this is nitpicking at that point imho :D
12:26 < bridge> <egyt> Maybe-maybe, but still
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> do you really use different abbreviations for measurements like that
12:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> they seem to translate that yes
12:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246411021527154688/image.png?ex=665c4a38&is=665af8b8&hm=99193f1c907de3390f47ff8414ec477065b97e6e354c9c2b90a1b67c97d8ec63&
12:32 < bridge> <egyt> Yes, because we have a different alphabet from lating
12:32 < bridge> <egyt> Yes, because we have a different alphabet from latin
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> no kidding
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
12:33 < bridge> <egyt> What's now?
12:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah jupster? ragebaiting smh
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> is this some translator site
12:33 < bridge> <egyt> yes, no jokes, that's how we abbreviate measurements
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> but would it do that if you went into File Explorer or something
12:34 < bridge> <egyt> Yes
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> then do it
12:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> kind of - its more of a "context" checking website
12:34 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246411565633114183/ee413c98c6a84549.png?ex=665c4aba&is=665af93a&hm=f8d50832c38c3431909c6efdc63dd2a2c9464aa53fd40b23f5d2a03989fb57be&
12:34 < bridge> <egyt> But there is no string to do it
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> then pull request
12:35 < bridge> <egyt> you know how it ended last time, don't you?
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> all you have to do is wrap the string literal with Localize()
12:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> well your prior Pull request revealed an error in localizable where the context is never used - so i'd call that a win
12:36 < bridge> <egyt> rather a Pyrrhic victory, because `breakdown`
12:37 < bridge> <egyt> so yeah, don't expect me to make such a PR anytime soon ‚ò†Ô∏è
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> im confused, %.2f KiB is translated? 
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```st
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> %.2f KiB
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û>  == 
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```cpp
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), Localize("%.2f MiB"), Size / 1024.0f);
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û>   else
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û>    str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), Localize("%.2f KiB"), Size);
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
12:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> or is it that it just wont work?
12:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah wait im fucking stupid
12:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> this is demo
12:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
12:45 < bridge> <egyt> Yes, that's only demo
12:47 < bridge> <egyt> Another nitpick: sometimes the string uses `...` and sometimes it uses `‚Ä¶`
12:48 < bridge> <egyt> Another nitpick: in original strings sometimes it's `...` and sometimes it's `‚Ä¶`
12:48 < bridge> <peter0x44> I agree with all this nitpicking
12:48 < bridge> <peter0x44> I do the same
12:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Old strings use `...`, new strings use `‚Ä¶`. We could replace them with `‚Ä¶` in all translation to make it consistent I guess.
13:16 < bridge> <egyt> Why not replace with `...` instead, so you don't have to copy `‚Ä¶` from the string?
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> there‚Äôs probably a reason for using the ellipsis character in the first place
13:21 < bridge> <louis> accounts soon? ü•∫
13:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/gopher_07.mp4 lerato check this out im go enjoyer too now xd
13:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> learn go in one day was a full success
13:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok tbh i still have no idea how go works but hey i managed to spawn a tee on a 0.7 server
13:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to make some 10s tiktok saying "HOW I LEARNED GO FOR GAME DEV IN ONE DAY"
13:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I suppose it gives translators a better hint that it's an ellipsis instead of just three dots. Also for example in Japanese, dots and ellipsis may be displayed differently.
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: https://youtu.be/MAlSjtxy5ak?si=TGFZV9OU3Dq_0rgn make like this but with go :santatrollet:
13:30 < bridge> <egyt> now learn this one https://youtu.be/P3QL1TXIYlM
13:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lmao that video already had a like from me
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wtf is that intro
13:44 < bridge> <learath2> This is the power of go. They have embraced the "itjustworks" mentality. No wrestling with language features, you just write code (at the cost of performance (but not as bad as python) and at the cost of memory footprint(but not as bad as Java))
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I was struggling quite a bit
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Was almost as bad as my teeworlds client in assembly experience
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So far the second hardest language I used to try to create a tw connection
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> My Byte slices had random values at some point. And I wasted a lot of time on figuring out how to do a non blocking read. And somehow my lsp can‚Äôt even autocomplete my variables or methods.
14:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> which LSP ? mine worked
14:05 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, gopls (the lsp) has been working very well for me
14:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it's blazingly fast
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> üöÄ
14:11 < bridge> <learath2> My favourite part is definitely how easy concurrency is and how simple channels make it
14:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yep gopls
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
14:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Must be a skill issue but I somehow expected it to be smoother given how ppl keep saying it‚Äôs good hehe
14:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yea it‚Äôs also horribly slow to go to function definitions in a 29 line file
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller: staypls
14:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> stay where
14:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> At C ?
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont go
14:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but where
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont c where
14:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
14:15 < bridge> <zhn> hm interesting why can't rust have out-crate derive macro semantics
14:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Today I found out there is a programming language called B
14:15 < bridge> <zhn> BPL?
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bpls
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller wait till u hear about D
14:15 < bridge> <zhn> ye don't forget about R
14:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> R
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> F#
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> A+
14:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs a thing?
14:16 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly go is as smooth as it gets. The only thing that remotely confused me was capacity of slices at the very start
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you use go at work right
14:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did not fully understand packaging yet and recommended names
14:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If I make a teeworlds client how should the package be called?
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerbot
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess
14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i work with go as well :owo:
14:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what kind of pkg even?
14:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk if I don‚Äôt rq tomorrow maybe a lib to make chat bots and stuff
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> a pkg where tho
14:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good question xd
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it's usually p str84wrd
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> brah
14:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go docs mention something about not using abbreviations or more than one word xd
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> oh a go pkg
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> no idea
14:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: when rewrite ur chat in go and templ ü§®
14:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://go.dev/blog/package-names
14:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This is a bit non obvious to me
14:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds like I should call it ‚Äûteeworlds‚Äú
14:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean, yea
14:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There isn‚Äôt really conflicting names in go right?
14:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Because you install from source url?
14:27 < bridge> <egyt> and another one: some strings have `:` in them, some don't
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> you can have multiple packages with the same name, aslong as the actual source url is different
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> for example there are 4 `protobytes` packages:
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> github.com/fuck-clash/protobytes
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> github.com/siding9241/protobytes
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> git.hiifong.cc/mirrors/protobytes
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> github.com/eyslce/protobytes

14:45 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
14:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i can't go past 12 months to see my old activity :feelsbadman:

15:03 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
15:03 < bridge> <egyt> I crashed DDNet by rendering demo into a video with a filename of `?`
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> white design is prohibited here xd
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> create issue on gh
15:04 < bridge> <egyt> I thought it would tell me `Please use a different filename`, but it didn't
15:05 < bridge> <robyt3> You get that message when you cut a demo and use the same name as the original demo
15:06 < bridge> <egyt> oh well
15:06 < bridge> <egyt> I discover more and more bugs by translating stuff than by actually playing it
15:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't crash for me on Windows, which OS and client version are you on?
15:11 < bridge> <learath2> twcl? idk
15:30 < bridge> <egyt> Windows 11, 18.2
15:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Do you have a recent crash log in the `dumps` folder in your config dir?

15:37 < bridge> <egyt> so, yeah, kids, don't name your files with forbidden characters
15:40 < bridge> <robyt3> thanks, can be reproduced with 18.2, should be fixed in nightly by #8302
15:40 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8302
15:41 < bridge> <egyt> crazy stuff
15:42 < bridge> <egyt> that's why I love Free Software
15:45 < bridge> <egyt> and, just in case:
15:45 < bridge> <egyt> 
15:45 < bridge> <egyt> 1. I press the "Render" button and name video file `?`
15:45 < bridge> <egyt> 2. I press the "OK" button and it shows up a demo player with the demo stuck on the first frame
15:45 < bridge> <egyt> 3. I press the "Close demo player" button, and the game crashes
15:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> as mentioned, this was reproducable and is fixed now, it will correctly tell you if you're using an invalid string or a duplicate name when you use nightly (beta)
15:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> as mentioned, this was reproducable and is fixed now, it will correctly tell you if you're using an invalid string when you use nightly (beta)

16:28 < bridge> <egyt> I don't even know if it is a nitpick, but if the string for `Please use a different filename` is too long, it makes a new line
16:38 < bridge> <robyt3> That's intentional, the popups message should support multiple lines if the message is longer
16:38 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246472871795232961/image.png?ex=665c83d2&is=665b3252&hm=f637365a641e9d84f05a0ba2056899c3f562a1c1186b98b4f51d81ff6db0a314&

17:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> go hard
17:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> one thing i dont like about go is that you have to name things with uppercase letter to make it public and lowercase to make private
17:09 < bridge> <Ewan> yuck
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> your nested loop looks a little absurd
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> not a big fan of forced naming or whitespace conventions
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone's plasma shit the bed when returning from sleep or locked btw
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> mine does like every time and it's getting old
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah this is so annoying, go really needs a better way of doing visibility
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing you are looking for `if n%i == 0 {; n /= i; }`
17:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> i just turned it off
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> turn what off
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> the bug? xd
17:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> sleep on plasma, it took ages to wake up
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> oh no
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> need sleep
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> power bill
17:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> i searched the WWW and couldnt find a good solution, so i just turned it off loll,
17:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> i searched the WWW and couldnt find a good solution, so i just turned it off lol
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
17:14 < bridge> <Ewan> in my case the dock and desktop and things like that go completely unresponsive
17:14 < bridge> <Ewan> and they are kept in place by the window manager but they don't respond so they are just painted with null brush, i.e. whatever was in front of it
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246482138128322693/IMG_5517.jpg?ex=665c8c74&is=665b3af4&hm=068c41d8bff1fbaaebd2facfa0fcd444e275ba938f4f43c63727d9abcf833821&
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i think u get the picture

17:16 < bridge> <Ewan> thoroughly fucked up
17:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> whatahell - i luckily didnt have that issue XD - my problem was that it took like 3 minutes to actually wake up
17:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that is too long
17:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> gg i divided by 1
17:16 < bridge> <Ewan> from sleep or hibernate?
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> or auto lock
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> which is neither
17:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> sleep
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> bizarre
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i can't rly think of anything that should get in the way of resuming from sleep
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> ironically my desktop feels smoother on integrated graphics :feelsbadman:
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> the terrible state of the nvidia driver
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> the proprietary one has been fine for me for years now
17:19 < bridge> <Ewan> which gpu
17:19 < bridge> <Ewan> when i was running various cards on the 10 series there were very few issues
17:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but i'm on a 3060 now and it's terrible
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> 1080, so it is on the older side
17:20 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah 10 series was great for me
17:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i ran a 1050, a 1060 6GB and a 1070 TI on the nvidia driver with very few issues
17:22 < bridge> <Ewan> a part of it is that the new driver only supports turing and newer, and iirc when I was using arch before they actually had separate packages for the newest cards at the time. maybe just a different driver eventually got merged or re-configured to be the main nvidia driver as it matured
17:22 < bridge> <Ewan> sry, new driver = OSS driver
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4090
17:22 < bridge> <Ewan> what about it
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just little brainwashing
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for my not payment from nvidia
17:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i could never afford it
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have a liver
17:22 < bridge> <Ewan> if i was gonna sell my liver i'd fix my car
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u *still have a liver
17:23 < bridge> <Ewan> or move out
17:24 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah my shell is just completely fucked LOL
17:24 < bridge> <Ewan> and a lot of the apps running under it become unresponsive or must be resized to be restored from a black screen state
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> Well this is not the proprietary driver, have you tried that one?
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> im on the proprietary one rn
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 when u have time for aggounts
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> but i don't think it's an entirely separate driver necessarily
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> Tomorrow perhaps, I'm a little full today
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds fine
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it's their proprietary driver that's been open sourced and modified to be "presentable"
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> but is functionally the same
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> iirc the OSS driver was their data center driver so not quite the same really
17:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
17:27 < bridge> <Ewan> im currently on beta driver 555
17:27 < bridge> <Ewan> because that supports explicit sync
17:27 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246485403482194022/screenshot_2024-06-01_18-26-18.png?ex=665c8f7e&is=665b3dfe&hm=081ccd059b2a21fc5310bfe91bdd41922725499ea4ce2b0c178be1d5fe803491&
17:28 < bridge> <egyt> That's definitely a bug
17:28 < bridge> <Ewan> what is
17:28 < bridge> <egyt> It cuts off tex
17:28 < bridge> <egyt> It cuts off text
17:28 < bridge> <Ewan> where
17:28 < bridge> <egyt> Near the red circle
17:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> cant you see, he sent the screenshot :santatrollet:
17:28 < bridge> <zhn> its not a bug, you should fit in char array buffer xd
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ewan our native ukraine speaker
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant see
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it
17:29 < bridge> <zhn> you can try enlarge it but hey we have 5:4 where it will not fit at all
17:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i think u can wrap it
17:29 < bridge> <Ewan> depending on the method used to render the text there
17:29 < bridge> <egyt> It is a big, because I do fit in char array buffer
17:30 < bridge> <zhn> wouldn't cut it off if it fits in buffer
17:31 < bridge> <zhn> it just copies everything and if your string is a bit larger it will just put `'\0'` at the end
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Might, not all boxes dynamically resize text or grow
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> but it would look graphically cut off, usually not perfectly
17:31 < bridge> <egyt> That's why you should have UI adapting to the length of the string
17:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> that would look horrible on smaller resolutions
17:32 < bridge> <zhn> no i don't really want to see 2px text on my monitor just because translation doesn't fit well
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> We should add chromium and render ui with html
17:32 < bridge> <zhn> ye especially in news feed xd
17:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh my god yes please - i proposed that to stormax like half a year ago into his custom client!
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> Reimplement teeworlds in js and electron
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> he's saying the box resizes to the text
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> not vice versa
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> though there are some spots where it does that
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> There are both in the code iirc
17:34 < bridge> <zhn> i mean this

17:34 < bridge> <learath2> Which one of those strings is cut off btw?
17:35 < bridge> <zhn> first one and last one
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> This looks like it can just be made to grow
17:35 < bridge> <egyt> Replay is cut here:

17:36 < bridge> <egyt> "Don't change the font size, change the button size instead"
17:37 < bridge> <Ewan> right
17:37 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesn't always work

17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fits
17:38 < bridge> <Ewan> eventually the font size bottoms out lol
17:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> :cammostripes:
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> peak GUI, what do u mean
17:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> add that to your version ty
17:38 < bridge> <zhn> yeah but still 5:4
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hater
17:39 < bridge> <egyt> Valve, please, fix DDNet GUI

17:40 < bridge> <egyt> I'm gonna learn Esperanto
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> MHHHHHHHHHHHH
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why go tho?
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> what is valve's new gui thing
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> that they use in dota
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and uhh
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> whats it
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> the new game in beta
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like it would actually be nice to use for game UIs if it was open source
17:41 < bridge> <egyt> It's a miracle that my translation fits almost perfectly

17:41 < bridge> <egyt> Keyword: almost
17:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> i wanted to see myself why people praise GO to be a good "beginner" language - and it competes with rust in terms of speed
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never xd
17:42 < bridge> <zhn> oh key problem here that it concats all the things in one string and then renders in box
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> go uses GC
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but since learath likes it, it might still be a good lang
17:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i know another C wizard who is partial to go
17:43 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe it's a thing
17:44 < bridge> <zhn> ye its easy to write anything in go
17:44 < bridge> <zhn> prototyping speed is really high there
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in rust, when u code smth and it compiles it magically works
17:44 < bridge> <zhn> ye so you don't really debug runtime problems but compile time
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
17:45 < bridge> <zhn> friend of mine whos go dev hates rust so much
17:45 < bridge> <zhn> he started his list of rust problems
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and u still call him your friend?
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> this happens to me so much
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but not in rust
17:45 < bridge> <zhn> one of them is that he can't put serde derive macro on out-of-crate structs
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> and is able to do so in csharp and go
17:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i go down crazy refactor rabbit holes and if it compiles it's usually good enough for me
17:46 < bridge> <Ewan> but i hate it
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> ~~sfinae~~
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that might suck, but which crate does not implement serde? xd
17:46 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe adhd thing
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> idk
17:46 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> he also tried to prove me that i can do so in java
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> and
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> out-of-package type implemented Serialized interface
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> java
17:47 < bridge> <zhn> like xd
17:47 < bridge> <zhn> your type IS serializable
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> go is one thing
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but java is another
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> another level of disrespect
17:47 < bridge> <zhn> he also said that aot compiling allows to use reflection in its fullest
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use micro which is written in go
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i dunno what java app i use
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what reflection?
17:48 < bridge> <zhn> type reflection ig
17:49 < bridge> <zhn> introspection and so
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah that shit
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the worst part about java xd
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> is it
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> helps for runtime loading of classes and for error handling
17:51 < bridge> <learath2> go takes it one step further by making it easier to write code that compiles (at great cost to performance or memory footprint that is)
17:52 < bridge> <learath2> the gc comes with many downsides that are common to all gc'd languages, the cost of not having to think about memory management at all is always performance, I would probably never write a game in go, it's impossible to give the gc a deadline so it'd give you inconsistent frame times
17:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> go wouldnt be my "go-to language"(no pun intended) for things that require performance
17:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> its just easy to get started and write working stuff
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh for me it's not so much about GC. You know that i am biggest RAII fan
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> Ah yep, no raii is a bit of a paradigm shift
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just think with most GC models the code cannot be clean
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and yes i am hater
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> as a C enjoyer, I was used to not having RAII anyway
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mostly wrote code in java & typescript when it comes to GC
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i cannot really judge about it
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i disliked writing in those languages, even if they clearly had other benefits
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> I need to find a youtube video to watch while I cook very quickly
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> yeah, many other things to dislike in java and typescript before you get to the gc
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rust has no async drop, that kinda sucks too xdd
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on other hand side, i guess i prefer to use as few async as possible anyway
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> async is simply always hard
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> one reason i hate typescript too
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u cannot opt out of async really
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> I'm still not completely sold on the idea of async with green threads, but I just trust that people smarter than me ran the numbers on them üòÑ
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it really depends on the task anyway.
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but generally it scales up to a certain degree
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u have 200 database connections that are mostly busy u don't want 200 threads too
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blaiszephyr didnt u do the benchmarks
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> kernel schedulers got better too, I wonder how bad that is nowadays
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep, but i'd say windows still sucks
18:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i did bombard my rustAPI with requests once yes, didnt really benchmark it tho :D
18:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i sent 50 requests every second and saw if it still operates normally
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh i thought i get epyc benchmarks now
18:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> @gerdoe go benchmark api really quick, im not on linux atm
18:01 < bridge> <zhn> it sucks cuz http1
18:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> http1 xd
18:02 < bridge> <zhn> html5 sounds funnier
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> wanted to stick userver here as a nice example of async code, but it looks like usual code xdd
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> still async thoguh

18:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont get that
18:15 < bridge> <Ewan> ur basically guaranteeing deletion of all the invites
18:37 < bridge> <egyt> So, uh, I need to make a list of issues I have, because I forgot some of them X\_X
18:59 < bridge> <Ewan> the preferred solution would be to make GitHub issues as you find them
19:00 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz we can discuss them in here all day but then people will forget about them unless they're tracked
19:18 < bridge> <egyt> sooo, the list is something like this

19:22 < bridge> <egyt> I'm kinda useful
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i do not think you should translate ddnet or tee
19:24 < bridge> <egyt> Yeah, that's what I am going to report
19:24 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246514790235635852/60c147134b449b19.png?ex=665caadd&is=665b595d&hm=5631e0df9eb0c9e06ffec04b8ed968c91c705ccc52f15709c90099b10b58ce01&
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> btw i'm almost going to guarantee nobody will do anything about this unless you make an issue
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> or multiple
19:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> send link to this `–î—ñ–î—ñ–ù–µ—Ç` string in translation file
19:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can you send link to this `–î—ñ–î—ñ–ù–µ—Ç` string in translation file
19:31 < bridge> <egyt> I can't, because I modified it in my own translation
19:32 < bridge> <egyt> I can't, because I modified it in my own translation for the purposes of demostration
19:32 < bridge> <egyt> I can't, because I modified it in my own translation for purposes of demonstration
19:32 < bridge> <egyt> I'll make them, especially the "UI doesn't adapt to strings, it's kinda opposite" one
19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it's best to be specific about your issues
19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> cite instances of where the text does not fit and how you expect it to behave
19:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> > [ ] "DDNet" (as the tab in settings) is translatable and Tee (as the tab in settings) is not
19:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what does this mean?
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> but if you say "yeah this is a bad thing that's happening" there's no clear resolution to the issue
19:37 < bridge> <zhn> why do you want to hardcode DDNet and Tee namings
19:38 < bridge> <egyt> Sent the picture below the list
19:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you want to translate `DDNet` as `–î—ñ–î—ñ–ù–µ—Ç`?
19:40 < bridge> <egyt> No, rather vice versa...
19:40 < bridge> <egyt> For "Tee" to become translatable, and for "DDNet" to become UNtranslatable
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> isn't Tee translatable
19:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there's no word `–î—ñ–î—ñ–ù–µ—Ç` in translation file. what are you gonna untranslate
19:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my reptile brain dotn get it
19:43 < bridge> <egyt> It is not
19:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my reptile brain dont get it
19:44 < bridge> <egyt> I told you that I modified MY OWN translation, it is not in the repo
19:44 < bridge> <egyt> I told you that I modified MY OWN translation (so I can show that "DDNet" is translatable), it is not in the repo
19:46 < bridge> <archimede67> @milkeeycat
19:46 < bridge> <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246520175549747201/image.png?ex=665cafe1&is=665b5e61&hm=c21028711c1bec3ce40b3725b9bb32ff4103798ed215fd340ba8f904fb03b9d0&
19:46 < bridge> <archimede67> This is what he means
19:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ooooooooooooh
19:46 < bridge> <archimede67> As you can see `Localize("DDNet")` means that the string `DDNet` will be translated
19:46 < bridge> <egyt> Not really, but yeah
19:47 < bridge> <archimede67> bruh yes this is what you mean
19:47 < bridge> <egyt> I meant that I modified my `ukrainian.txt`, but... ok, gonna continue writing issues
19:47 < bridge> <archimede67> ...
19:48 < bridge> <archimede67> what I just posted is to illustrate "so I can show that "DDNet" is translatable"
19:48 < bridge> <archimede67> because clearly your explanation wasn't clear enough
19:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> communication hard
19:48 < bridge> <archimede67> anyways it's an easy fix
19:49 < bridge> <robyt3> It's not just the "DDNet" string itself, a bunch of other strings contain "DDNet", which should more correctly be untranslated and replaced with `GAME_NAME` to be more mod-friendly
19:49 < bridge> <archimede67> In this case it is the "DDNet" string itself
19:49 < bridge> <archimede67> oh yeah I see what you mean
19:50 < bridge> <robyt3> `DDNet Client updated!` -> `%s Client updated!` (with `GAME_NAME`) inserted as the placeholder
19:50 < bridge> <archimede67> yeah
19:51 < bridge> <archimede67> but `%s Client` isn't translatable the same way for all languages
19:52 < bridge> <archimede67> in French for example it would be `client %s` for `client DDNet`
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't seem like an issue now though and placeholders can be reorders in the translation
19:54 < bridge> <archimede67> ah true
19:54 < bridge> <robyt3> For example Azeri uses this:
19:54 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
19:54 < bridge> <robyt3> %d of %d servers
19:54 < bridge> <robyt3> == %2$d serverd…ôn %1$d …ôd…ôdi
19:54 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> > [ ] UI doesn't adapt to strings (it's rather strings adapting to UI by changing the font size)
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not very easy to solve and would cause other issues like buttons overlapping, especially because we also support screen with less width (5:4 resolutions)
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> > [ ] "Empty demo" and "Error reading demo header" strings are not translatable
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Not really worth it IMO since those are internal error messages
20:12 < bridge> <zhn> huh, i remember Tee being in a translation .txt
20:13 < bridge> <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246527083006525510/image.png?ex=665cb64f&is=665b64cf&hm=51cce7ed0a45273a71f0f0599a7f08b4016eef831031f8f5c127204777f3f553&
20:13 < bridge> <zhn> such a joke
20:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Same issue as DDNet basically
20:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Though it seems unnecessarily complicated to make the string Tee untranslated in all translations
20:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why do tees in spec not have a pos here
20:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246531072108396665/image.png?ex=665cba07&is=665b6887&hm=78772a973f6066be7d4022f40c0c58a6b4bd26e521e50a9bebac1114db33591b&
20:31 < bridge> <zhn> wdym
20:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> are you talking about /spec vanishing the tee or /pause?
20:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> /spec
20:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> are you talking about /spec vanishing the tee or /pause?, because it makes sense why tee's in /spec dont have a pos

22:09 < bridge> <egyt> ~~Cash? I would like some cash, because they say that doing it for free is stupid~~
22:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats the fun in FOSS projects!
22:09 < bridge> <zhn> its kinda radical changes to ui to actually implement it
22:13 < bridge> <egyt> That will give more freedom to translators, though
22:14 < bridge> <zhn> ehm its kinda late to give any freedom to translators
22:14 < bridge> <zhn> this game is almost 20 years old
22:18 < bridge> <egyt> So what? The community is growing right now, and it is definitely not "too late"

22:25 < bridge> <zhn> do it üòõ
22:26 < bridge> <egyt> Not a coder, that's why I opened an issue and not a pull request
22:27 < bridge> <egyt> After all, I am a translator in the first place üòõ
22:27 < bridge> <zhn> i don't mind of these changes being implemented but truth is that this problem was here for this ~20 years and yet nothing changed except translation context and box fitting text
22:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> i gave my fair bit of opinion egyt, we have to think about compatibilty with smaller screens and different resolutions - i mean ddnet latest still runs on windows XP - tested by furo :D
22:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> so its not unlikely someone will play on a 1024x768 monitor - and the UI would look horrible if every single string goes out of view
22:30 < bridge> <egyt> Yeah, that one will be a hard one, but if it will be done, it will pay off
22:33 < bridge> <zhn> not really xd
22:41 < bridge> <egyt> Well, I won't promise, but I might also check Esperanto\* translation and even add two new ones üòè
22:41 < bridge> <egyt> \*After I learn it, of course
22:42 < bridge> <egyt> Really crazy stuff going here
22:43 < bridge> <zhn> yeah maybe i'll finish my tatar translation too
22:43 < bridge> <egyt> Is this like fifth one today?
22:43 < bridge> <egyt> And fourth one from Robyt3?
22:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> you do one thing and find 4 more things, welcome to coding.
22:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> you do one thing and find 4 more things, welcome to coding. :P
22:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Exactly. All I wanted to fix was the `$` which I randomly found because I searched for it when looking for uses of the format argument reordering
22:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Then I found the weird error messages and had to improve the error handling :justatest:
22:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
22:46 < bridge> <egyt> So my breakdown is not a rare case
22:46 < bridge> <robyt3> And this ended with finding a cursed bug in the line reader
22:46 < bridge> <egyt> So me "finding" a bug while trying to translate something is not rare
22:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> i think most of your cases come from wanting to translate everything 100% accurately (which i respect by the way)
22:46 < bridge> <egyt> So me "finding" a bug while trying to translate something is not rare. Oh well.

22:48 < bridge> <egyt> literally me
22:49 < bridge> <egyt> But yeah, translations are really important, you better have a good one or none at all

22:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh god how much i love playing a game and you get a

22:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> we are translating entities in german :justatest:
22:52 < bridge> <peter0x44> since you'd have to be passing the string to a function that isn't printf
22:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> we are translating entities in german :justatest:, because i PR'd that.
22:52 < bridge> <egyt> I'm too
22:52 < bridge> <zhn> did you ever use all of these in your gameplay chatting routine
22:52 < bridge> <egyt> I've translated "Assets" as "Resources"
22:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> dudettes be using println
22:52 < bridge> <zhn> because russians do not
22:52 < bridge> <egyt> Imagine that
22:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> i dont like that XD - game assets and game resources are definitly not the same
22:53 < bridge> <zhn> @milkeeycat is that true xd
22:53 < bridge> <egyt> L
22:53 < bridge> <peter0x44> the distinction between assets and resources is that assets are supposed to be edited, resources aren't
22:53 < bridge> <peter0x44> (afaik - that's what it is to me anyway)
22:53 < bridge> <egyt> We don't have a really good words for "Assets", or maybe I just couldn't find it
22:53 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> tee = player? :poggers2:
22:53 < bridge> <egyt> Makes sence to me
22:54 < bridge> <zhn> also –¥–∞–º–ºi and –¥–µ–º–æ are just transliterations, not a real translations kekw
22:54 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> there's Tee and Player tab in game settings, what you gonna do about it
22:54 < bridge> <egyt> You don't have to translate word by word
22:54 < bridge> <zhn> there's no such word as –¥–∞–º–º–∏
22:54 < bridge> <zhn> thats why i say untranslatable
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> a tee is a player's entity, its like "Frankfurt" - its a Name that's not supposed to be translated IMHO
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> DDNet stands for Dummy Drag Network - also shouldnt be translated
22:55 < bridge> <peter0x44> that's called "proper noun"
22:55 < bridge> <peter0x44> and they are supposed to be always capitalized
22:55 < bridge> <egyt> I always wanted to ask what it stands for
22:55 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> there will be misunderstandings between people who know proper names and people who know non word by word translations
22:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> DDRaceNetwork, Dummy Drag Race Network
22:55 < bridge> <zhn> would have been –°–µ—Ç—å –¢–∞—Å–∫–∞–Ω–∏—è –î–∞–º–º–∏ (–°–¢–ù) xd
22:56 < bridge> <egyt> Better than TTT standing for WWW in Esperanto though
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> ttt.google.com
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> wild.
22:56 < bridge> <zhn> 3 2 vs or 3 ts
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> ttt.google.com
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> wild.
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> (im kidding)
22:56 < bridge> <egyt> Also, uh, I don't know etymology of a word "tee", and "—Ç—ñ" just- it just doesn't sound good, okay?
22:56 < bridge> <zhn> > untranslatable
22:57 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> tee doesn't mean anything in english either
22:57 < bridge> <egyt> I know
22:57 < bridge> <egyt> T-shirts!
22:57 < bridge> <egyt> I FEEL AN URGE TO TRANSLATE "TEE" AS A "T-SHIRT"
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> please dont. if i ever get a single person on discord asking "how to change t-shirt color"
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> please dont. if i ever get a single person on discord asking "how to change t-shirt color" - i'll drop my hobby as a discord helper
22:58 < bridge> <egyt> That was a joke, obviously
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> you never know..
22:58 < bridge> <zhn> moderator application when
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> i thought about it, but i dont know if i'll be a good fit really
22:59 < bridge> <zhn> not good but one of the best xd
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> ¬∞_¬∞
22:59 < bridge> <egyt> At least you are kind
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> to hear that from a veteran who stepped back :pepecry:
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> stepped down? how do you say "zur√ºckgetreten" correctly
23:00 < bridge> <zhn> im not jao
23:00 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> jao shooter
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i do get a lot of DM's from people asking me to help them with certain things tho - i guess im just so active they see me as a moderator already :kek:
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> –ü—ñ—à–æ–≤ —É –≤—ñ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫—É
23:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh you'd say `resigned` i guess
23:02 < bridge> <egyt> https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTT
23:02 < bridge> <egyt> Also, too bad Esperanto doesn't have an official keyboard for windows and macos
23:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> how many DM's to i have to send murpi to sign up for mod? like 3 a day?
23:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> how many DM's to i have to send murpi to sign up for mod outside of open applications? like 3 a day?
23:04 < bridge> <egyt> Interslavic has a W, though, because they use Czech alphabet for Latin
23:04 < bridge> <egyt> Interslavic takes a W, though, because they use Czech alphabet for Latin
23:05 < bridge> <egyt> Probs because Esperanto-specific letters are, well, only specific to Esperanto
23:05 < bridge> <egyt> Interslavic takes a W, though, because they use Czech alphabet for Latin
23:06 < bridge> <egyt> Probs because Esperanto-specific letters are, well, only specific to Esperanto
23:06 < bridge> <egyt> In the meantime, Interslavic takes a W, because they use Czech alphabet for Latin
23:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> much fun if you code in natural languages that don't have that upper-/lowercase concept like japanese or chinese
23:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> although I guess it's kinda cool that you can see at the usage site whether a symbol is public or not
23:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are work-arounds to that. how do you do that in go though?
23:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> you can use `marshalling` for json serialization ig
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but then you can't customize the serialization impl for types not in your module, either, can you?
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but then you can't customize the serialization impl for types not in your module either, can you?
23:16 < bridge> <learath2> you have to use reflection for it
