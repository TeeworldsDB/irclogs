01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rude. Stop banning people. He might be using a bit of a insulting language. But I think what he suggests would be cool. Why not remove keywords like class and private from a C codebase to make it more portable to C++
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also Linus torvalds insults and the kernel is doing fine. Political correctness should be banned instead!
01:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I didn‚Äôt read the full post yet just watched his propaganda video xd
01:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
01:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ‚ÄûDEATH TO LINUS TORVALDS‚Äú for not allowing to run the kernel headers from C++ is a bit intense I agree ‚Ä¢.‚Ä¢
02:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Meh I have to use some spreadsheets. What office suites are yall using? I somewhat managed to dodge any "word" tooling with a hello world latex file :D
02:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Libreoffice is just horrible
02:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706319033.png
02:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> look at this bloated uglyness i cant
02:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Isnt there some neat new lightweight linux desktop blazingly fast hyper modern dark mode spreadsheet tool?
02:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> something like this
02:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706319132.png
02:35 < bridge> <zhn> native app vs electron based one
02:35 < bridge> <zhn> yeah bloatware no way
02:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I think im going with this vscode extension and raw csv files for now as long as i can
02:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv
02:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but something non electron that can also load xlsx would be pog
02:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> someone has to have built something already in a day. I don't need fakin turning complete excel function macros. Just read write common office formats
02:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
02:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> shit the extension has too many bugs
02:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki do you ever have to use spreadsheets?
02:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
02:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lucky u
02:56 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
02:56 < bridge> <Ewan> use excel online
02:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it's quite good
02:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i rather not depend on a working internet connection and web tools are usually bloat since the browser it self is bloat already
02:56 < bridge> <Ewan> then i guess you are SOL
02:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you have a link to a good one?
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a link to excel online
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> by microsoft
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> who makes excel
02:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do i need to sign in there?
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> well yea
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> just to ms
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it's free
02:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats not an option either
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
02:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why would i want to sign in to an account to do tables? :D 
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> so u can access your tables when  you log in somewhere else
02:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont want that
02:58 < bridge> <Ewan> why has anyone ever signed into any cloud service
02:58 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
02:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont have to sign in to watch youtube videos
02:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont have to sign in to do jsfiddles
02:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> etc
02:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sign in can always be made optional
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i agree but the world doesn't work that way
02:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but ye i rather use google than ms since their web is better. But the google spreadsheet is too slow for me already. Given my pc power and internet speed its just not smooth enough
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> google's web is not better than microsoft's LOL
02:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is i was told
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i will always choose the MS product over the google one
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it'
02:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for desktop maybe
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it's consistently faster and more well-integrated
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> no, for mobile too
03:00 < bridge> <Ewan> and web
03:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but google is king of the web
03:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> duude there has to be a simple foss tool for simple spreadsheets
03:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is this the world we live in? Where everyone signs in to accounts to use spreadsheets!?
03:01 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
03:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i refuse to believe
03:01 < bridge> <Ewan> u can't even use desktop office without signing in
03:01 < bridge> <Ewan> u can run some old version of excel in wine and it would probably run very well
03:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i want something that probably runs well i rather run libreoffice calc
03:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i want something that runs good, is fast and looks hot af
03:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://edit-csv.net/
03:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uwan check this out
03:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its not there yet
03:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still too bloat ugly and slow cuz web
03:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> linus stopped doing it
03:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: just use libreoffice ^^
03:27 < bridge> <learath2> https://youtu.be/lLv1s7rKeCM
03:32 < bridge> <learath2> There seems to be a theme with you and enjoying closed source software and walled gardens, don‚Äôt make me ping ryozuki
03:34 < bridge> <learath2> Should be taken to an asylum
03:59 < bridge> <Ewan> google drive is oss now?
03:59 < bridge> <Ewan> or what are u trying to imply
03:59 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
04:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i am a big foss proponent but that does not mean that i will personally choose the open source alternative every time
04:01 < bridge> <Ewan> when it comes to actual functionality you can't really beat the existing closed source software that still is on top in many fields
04:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 libreoffice is so ugly :c 
04:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato thanks for C propganda video i added it to watch later
04:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Hello #developerGPT i have the following code in my tick ``if(time_get() % time_freq() == 0)`` and want it to be true once a second. But it doesnt work. Can you write me some correct code?
04:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah i guess i need to use tick instead otherwise it might not tick when this condition is true
04:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok got it this works ``if(Server()->Tick() % Server()->TickSpeed() == 0)`` 
04:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> was about to say that but then I thought I would say something dumb
04:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i have been using Server()->Tick() for years and suddenly decided to use time_get() at least now i understand why time_get() doesnt work
04:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 i started my question with "Hello #developerGPT" so i was ready to handle some halucinations xd
04:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O true
04:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> my first though was to say (bropaganda)
04:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> my first though was to say bropaganda
04:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watfak
04:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> My GPT was in need of water
04:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
04:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as a language model i find this funny
04:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki when write blog post about time_get() vs Server()->Tick()
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> aghhhh!!!

04:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ewwan .exe
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> pulling my hair out rn
05:23 < bridge> <stepfunn> can you tell me why i cant configure my dev environment. I just cloned the repo fresh and tried to configure cmake. im on windows using visual studio. followed the readme but it aint workin
05:23 < bridge> <stepfunn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200657315167207424/image.png?ex=65c6fa43&is=65b48543&hm=252295f618c20208d94269b2b8f7a0e0b5683cb95b4de828322a94e765cdf2cb&
05:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> thats where ryo would recommend you to use linux :KEKW:
05:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ngl I had a damn easy setup with a set command, dependencies downloaded and directory set in like 1 minute
05:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> on linux
05:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> on windows, kill it with fire
05:29 < bridge> <stepfunn> i mean the error tells me there is no instance of visual studio
05:29 < bridge> <stepfunn> do i actually need vs cus i use vs code
05:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot @stepfunn developin?
05:30 < bridge> <stepfunn> yea gonna do chat filter myself üôÇ
05:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then either visual studio has been incorrectly setup, or cmake had been. try reinstalling cmake first, faster
05:30 < bridge> <stepfunn> just need the project to run
05:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @stepfunn use chillerbot-ux it has chat filter already
05:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :owo: lmao, old recommendation by me
05:30 < bridge> <stepfunn> bruh
05:31 < bridge> <stepfunn> when add it to ddnet client
05:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chillerbot.github.io/
05:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its ddnet based
05:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> alongside blackmagic coding, ye why not
05:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :owo:
05:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just cba to pr this right now and do all the politics to get it merged
05:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> oh zamn, chiller injection
05:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :poggers2:
05:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> f1 ``chat_filter_add badword`` and you wont see messages in chat containing "badword"
05:32 < bridge> <stepfunn> since when do you have a chatfilter on the client
05:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it wont save if you quit the client
05:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so add your fav blacklisted words to your autoexec.cfg
05:32 < bridge> <stepfunn> bruh
05:32 < bridge> <stepfunn> ah ok
05:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since idk a few years i think
05:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then its good
05:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i needed it once when the spam on BlmapChill block server was too bad
05:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepeW: :question_ddnet:
05:33 < bridge> <stepfunn> but will the words be blocked anywhere. so im talking kill message, voting, scoreboard....
05:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was a "NIGGER WE THE BEST" copy pasta every 2seconds so i added the filter
05:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and still got no actual blacklist on ddnet client??
05:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is only for chat
05:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> makes sense
05:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> similar case for stepfunn
05:34 < bridge> <stepfunn> hm its a start but kinda need it for everything
05:34 < bridge> <stepfunn> the whole package
05:34 < bridge> <stepfunn> what else do you have in that client?
05:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> you mean a wordlist full of curses?
05:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> adding it everywhere should be easy but it might conflict with ddnet so i will probably not do it to reduce maintencane effort
05:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @stepfunn block warlist so you have green and red names 
05:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @stepfunn password manager to auto login in accounts like ifcity kog rcon etc
05:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @stepfunn automated smalltalk you can reply to "how are you?" "whats your mouse sense?" etc with a single bind
05:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So like all qol features?
05:35 < bridge> <stepfunn> do you have that tabbed out auto responder as well?
05:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
05:36 < bridge> <stepfunn> ah thats nice
05:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so you can set up "sry im afk" while tabbed out, cool
05:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> afk is exta feature
05:36 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why build instructions have u use cmake gui
05:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not the right way to do it
05:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you have visual studio yeah?
05:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can say "afk 5" in f1 and it will reply to pings "i am back in x minutes"
05:36 < bridge> <stepfunn> vs code
05:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ahhhh
05:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> starting to like this chiller client thing :gigachad:
05:37 < bridge> <stepfunn> i guess thats not enough
05:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it has virus that steals your data and mines bitcoin
05:37 < bridge> <Ewan> nop vscode is p different from real visual studio
05:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
05:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxaxxa
05:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but you can get a dev setup easy
05:37 < bridge> <Ewan> if u buy my book
05:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ah fck it, Ill fund you :kek:
05:37 < bridge> <stepfunn> yea i used visual studio back then when i deved c#
05:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wowo stepdev
05:37 < bridge> <stepfunn> idk i just like vs code so much more now
05:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah vscode is good
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> problem is vs comes with compilers and tools when u install the workflows, vscode doesn't
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> u either need to install standalone vs build tools, the whole ide, or use msys
05:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if this gets a streamer to use chillerbot-ux i might accept some feature requests from you @stepfunn hehe
05:38 < bridge> <stepfunn> yea cant i just install a compiler extension :kek:
05:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> vscode is what I use, the plugins are nicer there
05:38 < bridge> <Iza> for c++ vs is better
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a big hassle
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> false
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> well
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> depends
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> usually false
05:39 < bridge> <Iza> it has such a good dev environment from scratch tho
05:39 < bridge> <stepfunn> lol
05:39 < bridge> <Ewan> @stepfunn there is a vscode workspace for ddnet in the other folder of the src tree, but it was hard to set up on windows since nobody ever tested it there lol
05:39 < bridge> <stepfunn> well i waited like over 2 years for a chat filter so im kinda done waiting
05:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i have it working but with other compilers n tools than you would be using
05:39 < bridge> <Ewan> the easiest way to build ddnet for u rn is to just download real visual studio
05:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :owo: recommend account system
05:40 < bridge> <stepfunn> hm yea i guess i will just get vs community
05:40 < bridge> <stepfunn> its what ever
05:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @stepfunn but u know a chat filter will be a cat and mouse game right?
05:40 < bridge> <Ewan> the dream
05:40 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200661557265322034/image.png?ex=65c6fe36&is=65b48936&hm=21755e02e642857b94cbd284886fecfdf2356e02537ef6a84f9e82b88e992454&
05:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least for streamers
05:40 < bridge> <stepfunn> :justatest:
05:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for me it worked because nobody knew what filters i have
05:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, people find a way to bypass it if the filter is not configured enough
05:41 < bridge> <Ewan> for some reason qt creator build config doesn't put quotes around strings when u copy it ‚ÅâÔ∏è
05:41 < bridge> <stepfunn> i know yea. and i will have a HUGE file of filtered words at some point
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxD
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then you get false positives
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what about using the option to only show messages from friends?
05:41 < bridge> <stepfunn> nah
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because faking names in ddnet is illegal anyways xd
05:41 < bridge> <stepfunn> they rename to friends names
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it cant be bypassed
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono thats illegal
05:41 < bridge> <stepfunn> XDDDDDDD
05:41 < bridge> <stepfunn> ok bro
05:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, you could just have ***AI*** do it for u :troll:
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i fixed it
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ez regex
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200662010661187624/image.png?ex=65c6fea2&is=65b489a2&hm=d3b4677ee26cec33a5bf3ce694eae61947731607d1275c12a995e82473a789d8&
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with a big list i would be super scared of false positives
05:42 < bridge> <stepfunn> need me some agi
05:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> eh, yeah I assume its ez idk
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> image you mess important chat messages from frints because they get detected
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> miss*
05:42 < bridge> <stepfunn> better false positives then shit getting through
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mood
05:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> at least he is optimistic
05:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sure buy chilerbot today and give it a try :3
05:43 < bridge> <stepfunn> what did you fix
05:43 < bridge> <Ewan> this
05:43 < bridge> <stepfunn> oh
05:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> as I said, lemme have your chillerbo- I mean, client yeah
05:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> lemme have that :owo:
05:44 < bridge> <Ewan> problem is when i select config values and right click to copy
05:44 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200662497519218759/image.png?ex=65c6ff16&is=65b48a16&hm=8798e3e20e964d9789192436753b9f1de9a288c0ee48ad37db8df2274784f6f8&
05:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it won't put values that need quotes in quotes
05:44 < bridge> <Ewan> all these matches are values which should have quotes

05:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> still safer
05:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> than all the other bs
05:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chilerbot has like 2 users

06:36 < bridge> <Ewan> our cmake makes targeting android kind of a pain
06:36 < bridge> <Ewan> not ddnet
06:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it's supposed to make libappname-arch.so but it just makes appname
09:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have been doing ``COUNT (*) AS count`` my entire life omagawd 
09:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> w out space omagawd
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``COUNT(*) AS count ORDER BY count``
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but why have i done it if also this works ``COUNT() ORDER BY COUNT()``
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even this works the same ``COUNT(69) ORDER BY COUNT(*)``
09:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay i am officially only using this from now on ever ``COUNT('people who use count as are trols') ORDER BY COUNT(420 - 69)``
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay even string concat works so this is even funnier ``COUNT('people who use ''count as'' are trols') ORDER BY COUNT(420 - 69)``
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got clean 1000 finishes on ddnet pog

11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> trol
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> im losing my mind
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it's a qt creator bug
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> the android plugin incorrectly reporting a kit's supported ABIs
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 i'm on windows now
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> am i right in the assumption that windows sends no maximize or restore event?
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but does send a minimized event
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> it does
11:13 < bridge> <robyt3> not sure if it even sends a minimized event, because it already starts out minimized
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it sends event 7
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone know if i can make clangd load the whole index into memory
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> for fast
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is beyond broken xD
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> wat are u debugging
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u start a app minimized on windows, it sends a minized event.. good
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if u maximize the app then it seems like it doesnt send a maximize or restore event
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you can't really check if the window restored in a nice way
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> mh wdym doesn't send event. because i can basically guarantee you that on the lowest level there is a message being sent and received and processed by sdl's windowproc, but whether it makes it to you is a different story
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 if i tab out twice
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it works
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with the pr
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it sends a restore event
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
11:16 < bridge> <robyt3> :pepeW:
11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> IMO the pr is correct.. that there is no resize event sucks, i dunno if we really should add special cases for this
11:17 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe it doesn't know that it's minimized so you don't get the restore event on the first try?
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess so. maybe it's even a SDL bug
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> likely
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> sdl has lots of windowing bugs on windows
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u said u still get validation errors with the PR?
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would really surprise me
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> many instances of wrong measurements being reported in hi dpi environments
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then for you it works differently=
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then for you it works differently?
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and the thing where you can't opaquely handle window resizes
11:18 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, still the same errors as before, about width/height being zero
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> and the thing where you can't opaquely handle window resizes without an event filter
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how is that possible, for me it never enters the code region where it could throw this error, bcs without the restore event the rendering is paused
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> help me help u
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i am very curious
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe it does
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nvm then @robyt3
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> D:
11:20 < bridge> <robyt3> If you want to log the validation errors on restart you need `dbg_gfx 4; logfile log.log` in your `autoexec.cfg`, doesn't work when in config or console argument when restarting
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont have vk sdk installed anyway i guess
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can we force maximized somehow xd
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> not force but u can set the window maximized
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> which is a thing i forgot iw as gonna add
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> :X
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and is that event handled directly? xd
11:22 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if this is an sdl issue. Have you verified that we definitely get no event for the unminimize?
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not async
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont get any
11:22 < bridge> <Ewan> window messages are always handled synchronously>
11:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate it when i open the game and it's the size of my screen but it's not maximized
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if i tab out and in again it sends one xd
11:22 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> send me link to checkout
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> so i can see
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> Well next thing I would check if SDL is getting the winapi event properly
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i added ``
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             dbg_msg("w-event", "with code %d", Event.window.event);``
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in input.cpp
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then simply start client minimized
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> u are not actually debugging
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> x
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we don't drop any events
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the logging should be correct
11:24 < bridge> <learath2> As long as you put it in the right place it should be fine üòÑ
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone touch cmake code related to atomic recently

11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> no default case
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> can't be sure ur ingesting 100% of window events
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> why discord format my screenshot like that
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't handle mouse enter, mouse leave, or focus gain events
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> how are u starting the app minimized
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> create shortcut
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and in the shortcut change the settings
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> mh
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i added the log before the switch
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fck i dont have access to my gh on windows xdd
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 can u apply this patch?
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1200752700057456701/bugfix.patch?ex=65c75318&is=65b4de18&hm=6210655c1a045bb729f444126f237711062b45d7e2e41e0f3db80197ea143326&
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and check if it removes the validation errors
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> meanwhile i try to get https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-vulkan-validation-layers working
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè

11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> checking vk validation layers

11:46 < bridge> <Ewan> dunno what that's about
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, fcking utf8
11:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Should never happen, maybe you have uninitialized memory somewhere
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> this is upstream master xd
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe *you* have uninitialized memory somewhere...
11:47 < bridge> <robyt3> With which OS and compiler?
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> win11 msys mingw ucrt runtime
11:47 < bridge> <robyt3> The crash dump would help a lot because it would say where the invalid UTF-8 comes from
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it was a fluke
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> no idea how to reproduce
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> just funny
11:48 < bridge> <robyt3> If you have the crash dump then that's not required
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> later
11:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Or did you build without exception handling?
11:49 < bridge> <Ewan> if i start it minimized, i can't get ddnet to display anything until i minimize it again and then bring it to fg
11:49 < bridge> <Ewan> is this what u are trying to fix
11:49 < bridge> <robyt3> yes
11:49 < bridge> <Ewan> ic
11:49 < bridge> <robyt3> How do I apply this patch automatically? `git apply ./bugfix.patch` says `No valid patches in input`
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> git am ?
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can i not start a shortcut in mingw64 shell??
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```

11:50 < bridge> <robyt3> `Patch format detection failed.`
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u run it on the pr branch?
11:51 < bridge> <robyt3> no, I'm on master
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah that might be the problem
11:51 < bridge> <robyt3> still the same, weird
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah rip since 2 factor auth i dont have access to gh on windows
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i cant get validation layers to work bcs i dunno how i can open a shortcut in mingw shell üòÇ
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is this so hard
11:53 < bridge> <robyt3> why do you need to open the shortcut in the shell?
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh can i also set minimized on the real exe?
11:53 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean you can start the shortcut from explorer
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> seems like it can find validation layers then
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u installed vulkan sdk?
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I installed VulkanSDK from the normal website
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> and then the necessary MSYS2 packages to get the build going
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i try that too then
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao

11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> patch was wrong anyway

12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hate this already
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it destroys everything that is good about vulkan

14:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Why won't we change it? This issue highly affects virtually all laptop users. 300 FPS default limit won't be visually different from 'unlimited' but it should stop the "air plan is taking off" effect, at least for some users.
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Oh no

15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 300 fps is unplayable xd
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we should simply add a fps slider at the first start
15:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i play with 200 :justatest:
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you mean you try to play
15:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just finished "Step by Step" map
15:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so its playable üòé
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess i can also finish that with controller xd
15:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think i got used to it
15:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so its fine for me
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm in favor. talk to @jupeyy_keks
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "we should simply add a fps slider at the first start"
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bad defaults are never a good idea
15:31 < bridge> <cyberfighter> wdym bad
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we make 60 fps limit. it's a matter of time until someone says: why did u make 60fps limit and not 240, like my screen
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we use vsync. i did i have input lag
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we use vsync. why did i have input lag
15:36 < bridge> <kaffeine0> The 'aircraft' issue shows that the current defaults are bad. A sane limit won't hurt.
15:36 < bridge> <kaffeine0> At the same time, SLIDER for FPS is an insane idea. Usually a user want particular value, such as the display framerate of doubled frame rate. E.g. it is literally impossible to set `60` or probably any other certain value with the slider ‚Äî it is always `59` or `67`.

15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no. a user isn't interested in selecting the fps at first start
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> slider with input then
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if they want to do that, they'll go to the settings with no problem
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we dont need to change it
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the issue is the typical user
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, it's useless to discuss with u
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> impossible
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this seems unhealthy
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u wouldn't accept that other ppl can see the diff between 60 hz and 120hz
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but okay
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep, sry
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please don't put words into my mouth
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I accept that people will see the difference between 60 and 120 hz monitors
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I accept that people see the difference between 60 and 120 hz monitors
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> please don't put words in my mouth
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see, always the same
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't say that you say it
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's something I'm saying
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can't accept it, i'll leave
15:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u can put words in my mouf
15:39 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I accept that a user can see the diff between 60Hz and 120Hz. Can we set a doubled display refresh rate as the default value? Or set 120Hz?
15:39 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Personally I think that vsync enabled by default would be even better but I'm not an expert in this area. üôÇ
15:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think the main difference is in input lag
15:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (when switching from the screen's refresh rate to smt higher)
15:45 < bridge> <patiga> there could be a default mode which would always set 2 * monitor-refresh-rate as max fps
15:45 < bridge> <patiga> oh
15:45 < bridge> <patiga> I literally suggested the same as @kaffeine0 üòÖ
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds good to me
15:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah I think like doulbe or triple the monitors refresh rate would be a good default
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you can make a PR so we can discuss it there?
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or an issue if you don't want to code it right now
15:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I think that the most of players won't notice the difference, and as the players go to settings anyway (to adjust the skin, etc), they can set the needed options. If a player knows the "input lag" and other terms then they can set the wanted settings. At the same time if a player has no idea about those settings and terms then probably 2x rate or even vsync would still provide a comfortable UX for them.
15:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Note: we'd need to use special value for `gfx_refresh_rate` (such as `0`) to make the game calculating the rate at runtime, based on the current display.
15:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Well I do see the difference which is mainly input lag. My screen's refresh rate is 75hz but I cap the client's fps at 1000
15:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah I just tried with 150hz and it feels choppy
15:57 < bridge> <kaffeine0> What's about 225?
15:57 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Though I'd be against 3x rate by default. IMO the default settings should target the needs of normal players rather than a few super sensitive pro gamers. Yet, "3x by default" would be much better than what we have now.
15:57 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 
15:57 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Also, `cl_refresh_rate_inactive` should be capped by 1x display refresh rate; there is no sane reason to keep the aircraft flying when the game is not in the focus.
15:58 < bridge> <kaffeine0> What's about 225?
15:58 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Though I'd be against 3x rate by default (in favor of 2x). IMO the default settings should target the needs of normal players rather than a few super sensitive pro gamers. Yet, "3x by default" would be much better than what we have now.

15:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Let me see
15:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah 225 I can't see the difference

15:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but now it's winter so 1000 fps ftw üò¨
16:03 < bridge> <patiga> season-dependant fps
16:04 < bridge> <patiga> during winter, x10 refresh rate, smoothly scaled down to 3x for summer
16:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ‚ô®Ô∏è
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> press shift
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess we could try x3
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but only for new clients or what? else we overwrite all configs of all players
16:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think there's already the functionality for that. It leaves the current cfg options if it finds it else it sets it.
