03:10 <@deen> hi EastByte 
10:59 < Nimda> DDNet GER2 went down!
11:04 < eeeee> wut
11:13 < Nimda> DDNet GER2 went back online!
11:47 < Muttley> deen, do you know if i need something on the server to support cyrillic names ? it renames to (1)
12:13 <@deen> Muttley: you have ddnet server?
12:13 <@deen> on regular TW server they don't work
12:14 <@deen> since version 0.6.2
12:14 < Muttley> ok, it is my openfng server wrong chanel.... 
12:14 < Muttley> on other servers the name works but not on mine
12:15 <@heinrich5991> Muttley: just out of interest, does your name consist of cyrillic characters only?
12:15 < Muttley> for test yes
12:16 < Muttley> if the name contains normal characters as well they get stripped
12:16 < Muttley> heinrich5991, 
14:00 <@deen> http://hookrace.net/blog/what-makes-nim-practical/
14:12 <@heinrich5991> deen: any hn post to upvote?
14:13 <@heinrich5991> ah found it
14:13 <@deen> woohoo, you're the first upvote :P
14:14 <@heinrich5991> :)
14:14 <@deen> Either everyone is still sleeping or the article is boring, we'll see^^
14:14 <@heinrich5991> "This even causes some to reconsider Python as a teaching language."
14:14 <@heinrich5991> nim doesn't solve what he talks about though
14:14 <@heinrich5991> no easy way to create gui applications in nim
14:14 <@deen> nope
14:15 <@deen> I was just talking about the "distributing to friends" thing
14:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: although I have to go right now, what is the windows story of nim?
14:16 <@deen> The main developer is a Windows guy, so it's great on Windows :P
15:07 < Muttley> does anyone know why my ddnet servers are disapearing from the list every few days ?
15:36 <@deen> strange
15:37 <@deen> not happening here i think
15:45 < Muttley> hmm, my logs are saying they are registred but i cant find them in the server list.
15:45 < Muttley> and the vanilla servers dont have any problem (running on the same host)
15:54 < CookieMichal> maybe the name is wrong0?
15:55 <@deen> Muttley: what version are you running?
15:55 <@deen> we had that problem with old versions on windows
15:56 < Muttley> uhm
15:57 < Muttley> how can i let the DDrace server report the version
15:57 < Muttley> deen, 
15:57 <@deen> select the server in the client and loo at the info top right
15:58 < Muttley> 0.6.2 0.6.4
15:58 <@deen> 0.6.4?
15:59 <@deen> doesn't sound like a ddnet server
15:59 <@deen> current version is 6.6.8
15:59 < Muttley> hmm then it is not the server i think
16:00 < Muttley> top right doesnt show me anything
16:00 <@deen> it says "Server details"
16:00 <@deen> "Version 0.6.2 6.6.8
16:00 < Muttley> 46.182.217.32:8323
16:01 <@deen> wait, you're running DDNet NL?
16:01 < Muttley> yes
16:01 <@deen> Can you please rename your servers...
16:01 <@deen> These are not DDNet servers
16:01 < Muttley> sure
16:01 <@deen> There have been many complaints to me that these servers are broken
16:01 <@deen> and I'm not even running them
16:02 < Muttley> ok, we spoke about nl before figured you would know it is me running those
16:02 <@deen> i have a bad memory
16:02 <@deen> you're on windows?
16:03 <@deen> You could try updating
16:03 < Muttley> nope
16:03 < Muttley> linux
16:03 <@deen> ok, then no idea
16:03 < Muttley> the git repo is yours ?
16:03 <@deen> yes
16:04 <@deen> how long do the servers run until they start disappearing?
16:04 < Muttley> ok if i do a new clone and build it should it work ?
16:04 <@deen> yes
16:04 < Muttley> idk like 5 to 8 days
16:04 <@deen> that doesn't sound thaaat long
16:04 <@deen> definitely something we would experience on ddnet as well
16:06 < Muttley> they get restarted often /
16:06 < Muttley> ?
16:06 <@deen> sometimes
16:10 < Muttley> deen, hmm cant compile
16:10 < Muttley> src/engine/external/zlib/gzlib.c:256:9: warning: implicit declaration of function 'lseek' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
16:10 < Muttley>          state->start = LSEEK(state->fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);
16:11 < Muttley> http://pastebin.com/6PQMV491
16:11 <@deen> can't compile because of a warning?
16:12 <@deen> you're trying to compile the sql server?
16:12 <@deen> then you need boost
16:12 < Muttley> i have compiled it before
16:12 < Muttley> on the same server with sql
16:12 <@deen> apparently boost disappeared somehow then
16:14 < Muttley> indeed, i compiled it on an other machine i guess
16:14 <@deen> but why do you call your server DDNet NL?...
16:14 <@deen> I don't get it
16:15 < Muttley> bam: done (0:08)
16:15 < Muttley> i just renamed the GER to NL ;-)
16:15 <@deen> the GER?
16:15 <@deen> anyway, it's not nice to fake another server
16:16 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=858
16:19 < o_be_one> 'morning gang :D !
16:19 <@deen> hi
16:21 < Muttley> hello
16:29 < Muttley> deen, http://snag.gy/VPCjw.jpg
16:30 <@deen> Muttley: thanks
16:35 < CookieMichal> deen: Could you modify HTML code of ddnet.tw, by replacing: '<iframe class="ytplayer" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nKFMF6BeR4U?autoplay=0&hd=1"></iframe>' with '<iframe allowfullscreen class="ytplayer" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nKFMF6BeR4U?autoplay=0&hd=1"></iframe>', please? :D
16:40 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
16:41 <@deen> CookieMichal: thanks, done
16:41 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
16:49 < CookieMichal> deen: thanks :)
17:02 < CookieMichal> When trying to compile DDNet client, I am getting  '#include "SDL.h" File not found'. Do you know how can I fix it? (I am on ubuntu 14.04)
17:06 <@deen> install sdl-dev
17:06 < CookieMichal> I've already installed libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev
17:07 < CookieMichal> apt-get says that there's no "sdl-dev"
17:18 < cris272> SDL.h should be there : /usr/include/SDL/SDL.h
17:19 < cris272> i installed libsdl1.2-dev and i have no problem for compile
17:19 <@deen> CookieMichal: can you compile vanilla TW?
17:25 < CookieMichal> deen: Haven't tried, yet
17:28 < CookieMichal> logs: http://paste.ee/p/iBeD6
17:29 < CookieMichal> same without -v http://paste.ee/p/mybE5
17:32 < o_be_one> i love ddnet.
17:33 < o_be_one> i need to put a linjk on r0x.fr !
17:37 < o_be_one> is there some ddnet official ddrace servers with /r ?
17:37 < CookieMichal> I don't think so
17:41 <@deen> no, /r is from the devil
17:42 <@deen> CookieMichal: ah, you're missing freetype
17:43 < o_be_one> its cause its in the intro vid of ddnet
17:43 < CookieMichal> deen: libfreetype6 and libfreetype6-dev are installed :x
17:44 <@deen> CookieMichal: then remove the config.lua
17:44 <@deen> CookieMichal: and build again
17:44 <@deen> you didn't have them installed when you first compiled
17:45 <@deen> that's one of the things i don't like about bam
17:48 < CookieMichal> deen: Thanks a lot! :) But now I am getting curl errors :x
17:48 <@deen> oh great^^
17:48 <@deen> i didn't do the curl stuff, Learath2 has to know :P
17:49 < CookieMichal> installing libcurl3-dev :))
17:49 < CookieMichal> 4 *
17:50 < Learath2> you need something that provides curl-config on linux
17:50 < Learath2> i never compiled it on linux
17:51 <@deen> Learath2: oh, so we depend on curl for linux now =/
17:51 <@deen> even for binary distributions?
17:51 < CookieMichal> Yay
17:51 < CookieMichal> it seems to work
17:51 < Learath2> could distribute it if you want but that sounds unreasonable
17:52 < CookieMichal> package called "libcurl4-openssl-dev" fixed curl errors :)
17:52 < Learath2> maybe could link it statically
17:53 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, like opus
17:53 < Learath2> dont really like that tho 
17:53 <@deen> i don't want the linux version to break for people because they don't have curl installed
17:54 < Learath2> should be as simple as apt-get install libcur4
17:55 < Learath2> but its your choice should be simple to do 
17:55 <@EastByte> what about static linking?
17:56 <@EastByte> embedding curl indeed is problematic
17:58 < Learath2> its just bloat im pretty sure most of the people using linux either a) have libcurl b) know how to install libcurl
17:58 <@EastByte> well how do we tell them that libcurl is missing?
17:58 <@EastByte> the binary doesn't even start
17:59 < CookieMichal> Add prerequisites on github :I
17:59 < CookieMichal> in readme file
18:02 <@deen> CookieMichal: that's not a solution
18:02 <@deen> most people never compile and never go to github
18:02 < Learath2> huh wouldnt he get error while loading shared libraries 
18:02 <@deen> Learath2: only on the command line
18:02 <@deen> what's so bad about static linking?
18:04 < Learath2> nothing except the executable getting bigger and bigger
18:05 < CookieMichal> ^ I don't think big executable is a problem
18:05 <@deen> the most important thing is that the client keeps working for everyone
18:05 <@deen> without manual intervention
18:09 < CookieMichal> How do I check if my build uses static or dynamic library?
18:09 <@deen> ldd
18:09 <@heinrich5991> (ldd can lead to arbitrary code execution, don't use it on untrusted executables)
18:54 < CookieMichal> deen: There's someone reconnecting and spamming @@@@@@@ on block server
18:54 < CookieMichal> on v3
18:55 <@deen> attack-wise or manually?
18:55 < CookieMichal> seems like no more
18:55 <@deen> yeah, because server is full^^
18:56 < CookieMichal> http://i.imgur.com/HtORxeD.png
18:56 <@deen> looks like manual spamming
19:17 < Muttley__> Brrrrr ubuntu desktop ;-)
19:25 <@heinrich5991> <3 linux :)
19:53 < CookieMichal> deen: What IRC client would you recommend? :-)
19:54 < CookieMichal> anyone, what client?  :>
19:55 < coffee> On windows, I use Miranda IM
19:55 < coffee> On linux, I use weechat
19:55 < coffee> weechat is console only, there is no gui
19:59 <@deen> I've always used irssi, no idea if others are better
19:59 <@EastByte> if you look at the code, you like weechat more
20:01 < CookieMichal> Since I like gui, I will try irssi
20:02 <@EastByte> it has a console ui like weechat
20:02 < CookieMichal> and it has no gui ;-;
20:02 <@EastByte> this actually is a gui :)
20:02 < CookieMichal> :o
20:02 <@EastByte> u see the colors?
20:02 < CookieMichal> yeah :P
20:02 <@EastByte> 8 different colors I think
20:03 <@EastByte> quite graphical
20:03 < coffee> This is a kind of ui
20:03 < michal_> :o
20:04 < CookieMichal> 2 hard 4 me
20:06 <@deen> coffee: it's called TUI
20:06 <@deen> wait
20:06 <@deen> CLI
20:06 <@deen> who knows, i always mix them up, one of them
20:07 < coffee> It's useful for ssh
20:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: I see your post has taken off :)
20:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: not first place on HN and r/programming =/
20:35 <@heinrich5991> pff
20:35 <@deen> last one went better :P
20:35 <@heinrich5991> it's on the front page of HN
20:35 <@deen> but i have plans for a new one
20:35 <@heinrich5991> =)
20:41 <@deen> not sure if people want to read about me implementing hookrace in nim though^^
20:50 <@heinrich5991> what do you think will be better in nim than in C/C++ for sth like hookrace?
20:50 <@deen> that I like the language much more
20:51 <@deen> no need for python to generate stuff
20:51 <@deen> semantics that make more sense to me
20:51 <@deen> higher level, more modern (though C++14 is nice too)
20:52 < eeeee> still no resumable functions tho
20:52 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I'd really like resumable functions. I think C# had them?
20:52 < eeeee> yeah
20:53 < eeeee> python, php, js also have them
20:53 <@heinrich5991> didn't know about php and js
20:53 <@heinrich5991> but those aren't statically types
20:53 <@heinrich5991> *typed
20:53 <@heinrich5991> while C# is
20:54 <@deen> resumable functions?
20:54 <@deen> async/await? Nim has that
20:54 < eeeee> sure does, i was talking about c++14
20:54 <@deen> aaah
20:54 <@deen> my bad :P
20:54 < eeeee> i think they're gonna add resumable functions in c++17
20:54 <@heinrich5991> nim can do:
20:55 <@heinrich5991> def foobar(): yield 1; yield 2; yield 3
20:55 <@heinrich5991> ?
20:55 <@heinrich5991> at least that's what I thought resumable functions are
20:55 <@deen> it's called an iterator
20:55 <@deen> but yes, works
20:56 <@heinrich5991> mh. I thought that was a nit of me after reading hte tutorial
20:56 <@deen> https://gist.github.com/def-/ee4a96fc293c2987ef65
20:56 <@heinrich5991> oh wait
20:56 <@heinrich5991> was it that nim can only sugar them away?
20:56 <@heinrich5991> i.e. can't put the resumable function state into a data structure?
20:57 <@deen> can do that as well, with closure iterators
20:57 <@deen> inline iterators are just sugar indeed
21:00 <@heinrich5991> pseudocode: def split_string(str): start = str; for(int i = 0; i < len(str); i++) { if start[i] == ' ' { yield start[..i]; start = &start[i]; } }
21:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: nim can do that?
21:01 <@heinrich5991> and then store the iterator `split_string("Hello World!")` in a struct?
21:01 < o_be_one> deen, how old are you ?
21:01 <@deen> o_be_one: still 24
21:01 < o_be_one> oh ok
21:02 < o_be_one> a young good guy, just awesome for the future :)
21:02 <@EastByte> 24 is ooold
21:02 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: that sounds like you're older, how old are you?
21:02 < o_be_one> 27
21:03 < o_be_one> going to 28 in some months
21:03 <@deen> heinrich5991: should work, yes
21:03 <@deen> don't understand the pseudo code entirely yet, but I'm trying :P
21:03 < o_be_one> ddnet is ddrace.info ? I dont understand the staff page ..
21:03 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: ddrace.info redirects to ddnet.tw
21:04 < o_be_one> omg im just very late on all these infos
21:04 <@deen> heinrich5991: just splitting into words and yileding each word?
21:04 <@deen> yielding*
21:04 < o_be_one> so i really help ddrace.info, the original one, by helping ddnet ?
21:04 <@heinrich5991> yes. writing the function like this, and storing the iterator returned by a call in a structure
21:05 < o_be_one> But is Megaman, Delo and .me" active actualy ?
21:05 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: ddrace development has stopped, ddnet is maintained. go help ddnet :)
21:06 < o_be_one> CookieMichal, lol wtf u pm some cookies :D ?
21:06 < o_be_one> heinrich5991, i already help ddnet :D
21:06 < o_be_one> i just want to understand :p
21:06 < CookieMichal> o_be_one: wot
21:07 < o_be_one> CookieMichal, just seen your query with cooki pics
21:07 < CookieMichal> xP
21:07 < o_be_one> :D
21:07 < CookieMichal> I found it on ur site
21:07 < CookieMichal> I mean
21:07 < o_be_one> oh yeah its possible lool
21:07 < CookieMichal> tumblr
21:08 < o_be_one> deen, you are alone now on ddnet ? No more Megaman, Delo and .me' ?
21:09 <@deen> o_be_one: "now"
21:09 < o_be_one> oO
21:10 < o_be_one> can you tell me a little more ?
21:10 <@deen> Megaman and Delo have never been actively involved with ddnet I think. It was Megaman's idea to make a new ddrace server because they were all banned from ddmax
21:10 <@deen> but Megaman couldn't setup the server
21:10 <@deen> Since I just got banned for life on ddmax I decided to help
21:10 <@deen> and set everything up
21:11 <@deen> I discussed with Megeman, Delo and .me' what to do
21:11 <@deen> and .me' did some testing
21:11 < o_be_one> oh good story !
21:11 <@deen> but not like I'm alone anyway
21:11 <@deen> lots of testers and coders help
21:12 < o_be_one> sure you have an active community
21:15 <@deen> heinrich5991: https://gist.github.com/def-/1ed42da87b9e9b7343d5
21:16 <@deen> http://nim-lang.org/manual.html#first-class-iterators
21:16 < CookieMichal> ddmax is poop
21:17 <@heinrich5991> sorry, I think that's still not what I want
21:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: what do you want?
21:17 <@heinrich5991> deen: I want to be able to call `.next()` on the iterator once, get the object returned
21:17 <@deen> ah, sure
21:17 <@deen> you can do that
21:17 <@heinrich5991> and later on, in the source code, call `.next()` again
21:17 <@deen> sure
21:18 <@deen> let first = c()
21:19 <@heinrich5991> and then
21:20 <@heinrich5991> let second = c() ?
21:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: ?
21:20 <@deen> yes
21:20  * o_be_one is looking for deen's pic :D
21:21 <@deen> you will never find it!
21:21 < o_be_one> whyyy :'( lol
21:22 < o_be_one> i just want to put a face on you
21:22 <@EastByte> well me and laxa found him on our own
21:22 < laxa> EastByte: ?
21:22 <@EastByte> go back to sleep laxa 
21:22 < laxa> :D
21:22  * CookieMichal will find deen's photo
21:26 < CookieMichal> deen: Is there some kind of IDE for nim? :o
21:26 <@deen> CookieMichal: https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/Editor-Support
21:26 <@deen> Aporia is an IDE just for Nim
21:26 < CookieMichal> written in Nim :D
21:26 <@deen> but Visual Studio should work as well
21:26 < CookieMichal> I am on linux :x
21:27 <@deen> there are IDEs on Linux?^^
21:27 < CookieMichal> I think so
21:27 <@deen> Araq is currently fixing nim-idetools, then proper ide integration will work
21:27 <@deen> with autocompletion and stuff
21:28 <@deen> (I should have fixed it but wrote the article instead :P)
21:28 < CookieMichal> haha :D
21:29 <@deen> what IDE do you use on Linux?
21:29 < CookieMichal> Netbeans, but i don't like it at all
21:29 < CookieMichal> I prefer simple gedit :D
21:29 <@deen> there's syntax highlighting for gedit!
21:29 < CookieMichal> but when I wanna learn some stuff I would like to know if I am doing that correctly :D
21:30 <@deen> i also have a syntax checker for nim in vim
21:30 < CookieMichal> vim is also not my favorite :D
21:35 <@deen> oh, gcc 4.9 has colors in its output
21:36 <@heinrich5991> wow
21:36 <@heinrich5991> deen: clang has had that for years :P
21:37 <@deen> yes, that's why i thought I'm accidentally using clang...
21:39 < CookieMichal> When compiling ddnet I like ./bam -r bc 
21:40 < o_be_one> laxa, combien pour la photo de deen :D ? mdr
21:40 < laxa> hahaha
21:40 < laxa> Non :)
21:40 < o_be_one> shit x)
21:40 < laxa> Elle est pas vraiment cachée si ca peux t'aider
21:40 < CookieMichal> !fr-en Elle est pas vraiment cachée si ca peux t'aider
21:40 < Nimda> Translation: It's not really hidden if AC can help you
21:40 < o_be_one> k faut que je cherche vers où laxa :p ?
21:41 < laxa> internet ^^
21:41 < o_be_one> well guys just asking to laxa for deen pics
21:41 < CookieMichal> I like Nimda :>
21:41 < o_be_one> laxa, mais genre j'ai cherché son nom prénom sur google mais bon y a un gars là on dirait pas rapport
21:41 < o_be_one> CookieMichal, nimda is awesome bot ! <3
21:41 < coffee> je suis preneur aussi
21:41 < CookieMichal> cause I made it, right?
21:42 < o_be_one> CookieMichal, i dont care, nimda is just awesome :D
21:42 < CookieMichal> geez
21:42 < o_be_one> seen how it works, i like it !
21:42 < CookieMichal> say yes next time
21:42 < CookieMichal> xP
21:42 < CookieMichal> !en-fr I like cake.
21:42 < Nimda> Translation: Je aime le gâteau.
21:42 < o_be_one> CookieMichal, you are the creator of nimda ?
21:42 < CookieMichal> nah, I was just kidding
21:42 < o_be_one> was what i expecting cause never seen your name on the project :p
21:43 < o_be_one> and i havent asked to you to port it to a friends network
21:43 < CookieMichal> Thought you will believe :x
21:45 < o_be_one> laxa, c'est dans le code :p ?
21:45 < laxa> hein ?
21:45 < laxa> le code de quoi ?
21:45 < coffee> on parle de la photo
