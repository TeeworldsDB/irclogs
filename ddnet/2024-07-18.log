00:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> where is the vulnerability

00:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> Chiller: 10 influence
00:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> a service like this should not exist unless it has enough data to get accurate results imo
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> send chiller's
00:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> I think he must trigger that himself, no?
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> o yea
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i forgot it's out of 5 anyway
00:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's no issue for chiller
00:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> still getting 10
00:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> reminds me of those old pokemon games
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i never could get into pokemon
00:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> All my repos are private or forked, it wont even scan Mine :KEKW:
00:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> My FOSS stuff is on codeberg :/
00:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> wrong life decisions
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> im thinking of making a web server in rust with a daemon and a cli controller program. is there a crate for high level IPC like that
00:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> literally not hireable
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i deleted essentially all my repos a few yrs ago
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing to look back on
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and hard to show growth for employers
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> keep ur old shitty code!
00:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> I got it all there
00:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> here, a game better than ddrace: https://github.com/jxsl13/TakeTheMatch
00:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
00:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> Any specific usecase ?
00:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest: :gigachad:
00:21 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
00:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> definitly not a virus
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> I mean, for this thing the "gimmick" will be that u can easily create an upload & link it to other people with access restriction via. account or OTP, but that's unrelated to the IPC stuff
00:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Rocket/axum for the Server and ipc-channel should do the Trick in General ig
00:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> I dont know any specific Rust crate that can provide everything you need, But thats what i would start with
00:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe ryo or Heinrich will sparkle some ideas in when its Not 00:30am for us :P
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah I woke up late
00:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> it is indeed detecting credentials, for example:
00:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
00:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> amqp://username:password@localhost:5672
00:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> I think I'll just do ipc manually then
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> not hard if I'm just sending messages. not really much data
00:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> I would recommend zeroMQ But the current crate only Supports IPC on unix
00:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> reminds me of those old pokemon games (that diagram)

02:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> could your update the ddnet-insta webhooks to filter out or escape usernames that correspond (at)here/everyone
02:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @ in general
02:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
02:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> username and role pings should look like this to discord \@fokkonaut

07:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> manual right?
07:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish
07:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought americans are full automatic
07:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh so its automatic
07:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> mine is manual, more fun
07:57 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
07:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> how are you doing @mpft
07:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u get ur dream job
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well everything would include bank account, social benefits and d
08:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not well
08:01 < bridge> <Ewan> no dream job
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what's your dream job
08:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i even apply to dishwasher and warehouse jobs and dont hear back
08:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chinese people's dream job apparently is the one where you sit there all day and do nothing.
08:02 < bridge> <Ewan> not sure but rn i want a code job
08:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
08:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i couldn't get one in the US either
09:25 < bridge> <avolicious> americans usually have pickups 😄
09:25 < bridge> <avolicious> but honda is reliable tho, if the motor survived 1.000km then you cant break it

11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> is that so
11:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Trucks are the most popular vehicle type, with 170,239,357 private and commercial truck registrations in 2022, compared to 98,573,935 vehicle registrations for cars.[1]
11:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if a pickup counts as truck… https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics/
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-towards-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/
11:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's not very nvidia of them
11:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sounds like work can't you just remove the webhooks permission to ping?
11:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> I don't see such a thing available in discord ._.
11:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> the easiest is I'd guess server side
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516734
11:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> might start a hobby project for relaying and transforming webhooks
11:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> and then make big bucks
11:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> ...
11:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> profit
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> pretty sure discord webhook does not have permissions integrated. so it is up to webhook senders to handle pings iirc
11:44 < bridge> <0xdeen> Work for a US company with an office in China, then after a few years you can switch to the US office.
11:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as the sender of the webhook, you can include `{…,"allowed_mentions":{"parse":[]}}`
11:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#allowed-mentions-object
11:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's not a discord specific webhook payload on the server
11:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> is it?
11:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's not a discord specific webhook payload on the ddnet-insta server
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> That does sound amazing, but only as like a second option
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> Imagine being paid to just sit around and do whatever you want
12:00 < bridge> <learath2> Manual is more fun until you encounter a city with TRAFFIC
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do you know i live in barcelona and did practice there
12:06 < bridge> <learath2> That is not TRAFFIC that's just traffic
12:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks @heinrich5991. @jxsl13 i commited heinrichs fix but did not restart servers yet.
12:11 < bridge> <avolicious> Arent they called pickup trucks? 😄
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt u seem bcn on friday before a long weekend
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> 30km of stopped cars xd
12:14 < bridge> <learath2> I stopped driving after I spent a day not touching the gas pedal
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway i like it for noe
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> now
12:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> Me who enjoys munich Traffic :monkaStop:
12:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im interedted in how automatic works
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> Transmissions are insanely cool
12:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> I could Tell you all about it! I learned a Lot about it Back in my apprenticeship
12:17 < bridge> <learath2> Btw there isn't a single "automatic" design. There are a couple and all are very interesting
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> Some are just what a computer engineer would come up with. Manual but with a computer doing the gear shifting 😄
12:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> DCT is my favourite one, its Design is really cool
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, mine too, such a smart idea
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> It also feels like something I might have come up with. Unlike the much more complicated CVT or hydraulic designs
12:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Agreed, it's Design is pretty straight Forward. CVT IS okay'ish, it constantly gets better `software wise` (Not that much the actual Transmitter).
12:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> thanks, chiller
12:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> will test that in the evening
14:52 < bridge> <patiga> @murpi can you update the twmap/twgpu tools for the discord bot? I fixed the bug that happened a few times recently :)
15:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> bumping this issue here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7876

16:37 < bridge> <learath2> @patiga if you have a minute can you also check `1f4cc`
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps I should just bite the bullet and get the full noto fonts just to have a fallback
16:40 < bridge> <patiga> I don't have that one 😅
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> If anyone has it ping me pls 😄
16:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> NotoColorEmoji has 1f4cc

16:47 < bridge> <learath2> `01f4: ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff bfffffff` the installed file definitely has it, I wonder why fc-list won't find it in there

18:21 < bridge> <therealdock> @gerdoe ninslash looks awesome
18:30 < bridge> <bencie.> `fc-list ':charset=2717'` (its in learaths message ^^)
18:35 < bridge> <zhn> it differs from version to version, you better test every major release
18:58 < bridge> <egyt> Update https://ddnet.org/news/client-translations/, btw :^)
19:07 < bridge> <zhn> found myself solving same problem i had like ~5 years ago with compile-time strings not being complete (in terms of my usage)
19:07 < bridge> <zhn> maybe it's because i use cpp17 :D

19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> open an issue on the bots repo..
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dilate old skins sounds hard tho, maybe some day do it _manually with a sh script over ssh_
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is related to the global scale value which is provided by SDL and wine...
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or moltenvk reports the surface wrong to vk.
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's not related to the missing font glyphs other ppl have.
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the clipping gets wrong and thus u dont see everything
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least that is what i assume

20:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> leaky ddnet
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> Leakleaknet
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> It's probably not a real leak btw. Did you compile libdbus with instrumentation?
20:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like the discord forum thing
20:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> gives me ideas to code
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk its from gentoo
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Then no
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i compile glibc with debug info
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Try with valgrind. It instruments at runtime. It would tell you whether it's a real leak or not
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2lazy
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just wanted to banter xd
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 looks like discord forum turned into anti-ddnet demonstration xDD
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> antidummy
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> my god
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> brain dead XD
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> As expected
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> antidummy*
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps it can be a periodic thing. Townhall once every two months
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1263514337449087017
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> this can be done with teeworlds settings iirc
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> I'd guess that is more referring to our policy of not enabling that setting
21:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Do you use guys use github issues for your personal projects to add todos or do you store them in local todo file or you just keep everything in your head?
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> ```py
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> # TODO:
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> ```
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> ```py
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> # TODO: just delete everything
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> ```
21:31 < bridge> <totar> I just keep a text file somewhere or in a google doc for all my todos
21:31 < bridge> <totar> anything more complicated feels like too much effort lol
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uff no joke, feels almost like lapce xdd
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also almost same amount of features missing xdddd
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> always feel so unfinished
21:32 < bridge> <zhn> if you mean features to add then id suggest obsidian + kanban
21:32 < bridge> <zhn> or emacs org
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but defs very fast
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 20 years i defs switch to it
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
21:39 < bridge> <egyt> Delete unused code\*
21:41 < bridge> <therealdock> Is compression completely optional?
22:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> `# TODO: why am i like this` is one of my favourite comments
22:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if I leave a comment in code I never read it ever again
22:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> `TODO: why am i like this` is one of my favourite comments
22:34 < bridge> <peter0x44> you don't need to use issues
22:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> really? some program's even highlight `TODO's` in code for better readability
22:34 < bridge> <peter0x44> github has this "kanban" type thing in the "project" tab
22:35 < bridge> <peter0x44> todo in a comment is for dropping refactoring ideas or missing features and such
22:35 < bridge> <peter0x44> if it's something you are yet to implement it doesn't really work
22:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> whenever I get some ideas for a features or how to improve a code I just make a new issue xd
22:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> dis how i structured

22:36 < bridge> <sedonya> What’s that?
22:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> gitlab issue boards
22:36 < bridge> <sedonya> btw gm 🍉
22:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> good night*
22:37 < bridge> <sedonya> aaah 😦
22:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I didn't even know such thing exists on github :kek:
