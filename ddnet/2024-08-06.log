00:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> Investment advice from Kim Schmitz, when will the trolling stop? üòÑ He started trolling on Usenet before most people here were born
00:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Well, there's articles about it
00:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Not only him saying this
00:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> Sounds like a conspiracy theory
00:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Probably
01:16 < bridge> <teero777> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH3tenVGk60
01:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> original article: https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github
01:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the gist is that you can access repository data by hash if the private repository is part of public network (forked from a public repo, or public repo forked from the private one)
01:40 < bridge> <learath2> huh, I thought there is no way they wouldn't have thought of this when I read their blogpost about sharing objects between forks
01:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wat it do
01:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's by design according to github. it got documented later
01:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs a feature to trol people violating the GPL license xd
01:45 < bridge> <learath2> sharing objects yes, but objects that only got pushed to private forks being available from outside is also intended?
01:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1270165993804660928/G9xGKRx7gPHauxianQClKVxPE.png?ex=66b2b5c3&is=66b16443&hm=12a7b2a76b77861365b41688115fa039fcc9e17e130d1045540eb97d46e6b347&
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When I first saw that I instantly thought about fokkonaut who had a webhook posting to public discord the commit previews of his closed source repo
01:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no idea why they included screenshots of text üò¶
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That would have revealed all the hashes
01:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you don't even need the hashes
01:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can bruteforce them
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah because short ones work ye
01:47 < bridge> <learath2> It permutes bytes in one register according to another command register. You can use it for stuff like very quickly finding certain characters in a string
01:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do I debug that suspending stopped working
01:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on my desktop
01:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> what‚Äôs suspending a desktop
01:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also since when do you have a desktop
01:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since always
01:48 < bridge> <learath2> define stopped working, does it fail to sleep or does it fail to unsleep?
01:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fail to sleep
01:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> screen just freezes
01:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my `journalctl -b-2` has the following to say
01:49 < bridge> <learath2> I had the exact same issue, turns out I didn't have the correct gpu power management thing built into my kernel, though I do build my own so might be less likely for others
01:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
01:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> Aug 03 00:46:04 kernel: r8169 0000:05:00.0 eth0: Link is Down

01:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and a couple of tor log messages afterwards
01:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want your desktop to go to sleep when you go afk?
01:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I want it to sleep when I tell it to
01:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah
01:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess I could try to bisect kernels‚Ä¶
01:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds a bit annoying though
01:53 < bridge> <learath2> I was missing `CONFIG_AMD_PMC` perhaps you are missing something similar that doesn't allow your kernel to signal your gpu to sleep
01:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Switching from lts to non lts kernel should be straightforward
01:56 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 also skim through all your dmesg. I did have an error message point me towards that
01:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I only see the dmesg of the current boot, no?
01:56 < bridge> <learath2> Yep

07:14 < bridge> <teero777> if you are on windows you can theoretically use cheatengine to slow down both the server and the client. this works.
07:15 < bridge> <teero777> if you are on linux use https://github.com/evg-zhabotinsky/libspeedhack
07:15 < bridge> <teero777> if you are on windows you can use cheatengine to slow down both the server and the client. this works.

07:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The license is quite permissive. Should be fine.

09:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> I love the bokeh effect on every ai generate image on social media. allows me to block them directly.
09:57 < bridge> <stormaxd> ~~just skill issue, got a better phone ez clap :feelsCoolMan: ~~
09:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> doesnt social media have to explicitly label ai content as such?
09:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> at least in the EU
09:58 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Chinese phone devlopers are good at nothing except placing lots of ads into the system
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> haven't seen anything remotely marked as ai generated on boomer facebook
09:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i am so happy that i never had a facebook account
10:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> *but still has instagram, whatsapp. etc*
10:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
10:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i was just about to say that i am kinda mad about the fact that they bought those after i've used them already
10:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you could literally see how instagram changed over the years :(
10:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> & whatsapp of course
10:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> I feel that

16:24 < bridge> <Cammodude> tested it out and beat the tutorial with it, the current controls work really well if the phone is flat on a table but the moment you pick up your phone it becomes unusable, no joystick is good for the "flat on the table" but horrible for anything else
16:24 < bridge> <Cammodude> i found that my finger kept missing the "left" key and hitting the empty part of the screen but i assume thatll fix itself once the controls become customizable
16:24 < bridge> <Cammodude> also the chat was completely unreadable because of how the controls are, imo something like the chat on bedrock edition could be a better solution
16:24 < bridge> <Cammodude> 
16:24 < bridge> <Cammodude> but still, its way better than the old version
16:25 < bridge> <robyt3> > imo something like the chat on bedrock edition could be a better solution
16:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you give a screenshot?
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can enable a joystick in the ESC menu

16:30 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean the darker background or the chat being further up?
16:31 < bridge> <Cammodude> chat position
16:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, I don't know if we want to make it adjustable. If you move it up it would overlap with voting and other HUD
16:32 < bridge> <Cammodude> i mean the bedrock chat also opens a menu vs the java one where a bar appears at the bottom but idk if thats a good idea
16:32 < bridge> <Cammodude> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1270388997843058780/iu.png?ex=66b38573&is=66b233f3&hm=cd0dc340925ac818a14f08666c02365b3fc639aab289d0a77d3203373dbfe553&
16:32 < bridge> <louis> the bedrock menu is nice
16:32 < bridge> <louis> the huge chatbox in bedrock is not though, itd be nicer if it was like 2-3 lines max
16:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Chat scrolling and selecting with mouse would be nice, yeah
16:39 < bridge> <Cammodude> bedrock moves around the hud elements to fit mobile better

16:39 < bridge> <robyt3> You could try getting a crash dump (called tombstone) with `adb` if you know how to use it: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73755053
16:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Though I'm not sure how useful it will be, as the test versions were probably not compiled with debug symbols.
16:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Or use `adb logcat` and then launch the app to capture the stack trace when it crashes
16:41 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> The one who has problem don't even know what a file path is. I will do this when I get the phone
16:42 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Currently XiaoMi devices can run this client perfectly
17:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u knwo D right?
17:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://dlang.org/spec/interfaceToC.html
17:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can import C files directly
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> Know is perhaps too strong a word. I‚Äôm aware of it and have written like a hundred lines of it
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know Odin
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont like it but maybe u do
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> its for C ppl
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://odin-lang.org/
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> The samsung flasher thing is the only Odin I know
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would rather use C tho
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  Odin is a general-purpose programming language with distinct typing built for high performance, modern systems and data-oriented programming.
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Odin is the C alternative for the Joy of Programming.
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> C3 looks interesting. I‚Äôll have to investigate that one
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> it uses ^ for pointers
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ^int for types
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> x^ for deref
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its from pascal
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> HEH, they took the leap the golang authors weren‚Äôt willing to take
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> the thing with this u can deref on the right side
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant with *
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> right?
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk xd
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> They kept deref and array indexing on the right side
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> Even though both are on the left side in types
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```odin
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> Odin has pointers. A pointer is a memory address of a value. The type ^T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> p: ^int
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> The & operator takes the address of its operand (if possible):
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i := 123
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> p := &i
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> The ^ operator dereferences the pointer‚Äôs underlying value:
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> fmt.println(p^) // read `i` through the pointer `p`
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> p^ = 1337       // write `i` through the pointer `p`
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> Note: C programmers may be used to using * to denote pointers. In Odin, the ^ syntax is borrowed from Pascal. This is to keep the convention of the type on the left and its usage on the right:
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> p: ^int // ^ on the left
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> x := p^ // ^ on the right
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> Note: Unlike C, Odin has no pointer arithmetic. If you need a form of pointer arithmetic, please use the ptr_offset and ptr_sub procedures in the "core:mem" package.
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> not ADTs tho
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> so a its a meh for meh
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> so a its a meh for me
18:24 < bridge> <sans._.> If I host a server, is it possible to connect to rcon remotely? kind of like an ssh connection?
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> There is econ you can connect to with telnet
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> And there is also a fifo file you can write into to execute commands that you can enable
18:25 < bridge> <sans._.> Is there some setup i need to do?
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> ye
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> ec_port and ec_password
18:26 < bridge> <sans._.> do i put that into autoexecserver.cfg?
18:26 < bridge> <sans._.> do i put that into autoexec_server.cfg?
18:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> yes
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 do u think it is hard to show a selection popup before cpp ddnet client starts on android?
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never really coded java android stuff
21:32 < bridge> <robyt3> A completely separate launcher activity might work. I don't think we can change much about the native main activity because SDL handles it.
21:32 < bridge> <robyt3> A completely separate launcher activity might work (within the same application). I don't think we can change much about the native main activity because SDL handles it.
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> >  I don't think we can change much about the native main activity because SDL handles it.
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> > 
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i know so much, you can overload every shit in java
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so we could probably overload the create function and add some stuff
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then call super.create
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or override
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is the better word
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume we need smth like that. the driver situation already kills me internally xd
21:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems brittle, a separate activity seems more robust
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but can we prevent the first one to load?
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or how does a second activity work exactly?
21:35 < bridge> <robyt3> The launcher activity would be started initially, if everything is ok it starts the SDLActivity and removes itself from the activity stack
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Then we could use normal Android UI elements in the launcher
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah so it's like a queue of activities?
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> And the SDLactivity could be unmodified
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean i seen activities in the android manifest
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i dont exactly know what they mean
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> They work like separate windows of one application basically
21:37 < bridge> <robyt3> You can switch between multiple activities generally
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah
21:37 < bridge> <robyt3> In our case, we wouldn't want the launcher activity to be in the stack though I guess
21:37 < bridge> <robyt3> So you don't back-navigate from the main actitvity to the launcher
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i see
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what exactly you mean with stack, is that the manifest thing?
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u not make the launcher activity default and simply replace it with the "next" activity.
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the manifest knows the "first" activity doesnt it?
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> android has an activity stack
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to make the back button work
21:39 < bridge> <robyt3> The stack is the task stack you can view with the task button usually
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but like is it always there or can you code it programmatically
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> The launcher activity is specified with
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> ```xml
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> <intent-filter>
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3>     <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3>     <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> </intent-filter>
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> in the manifest
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Other activities can be started with `Intent`s
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i guess you know how it would work
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you think it's doable in effortable time, would be nice.
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> similar to steam with a "skip launcher" button
21:42 < bridge> <robyt3> And it's supposed to detect the graphics driver before it crashes the client?
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, simply give a selection for all backends
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> detecting crashes.. i dunno. sound cool in theory but in practice it will have false positives and stuff
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a simple solution is better than nothing i guess
21:43 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but just a dialog would still be simpler though
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a dialog while game is running or what do you want to say?
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you meant what native element you use, idc xd
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some kind of combobox
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean what you originally suggested, but it's probably not possible
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Like only showing a dialog from the SDL activity
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Would only work after starting it
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah, do you thing
21:46 < bridge> <robyt3> So if it already crashes then the dialog would also die
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds good
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah, do your thing
21:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd be nice if it only showed the dialog after an unclean exit or so
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i still think we should replace our home page with a launcher generally xd
21:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a launcher slows me down in launching ddnet
21:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like that
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is a skip launcher button
21:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> ddnet not big enough for a launcher
21:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> needs to be at least double A
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet is AAAA
21:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
21:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> for sure, Ubisoft, for sure
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> A mostly transparent launcher/crashpad would be useful to handle crashes
21:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> telemetry, when?
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would also make updating ddnet easier for non-steam
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a word that is so hated, because of the often corresponding privacy violations
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> telemetry is not smth bad per se i'd claim
21:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> make it openly accessible
21:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, transparent thing would be nice
21:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> would probably mostly be stacktraces or whatever
21:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe with a little bit of system info
21:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> os, arch
21:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> gpu maybe
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ddnet user settings would ofc be interesting
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to see which config vars are most useless
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> would be cool. but please let the user click a button before sending the crash info to us
21:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> opt in
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then there is this
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> opt in doesnt work
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in theory yes
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in practice no xD
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for crashes?
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why not?
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> program crashes. user wants it not to crash
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> clicks "send"
21:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> a popup would be good
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh yeah if it is accessable, maybe it does
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not if he goes into settings and enables crash reports
21:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. popup shows up after cash
21:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> send and a second button for automatically send
21:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> works
22:00 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, crashpad would detect if the client crashed then allow sending the crash log. maybe also automatically check if a graphics driver involved and suggest fixes
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need this launcher tho

23:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Dear diary, I can't find words to describe the pain and humiliation I experienced when I was trying to do fifth-grader mafs :pepeW:
23:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1270491923781652520/image.png?ex=66b3e54f&is=66b293cf&hm=a55b450434694f286ad01f8a1ec9f8a2cede19eefbf8c6df8a94154d407df4a8&
23:47 < bridge> <learath2> It seems you got to the wrong solution, (it does work). Why is your stack offset 1 based?
23:48 < bridge> <learath2> Instead keep the offsets all 0 based, but when addressing the stack, your 0 is rbp - 1
23:49 < bridge> <learath2> That way addressing a field is just struct offset + field offset and there is no discrepancy when addressing nested structs
