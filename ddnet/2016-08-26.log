16:29 <+WolfAlex_> uhm for some reason i can not write anything in the editor if i'm ingame (number for quads or names for groups for example)
16:30 <+WolfAlex_> using linux (arch)
16:30 <+WolfAlex_> could someone try out if it works?
16:32 <+Henningstone> Doesn't work for me either (running Linux aswell)
16:33 <@deen>  well, sounds like a bug introduced by the new IME feature
16:33 <@deen> check the git history, try 1 commit earlier, and if confirmed, please report or ideally fix
