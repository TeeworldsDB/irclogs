10:31 < Mekrioz> Hey guys, can some1 come on Next Grey and ban Wesker for blocking Garik and me :)?
12:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 closed pull request #739: Don't show ips to non-administrators, Fixes #694 (master...pr_hide_ip_nonadmin) https://git.io/vSHy9
13:03 < Ryozuki> why all buttons, and menus are round?
13:03 < Ryozuki> teeworlds like round things? xD
13:04 < Ryozuki> and they look edgy cause that
13:05 < Ryozuki> what if i make a pr making it all rectangular? would it be accepted?
13:06 <@EastByte> because rounded edges require the teeworlds engine to render multiple quads for a single button
13:06 <@EastByte> and that's what we want
13:07 <@heinrich5991> …
13:07 <@EastByte> I personally like flat design but I doubt such a pr will be accepted
13:08 < Ryozuki> i also like flat design
13:09 < Ryozuki> well
13:09 < Ryozuki> ill try making it
13:09 <@EastByte> wasn't the tw 0.7 ui more flat?
13:10 < Ryozuki> idk i never used 0.7
13:11 <@EastByte> nah, it also has round buttons
13:11 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/priv/17_Apr-17-13_10.png
13:11 <@EastByte> but it has awesome fading *.*
13:12 < Ryozuki> https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ab/78/25/ab7825d390b921d02ca06ba5f5936c23.png
13:12 < Ryozuki> idk why i love t his type of buttons
13:12 <@heinrich5991> they also have rounded edges
13:12 <@heinrich5991> *corners
13:12 < Ryozuki> there are also rectangle buttons like that
13:12 < Ryozuki> wait
13:13 < Ryozuki> https://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2013/08/flat-ui-psd.jpg
13:13 < Ryozuki> well, these are completly flat
13:14 <@heinrich5991> .jpg
13:16 <@EastByte> yes, that's a bad idea here
13:16 < Ryozuki> ?
13:17 < Ryozuki> what happens with jpg?
13:17 <@EastByte> jpg lossy and meant to be used for normal photos
13:17 <@EastByte> afk
13:18 <@EastByte> is*
13:24 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: look at the edges, they're unclean
13:24 <@heinrich5991> in a png, they'd be sharp
13:58 < Justafish> I successfully compiled tw with linux (gave up on windows). Now lets dig through some code >.<
13:59 <@heinrich5991> what went wrong on windows?
14:02 < Justafish> Dont know. Had so many errors etc. I think that my python3 path was just wrong and that my default action for .py fules was to open them with a texteditor. So whenever I tried compiling through the cmd I had a bunch of errors :/
14:02 <@heinrich5991> ah. the cmake-build doesn't have *that* problem
14:02 < Justafish> haha no, this was buttersmooth xD
14:03 < Ryozuki> u can use cmake in windows too
14:04 < Justafish> but then I need something like cygwin, aight?
14:05 <@heinrich5991> no
14:05 <@heinrich5991> cmake would generate a visual studio project
14:05 < Justafish> either way, if was suitable for me. Since I completely switched from windows to linux on my laptop. 
14:05 <@heinrich5991> k :)
14:06 < Ryozuki> linux is freedom :)
14:06 < Justafish> I just want to get my hands on the code and try some things :) If I get serious I might swap back to visual studio, still have a partition of windows running it c:
14:06 < Ryozuki> but visual studio is such a good tool
14:06 < Ryozuki> xD
14:06 < Justafish> yeh I know .__.
14:07 < Justafish> btw I actually payed for sublime3
14:07 < Justafish> I think that is a rare thing to do x)
14:08 < Ryozuki> well visual studio is better than sublime
14:08 < Ryozuki> if you want to pay, https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/
14:09 < Justafish> haha sublime is a texteditor, not a full sutied development platform XD hard to compare
14:09 < Ryozuki> then vs studio code
14:09 < Ryozuki> xD
14:09 < Ryozuki> vs code*
14:09 < Ryozuki> https://code.visualstudio.com/ <- editor, not ide
14:10 < Ryozuki> and its crossplatform
14:11 < Justafish> might look in to it :P I mainly use sublime because it starts so fast :o
14:11 < Ryozuki> vs code also
14:11 < Ryozuki> thats why i switched from atom to it
14:13 < Justafish> yeh, I was just going to mention atom. Because atom starts really slow :/
14:13 <@EastByte> atom, sublime, vs that's cute :p
14:13 < Ryozuki> vim is best!
14:13 < Ryozuki> 0ms startup time
14:14 <@EastByte> that's what I implied
14:15 < Justafish> why not emacs?
14:15 < Ryozuki> nah
14:15 < Ryozuki> vim is better
14:15 < Justafish> why not nano?
14:15 < Justafish> xD
14:15 < Ryozuki> nano is for nubs xD
14:16 < Ryozuki> nano isnt as powerfull as vim
14:16 < Justafish> tbh if someone was actually coding good in nano, I wouldnt call them noobs x)
14:16 < Ryozuki> http://spacemacs.org/doc/img/spacemacs-python.png
14:17 < Ryozuki> "emacs and vim"
14:18 < Justafish> looks pretty dope tbh :o But I had my fair share of weird keyboard commands
14:18 <@heinrich5991> vim doesn't have 0 startup time either
14:19 < Ryozuki> but its rly fast
14:19 < Ryozuki> heinrich5991, what's what u did? "VERSION"?
14:19 < Ryozuki> CTCP version
14:19 <@heinrich5991> I checked whether you're running linux
14:21 < Ryozuki> ok im back here :c
14:21 < Ryozuki> and what you got?
14:21 < Ryozuki> http://image.prntscr.com/image/9a4e44fb60c843b4a8eea0fc3c008a63.png
14:21 < Ryozuki> looks like im missing some offset
14:21 < Ryozuki> or scale
14:21 <@heinrich5991> I got: no you're not running linux
14:22 < Ryozuki> how you do that?
14:22 <@EastByte>  /ctcp Ryozuki VERSION
14:22 <@EastByte> or something
14:22 <@heinrich5991> I did it by rightclicking your name and selecting ctcp version :)
14:22 <@EastByte> non-terminal user spotted
14:23 < Ryozuki> i use hexchat
14:23 < Ryozuki> EastByte, i got VERSION WeeChat 1.7 (Jan 18 2017)
14:23 < Ryozuki> why my ctcp version even send my cpu info
14:23 < Ryozuki> xD
14:23 <@EastByte> because hexchat likes to do that
14:23 <@heinrich5991> you can probably disable it in the options somewhere, if you don't like it
14:23 < Ryozuki> nah its ok
14:24 <@heinrich5991> ZNC website has died on 29 March 2017, without fresh backups. Wiki is now back from dump of July 2015. Please help restoring the lost content.
14:24 <@heinrich5991> wow...
14:24 <@EastByte> lol
14:24 < Ryozuki> VERSION irssi v1.0.1 - running on Linux x86_64
14:24 < Ryozuki> didnt know irssi
14:24 <@heinrich5991> irssi is *the* console client for irc
14:24 <@EastByte> it's weechat only in old
14:24 <@heinrich5991> :P
14:24 < Ryozuki> xD
14:25 < Ryozuki> it's deen who uses it
14:27 < Ryozuki> http://image.prntscr.com/image/9064050bfe4c466d8ae8c02ae78709db.png
14:27 < Ryozuki> looks better imo
14:27 < Ryozuki> than round
14:27 < Ryozuki> 1 line change and all is square xD
14:27 < Ryozuki> well, the hud not
14:28 < Justafish> cant the tee's also be square? that would be dope. We could call it Teecraft
14:28 <@heinrich5991> search and exclude not translated?
14:29 < Ryozuki> my catalan translation its 100%
14:29 < Ryozuki> might be a bug
14:29 < Ryozuki> or maybe its not 100%
14:30 < Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/languages/catalan.txt#L786
14:30 < Ryozuki> it's translated
14:30 < Henningstone> Clicking through the languages, 'search' and 'exclude' don't appear translated for quite many
14:30 < Ryozuki> but i did it :c
14:47 <@heinrich5991> that seems like a different string though, it doesn't have a colon
15:01 < Justafish> src/game/client/components/background.cpp row 51"std::cout << "here" << std::endl;"
15:01 < Justafish> think I found an old debug print when looking through some random code >.<
15:37 <@heinrich5991> feel free to remove it
15:39 < Henningstone> haha, just as a funny side note: this message was introduced by a commit called "Clean up debug messages a bit (lower case, no useless errors)"
15:41 <@heinrich5991> ^^
15:57 < Justafish> hahaha ^^
15:57 < Justafish> I am fooling around a bit with the code and have now added the "dead eye emote".... yep that exists .__.
16:32 < DawnDN> hey! someone who hosts the zCatch Grenade servers?
17:04 < Ryozuki> RenderTools()->DrawUIRect(pRect, vec4(1, 1, 1, 0.5f)*ButtonColorMul(pID), 5.0f);
17:04 < Ryozuki> this is to render a button menu
17:04 < Ryozuki> but changing the color does nothing
17:04 < Ryozuki> but it indeed sets the color inside that function
17:04 < Ryozuki> rly weired
17:04 < Ryozuki> only alpha works
19:22 < Justafish> Is it in anyones interest to add dead eye emote support? The eye emote is there, but I have never seen it used in game :o
19:45 < Ryozuki> ddos?
19:48 <@EastByte> Ryozuki: nfo appears to have some instabilities currently
19:49 < Ryozuki> ok, server has some little moments where u have -1000 ping
19:49 < Ryozuki> "conection problem"
20:14 <@heinrich5991> time travel?
20:16 < Henningstone> I guess that was supposed to mean "up to 1000"…?
20:16 < Henningstone> time travel would be cool though :D
20:32 < Ryozuki> well im sry, i was talking about pred, going up to -1000
20:32 < Ryozuki> or should i say down?
20:42 < Henningstone> ah that clarifies it *was still hoping for time travel*
20:53 <@deen> EastByte: reported the instabilities already?
20:53 <@deen> EastByte: I'm not sure yet if it's network or disk based
20:53 <@deen> i think i see a lot of disk load, but then I thought I made our code independent of disk performance
20:58 <@EastByte> deen: I only noticed that in the recent days there were quite a few gaps in the traffic graphs which usually has to do with the hostsystem of our vps
21:00 <@EastByte> I didn't report it, yet
21:05 <@deen> would be nice, maybe they can investigate too
