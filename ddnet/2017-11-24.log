02:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I found the mistake
02:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/953
11:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I added some tests ðŸ˜ƒ
12:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #954: Change some config variable defaults to official server values (master...pr_ddnet_config_defaults) https://git.io/vFp8A
12:52 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> ``sv_emoticon_delay 1`` pls
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Y pls
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> There is no reason to not have it and kinda everyone likes it more
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> pls pls
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ezy I know a reason not to have it
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @jao I'm just adjusting the values in the code to the values the official ddnet servers have
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> performance @heinrich5991 ?
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> tell me ur reason then o.O
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> @heinrich5991 it's the default value on all servers but GER and RUS ðŸ˜›
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @jao I can't find that configuration on CHN
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> ðŸ˜®
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> So why is it not set to 1 on GER RUS and CHN?
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> where is it set to 1?
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon it would definitely, and without question, to people spamming the emotes ðŸ˜ƒ
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Usa
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and where is the problem with spamming emotes?
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Tell me the reason why not set to 1
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Xd
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it is nice for swag and communication
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> because it's annoying
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> USA Chile Brazil CAN ZAF
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Only 1% of players find it being annoyinh
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> communication works fine at 1 per 3 seconds, in my experience
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ezy stop making up numbers
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> No i know from expierience
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, you don't
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Look even in this chat
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you just pulled that number out of nowhere ðŸ˜›
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can say "few players find it annoying"
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> 3 People fighting for it 1 against
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Then take that
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's 25%
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> It's true tho that ger people like it when they join USA for example
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> we need an official poll
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> in forum
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what do you mean, like it? they use it?
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ezy anyway, there's your reason
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you said there was none, my job was only to remind you of people on the other side of the debate ðŸ˜ƒ
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you said there was none, my job was only to remind you of people on the other side of the debate ðŸ™‚
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> hi
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Every blocker server has it. Ive never seen someone dislike it but i have seen some liking it
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> spamming emotes is the best
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> y
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> f3
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> And another one
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Yes they use it and ask me why it's not the same on GER ðŸ˜›
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I mean, is there an actual reason to not have it on GER or was it just never changed because no one thought about doing it
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't know who changed it where tbh
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if I was to unify the settings, I'd change everything to 3?
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if I was to unify the settings, I'd change everything to 3
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Then you will upset all Americans
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> They really do spam emotes a lot
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> good thing I'm usually playing on ger servers ðŸ™‚
13:45 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> you should put a chat cooldown in chile servers too
13:45 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> lul
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> 1 text per 2 minutes would be great
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> Xd
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> one thing is that USA is more of a fun place tho while GER is more competitive-ish
14:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you are funny guys
14:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's like you take numbers from nowhere, and also you telling us what "people would like to see", like you are perfect guys to know that. No, you arent ðŸ˜‰
14:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No one here is
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> stop fighting in that way, and give us advantages and disadvantages, and afterall as people
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on forum
14:12 <+FlushA> Hello
14:12 <@heinrich5991> hi :)
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> sure I can if people give me feedback about it
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ask people *
14:12 <+FlushA> i have a question about bam and visual studio
14:12 <+FlushA> can i ask ?
14:12 <@heinrich5991> sure
14:13 <+FlushA> how i can compile bam with visual studio 2017
14:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> By using visual studio?
14:13 <+FlushA> no
14:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You mean, by using that "compile" button?
14:13 <+FlushA> i can use visual studio as compiler
14:13 <+FlushA> but i want use bam
14:14 <+FlushA> like this bam release in a cmd screen
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I bet, that you can execute custom build tool
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> via visual studio
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hefydhhy.aspx
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe that will help you
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why not using cmake then ?
14:17 <+FlushA> cmake is good but every time open client after cmake done and this make me slow in my coding
14:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh?
14:18 <+FlushA> :D
14:18 <+FlushA> my English is a too bad i know sorry about that
14:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no no, my either.. don't worry ðŸ˜ƒ just, in visual studio you have a play button
14:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you click that, it will compile and run
14:19 <+FlushA> exacly
14:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but you can execute only build
14:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> via visual studio
14:19 <+FlushA> i just want compile codes not run
14:19 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> @Savander I'm perfect
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @worstwish go to the north korea
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you fit to the government
14:21 <@heinrich5991> FlushA: have you tried following the cmake instructions at https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765 ?
14:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> lul
14:21 <@heinrich5991> you should be able to "just compile" there as well
14:21 <@heinrich5991> without executing
14:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You can use the shortcut "CTRL+SHIFT+B" and it will just build without running.
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @heinrich5991 Have you know any good books about algorithms?
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> from beginning, I would like to learn
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh...
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but no idea, where to start huh
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'll ask someone
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I feel like a bad programmer, without good foundations
14:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh.. as said, I'll ask someone
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could ask on some subreddit as well, they usually give good answers
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right, maybe i should start to use reddit
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But if you would know something, I would be appreciated
16:47 <+nemo2> It's definitely a good idea to know algorithms and which ones are best to choose under which circumstances, but it is interesting to me how few opportunities I've had to ever make a fundamental data structure
16:48 <+nemo2> in my entire paid programming career, I've had a reason to implement a sort exactly once
16:48 <+nemo2> for j2me
16:48 <+nemo2> so far no reason to implement any custom map or tree.
16:49 <+nemo2> hedgewars does have its own doubly linked lists, but I bet those will go away if/when we transition to rust
16:49 <+nemo2> and it wouldn't even have those if unc0rr wasn't trying to stick to non-OOP pascal
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander regularly see people working on "Algorithms in C" not sure if it's any good tho
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't want to reinwent algorithms
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just want, to know how they works and be better in making custom if needed
18:29 <+Learath2> I think that's what the book teaches tho
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tha'ts why im asking for a book :D:D
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you know good one
18:44 <+Learath2> "Algorithms in C" is the name of the book :P
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ohhhhhh
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Am I stupid ?
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> probably
19:04 <+Learath2> definately not
19:57 < fool_> what library is ddnet dependent on to be able to run on linux
19:58 <+fool_> it doesn't start. I must install dependency, then I must play.
19:58 <+fool_> what library is ddnet dependent on to be able to run on linux
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> read Readme.md
19:59 <+fool_> readme.txt -> CTRL F -> dependency, linux, ubuntu
20:00 <+fool_> nothing. just tell me.
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> There's clear instructions
20:00 <+fool_> I don't want to compile.
20:01 <+fool_> I trust you not to build virii into the binaries.. 
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sudo apt install cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libsdl2-dev
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> without dev
20:01 <+fool_> I just had to install one graphics runtime or whatever for ddnet to run
20:02 <+fool_> no cmake.. I use the libraries
20:02 <+fool_> *binaries
20:02 <@heinrich5991> fool_: try to run ddnet from the console
20:02 <@heinrich5991> it'll show you what is missing
20:03 <+fool_> how to run it in the console? omg I'm a noob. I tried ~/DDNet-10.8.6-linux_x86_64$ run ddnet
20:04 <+fool_> *ddnet* didn't work either
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You need at least this: curl freetype2 opusfile sdl2
20:04 <@heinrich5991> ./DDNet
20:04 <@heinrich5991> fool_: ^
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Am I right @heinrich5991 ?
20:05 <+fool_> Okay.  libSDL2-2.0.so.0 is missing. THank you heinrich5991 
20:07 <@heinrich5991> fool_: I'm away for some time, can't help you for the next half hour or so
20:07 <+fool_> I will manage. THank yuo.
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> can someone say if/when this thing is finished that you can play maps on your homeserver and still get the ranks?
23:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> when what is done?
23:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> oh
23:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> i heard one big problem is that you cant say where tele will spawnb you
23:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it would make it technically possible. we're still far away from that
23:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
23:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we'll make that predictable somewhen
23:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> ye pls
23:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> because i cant speedrun anymore for like a week now ðŸ˜¦
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
