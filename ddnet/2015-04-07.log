17:42 <@deen> molch: here i am
17:44 < DawnDN> Hello, please I need fast help
17:45 <@EastByte> DawnDN: what's the problem
17:45 < DawnDN> I was trying to set up a Server
17:45 < DawnDN> with your Mod
17:45 < DawnDN> Linux based
17:45 <@EastByte> ddnet?
17:46 < DawnDN> But when I try to start the Server I become following error: "error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
17:46 < DawnDN> yes, ddnet
17:46 <@EastByte> looks like you have a different libstdc++
17:47 < DawnDN> what's that? :D
17:47 <@EastByte> might be a better idea to compile the mod by yourself
17:47 < DawnDN> and how I can compile it for Linux?
17:48 <@EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/archive/7.3.4.zip
17:48 <@EastByte> here is the sourcecode of an up to date version
17:48 < DawnDN> thanks
17:48 < DawnDN> what I have to do now?
17:48 <@EastByte> for the build you need bam and some compiler packages
17:49 < DawnDN> oh man, I have no plan of that..
17:49 <@EastByte> which distribution are you using?
17:50 < DawnDN> ah
17:50 < DawnDN> I tried the 7.3.5 version
17:50 < DawnDN> and that function
17:51 <@EastByte> oh, 7.3.4 isn't that up to date
17:51 < DawnDN> yea I know..
17:52 <@EastByte> but the problem is you cannot run the binary on your server because your linux distribution uses a different version of libstdc++
17:56 < DawnDN> Ups sorry
17:56 <@EastByte> 18:00:28       @EastByte | but the problem is you cannot run the binary on your server because your linux distribution
17:56 <@EastByte>                          | uses a different version of libstdc++
17:56 < DawnDN> Also, it's a problem that I use the 7.3.5?
17:56 < DawnDN> ah ok :/
17:56 <@deen> or no libstdc++ at all
17:56 <@EastByte> ^
17:57 <@deen> sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
17:57 <@deen> I compile DDNet on a shit old Debian distribution that is not supported anymore
17:57 <@deen> if your libstdc++ is older than that, you have problems :P
17:57 < DawnDN> warning: The apt tool and its associated API are planned to be removed in the next major JDK release.  These features have been superseded by javac and the standardized annotation processing API, javax.annotation.processing and javax.lang.model.  Users are recommended to migrate to the annotation processing features of javac; see the javac man page for more information.
17:57 <@deen> DawnDN: what distribution do you use?
17:57 <@EastByte> what has java to do with apt?
17:58 <@deen> not a debian based distro i guess
17:58 < DawnDN> don't know :D It's not my root, it's the root from my uncle
17:58 <@deen> uname -a
17:58 < DawnDN> Linux euve37417.vserver.de 3.2.41-042stab103.6 #1 SMP Wed Jan 21 13:07:39 MSK 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux
17:58 <@deen> but anyway, you'll probably have to ask your uncle to install libstdc++6
17:58 <@deen> if you don't have root access
17:59 < DawnDN> I have full root acess
17:59 <@EastByte> first check whether it's installed or not :D
17:59 < DawnDN> Oh man, Linux is so hard :D
17:59 <@EastByte> hm how to check
17:59 <@deen> Try this to find out what distro you have: https://www.howtoforge.com/how_to_find_out_about_your_linux_distribution
18:00 < DawnDN> Debian GNU/Linux 7 \n \l
18:01 <@EastByte> I guess it's debian
18:01 < heinrich5991> [    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset
18:01 < heinrich5991> :)
18:01 < heinrich5991> (sorry)
18:01 <@EastByte> ah
18:01 < DawnDN> I only understand "bla bla bla" :D  I am not that computer expert :/
18:02 <@EastByte> DawnDN: do you have root access?
18:02 < DawnDN> yea
18:02 <@EastByte> well
18:03 <@deen> as root this should work: apt-get install libstdc++6
18:03 < DawnDN> yeah it works
18:03 < DawnDN> but what does I install? :D
18:04 <@deen> the standard library for c++
18:04 < DawnDN> and what's the differences between DDNet 7.4 and DDNet 7.3.5?
18:04 <@deen> it's necessary to run c++ programs
18:04 < DawnDN> ah oke
18:04 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/releases lists the changes
18:04 < DawnDN> I ask him later
18:04 <@deen> wait, wrong website^^
18:04 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/downloads
18:05 < DawnDN> I only use the mod for a Block-map
18:05 < DawnDN> called Starblock
18:05 < DawnDN> also no race
18:06 < DawnDN> lol I saw the changes, nothing for me :D
18:06 <@EastByte> atleast the right mod
18:07 < DawnDN> I don't want any race bugs fixed, 'cause the Map has no Race xd
18:07 < DawnDN> thanks for your very very nice and fast support!
18:07 <@deen> Good luck with your server
18:07 < DawnDN> oh wiat
18:07 < DawnDN> wait*
18:07 < DawnDN> I have 2 questions
18:08 < DawnDN> 1. do you have a script that starts the server automaticly if the server goes down?
18:08 < DawnDN> 2. how I can send an echo broadcast to ALL Servers, like you
18:08 < DawnDN> sorry for my bad English/
18:10 <@deen> yes, i do
18:10 <@deen> but without linux knowledge this stuff isn't all that simple
18:11 < DawnDN> oh ok..
18:11 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/run64.sh
18:11 <@deen> This is my script to auto-restart servers
18:11 < DawnDN> ehm yes, okay xd
18:11 < DawnDN> nothing for me :D
18:11 < DawnDN> and what's with the broadcast?
18:11 <@deen> I think people have easier solutions, you could google for teeworlds server management
18:12 <@deen> for each server you need an entry 'sv_input_fifo "foo.fifo"' like here: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/servers/8303.cfg
18:12 < DawnDN> xd
18:12 < DawnDN> ehm 
18:12 <@deen> and then you can do 'echo "broadcast blabla" > *.fifo'
18:12 <@deen> in the shell
18:12 < DawnDN> also
18:13 < DawnDN> I have to paste that in the autoexec or what?
18:13 <@deen> if you want multiple servers, you can'T just have an autoexec.cfg
18:13 <@deen> you need server1.cfg server2.cfg and so on
18:13 <@deen> and at least set a different port in them
18:14 < DawnDN> at the moment I have 2 servers online
18:14 < DawnDN> 1. ddnet and 1. tournament
18:14 <@deen> From what I've heard there are helpful people in teeworlds-friends.de
18:14 < DawnDN> both configs are called "autoexec.cfg"
18:14 <@deen> ok, just in different directories? that works as well
18:15 < DawnDN> puh I think my english is to underskilled for all that difficult stuff :D
18:15 <@deen> start slow and try stuff
18:16 < DawnDN> do you have a german IRC too?
18:17 <@deen> nope. some people here speak german (including me), but I don't really want to do much support for other servers, sorry
18:17 < DawnDN> and what's with Skype, maybe for Teamviewer or anything else, if you want to help me :/?
18:18 < SHAY> DawnDN
18:18 < DawnDN> yes
18:19 < SHAY> I made an external program for Broadcast, some Admin commands etc.
18:19 < SHAY> you type in the IP
18:19 < SHAY> and the broadcast
18:19 < SHAY> blablabla
18:19 < DawnDN> oh ok
18:19 < SHAY> I will contact you in a few minutes, and send you my program and tell you all about that. It's very easy
18:20 < DawnDN> thaaaanks bro
18:20 < SHAY> I will send you a eMail. See you later
18:20 < SHAY> And DDNet, nice work! I will support and donate :-)
18:20 < DawnDN> lol
18:20 < DawnDN> that was fast xd
18:20 <@deen> huh, who was that?^^
18:20 <@EastByte> DawnDN: there is your help :P
18:21 <@deen> I mean, how did he know what we're writing in here?
18:21 < DawnDN> don't know xd
18:21 <@EastByte> I guess he is reading the chat somehow
18:21 < DawnDN> maybe he joined with other name
18:21 < DawnDN> minutes ago
18:21 < DawnDN> i don't have a plan :D
18:21 < DawnDN> or maybe he hacks your IRC xd
18:21 <@deen> must be someone who's here right now
18:21 <@EastByte> yep
18:21 < DawnDN> hm
18:21 < DawnDN> anyway
18:22 < DawnDN> thanks for your help
18:22 <@deen> I'm a bit suspicious when someone randomly joins and can help you setup stuff on your root server
18:22 < DawnDN> you mean I can't trust him?
18:22 < DawnDN> I don't know :/
18:22 <@deen> Maybe send us a link to the program he sends you, before you run it
18:22 < DawnDN> i mean, he came in, told me all and goes directly
18:22 <@deen> and I've never heard the name SHAY before
18:22 < DawnDN> sure I will test it on virustotal etc.
18:23 < DawnDN> i heared it
18:23 <@EastByte> virustotal won't help
18:23 < DawnDN> he's a big server hoster
18:23 < DawnDN> have his own mods etc.
18:23 < DawnDN> in block many people talk about him :D
18:23 < DawnDN> but he's not online lel
18:23 < DawnDN> also in teeworlds
18:24 <@EastByte> maybe you had the same topic with him before?
18:24 < DawnDN> which topic?
18:24 <@EastByte> or he overheard it somewhere else
18:24 <@EastByte> server administration
18:24 <@EastByte> + broadcast
18:24 < DawnDN> hm
18:24 < DawnDN> don't know
18:24 < DawnDN> did you have his IP?
18:25 < DawnDN> if he hacks me or anything else ;x I don't know now I can trust him or not :D
18:25 <@EastByte> ips are public in irc
18:25 <@EastByte> SHAY (webchat@p4FFD787E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #ddnet
18:25 <@EastByte> well you have to lookup it first
18:25 < DawnDN> ah ok
18:26 <@EastByte> but generally you don't need it anyway
18:26 < DawnDN> yea
18:26 < DawnDN> you're right
18:26 < DawnDN> i check my email xd
18:27 < DawnDN> lool
18:27 < DawnDN> how he knows my fxcking email adress?
18:27 < DawnDN> he send me a .exe and a github source code for his program 
18:28 < DawnDN> and the last sentence was "don't ever send it to other people. No system is safe"
18:28 <@EastByte> he probably knows you well
18:28 < DawnDN> and the email is a trash mail lol
18:29 <@EastByte> I can check the sourcecode if you want
18:29 <@EastByte> can't be more suspicious
18:29 < DawnDN> but he wrote that I don't ever send it :x
18:30 <@EastByte> with the reason "No system is safe" ?
18:30 < DawnDN> also
18:30 < DawnDN> I have 1 email
18:31 < DawnDN> this inculudes the .exe, the github link and the sentence "Don't ever send it to other people. No system is safe" don't know what he means with that
18:31 <@EastByte> yea, it's suspicious
18:32 <@EastByte> well you can't run the .exe on your server anyway
18:32 <@EastByte> and the sourcecode also might be for windows only
18:32 <@EastByte> oh wait, it was a client right
18:33 <@EastByte> nevermind
18:33 < DawnDN> a client 
18:33 < DawnDN> + the source
18:34 < DawnDN> wtf
18:34 <@EastByte> could be any source
18:34 < DawnDN> I downloadet the source
18:34 < DawnDN> and now the link of the source is offline
18:34 < DawnDN> deleted
18:34 < DawnDN> man
18:34 < DawnDN> what is going on with this guy
18:35 < DawnDN> so serious
18:35 < DawnDN> and at the end he's one of the biggest hackers in the world :D
18:37 <@EastByte> what do you mean?
18:37 < DawnDN> he deleted the file from github
18:37 < DawnDN> not aviable anymore
18:37 < DawnDN> how do he knows if I downloadet the src or not?
18:38 <@EastByte> no idea
18:38 < DawnDN> I don't trust this guy
18:40 < DawnDN> lol I tried to write him a eMail
18:40 < DawnDN> The error that the other server returned was: 550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist.

18:40 < DawnDN> this error pops up
18:41 <@EastByte> so...
18:41 < DawnDN> what do you think about that?
18:41 <@EastByte> how does it come that he uses the same ip address as you?
18:41 <@EastByte> DawnDN (webchat@p4FFD787E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #ddnet
18:41 <@EastByte> SHAY (webchat@p4FFD787E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #ddnet
18:41 < DawnDN> what do you mean?
18:42 < DawnDN> wtf
18:42 <@EastByte> you both are sharing the same ip
18:42 < DawnDN> lemme check that
18:42 < DawnDN> OMG
18:42 < DawnDN> WHAT DOES HE MAKE
18:42 < DawnDN> now i am very scared
18:43 < DawnDN> man
18:43 < DawnDN> help me
18:43 < DawnDN> what's going on here? :(
18:44 <@EastByte> he probably put a RAT on you
18:44 < DawnDN> but how?
18:45 < DawnDN> I never downloadet the .exe
18:45 < DawnDN> and I don't opened the source
18:45 <@EastByte> it was before
18:45 < DawnDN> and I never was in contact with him before
18:45 <@EastByte> that's why he can read the chat
18:45 < DawnDN> what I have to do now? help me pls :'(
18:47 < heinrich5991> what's a RAT?
18:47 < DawnDN> trojaner
18:48 < DawnDN> man?
18:48 < DawnDN> hello?
18:48 < DawnDN> why all my .exe datas are .ink now???????????
18:48 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: it's the blocker community, kinda normal there
18:49 < heinrich5991> you mean .lnk?
18:49 < DawnDN> can't open it anymore
18:49 < DawnDN> nothing
18:49 < DawnDN> yes lnk
18:49 < DawnDN> i think
18:49 < heinrich5991> that's a shortcut
18:49 < heinrich5991> normally the extension is invisible
18:49 < DawnDN> what the fuck going on here? :(
18:50 <@EastByte> there he is
18:50 < heinrich5991> if your computer is compromised, there''s not much you can do about that
18:50 < SHAY> No System is Safe.
18:50 < heinrich5991> ahaha
18:50 <@EastByte> DawnDN: just reinstall your computer
18:50 < DawnDN> I have a windows 7 cd
18:50 < DawnDN> maybe you have right
18:51 < DawnDN> but I have a client
18:51 < DawnDN> and if i reinstall it i havent it anymore
18:51 <@EastByte> is it some kind of botting client?
18:51 < DawnDN> no
18:51 < DawnDN> some feauters
18:51 < DawnDN> i hate bots :D
18:52 <@EastByte> just keep the binary of the client
18:52 < DawnDN> i used a bot as i start to play teeworlds. 1 week and than i l deletet it. since this day i've never touched a bot again
18:52 < DawnDN> but how he can write with my fxcking ip????
18:53 <@EastByte> typical feature of a RAT

19:00 <@deen> Weird guy
19:00 <@EastByte> welcome back detective deen 
19:01 <@deen> No idea why he faked all that
19:01 <@EastByte> yea, (as SHAY) he pretended to be a ddnet donator :/
19:02 <@EastByte> bad guy
19:02 <@deen> ^^
19:03 < dawndn> Back
19:03 < dawndn> I have to create a new partition or what?
19:04 < o_be_one> hi molch can i help you ? 
19:04 < dawndn> Who is molch?
19:04 <@EastByte> dawndn: just use the default choice in the win7 install assistent
19:05 <@EastByte> it will erase all partitions
19:05 < dawndn> Ah ok
19:05 <@EastByte> (if it didn't change)
19:05 < o_be_one> a player in the chat, dawndn, he was asking for help and i can help if he havent an answer :).
19:05 <@deen> o_be_one: i talked to him in PM
19:05 <@deen> he's afk now
19:05 < o_be_one> well good to know ^^
19:06 <@deen> he found a weird thing on our block servers: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/190
19:06 <@deen> no idea yet how it's caused
19:06 < o_be_one> i know this deen 
19:06 < dawndn> Omg it's so slow xd
19:06 < o_be_one> it concerns only blmapV3ROYAL
19:07 < dawndn> o_bee_one do you know o_tee_one?
19:07 < o_be_one> it's easy to do, the player go to the end to get endless hook
19:07 < o_be_one> dawndn, it's me
19:07 < dawndn> Ah xd
19:07 < dawndn> nice to see you
19:08 < o_be_one> deen, the player goes with his dummy after, to then end, and hook dummy to the tele (where ninja is), so his dummy is hooked at spawn with ninja, he can move with ninja and jump to go the place where he wants to go
19:08 < dawndn> nazar don't ddos your servers anymore?
19:08 < o_be_one> dawndn, nice to see you too :). You want to host a TW ?

19:08 < o_be_one> dawndn, in my side, no problem at this time ... about DDNet side, i thinks it's ok. Well i think nazar is not able to DDoS our servers, i hope too
19:09 < dawndn> Ok
19:09 <@EastByte> was nazar the 40gbit ddoser?
19:09 < dawndn> But the ddnet block servers can be crashed without ddos very easylie
19:10 <@deen> dawndn: show me how?
19:10 < o_be_one> deen, yes, nobody can move it so, he is just hooked from the end :p. it's not a bug, just a stupid and annoying map exploit ... We can't stop that since it's a map possibility, or we must edit the map or add a rule, idk ... But by experience it's not a real problem for me, just annoying sometime when you spawn
19:10 < dawndn> o be one yes, I host servers :D but atm i have other problems lol
19:10 < dawndn> deen I can't do it but I know some persons who did it 
19:11 < o_be_one> EastByte, i dont think, but how is it possible to confirm that ? Nazar claims every ddos to be from him, but it was often from vali, you see what i mean ?
19:11 <@deen> dawndn: i believe we fixed that already
19:11 < dawndn> not vali
19:11 < dawndn> I am a good friend of vali
19:11 < o_be_one> vali is "calm" atm
19:11 <@EastByte> maybe he is SHAY?
19:11 < dawndn> Yeah
19:11 < dawndn> Everyday I skype with vali
19:11 < dawndn> xd
19:12 < o_be_one> i think he have a GF ahah :D

19:20 < o_be_one> dawndn, i'm just curious, never seen your servers :)
19:20 < dawndn> it was a long time down
19:21 < dawndn> 'Cause of hackers
19:21 < o_be_one> it's hard to host quality servers ...
19:21 < dawndn> Some idiots crasht my servers, hacked the password etc
19:21 < dawndn> Crashed*
19:21 <@EastByte> it's hard to write proper software...
19:22 < dawndn> But now I have servers which are ddos protectet up to 480gbit/s :D

23:23 <@deen> WolfAlex: i don't understand zcatch. always when I'm close to winning the ban me^^
23:27 < Learath2> deen: dont think thats quite fun 
23:28 <@deen> i neither understand the rules of zcatch nor am I the one running the DDNet zcatch servers
23:28 <@deen> so I'm not interfering
23:28 < Learath2> its like a tradition 
23:28 < Learath2> they funvote the guy close to winning 
23:28 <@deen> But from what I've heard .me' is talking to Savander, who's running it, and there are plans to get more mods
