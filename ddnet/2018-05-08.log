08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen emojis are good again? ^^
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> someone asked, it's not on master branch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9alANBdAeiQ&feature=youtu.be

08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª ^
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess I don't understand the text buffering system well enough to make it work with emojis
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they showed up but were flickering
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for a little FUD on emojis: IIRC caused crashes
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know, the emoji rendering code was a bit complicated. I fixed some crash, but probably not all
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sry im hater of emoji system ;P
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> IMO, a great game doesn't use a chat to show emotions, social actions etc.
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> binding such stuff to the ingame character is pretty common, and teeworlds does good there. no need to be the next whatsapp
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I agree, not planning to put that in DDNet source code, just trying to help out Pathos.
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well the text creation is pretty similar to textex function, so just create the space for the emojis and render the emojis independed from the text i'd say
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª could you try doing that? I guess it would be easier for you
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im not well with this emoji code :/, the one who wrote the emoji code could probably do it
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> are you bringing back emojies?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Rockus.~ read the chat log ðŸ˜„
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> where is that? xd
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> too much to read
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> just answer it please xd
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Rockus.~ just read literally like 10 lines or so
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> but emojies were cool
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> it's a good way to express ourselves
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pastoer> its an lazy way
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @Admin fix the client kappa, the newest ddnet version has a mouse bug, you cant move the cursor
21:58 <@heinrich5991> deen: my thought was that this was already talked about for hours
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is https download for maps deactivated?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is some map missing on https://maps.ddnet.tw/?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think there are more maps than on ddnet. some fng maps slipped in there.
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's intentional
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we were collecting maps from popular tw servers for faster downloads
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now stopped obviously after the hash collision attack
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @deen  you can still add the maps of my server too for http download
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so thats why konsti was so deperite to upload maps to that site some days ago?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it was sp someone
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> konsti just tried to sneak in his glitched fix
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> on getspeed
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well thats what the map says but are you sure?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its literally sp someone whom asked on this channel
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> about it
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i didnt see that.
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> type `maps.ddnet.tw` in searchbar
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah yeah. i remember
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> Has anyone downloaded the Spring Creator update from Windows 10 yet? When I go out of the game with alt + tab it loads quite long and also again when I go in. Normally I only know this from games like F1, Dark Souls or Counter Strike. Anybody know the problem?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I recognized that problem as well kero, but sometimes it randomly works as usual..
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> hm ok
