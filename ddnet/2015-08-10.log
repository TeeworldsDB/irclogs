00:00 < KinG_> deen: one of servers still have ddnet ger name
00:01 <@heinrich5991> good night :)
00:01 <@EastByte> gn8
00:02 <@deen> KinG_: don't see it, port?
00:02 < KinG_> 8317
00:03 < KinG_> and deen  can u run some more servers?
00:03 <@deen> it says "DDNet Persian" for me
00:03 <@deen> some more servers?
00:03 <@deen> more DDNet mod?
00:03 <@deen> or other mods?
00:08 < KinG_> no just ddnet
00:08 < KinG_> and ictf
00:08 <@deen> KinG_: if there are more players, ok
00:08 < KinG_> we have some good ictf players
00:08 <@deen> i generally only run more servers when there is no empty server left
00:09 < KinG_> hm ok so forget more ddnet servers
00:09 < KinG_> just run ictf
00:12 <@deen> the Persian server has nice CPU performance
00:14 <@deen> ictf running too
11:20 <@EastByte> oh, matricks already used custom new/delete operators in entities and player

14:30 < Savander> heinrich5991, there are somewhere demos from last teewords tournament?
14:30 <@heinrich5991> I don't know
14:31 <@heinrich5991> I haven't taken part in it
14:31 <@deen> Savander: i remember that i recorded them on ddnet servers that were used for tournament
14:31 <@deen> and i send the final demo files to the organizers
14:31 <@deen> no idea what they then did with those demos
14:39 < Savander> hm
14:39 < Savander> do you have them?
14:39 < Savander> probably no
14:39 < Savander> :P
14:40 <@deen> i don'T think i do
14:40 <@deen> and i only ran the "boring" servers
14:40 <@deen> RUS and USA
14:40 < Savander> You know, those demos are really good materials to montage.
14:40 <@deen> not where the main action was
14:40 < Savander> oh

18:54 < BeaR_> io
19:00 < Savander_> deen,  it's possbile
19:00 < Savander_> to hide scoreboard?
19:00 < Savander_> on demo
19:00 < Savander_> after death xd?
19:02 <@EastByte> needs client mod I guess
19:03 < Savander_> hm
19:03 < Savander_> EastByte,  it's possible
19:03 < Savander_> to start demo
19:03 < Savander_> without this console
19:03 < Savander_> ?
19:03 < Savander_> bind for start
19:03 <@EastByte> "without this console" ?
19:03 < Savander_> this at bottom
19:03 < Savander_> where you have all buttons
19:04 < BeaR_> press 'Esc'
19:04 <@EastByte> ^
19:04 < Savander_> i know but
19:04 < Savander_> without.. 
19:04 < Savander_> xd
19:04 <@EastByte> without the progress bar?
19:04 < Nimda> New channel peak for #ddnet: 27 users online. Old one was 26 users online at 2014-10-07 22:44:23 (306 days, 20 hours, 20 minutes and 6 seconds ago)
19:04 < Ryozuki> hihi
19:04 < Ryozuki> xD
19:04 <@EastByte> or without pressing esc
19:04 < Savander_> i mean, i want to start demo without this progress bar and those buttons
19:05 <@EastByte> needs client mod I guess
19:05 < Ryozuki> ;(
19:05 <@EastByte> hi Ryozuki 
19:05 < BeaR_> starts without them by default here
19:05 <@EastByte> but the progress bar is still there
19:05 < BeaR_> nop
19:05 <@EastByte> (depends on resolutin)
19:05 <@EastByte> not visible on wide resolution I think
19:05 < Ryozuki> isn't posible to start demo without the demo hud? 
19:06 < Ryozuki> i have 1920
19:06 < Ryozuki> res
19:06 <@EastByte> deen: ?
19:06 < Ryozuki> looks like isn't possible
19:06 < BeaR_> why should it depend on resolution ?
19:07 <@EastByte> bug
19:07 < BeaR_> well, on 1680x1050 it works
19:07 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/public/videos/speedmeter.webm
19:07 <@EastByte> no progress bar here
19:08 < Ryozuki> yeah but we want to record at 1080..
19:08 < BeaR_> try a lower resolution to see if it works there, then we know if it's a bug or not
19:14 < BeaR_> w/e \o/
19:16 < Savander_> grr
19:16 <@EastByte>  /o
19:17 < BeaR_> Savander_: so does it work?
19:17 < Savander_> hmm?
19:17 < Savander_> we need full hd
19:17 < Savander_> don't know if it works
19:17 < Savander_> now i have another problem
19:17 < BeaR_> ^^
19:17 < Savander_> because it's not possible to
19:17 < Savander_> hide "death scoreboard"
19:18 < BeaR_> indeed
19:18 < BeaR_> 4K would be cool (:
19:19 < BeaR_> but probably requires off screen rendering
19:21 < Savander_> 2k doesn't work property
19:21 < Savander_> (ryozuki tested)
19:21 < BeaR_> "doesn't work" means ?:
19:23 < Savander_> don't know, just bugged, ask ryozuki ^^
