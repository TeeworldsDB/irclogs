00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I think we could fix whatever bug this uses
04:28 <+Learath2> definitely should fix the bug if it breaks demo playback
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 that we can, but change map I would not
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Could it be that the grenade prediction still uses the old physics
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, could be
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The code is written with the copy-and-paste code pattern
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> git grep AntiPingWeapons might help in finding the location, if anyone wants to fix
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so i was just playing Just copy fly by vasten. and fikmesan joined. and after some time we both had it that the dummies desynchronize all of a sudden. it worked perfectly fine but then both of us had it.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> server lag maybe
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> I am getting this when I try to run the server on centos 7: ./server: /lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by ./server)
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> hlep
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> apparently Centos 7 ships a rather old version of libstdc++ that does not support the abi ddnet was compiled with and after some research it appears they do not even ship c++11 compilant g++
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> Is there someone who knows perfectly how works "layers" in serverside?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> like entities, for example if you spawn an armor before a heart
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> will the armor be hidden behind the heart?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> Not sure what you mean, this sounds rather like a question related to the order in which the client renders things, could you clarify what you mean by hidden ?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> @HMH I have a really poor knowledge in C++, could you tell me, what I need?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> I tried gc++ 4.9 and some others but it didn't help
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> So you did try to compile ddnet from source with g++4.9 ?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Yes
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> But I am getting error messages that the libraries are missing
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> All of them
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> on  that Centos 7 machine ?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Yes
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> How did you install g++4.9 on Centos then, maybe some librarysearchpaths are not set properly ?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> I think that I installed this https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-sclo-rh/devtoolset-3-gcc-c++-4.9.2-6.el7.x86_64.rpm.html

20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> The libraries are installed. You are talking about the search path, how can I change it?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> I thought you already got the server compiled, currently cmake tries to also find all libraries required to build the client but fails. To turn building the client of invoke cmake like that: `cmake -DCLIENT=OFF ..`
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> I thought you already got the server compiled, currently cmake tries to also find all libraries required to build the client but fails. To turn building the client off invoke cmake like that: `cmake -DCLIENT=OFF ..`
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Where can I find the result?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> if by result you mean the binaries you need to run make first: `make DDNet-Server -j$(nproc)`
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Yes, thank you a lot
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Now it is working, thank you a lot
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> nice, then have fun with your freshly compiled DDNet-Server ðŸ˜ƒ
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh, our version should work with old libcxx
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @HMH maybe can we take some time in private? I could show you
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> or wait
22:51 <+Learath2> that sounds oddly erotic
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> xd
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @HMH lets take as example this pic
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> 
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/417438647101423616/unknown.png
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> you see, in serverside, inside the Snap function, you're mostly creating whatever you want, actually there it creates a pickup (heart, armor, idk)
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> imagine that I copy all of those line inside the function, & i paste it after (editing for make it work)
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> & the 1st code will spawn a heart, but the 2nd an armor
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> so:
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> Snap()
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> {
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> spawning_heart
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> 
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> spawning_armor
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> // both at the same position xd
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> }
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> will the heart be hidden behind the armor cuz he's spawned before?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> (actually ik that snap doesn't spawn smth)
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> it shows
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> sry my bad to explain xD
