11:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 40a36a3 def: Minor fix
13:32 < Learath2> is there a problem with just adding a new message to the protocol ?
13:32 <@EastByte> yes
13:33 < Learath2> i remember some talk about extending it and stuff
13:33 <@EastByte> all bits are in use
13:33 <@EastByte> yes, we wanted to do that
13:33 < Learath2> idk how it works but what would happen if i add a new message ?
13:34 <@EastByte> I think it would be ambiguous with another message then
13:34 <@EastByte> because of the bitmasking
13:34 < Learath2> is the packet size set and adding a new message would make it a new bit bigger ?
13:35 <@EastByte> the header always has the same size, you cannot change that
13:35 <@EastByte> we probably need to implement a sub protocol
13:35 <@EastByte> using and existing unused message id
13:35 < Learath2> should have done that before we ran out of ids 
13:36 <@EastByte> yea
13:36 < Learath2> so the msg id is in the header ?
13:39 <@EastByte> it's the first byte of the chunk data I think
13:41 < Learath2> yeah its packer reset and addint(type)
13:41 < Learath2> dont see how it needs extending
13:42 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L579
13:43 <@EastByte> there is a problem with this "hack" I think
13:45 <@EastByte> so the first bit of the byte is the system flag
13:46 <@EastByte> maybe it's possible keeping this bit intact, but we need to care about the integer compression then
13:53 < Learath2> oh the leftmost bit gets thrown out
14:00 < Learath2> EastByte: *((unsigned char*)Packet.m_pData) |= 1; wouldnt this destroy the entire msg id tho ?
14:01 < Lady> heinrich5991 ?!
14:01 < Learath2> !?
14:01 < Lady> you are not heinrich5991 
14:01 < Lady> I need him
14:01 <@EastByte> / unpack msgid and system flag
14:01 <@EastByte> int Msg = Unpacker.GetInt();
14:01 <@EastByte> int Sys = Msg&1;
14:01 <@EastByte> Msg >>= 1;
14:02 < Learath2> thats kinda rude 
14:02 <@EastByte> you see the shift right there
14:02 < Learath2> x | 1 = 1 is a tautology isnt it ?
14:03 <@EastByte> what do you mean?
14:03 < Learath2> x | 1 is always 1 given any x ?
14:03 <@EastByte> no
14:03 <@EastByte> | is bitwise or
14:04 <@EastByte> can also be a higher value
14:04 <@EastByte> 1111 | 1 = 1111
14:04 < Learath2> 1 = 00000001 isnt it ? :P
14:05 <@EastByte> you said x | 1
14:05 < Learath2> i somewhy thought 1 would be 11111111
14:06 <@EastByte> oh
14:07 < Learath2> so we have exactly (unsigned char
14:07 < Learath2> (unsigned char - 1) bits for the msg id
14:08 <@EastByte> I think 7 bit for game messages and 7 bit for system messages
14:09 < Learath2> 7bits + 1bit system flag should give us around 2^7 = 128 msg ids 
14:10 <@EastByte> maybe we got something wrong
14:10 < Learath2> i dont see anything else modifying the message id
14:12 < Learath2> EastByte: NETMSG_AUTH_CHALLANGE any idea what these are ? they dont seem to be used anywhere
14:12 <@EastByte> it's unused
14:12 <@EastByte> also maybe by using a higher msg id number the integer compression will start using 2 bytes
14:14 < Learath2> maybe i should just use those
14:15 <@EastByte> make an issue
14:15 <@EastByte> heinrich5991 probably wants to take part in that discussion
14:16 < Learath2> ill talk to him later
14:16 < Learath2> not too hard to change the msg id after im done coding
15:32 < o_be_one> hi all :)
15:33 < Learath2> o/
15:33 <@EastByte> o/
15:52 < dhkmt> anyone here who is very famililar with complex sql queries?
15:53 <@EastByte> deen or WolfAlex
15:58 < dhkmt> ok thank you

16:24 < Lady_> heinrich5991
16:50 <@EastByte> Lady_: did he do something wrong?
16:50 < Lady_> yes
16:51 < Lady_> in my opinion

16:53 < Lady_> yes
16:53 < Lady_> and this video is not public, why?
16:54 < Lady_> why I need link to it and can't find it in youtube?
16:54 < Lady_> if this is game trailer
17:06 < Learath2> Lady_: its not on youtube and you can get a link to it from the steam store page
17:06 < Learath2> not sure how its licensed either
17:06 < Lady_> what?
17:07 < Learath2> http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256655646/movie480.webm

17:09 < Lady_> Learath2
17:15 < Learath2> well ill ask him later if you arent around
17:20 < Lady_> ok thanks
17:31 < Donate4DDNet> I have a question for mapping!
17:34 < Donate4DDNet> How to make no jumps and again jump +2jump?
17:44 < Lady_> you have to... oh :c
19:28 < Nimda> Verification 3.4 by Silex just released on Solo at 2015-09-04 19:25
19:31 < o_be_one> hum
19:32 < o_be_one> why i dont see ddnet-commits bot ?
19:35 < o_be_one> !help
19:48 < Nimda> Black&White by TyxpekCZ just released on Brutal at 2015-09-04 19:41
19:56 < anyone> hi
19:58 < anyone> who knows how to map this: normally i have jump +2 and I WANT IN MY MAP to have NO JUMP
19:59 < anyone> HOW TO MAP THIS?
20:19 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: just got my MC32 :D
21:06 <@deen> o_be_one: it's sometimes buggy
21:07 <@deen> damn, over 70 posts in forum while I was gone today. I set up an RSS filter to only get the sections I'm interested in, no more map testing!
21:14 < o_be_one> :s
21:25 < o_be_one> well i'll use CoreOS i think on my MC32
21:26 < o_be_one> deen: can you tell me what bot is ddnet-commits ?
21:26 < o_be_one> hey Savander 'sup ?
21:27 <@deen> o_be_one: eh, the one by github
21:27 <@deen> o_be_one: i just clicked through their webinterface to enable it
21:29 < o_be_one> oh thats nice :)
21:30 < o_be_one> i'm curious on how he can talk in chat and not beeing irc
21:30 < o_be_one> beeing here
21:30 < o_be_one> maybe a irc service
21:31 < Savander> hi o_be_one 
21:40 <@deen> o_be_one: ah, i gave permission for this channel so that you can send messages without being in channel
21:40 <@deen> because it was annoying that it joined, sent message, and left
21:44 < o_be_one> oh ok
21:44 < o_be_one> the +n mode i think
21:57 < o_be_one> !interpreter
21:57 < Nimda> A language is not available. Available languages are af, ar, az, be, bg, bn, ca, cs, cy, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fa, fi, fr, ga, gl, gu, hi, hr, ht, hu, hy, id, is, it, iw, ja, ka, kn, ko, la, lt, lv, mk, ms, mt, nl, no, pl, pt, ro, ru, sk, sl, sq, sr, sv, sw, ta, te, th, tl, tr, uk, ur, vi, yi
21:57 < o_be_one> awesome
21:57 < o_be_one> so !interpret de en
21:57 < o_be_one> !interpreter fr de
21:57 < Nimda> Started translating between fr & de
21:57 < o_be_one> Salut ça va bien :D ?
21:57 < Nimda> <о_be_one> Hallo, es ist gut: D?
21:58 < o_be_one> Trop bien 86)
21:58 < Nimda> <о_be_one> Zu gut, 86)
21:58 <@EastByte> o_be_one: you should rather subscribe a git repository directly instead of waiting for irc notification :P
21:58 < o_be_one> !interpreter stop
21:58 < Nimda> <ΕastByte> o_be_one: vous devriez plutôt souscrire un dépôt git directement au lieu d'attendre la notification irc: P
21:58 < Nimda> <ΕastByte> o_be_one: Sie sollten vielmehr Schließen Sie eine git-Repository direkt anstatt zu warten, IRC-Benachrichtigung: P
21:58 < Nimda> <о_be_one> ! stop interpréteur
21:58 < Nimda> <о_be_one> ! Interpreterstopp
21:58 < Nimda> Interpreting stopped.
21:58 <@deen> EastByte: oh, you can subscribe on github?^^
21:58 <@deen> EastByte: i just regularly pull all the repos I have
21:58 < o_be_one> yes
21:58 <@EastByte> watch, rss feed
21:58 < o_be_one> star
21:58 <@EastByte> whatever
21:58 <@EastByte> ^
21:59 < o_be_one> i was just asking for this for friends who are core dev on Shinken and a new monitoring project :)
21:59 <@EastByte> deen: You don't get email notifications?
21:59 < o_be_one> but just seen they already have github commit bot
21:59 <@deen> EastByte: nope, guess i disabled that or they land in my spam filter
21:59 <@EastByte> ah
21:59 < o_be_one> i'm planning to have a bot to let me know by irc if something is down, just for the fun :p
21:59 <@EastByte> well I get flooded the whole day
21:59 <@deen> i unsubscribed from everything a few days ago
22:00 <@deen> feels nice not to get 500 emails from mailing lists every day
22:00 <@EastByte> ouh, mailing lists are evil
22:00 <@EastByte> I'm using seperate email addresses for that :p
22:00 <@deen> EastByte: procmail can sort them in quite easily
22:01 <@EastByte> currently using thunderbird
22:01 <@deen> yeah, probably reasonable. i just love my old fetchmail/procmail/unison/mutt setup
22:02 <@deen> perfect to read emails anywhere, even when I just have a few seconds of internet or 2 KB/s
22:02 <@EastByte> I don't really like thunderbird actually
22:02 <@EastByte> cannot serve anything of my servers
22:05 <@EastByte> o_be_one: I also need to work on some kind of notification system for myself
22:06 <@deen> EastByte: i have email notifications when some cron script on ddnet fails. I see when you miss something at map releases :P
22:06 <@EastByte> I noticed that ^.^
22:09 < o_be_one> nice EastByte :)
22:09 < o_be_one> i use webmail (inbox from Google or Outlook.com), for me it's the best way 
22:19 <@EastByte> o_be_one: so, are you setting up the mc32?
22:26 < Learath2> I have a nice irc bot that barely works maybe you could write a plugin for it o_be_one \o/
22:38 < o_be_one> EastByte: i would but ... auto install crashed, waiting for tech -_-
22:38 < o_be_one> Learath2: lol i'm so noob at dev, what is your bot ?
22:39 <@EastByte> o_be_one: :P
22:43 <@EastByte> deen: I recently asked the nforservers support about adding bpf bytecode support to their host firewall
22:43 <@EastByte> response from the CEO:
22:43 <@EastByte> "I will also keep your feature request in mind for the firewall page -- I think it's the first time I've had anyone even say they looked at the bpf feature there."
22:43 <@deen> haha
22:43 <@deen> i guess people who need stuff like that don't usually buy at a gaming vps hoster :P
22:44 <@EastByte> maybe...
22:45 <@EastByte> but this is probably the only vps hoster allowing access to the host system's firewall
22:45 <@EastByte> well looks quite experimental^^
22:45 < Learath2> o_be_one: https://github.com/Learath2/nimircbot
22:59 <@deen> EastByte: who knows, it's not like they advertise it
23:03 <@EastByte> without xrothx we wouldn't even use it right now^^
23:03 <@deen> EastByte: right, and i totally didn't trust him that it has strong ddos protection
23:03 <@EastByte> it's a pretty good hoster
23:03 <@deen> no idea how he found it
23:03 <@deen> i wish there was an easy way to find good hosters with some criteria worldwide
23:04 <@deen> instead of going on each website, reading through their marketing bullshit, asking them stuff by email, trying out a server, etc
23:05 <@EastByte> atleast you have your personal list now
23:05 <@deen> yes, i know about 50 hosters per country that suck
23:05 <@EastByte> :p
23:09 <@EastByte> teeworlds is a pretty special game
23:09 <@deen> what do you mean?
23:10 <@EastByte> there aren't many well-known games that heavily rely on network stability
23:10 <@deen> All ego-shooters?
23:10 <@deen> In Vanilla TW network stability isn't essential I think
23:10 <@deen> pretty much like in other ego shooters
23:11 <@deen> fps shooter*
23:11 <@EastByte> in ego-shooters the client mostly has more control than in teeworlds
23:11 <@deen> -shooter
23:11 <@EastByte> you can do stuff like speedhacking etc.
23:11 <@deen> eh, sounds like a bug
23:12 <@deen> but yes, you really feel any network problems in DDRace
23:12 <@deen> People say they can have YT run in background during every game except DDRace
23:13 <@deen> small lag spike, you miss your partner and all is over
23:13 <@EastByte> this is what I thought about being 'special'
23:13 <@EastByte> in most games it doesn't really matter
23:14 <@EastByte> atleast not as much as in teeworlds
23:14 <@deen> could it be improved?
23:14 <@EastByte> I don't think so
23:14 <@deen> I'm thinking about working on HookRace again, should think of stuff like that beforehand
23:14 <@EastByte> definitely
23:15 <@deen> client definitely needs to predict everything it can
23:15 <@deen> not half-assed as in DDNet client currently
23:17 <@deen> slowly rising on Steam Greenlight
23:17 <@EastByte> what's the state?
23:17 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/download/file.php?id=15500&mode=view
23:17 <@deen> compared to 1 week ago: http://forum.ddnet.tw/download/file.php?id=14934&mode=view
23:18 <@EastByte> 50:50
23:18 <@deen> yeah, when I posted on teeworlds.com and teeworlds-friends.de lots of no votes came in
23:19 <@EastByte> wasn't the best idea to post it where no one knows about ddnet
23:19 <@EastByte> (in tw community)
23:19 <@deen> well, i've posted there about ddnet for 2 years
23:20 <@EastByte> but the greenlight campaign is just about a modded client
23:20 <@deen> huh?
23:21 <@EastByte> that's how the normal teeworlds player reacts
23:42 <@deen> heh, MySQL has 3 byte ints
23:42 <@deen> don't think i've seen that before
23:42 <@EastByte> dafuq
23:42 <@deen> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/integer-types.html
23:42 <@deen> mediumint
23:43 <@deen> a bit too small for the FinishID
23:43 <@EastByte> "a bit" ^^
23:43 <@deen> 8 bits too small*
23:43 <@EastByte> k
23:44 <@EastByte> no 32bit ints?
23:44 <@deen> that's just regular INT in mysql
23:44 <@deen> and what i'll use
