07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I heard people report they're unable to join LAN servers. I'm too, but I've updated to latest master and work with server code, so:
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Did you break CRC here or it was me?
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its only broken in the RC as we already fixed it in master
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Ok
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> Hello everyone, there is a way to delete all the configurations that I have on DDNet?
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> yes delete the ddnet_settings.cfg in your teeworlds directory
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> uhm settings_ddnet.cfg i mean
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> located at %APPDATA%\Teeworlds
16:32 < ***> Buffer Playback...
16:32 <+bridge> [16:31:39] [ddnet] <FeaRZ> I delete the file, or the text that has inside?
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> [16:31:57] similar result
16:32 < ***> Playback Complete.
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> okey man, thanks
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> @FeaRZ either way it will be rewritten with defaults on successful client save
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> make sure u dont lose shit
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> better do a backup
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Anyone knows who added the dirt linkers and single tiles into grass_main_0.7, since they aren't on the original 0.7 tileset?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > 2 more tiles for grass_main_0.7 (by Soreu)
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commits/master/data/mapres/grass_main_0.7.png
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Thanks! Whats the purpose of this tile? I already have a finished grass_0.7 substitute, should I add this tile to it?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/775435642213105744/screenshot_2020-11-09_20-01-02.png
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Did you find out who added it?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, it was hi_leute_gll
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> He was ingame a few minutes ago, but not anymore. Not sure if anyone knows how to reach him. timakro: Any idea? Was added in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/233
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> looks like it matches the border colors (the darker shades here)

20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> @deen @gamertyp is his dc name
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gamertyp Hi! Can you remember the motivation for the above tile? ^
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My guess would be as background when you used the darker color somewhere, hidden behind another rounded corner
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why are you guys messing with the wrong version of grass_main_0.7?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> grass_main_0.7 is ddnet version of 0.7 grass_main, imo there is no need for them to be 100% the same. Moreover everyone is already used to the ddnet layout.
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean it has borderadd artifacts
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> You want to keep them?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> I'm working from the 0.7 version, seems like you missunderstood something.
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well your screenshot has borderadd bugs
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Yes, since I asked a question about the ddnet version.
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gamertyp> > @gamertyp Hi! Can you remember the motivation for the above tile? ^
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gamertyp> @deen Hi, sry idk. Soreu made the graphic-stuff. He added the tiles in the bottom left.
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it seems useless as there is no other tile with a full edge in that color, maybe @Soreu filled a tile with that color to make it easier to pick and forgot to remove it afterwards
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It was to give possibility of making grass_main's cave/ground as flat as any other tile, instead of ... you know, walking halfway in air
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> similar to generic_clear filled corners
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @mind
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Ok, but do people use it?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> idk, I'd guess not many thought of such possibility, similar to you guys wondering for what reason such tile is there ^^'
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Now I'm going back to being dead, cya üëª
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Seems like I can't upload my current 0.7 version atm üò¶
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh, the tile is there also for the consistency - there is one for dirt's main, cave's main, cave's border, so I added also the dirt's border
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @Soreu  if you don't like my version of the single tiles feel free to edit them.
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Well but then you also need to add a green one for the grass üòÑ
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I think I had version with that one somewhere
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> anyway... idk what u mean with the single tiles, and honestly, I don't even care anymore thanks to Saavik
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh, when we're at it... @deen remove me from skin DB crew please
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> cya
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu where are you going?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cya
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Soreu no :( , nobody leaves teeworlds
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> eh? what happened
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @mind dont u just wanna add the brown tile
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has the same color as the outline of the tiles
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe its just used as a background
