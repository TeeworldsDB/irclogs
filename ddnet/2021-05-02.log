11:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe one day we'll come up with a better way to do shared libs
11:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> static linking  + lto = best xd
12:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the performance of native wayland is really good, outperforms x11 a bit with ddnet alteast
16:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Nice, didn't expect that

18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> Dear DDNet team u rly need to re-think the point system on many maps.
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> Good example is the newest map by @Ravie 
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> It have 5 stars and 5 points and  lets face it. Its not a hard map.
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> it's a lot easier from older map "Planet Mars" by Aoe (4 stars and 4 points).
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> If you won't clean it up, you will end like I did with ddmax.easy, ddmax.next. Where level of difficulty is just messy. Not to mention ddmax.pro where some maps should never be there in the first place.
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> I've never had time to clean it up and ehhhh. Don't do my mistake =]
20:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i suggest to add half stars. it doesnt mess it up too bad but you get double the rating range
21:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And, how well does it work for you? In the PR we already discussed some bugs, what GPU are you on?
21:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> it works pretty well. I didn't notice this flickering
21:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Just the color-banding thingy on the title screen
21:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> it works pretty well. I didn't notice any flickering
21:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> AMD Vega 56 btw, using AMDGPU
21:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Radeon Vega 56 btw, using AMDGPU
21:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ah too bad. So we all on amd Vega or newer. Thanks for testing tho
21:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> @Jupstar ✪#5615 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/354cabd4a7ae73121a527980d7cef9dae41e9d3a 
21:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> is this the issue we had on wayland? it's fixed on master if it is
21:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ah nice
23:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think adding half stars fixes the difficulty rating system, what does fix it is allowing players to vote on difficulty
23:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but half stars defs give more space for more precise difficulty
23:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> one question would be, are longer maps always harder, or should there be a category that gives just more points for longer maps
23:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not that they'd use it. this is a conversation about 5* maps being voted 3* and vice versa, not tiny 1 star discrepancies
23:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be nice to see the estimate map length when voting too
23:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't like the length argument too much, length does not affect difficulty unless it's faily, something that should not apply to novice
23:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah i dont meant novice only
23:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> then sure
23:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kog (in the past) did this i think, more points for longer maps, but difficulty only set the map difficulty
23:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kog (in the past atleast) did this i think, more points for longer maps, but difficulty only set the map difficulty
23:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I think length can really only change a map by about a star unless it's a brutal, then it probably shifts around by 2-3
23:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> insane difficulty changes based on length by, well, pretty much the entire range
23:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well that would be the argument for the category btw
23:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u could split difficulty from length
23:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and just give more points for longer maps
23:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think it matters to make a distinction. there is already a ton of criteria you need to consider when rating a map. length is just one tiny part of those considerations, it is not notable above the others
23:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> we need guidelines for these criteria and a voting system, period
23:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for shorter maps u generally need less tries to finish if faily
23:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so many decisions are made without the popular opinion of the community already, ddnet is a modern game now and needs to respect its community a bit more imo
23:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if only 10% of the map is faily
23:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and we have room to. the game is not proprietary, the game's contributions are already made by the community. this can extend to our processes and future decisions related to the game
