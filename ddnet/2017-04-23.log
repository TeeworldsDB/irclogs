08:18 < Learath2> some nice constructs in C that use goto, don't know of any in C++
12:17 < Learath2> coding at airport cafes are a nice way to pass time

14:09 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 8dcad29 def: Also update timestamp in team rank (fixes discord bot to show team ranks when they exist)
14:43 <@deen> meh, ddnet-discord bot dead
17:48 <@deen> apparently no one fixed the /invite stuff yet and we still can't have kicking
17:49 <@deen> I'll remove the invite system entirely and re-enable kicking

17:51 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 99cc9d2 def: Remove invite system entirely since no one wants to fix it
17:52 <@deen> (I hope that was why we disabled kicking, can't remember and no one could tell me last I asked)
17:52 <@heinrich5991> it was /load stuff
17:52 <@heinrich5991> I thought
17:52 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
17:52 <@deen> ah, do we have a fix for that?
17:52 <@heinrich5991> yes, two iirc
17:53 <@heinrich5991> not merged though
17:53 <@deen> well, unmerged doesn't count
17:53 <@heinrich5991> yea, then we don't have a fix
17:53 < Ryozuki> we disabled kicking because trolls made a player join and insta kicked him
17:53 < Ryozuki> i think u shouldnt enable it
17:53 <@deen> then I'll turn off /save and /load
17:53 < Ryozuki> join a team
17:54 < Ryozuki> :c
17:54 <@deen> i think that stuff was reported quite some time ago and still unfixed
17:54 < Ryozuki> whats the fix that invite needs?
17:54 <@deen> and i can't go around kicking blockers on servers manually
17:57 <@deen> or is kicking considered less important than saving?
17:57 <@deen> not sure
17:58 < Ryozuki> saving is important
17:58 < Ryozuki> actually people vote trolls to spec
18:00 <@deen> that works?
18:00 <@deen> i tried and even when vote succeeded it did nothing
18:02 <@heinrich5991> they can jsut rejoin though
18:03 <@heinrich5991> I think kicking blockers > saves
20:29 <@deen> heinrich5991: build error due to linking with cmake, works with bam: https://pastebin.com/D15LqBd6
20:52 <@heinrich5991> mh
21:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: os?
21:05 <@deen> debian/ubuntu i guess
21:05 <@deen> since he said he could fix it with apt-get
21:05 <@heinrich5991> what fixed it?
21:13 < davide> Ubuntu 14.04
21:13 < davide> Fix it with apt-get upgrade
21:23 <@heinrich5991> mh
21:23 <@heinrich5991> davide: hey
21:23 < davide> Talk in private
21:24 <@heinrich5991> no, please not
21:25 < davide> Read private chat

21:34 < davide> [17-04-23 20:13:22][sql]: FATAL ERROR: Could not init SqlScore
21:34 < davide> Don't work but.. Is all correct
22:40 < Learath2> mfw we provide 2 fixes for it and you decide to remove invite instead of pulling any of the fixes
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I would suggest adding it back in
22:41 < Learath2> and it wasn't even the thing that was causing the problems
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> Revert to previous commit then!

22:45 < Learath2> I'm bound to mess something up, have been on the road for the last 13 hours
22:45 < Learath2> Rolling on floor the laughing?
22:51 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #748: Add the invite system back (master...dd_pr_invite2) https://git.io/v9klH
22:52 < Learath2> heinrich5991: were you here when ddnet-discord left? did it EOF or leave gracefully?
22:53 <@heinrich5991> davide: what did you configure?
22:53 <@heinrich5991> have you tried logging in manually, without the ddnet server?
22:53 < Learath2> deen: I also fixed the pause vote thing
22:53 < Learath2> but should get a review on that before merging
22:54 <@heinrich5991> [09:54:24] *** Quits: ddnet-discord (~ddnet-dis@dcord.users.quakenet.org) (EOF from client)
22:54 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: ^
22:54 < Learath2> meh shouldn't have used "&>/dev/null" :D
22:58 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> sudo rm -rf /
22:59 < davide> Yes heinrich5991, Mysql work without problems
22:59 <@heinrich5991> have you connected to it using the mysql command or so?
23:00 <@heinrich5991> mysql --user ddnet (or similar)
23:01 < davide> I use root user
23:02 < davide> But yes, mysql -p and work without problems, same in navicat or phpmyadmin
23:02 < davide> Only in ddnet don't work 
23:25 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: ideas on how to debug this? ^
23:31 < Learath2> well i never could get any of the sql stuff to work :P
23:31 < Learath2> let me think
23:33 < Learath2> davide: is it just that error? "Could not init"?
23:37 < HMH> have you used the bundled libs, sometimes this leads to the server being unable to connect properly to the database
23:40 < davide> Yes Learath2 just that error 
23:43 < davide> HMH i have used this config
