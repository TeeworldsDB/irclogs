04:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn woah epic oldschool knowledge
04:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti sos how to graphics programming? i am working on minetee stuff and some of the tiles i placed have display bugs. They disappear when the player position or zoom level changes. What are the things that need refresh if i edit the map without going through a full OnMapLoad?
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> got it <:poggers2:1008007455936094328> fakin `m_Skip` skipping tiles so `Collision()->Layers()->Init(Kernel());` did the trick
06:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm still bugs away sometimes

12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> It takes a long time 20 minutes or more. Let's take a rest and get some ‚òï.
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> Whatafak
14:05 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> i really need a function where if your intenet goes off you can continue the game
14:05 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> like you join automaticly sometimes back
14:05 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> but if you doesnt, a button that joins you back
14:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so link information with a LAN server?
14:05 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> i mean after it came back
14:06 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> but thats intresting also
14:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, if it's a solo gamemode, then it's worth doing it
14:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> however in DDRace, we have a timeout function, which contradicts this idea
14:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think sub servers which connect to the main server, gathering data and hotswap the main server's data with the sub servers could work out better
14:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think sub servers which connect to the main server, gathering data and hotswap the main server's data with the sub servers could work out better (in case of ddos, not internet cut off)
14:08 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> i see
14:08 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> is this how companies deal with ddos normally?
14:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the timeout is around 5 minutes, during that time if the server detects that it didn't "request" disconnect but just the internet has been cut off, then the Tee stays, till the player joins back
14:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, remember WoW's server channels? if one goes down, other ones can take it's place without losing much data
14:10 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> oh nice
14:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's a similar concept, but instead of losing data, we copy exactly all the data the master server stored. Then the closest sub server (channel) will take it's place as a new master server
14:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If the previous server has been ddosed and players have been isolated from it, we can do some funny things like throwing fake data to the ddoser, make it think, that he still ddoses the master server, while the other players play on a different one
14:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Making it difficult for the ddoser to recognize that he still ddoses an empty server xd
14:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I kinda wish we have p2p, but that would cause a lot more trouble without a proper player data encryption

16:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> German masterrace :poggers2:
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> Japanese would look very pleasing aswell I think
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> Actually no, it should have the same pattern as english
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> should have a better pattern for the 10-19
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> True. So one more of those blots
16:56 < bridge> <0xdeen> Got it, will use alphabetic ordering of German numbers as my RNG

20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> speaking of 
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> >     `ExpectLines(m_pPlayerResult, {"nameless tee - 01:40.00 - better than 100% - requested by brainless tee", "Global rank 1 - GER unranked"}, true);`
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> should it say top x% instead? instead of better than 99%, say top 1%
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> with that u could add sub-percentage accuracy for those who care, and it'd look less clumsy
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> "better than 0.5%"
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> "top 0.5%"
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> fwiw I don't mean the test
21:18 < bridge> <0xdeen> no, i prefer the current wording

21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> what about xth percentile
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> 99th percentile
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> not that it really needs chaiging
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> not that it really needs changing
22:47 < bridge> <Ewan> transmission daemon autoconf doesn't change the binary location in the systemd unit :pepeW:
22:47 < bridge> <Ewan> how do u miss that
22:47 < bridge> <Ewan> makes make install unusable
