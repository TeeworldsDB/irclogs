11:54 < debian> hi
11:55 < debian> all my friends tell me I should use the ddnet client cause it has antiping and I can make a dummy to practice on
11:55 < debian> but ddnet isn't in any debian repos or ppa :(
11:55 < debian> I can apt-get install teeworlds
11:55 < debian> it's very convenient
11:55 < debian> I wish I could apt-get install ddnet 
11:56 < debian> that would be pretty cool if you could do that, thanks!!
19:30 < eeeee> debian stable probably still has the time-proven 0.5.2 or sth
19:52 <@deen> and I proposed adding DDNet to Debian, nothing else I can do
19:55 <+necropotame> You can still create your own ppa
22:06 <+necropotame> Is the bug fixed by TW 0.6.4 is also fixed in DDNet ?
22:11 <@EastByte> there were 7 bug fixes for tw 0.6.4
22:11 <@EastByte> I'm not sure about the snap handling thingie but otherwise, yes
22:12 <+necropotame> Is this one serious ?
22:12 <+necropotame> I've not that much checked all this stuff ^^
22:14 <@EastByte> yea, it allows memory write by an attacker
22:14 <+necropotame> Ok
22:14 <+necropotame> That's the evil one so
22:14 <+necropotame> And did you found a workaround for fast download ?
22:15 <@EastByte> I think heinrich5991 implemented something
22:16 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/591
22:16 <+necropotame> So simple ^^
22:17 <+necropotame> Thanks !
