00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> its possible without finding the intersection, yes. see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection#Given_two_points_on_each_line_segment in the section where they calculate "t" and "u". the line segments intersect if both of those are between 0 and 1 (unless they are parallel, but in that case the divisor in both fractions will be 0, so only need to check for that and handle it separately)
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And he is saying it like that because most people on the internet have no capability of giving feedback without cursing
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I took this now, for 2 dimensional vectors
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024812810137518090/unknown.png
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The only "problem" with this is, that it doesnt find an intersection when the point is exactly on the other line, but that doesnt matter for my case
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that one has a bit of an issue with collinear lines
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'm amazed by how fast you saw that, lol
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, I'd seen this solution way back when I was also looking for a way to intersect line segments 😄
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ohh 😄
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cheater
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why can I not send this `→` character to a client, it appears as a question mark, while DDNet uses that for whispering for old clients
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6104246ea601b9f6c4a7e395a56870cb5639187e/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L4063
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Weird, we should support same characters in chat
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It works in DDNet
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> At least from what I remember many years ago
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I am trying this in my mod right now
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> File encoding should be correct too
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024815248605204521/unknown.png
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is it maybe 0.7 that packs it differently, I dont know
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (my server is 0.7 based, but DDNet clients can join)
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah well, I can manually send that character in chat
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> DDNet server works locally, what else can it be?
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> To me it looks like the character gets swapped by a question mark before it gets sent to a client, means probably while compiling?
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, then probably 0.7 filters out some unicode
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, as I said it works when I manually send it.
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol, it worked when I saved the file as "Unicode (UTF8 WITHOUT Signature) - ...
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> While here, I did it with signature.
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Since I have updated my mod to C++ (no C anymore in system) I get these errors, does anyone have a solution?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024820973125501018/unknown.png
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it have `#include <system.h>`?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> client.m needs to be client.mm
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's objective-C++ and not objective-C
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So I just change that?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think so
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Seems to be better :D What is this?
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024822297225343076/unknown.png
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> need TWMain in src/engine/client/client.cpp, probably?
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It is there tho
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024822986634707094/unknown.png
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> @fokkonaut which server providers are the best to use?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Teeworlds/DDNet servers usually dont take a lot of ressources, you could basically use any
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sile> Xd
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And a team deathmatch of eight players at the same time with a large map
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably remove the `extern "C"` there
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ahh i hate pdf
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its all so hacky
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to add a signature you need to add an object
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that object has the pkcs7 data
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and a bytes range with offsets
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the bytes range are the data to digest
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it has to include the bytes range itself
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1025042470414856323/unknown.png
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate adobe
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> already implementing rustTeX 😄 ?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i hate pdflatex stupid limitations
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its related to my job
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Pdf itself is the stupidest format
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thank adobe
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i stumbled upon a really stupid limits yesterday, which is that pdflatex can't use more than 16 file handles
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nice software from the 90's
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Have u looked at xelatex
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or luatex
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk there are more out there i think
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, im kinda out of time to switch to these 😄
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think xelatex has some problem with tikz?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i tried it to test some fonts
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i need some quote idea for my epigraphs 😄
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk xd
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> chapter 1 is introduction, chapter 2 is state of the art, chapter 3 is hardware circuit design, chapter 4 is software platform design, chapter 5 is results and analysis
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i have some funny quotes form my favorite french serie, but i'd like to have both a serious and a funny quote at each chapter
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so i lack the serious one
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ConTexT exists too
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ConTeXt exists too
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> never heard of it
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i'd like a drop in replacement where it just works™
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i feel like a lot of packages should be part of the default mode
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> my latex template includes 414 files with 373838 lines  1017743 words 17389484 bytes and takes 8 seconds
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> g++ with a simple file includes 240 files with 111022 lines 402300 words 3607885 bytes and takes less than 1 sec...
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so definetely latex is slower, but not by that much
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki use XPS, better format
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pdf is a result of 56 decades of bolting things onto the corpse of postscript
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://xkcd.com/927/
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we did get it right with usb this time around atleast. Usb-c seems to be what everything has settled on 😄
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the only reason character encodings isn't a settled issue is microsoft stubbornly holding onto utf16. I think almost everyone else and their mothers use utf8
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't even know how character encodings work 😦
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but soon there will be competing standards for electric car chargers
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> chargers and charging station
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not soon, it's already here no? Tesla had one thing and the others were using 2 separate standards
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, EU commission will probably take a decision by 2035 or even 2040
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the EU mandates every EV manufacturer to provide a CCS Adaptor nowadays tho, not quite sure, I atleast saw legislation proposed and Tesla starting to provide them
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe it didn't pass but Tesla started including them so they didnt try again?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm apparently there are still atleast 5 kinds of connectors in the wild 😄
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ppl use pdfs
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Make ppl use xps instead
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wtf i thought it was spelled seperate
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> not sep**a*rate
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Today you learned 😛
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> not sep**a**rate
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Comes from the latin separare
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I guess the original latin was separatus, living in italy I got used to the wrong base forms of verbs
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways now that i actually can, i'm going to analyze the run animation and finally try to tweak it
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you make a tool for it or are you trying the thing I suggested with a map with speeders and no friction?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> honestly i just recorded a demo of me running
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i wanted to edit alexander's teeassembler to impliment animation capabilities but that would take too long
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 cant fight adobe lobbyism
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also today i found out you can get some ISO docs that otherwise wouls cost 200€j+ from archive.org
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fck the system
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you see my tip about adding config options everywhere so you dont have to recompile to test new values?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh i dont think i did-
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to believe in yourself. Make it happen
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I would rather spend my time promoting rust over c/c++ :BASED:
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> :pepeH:
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> XPS has microsoft behind it. I wonder how they never managed to get it popular
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz corps use pdfs
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Microsoft themselves too
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Being an established thing holds lot of power
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hard to change the norm
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also million contracts etc are in pdf
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ppl would need yo convert lot of stuff
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Microsoft is the big dog. They should add a transparent layer to the ntkernel that immediately converts every downloaded pdf instantly to xps
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also pdf format itself is incredibly wasteful
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any NTOpen call to a pdf file results in it being replaced by an xps file
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If u gonna allow binary stuff inside make the while format binary, not half and half
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whole*
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The xps approach is that the bundle is a fancy zip file and the binary stuff gets referred to with a relative path
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah a zip like file makes sense
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc it is, as I said it's almost 3 decades of bolting on stuff to postscript
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm honestly surprised they even managed to write a coherent standard for it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also its funny at work mac ppl send u zipped folders and they have those stupid hidden files
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yes the stupid DS_Store
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Apple should stick to hardware kek
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough their kernels are actually quite an interesting take, I like the XNU architecture
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is it a microkernel or smth?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are the weirdest company ever a perfect marriage of good and shit engineering
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's hybrid, but the more interesting part is the facilities it has. Stuff like mach messages are pretty nice
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mach ports are also cute. The builtin IPC facilities are quite nice to work with
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i see
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I hear lot of ppl hate ipc of any kind
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They prefer ffi
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Outside of the kernel launchd is probably the only take on a process monitoring init I like. They got just the right amount of monolith in there to monitor processes efficiently
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well ffi isn't exactly a proper replacement to IPC, is it? You want to talk to a service running in a another process, how will ffi help?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't really call/write into another processes memory
19:23 <+Konsti> @ryozuki fake noby
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye idk
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i heard
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iixwa> Guys what to do if the servers do not work
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> who the hell pays for that except company?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> companies
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iixwa> Guys what to do if the servers do not work
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> How would you go about convincing me? I want to give rust another shot, before coding in C
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> (For godot)
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Extensive standard library, don't have to worry about memory management
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cons: wonky syntax, annoying compiler
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> loving compiler*
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ syntax aint better
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> complex type systems make stuff complex
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but provide type safety xd
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and concurrency resources basically direct you to async/await due to all libraries relying on that, but IMHO the async/await stuff can use a bit more love
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not everything
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rayon is amazing
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/rayon/1.5.3/rayon/
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess some third party crates do ease the pain, async_trait is basically mandatory if you want to write generic code
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh yeah you need async_trait
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> futures_util is nice too iirc
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes futures in general is also imo mandatory
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Streams are very very useful
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/futures-util/0.3.24/futures_util/
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, most definitely worth giving another try. Is good language
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C syntax is ❤️
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ is sadge
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz c doesnt have  generics
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and rust adds another layer, lifetimes
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have the c preprocessor and c20 generics 💪
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 have you ever tried D
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is actually quite a cute language. I did write a couple toys in it
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another language I enjoyed alot was zig. Tho it's just bound to die since no mozilla or google daddy to bankroll it
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 isnt it a pain to pass the allocator everywhere
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hear u gotta do that
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never rly looked into it tho
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A little, there was a plan to make it better but implementing anything takes time with max 2-3 people working on a language
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can also have an allocator in a global variable which mimics what other languages do in a way. But it was discouraged for some reason I don't remember
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone wanna gift this to this poor ddnet dev  https://www.amazon.es/AMD-7950X-Procesador-desenfrenados-Arquitectura/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks bye
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why is it so expensive
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> cl_show_console deprecated?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm actually planning on getting this thing
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what do u mean?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its gone, then yes
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else no xd
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why didnt they put the 3d cache into it, they are too rich now, they get the new intel XDD
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1025123567576285254/unknown.png
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> how enable console now?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont even know why its gone
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 16.4
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs bcs all is printed into f1
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5155
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can still start ddnet from a cmd apparently
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it will attach to it
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iixwa> Guys what to do if the servers do not work
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> drink a tea, enjoy the world, then enjoy teeworlds again
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do they generally not work?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just today
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> thx
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FJP> get into mapping so when the game crashes you can use graph paper and colored pencils to map irl :happy:
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut not sure if there is much to be done about it but GER3 is crumbling
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we maybe make it so we don't count tees that have timed out when counting for max tees per ip?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like an easy way to fill up the server
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could front-load the timeout stuff to not make it take up a slot
