00:50 < Maple> by cheating i mean that they used no teams and put players at specific spots to save time
00:50 < Maple> isnt really cheating but isnt a legit race
00:50 <@deen> Maple: ah, but that's why ddnet has separate team ranks
00:51 <@deen> every single map can be cheated like that without team
00:51 < Maple> still doesnt feel worthy of HoF
00:51 <@deen> is it in the HoF?
00:51 < Maple> nah
00:51 <@deen> and it won't be
00:51 < Maple> why not
00:51 <@deen> for team maps you need to be #1 in team ranks
00:51 < Maple> we are
00:51 < Maple> in general rank we arent
00:51 <@deen> i mean their race won't be in HoF
00:52 <@deen> don't know about yours :P
00:52 < Maple> oh
00:52 <@deen> I remember there was a group of people who did the same thing and actually submitted that to the Hall of Fame
00:54 < Maple> doesnt do a very impressive video
00:56 <@deen> it was funny to watch
01:04 < Maple> oh
01:04 < Maple> maybe
01:04 < Maple> just maybe
01:04 < Maple> another video run section
01:04 < Maple> not for the best
01:04 < Maple> but maybe with funny things
01:04 < Maple> or interesting things
01:04 < Maple> or fails
01:04 < Maple> i have a run where we hammerfly and touch freeze, supposed to die
01:05 < Maple> but we land one on eachother and succeed

15:09 < laxa_work> pause: mofo !
15:11 <@deen> KinG_: huh?
15:11 < KinG_> deen:  just change the rcon password of server to ddnet's and remove the server password :)
15:14 < KinG_> thanks deen 
15:15 <@deen> maybe we should just stop DDNet Persian
15:15 < KinG_> why?
15:15 <@deen> It's more work than all the other servers and always 0 players
15:15 <@deen> because it lags
15:16 < KinG_> from next month i'll cahnge vps(no laggs) and persian pro will go down trust me he is running out of money
15:16 < KinG_> deen:  u gave me moderator access i need full acess in xxl server
15:16 < KinG_> change*
15:46 < KinG_> thanks deen  i gtg bye all
17:01 < CookieMichal> Hai ho :D
17:02 < CookieMichal> I'm doing data backup and I will install Windows 10 :D
17:07 <@deen> hi CookieMichal 
17:10 < CookieMichal> Hey deen :3
17:11 < shahan> ohi all
17:11 < CookieMichal> Hello :D
17:11 < shahan> i have a question about ddnet tournaments
17:12 < shahan> this sunday i watched one of them, and I noticed broadcast messages about the players
17:12 < shahan> something like online commentation 
17:13 < shahan> who does it? 
17:13 < CookieMichal> deen
17:13 < CookieMichal> he's admin
17:13 < CookieMichal> and he watches players and comment
17:14 < shahan> and he does it on all ddnet servers at one moment?
17:15 < CookieMichal> I think he uses script to that
17:15 < CookieMichal> He just type message and it appears on each server
17:16 < CookieMichal> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/ check this
17:21 <@deen> hi
17:22 <@deen> yes, every server has an input fifo
17:22 <@deen> and this script just writes into them all at once: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/bc.py
17:24 < shahan> thanks for answer
17:25 < shahan> deen: do you use and tools for watching servers too?
17:26 < shahan> for example, if the second player takes the race, the broadcast message appears
17:26 <@deen> i just have 10 clients open
17:26 < shahan> that's the answer I was afraid of :(
17:26 <@deen> the important part is to set gfx_backgroundrender to 0, then I have no problems with many clients
17:27 < shahan> ah, ok
17:27 <@deen> I tried to make a tournament spectating client that connects you to all servers, but a few bugs remained and it seemed like a lot of work to get right: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/tree/tournament-spec
17:28 < shahan> quite a nice idea
17:29 < shahan> btw, there is only german live stream?
17:30 <@deen> Yes. I think we could get many more viewers with an English one but noone has done one yet
17:30 < shahan> yes, that's strange
17:31 < shahan> I can do only russian, because my english speaking skills are horrible^^
17:32 < shahan> And the last thing I wanted to talk about: dummy hammerfly
17:33 < shahan> some people told me, that it's quite hard to teach dummy hammerfly
17:34 < shahan> I decided to teach dummy to hit player after the 'touch'
17:34 <@deen> we have dummy hammerfly
17:35 < shahan> and some people told me, that you've also though about it
17:35 <@deen> in the ddnet client
17:35 < shahan> but implemented a timer
17:35 <@deen> it just hammers in a fixed interval, works well enough
17:35 <@deen> with touch you would need to factor in the ping
17:36 < shahan> ah, this problem is only client side
17:36 < shahan> i did it with serverside bot
17:36 <@deen> Yeah, we have clientside dummies
17:36 <@deen> Aah, you're the developer of iDDRace
17:37 < shahan> yeah, right
17:37 < shahan> and since ddnet is out, many people ask me to implement some ddnet features, some game tiles
17:38 < shahan> i'm thinking about merging idd to ddnet
17:39 <@deen>  /r and serverside dummy?
17:40 < shahan> yes
17:41 < shahan> are you also againist /r?
17:41 <@deen> So you want to add these features to ddnet or put remerge ddnet into iddrace?
17:42 <@deen> i don't know if serverside dummies are necessary, I've never played with them
17:42 <@deen> Personally I'm against /r and I believe it should stay disabled on all official DDNet servers
17:42 <@deen> but we could still add it to the mod and just disable it for official servers
17:43 <@deen> Some had the idea to enable /r for novice maps, but we'd need to have a discussion with the community about that first
17:43 < shahan>  /r is an awesome oppurtunity to play hard ddrace maps quickly
17:44 < shahan> and dummies are really great for studing hammer tricks
17:45 <@deen> i never played with /r. i always loved about ddrace that it's hard and you need to work together and think to survive
17:45 < shahan> if you will add dummies to ddnet, it will cause many bugs, probably crash bugs
17:46 <@deen> i think the client side dummy is good enough
17:46 < shahan> on ddrace64 it caused some funny bugs such as controlling another player as a dummy
17:46 <@deen> haha, we had bugs like that too with some new features
17:46 < shahan> did you base ddnet on eeeee's ddrace64 ?
17:47 <@deen> it's based on the original ddrace
17:47 <@deen> but at some point i decided to get the 0.6.2 changes in, so i just diffed and applied by hand
17:47 <@deen> for 64 player support i did the same, by hand
17:53 < heinrich5991> hello shahan!
17:53 < heinrich5991> you think /r should be added?
17:54 < shahan> hello, heinrich5991 
17:54 < heinrich5991> long time no see btw
17:54 < shahan> yea, that's because I had windows 8.1 :C
17:54 < shahan> lagging shit, actually
17:55 < shahan> I had teeworlds hanging on a random time
17:55 <@deen> I know the Persian Pro guys merged /r into ddnet
17:55 < shahan> so i didn't played ddrace for 6 months
17:55 < shahan> i'm not againist /r at all, and not for it
17:55 < heinrich5991> ah
17:56 <@deen> Now noone wants to play ddnet maps without /r anymore in Iran
17:56 <@deen> no one*
17:56 < shahan>  /r has many advantages such as solution againist lagg-caused-failes
17:57 < shahan> and for training ofc
17:57 < shahan> the only iddrace tournament was without /r btw :)
17:58 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
17:58 <@deen> and there goes the daily DDoS
17:58 < heinrich5991> I kinda don't like how /r completely removes helping each other
17:58 < shahan> who and why does it?
17:59 <@deen> shahan: no idea, happens all the time
17:59 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
17:59 < Nimda> DDNet USA went down!

17:59 < heinrich5991> aha
17:59 < shahan> lmao
17:59 < heinrich5991> every day at 18:00?
17:59 < heinrich5991> my /r implementation would require the whole team to be frozen
17:59 <@deen> (the others didn't actually go down, just FRA)
17:59 < heinrich5991> Nimda is on france?
17:59 <@deen> heinrich5991: no, different times
18:00 <@deen> heinrich5991: nope, but the site it uses for information is: http://ddnet.tw/status/

18:00 < heinrich5991> oh nice
18:00 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, i have the same problem with /r
18:00 < heinrich5991> botox's server tool
18:00 <@deen> indeed
18:01 <@deen> i should probably send him a few fixes
18:01 <@deen> because it didn't work with flaky connections
18:02 < shahan> it's a good idea
18:02 < shahan> i'm about /r for the whole team
18:02 <@deen> what does "whole team" mean when most play in team 0?
18:03 < heinrich5991> nothing
18:03 < heinrich5991> :)
18:03 < heinrich5991> maybe
18:03 < heinrich5991> all players that have interacted with you in the last minute
18:03 < shahan> team 0 won't have /r then :P
18:03 <@deen> Also, I think everyone who has a lot of ranks on http://ddnet.tw/ranks/ will be mad that they didn't have /r back then
18:03 < heinrich5991> . /r would make ranks go away
18:03 < heinrich5991> if you /r once e.g.
18:03 < shahan> lol
18:04 < shahan> right
18:04 < shahan> hey deen, have you seen iddrace trailer? https://www.google.ru/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBWH4YPXzFBk&ei=aXYtVK2iJuXnyQPJ84L4BQ&usg=AFQjCNG_hFD9KLXY7VoYfbZKt5lqgDYDjg&sig2=YOJ-wUs3MmsgGwGKOgUSeA&bvm=bv.76477589,d.bGQ

18:05 <@deen> it's so dramatic!
18:06 < shahan> yeah, i like it too^^
18:06 <@deen> but you can cheat normal maps with that feature
18:07 < heinrich5991> wow, that trailer is like really good IMO
18:07 < heinrich5991> who did that?
18:07 < shahan> Warch did
18:08 <@deen> We need more artists for ddnet!
18:08 < shahan> he organized many ddrace tournaments btw
18:08 < shahan> probably, you know his maps War4yH?
18:09 <@deen> I don't
18:13 < shahan> ehm
18:13 < shahan> i think everyone remember the time, when on all ddrace servers default broadcast message was "ddm.ucoz.net"
18:14 < shahan> it was community "dummy drag masters"
18:14 < shahan> the leader: 3DA
18:14 < shahan> the guy, who made ddrace
18:15 < shahan> in his community were Warch, FireFry, ZoOm and others :)

20:29 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
20:29 < laxa> Hum, yesterday I was reading about hetzner
20:29 <@deen> we still have ddos protection for GER promised but no date
20:29 < laxa> they say they only count outgoing traffic as traffic
20:30 < laxa> is it the same for data fabrik ?
20:30 <@deen> but hetzner has no ddos protection
20:30 <@deen> no, both directions count
20:30 < laxa> boah
20:30 <@deen> but traffic doesn't matter, we have more than enough
20:30 < laxa> so ddos really fucks you
20:30 < laxa> oh ok
20:30 <@deen> at least on GER
20:30 <@deen> and even when we went over the "limit" the hoster said it doesn't matter^^
20:30 < laxa> You have 1TB ?
20:30 <@deen> 3 TB
20:30 < laxa> Nice :)
20:31 <@deen> we usually use about 2 TB per month on GER
