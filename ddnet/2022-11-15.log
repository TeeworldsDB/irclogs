03:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> DDNet already provides some useful JSONs. if deen makes all data fetchable as JSON, we can use anything

09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The replies
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Too much
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i love spotting elon bootlickers
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so funny
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also the amateur investers in the replies talking about tesla stock.
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the people that advocate for testing on production ðŸ˜„
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This isn't ddnet, it's one of the biggest sites on the web

10:27 <+ChillerDragon> sos i need help naming stuff. In case someone missed it i build a network lib. I currently plan to create a class for every chunk that is being sent. Now I struggle to pick a name for that thing because it is lib user facing.
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> I mean stuff like ClSay. Imo the nicest term would be "packet" but that seems wrong since a packet can contain multiple chunks like ClSay and SvMotd etc. but calling it "chunk" would be weird in user facing code imo.
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> any ideas on how to name that thing? message?
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª life advisor im counting on you
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Name it bloat
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Fragment
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> bloat xd
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> hm fragment
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> if as a user of a twlib you get a thing called fragment do you expect the content to be a full ClSay chunk?
10:41 <+ChillerDragon> lmao BLOAT was close! lets go with BOAT xxxxxxxxxxxxD https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668505287.png
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> i think tw code basically calls those messages due to method names like ``OnMessage()``
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 the lyrical genius any input?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I'd it's a msg
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It event
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Or*
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But packet would be fine too imo
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Multiple packets live in one packet container or packet chain
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tokyo> @Moderator
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tokyo> Ãœ
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª if you name the chunks in the packet also packet. Stuff like packet header becomes confusing. Since every chunk also has a header.
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> currently it's stalling, i have way too much to do IRL rn
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> U mean the packet data or what
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Packet content
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Payload xd
11:22 <+Ryozuki> xd
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> I'm happy to announce that my teehistorian replayer is now public. I finally found the motivation to publish it with the DDNet season 2 announcement :D. https://gitlab.com/zwelf/twgame
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> pog
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> yea basically the packet content jopstar but the content is multiple seperate chunks so imo packet.payload is all chunks but how do i call the individual chunks? also they have a payload as well so it would be payload.payload then
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Wow ðŸ˜„
12:20 <+Ryozuki> i want a zip of all the map preview images
12:20 <+Ryozuki> i dont wanna rely on ddnet hosting them
12:20 <+Ryozuki> zzz
12:20 <+Ryozuki> and they are not public rn
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> AGPL :/ so not usuable for ddnet client
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Isnt agpl kinda anti rust too xd
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: go scrape them hehe
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, aren't they on the site?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think even the tool that generates them is public
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> Has anyone seen this before?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> If not, here's a little info: a few dudes wanted to make a game based on Teeworlds in 2013, with accounts, skinning system, etc., just like ddnet season 2
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1042050992851656714/unknown.png

13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh wow, I haven't seen that before
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> Of course, it didn't get any further than sketches...
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they seem to have posted the same text on a couple of sites
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but everything seems wiped, their website and youtube videos too
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> + twitter account
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh wow they were serious o.o https://www.copyrightfrance.com/certificat-depot-copyright-france-8GKY3D2-lges-impry.htm
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how deens idea of accounts + achievements got turned into so many demands
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, I also fear that this might hinder the development of the actual accounts, that would be sad
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but it also feels like deen gave some people motivation to start on some stuff themselves
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what do u think about jwt
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> jwt + access token + refresh token
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1042058393004810270/unknown.png
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think in this case it fits really well
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually find it overkill, but it fits the central auth scheme we have here
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye jwt rly fits
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> @Matodor those sketches look so cool!
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> by mipEr
14:27 <+Ryozuki> Learath2: no deen told me they not public
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool!
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im making my own ddnet web, which if is not used by ddnet itself ill just run it side by side
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dint rly wanna scrape map previews
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They should be available
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, in what format? Like just in a repo or sth?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Like maps
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.org/ranks/maps/Stronghold.png
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are they in predictable locations? you could download them from there
14:51 <+Ryozuki> thats what i dont want to do
14:51 <+Ryozuki> i do that now
14:51 <+Ryozuki> there is little reason to not put the images on a repo
14:52 <+Ryozuki> when everythign else is already in a repo
14:52 <+Ryozuki> maps, ranks, etc
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Just convince deen with good quality
14:52 <+Ryozuki> wdym
14:52 <+Ryozuki> im making this web cuz i know unless u show smth good no progress will be made
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Convince him that your solution is better
14:52 <+Ryozuki> and even if its not accepted ill just run it on my server with another domain
14:53 <+Ryozuki> the data will just be daily cuz thats what i can get from the sql download
14:53 <+Ryozuki> but better than the current web
14:53 <+Ryozuki> also idc and the backend is in rust
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I dunno why u so mad xd. If it's clearly better deen can't resist xd
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im not mad
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> On the irc side i couldnt see ur msg was replying to my previous msg
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So it was a bit confusing
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess ill just scrape and put it in a repo
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> As they say, do it urself, cuz others will never do it for u
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i just invented this say
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm totally fine if someone wants to remake website and manages to do so. I don't want people to waste time doing 20% of what website currently has and calling it quits then
15:55 <+Ryozuki> ok
15:56 <+Ryozuki> just noticed the sqlite db doesnt have indexes
15:56 <+Ryozuki> my query went from 2s to 4ms after adding indexes :O
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I'd do it if I didn't already have a lot of ongoing projects
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Maybe if I get some time and inspiration I can start trying something for the website
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I think ryozuki means the backend while you mean the frontend?
16:32 <+Ryozuki> no im doing everything
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ah nice!
16:33 <+Ryozuki> as soon as i have something sizeable ill put it on github, ill try to not abandon this xd
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> did someone ever came up with names for all the emotes?
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> because the code only uses the number
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> There is an enum
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Or should be
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> got it thanks
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> ah wait no thats eyes
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> i think there is only eye enum
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Ah
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> ``EMOTE_PAIN`` etc
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> ye it scam
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Rest in peace
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Just create one
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> i rly do not wanna make up names
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> oof
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> And pr
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> tw code does not need it
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> it uses the index in the texture so duh
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Mad. Mad af. So mad he explodes
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> how to name the "!" ????
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Thats mad

16:52 <+ChillerDragon> ! is surprise?
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> hm yea
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> can be used like that but also as a warning
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> hmmm

17:35 <+ChillerDragon> #!!*:*!
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> <3
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> omg this sucks idk mman
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> i think ill use "..." lierally
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> what a mess
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i just thought that its better to name them how you'd use them while communicating with other tees rather than how its used in the game
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ðŸ’¢ btw ^^
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://emojipedia.org/anger-symbol/
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> oof thats descriptive
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> until the unicode breaks the font xd
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> its called anger symbol -.-
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> so the emote should be called anger?!
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> VEINS POPPING xd
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> BAM
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> POW
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> then i could also use the ghost emoji
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I guess 'anger' could be used, since it is officially anger in unicode
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> but the other angry emote is more obvious anger imo
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ddnet/tw has too many cursing emojis :d
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> how to call that one then
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> haha ikr
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> well
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> expressing your emotions
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> there is only anger
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> i did not use the happy years in my first 8 years playing the game basically
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> happy emote*
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> jesus brainfart
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I use it a lot
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> i started using it 
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> but late
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> yo teehistorians
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> statistics on emotes when?
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> i need graphs
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> which country uses the happy emote the most? xd
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i need to know which are the least used
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i'd say ghost or devil maybe
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> now im thinking like why didn't I make the list an array instead of json object
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i like how the discord emojis of teeworlds emotes have names
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ... is mmm
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> wtf why mmm xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> probably because you can't name it ...
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> dotdotdot
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it's called DOTDOT in the code
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i'd say `chat` or `speech` would be a better description of it
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But I'm not the one who is to decide about that, I just gave a suggestion =]
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean an isolated chat bubble would also be nice
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> something like `>..`
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> animated chat bobble
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Hey, the ninja is implemented way differently than the other weapons, right?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you opened Pandora's Box ðŸ˜„
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> update: my github account got suspended (no reason given, they still didnt answer my tickets after a week yet), so i decided to use gitlab instead (at least as long as my github is suspended): https://gitlab.com/swarfey/teeworlds-client/
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> I also added ddnet snapshot support and some documentation for (hopefully) everything, if anybody is interested: https://gitlab.com/swarfey/teeworlds-client/-/blob/main/docs/documentation.md :happy:
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Swarfey stand up for ur own
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> self host git
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you dont care much about other contributions
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cgit is lightweight and perfect
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise gitea
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or https://sourcehut.org/ but its hard to self host
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly dont like gitlab
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so bloated
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://git.edgarluque.com/
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> well i think gitlab is the best known alternative to github
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is my cgit instance
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> need to make it mirror more packages tho xd
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> i might switch back to github once my account is unsuspended, but im pretty sure i wont self host anything xd
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> weird that they suspended your account
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> ah yea that's cool
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> do you think it's for no reason?
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> well i had some project named "kahoot-botter" on my github page for some years
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> very simple, no proxies or anything, only a for loop and some random kahoot package
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's kahoot?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> i guess its for that, but they seem to have really long respond times
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think they ban for cheat software
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> its some quiz page, used sometimes in schools
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Some kind of quizz app
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> maybe the the kahoot package had kahoot code which is prolly proprietary
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @Alexander_ u're everywhere
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> well it only imported it, i dont think i also uploaded the node-modules folder
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> actually i dont know, its really long ago
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
