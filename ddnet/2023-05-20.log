02:36 < bridge> <name> I wonder if anyone have a blmapV2 map??
02:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this option seems kind of useless with the way people use clans. maybe the clan should always be ignored if not explicitly requested
02:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is roughly how it looks like in compact mode
02:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: probably never 0.6.5 dissector support. you can manually mark it as tw traffic
02:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see individual packets in the screenshots though
04:23 < bridge> <Ewan> huh?
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> do you think it would be plausible to multithread resource access so the whole game does not have to wait on skins or assets to reload
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> do you think it would be plausible to multithread image resource access so the whole game does not have to wait on skins or assets to reload
07:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A clicked decode as tw and that screenshot is the result. It does not detect most of the packets

09:31 < bridge> <VerteZzo> how to make funvote (vote what does nothing)
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add_vote <name> ""
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it was that order
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw better ask in #questions
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> I think ddnet.org/discord invite link expired or they ban tor idk
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice, u wanted to join dark side
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> no i wanted to see the server logo
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> but somehow it doesnt let me in with tor i guess
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> ah no its a tor thing
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> ok
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> they say invite invalid everywhere its weird
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> but its discord idk what i expected xd
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> could someone leak the server icon pls?

10:27 < bridge> <Vinson> how to solve this
10:27 < bridge> <Vinson> LNK2001 errer
10:27 < bridge> <Vinson> LNK2001 error
10:27 < bridge> <Vinson> thanks for help
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> if you’re declaring a variable as extern, you need to provide it a definition as well
10:29 < bridge> <Vinson> ok i will look for the error
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> do you have any new extern variables?
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> and for the record I can’t read any of this
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> also, if you’re using CMake, you need to regenerate your solution with cmake -G or the GUI (with the new files in your cmakelists)
10:32 < bridge> <Broso56> where are the kill tiles handled? cant seem to find it
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> what about the kill tiles
10:33 < ws-client> o/ this message was sent from https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
10:33 < ws-client> !jup thats what i needed the logo for xd i built discord lokking frontend for irc
10:33 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
10:33 < bridge> <Broso56> like what file
10:34 < bridge> <Broso56> i wanna toy around with making them /r if you are in practice
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic xd
10:34 < ws-client> on irc its instant im sure there is a bit delay to discord
10:35 < ws-client> try sending a message xd
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i can’t remember what /r does
10:36 < ws-client> <script>alert("xss safe?");</script>
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:38 < bridge> <Voxel> i have a confession
10:38 < bridge> <Voxel> i only code in ddnet because im better at editing code than writing my own code
10:38 < ws-client> <style>* { background-color: green; }</style>
10:38 < ws-client> a FUCK
10:38 < ws-client> all green now xd
10:38 < bridge> <Voxel> greem
10:42 < ws-client> UwU
10:51 < bridge> <Broso56> it tps u to the last spot u were alive and unfreezes u
10:52 < bridge> <Voxel> in theory i could learn rust by editing preexisting rust code
10:52 < bridge> <Voxel> but it still hurts my head
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i looked around a bit and for whatever reason it doesn't look like its determination is as simple as something like a freeze tile is
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> `CCharacter::HandleTiles` does most of it like this/
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan>     if(((m_TileIndex == TILE_FREEZE) || (m_TileFIndex == TILE_FREEZE)) && !m_Core.m_Super && !m_Core.m_DeepFrozen)
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan>     {
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan>         Freeze();
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan>     }
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan>     else if(((m_TileIndex == TILE_UNFREEZE) || (m_TileFIndex == TILE_UNFREEZE)) && !m_Core.m_DeepFrozen)
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan>         UnFreeze();
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan> this is at the start of `CCharacter::HandleSkippableTiles` in game/server/entities/character.cpp and is probably what you want
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>     // handle death-tiles and leaving gamelayer
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>     if((Collision()->GetCollisionAt(m_Pos.x + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetCollisionAt(m_Pos.x + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetCollisionAt(m_Pos.x - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetCollisionAt(m_Pos.x - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetFCollisionAt(m_Pos.x + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetFCollisionAt(m_Pos.x + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetFCollisionAt(m_Pos.x - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH ||
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>            Collision()->GetFCollisionAt(m_Pos.x - GetProximityRadius() / 3.f, m_Pos.y + GetProximityRadius() / 3.f) == TILE_DEATH) &&
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>         !m_Core.m_Super && !(Team() && Teams()->TeeFinished(m_pPlayer->GetCID())))
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>     {
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>         Die(m_pPlayer->GetCID(), WEAPON_WORLD);
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>         return;

11:04 < bridge> <Ewan>         return;

11:04 < ws-client> check out rust
11:04 < bridge> <Ewan> nice code guys 😃
11:04 < ws-client> the best lang
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> rust doesn't fix that
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that was me
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> trying the chat
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> if(condition) {

11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> if(otherCondition)
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan>   doOneOtherThing();
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> oic
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in that chat i didnt even see ur code properly
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> since it spam line per line or smth
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> @Ewan please stop sending code snippets
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> lul he hates it
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> your bridge getting blown up im sure
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> !ryo maybe one day ill add code snippet thingy but u like it so far? xd
11:06 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> what if i were to... edit some indentation......
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i forgot to ping you @Broso56
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> check out edlang
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> ye
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> oof
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> edlang
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> today i added rly basic type inference
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure why i should
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> you gotta sell it more
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz i made it
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like work idk what to do with it
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> does it do my laundry
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u cant do much rn
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just fiddle with numbers
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt even add a print yet
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> what's 9+10
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> yea ill try when u added print xd
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:08 < bridge> <Broso56> ye meeu pointed me in the same direction, should hopefully be good enough to implement it idk
11:08 < bridge> <Broso56> ty though
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> meeu know code?
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> !ryo wat are the lang goals?

11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk yet
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> will it be safe or sumsin?
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gotta figure out
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> probs not safe, idk how to code a borrow checker
11:08 < bridge> <Broso56> yes
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> swag
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> !ryo make it so its safe for me to include !edlang eval into chilerbot
11:09 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> reference check
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ez
11:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i gotta figure out how type inference  works if i ever add generics
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> type inference is a joke
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> in cpp it's carried by literal disambiguators
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> auto e = 10u; unsigned int
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> yadda
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> basic stuff should be ez tho

13:52 < bridge> <Vinson> these files with g_pData have the LNK errors
13:52 < bridge> <Vinson> how to solve
13:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe it was forgotten when time scores were added
14:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
14:04 < bridge> <Vinson> anyone help me
14:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With what?
14:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Vinson)
14:07 < bridge> <Vinson> the problem i send
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> u mean the one from 13:41 i dont get it what is LNK2001? xd do you get a compile error? can you show the full error or even share your repo?
14:37 < bridge> <Broso56> its a bug i think, it started happening the same time the other bugs happened
14:37 < bridge> <Broso56> like scrambled order in scoreboard ingame, not updating scoreboard time for a while after finish, etc
16:05 < bridge> <BillionRay> Did you create new .h or .cpp files? If so then you gotta add that to the CMakeLists.txt i think
17:21 < bridge> <Broso56> where is the /r check for if the player is in the air/freeze? wanted to add another check for kill but i cant find where thats done, tried looking in the rescue function and Load but cant really find anything related to it
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> !jup new screen arrived and is boring af xd
17:48 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> total waste of money xd
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> well ok to be fair i did buy it to feel exactly like my old one and just fix the tearing and indeed it did xd
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> it doesnt look any sharper or nicer xd which is fair i guess but it also doesnt feel any smoother than my suuuuuper old cheaper 60hz monitor xd
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684597779.png
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> do u know why the menu does not offer more than 60hz?
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> but buy this screen comes with his own set of problems xd freeze is so washy feels like i am drunk xd
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> nvm it glitchy af xd good i also ordered a new pc just in case xd
17:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> search for `m_Core.m_IsInFreeze = false` in `character.cpp` (server-side). it remembers the location for rescue when the tee is not in freeze and not in the air with `SetRescue();`
17:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> doing rescue for kill tiles would be harder, because kill immediately ends the run as far as I know, so you need to make the tee spec and give them a choice to rescue or restart when they hit a kill tile
18:02 < bridge> <Broso56> i mean my testing was fairly limited but for the most part the feature worked fine, the only reason i need that check is because you can get tped inside of a kill tile which makes you unable to move and spams /r infinitely, so unless i would have to refactor how thats done that part already works
18:02 < bridge> <Broso56> but ye ty ill look into that
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c no hate but if u cant feel difference between 60hz and 144hz then u lost af xD
18:07 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if menu doesnt offer more than 60hz then u didnt even set it to 144hz yet lmao
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> undefined behavior sanitizer as anime 😬
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109513703931510904/image.png
18:11 < ws-client> xd
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> !jup yea maybe the screen is 60hz by default would be weird tho rght?
18:12 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont trust gnome
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xrandr -r 144
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> i did notice a hughe diff when i bought my new laptop with 120hz its so much more smooth even on gnome desktop
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it fails then pc issue
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> but this screen is borin af
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> Rate 144.00 Hz not available for this size
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> i got scammed xd
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, but tbf
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> could be ur GPU
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> rly?
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with 4090 it should work
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> gpu can say no?
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> watf
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> ok good that i bought new one then
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> display port also has limitations
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and hdmi
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> i mean 980 is kinda top of the line
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> or was 10yrs ago
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> !jup jup japster check out my new setup!!! it loooks wastly different than my old one 
18:17 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684599427.png
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1:1 same
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> also irl it feels 99% same
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> just colors are worse
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> and even on max birghtness this lumen suck ass
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> funny after how many years later i can buy the same screen in more expensive and its worse.
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> gotta love inflation
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c here AI generated your dream setup for u

18:21 <+ChillerDragon> https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> its nicer for image viewing than weechat xd
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> eventho i have gotten really good at imagining how the image would look like based on the discord cdn url
18:21 < ws-client> the heck these pfps lmfao
18:21 < ws-client> they're high af
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> yea.. its placeholders for now xd
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> high?
18:22 < ws-client> test
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> its teeish
18:22 < ws-client> ah lol u can simply type in, nice
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> yes its free to use
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> no accounts no nothing
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> as it should be
18:24 < ws-client> and beatiful af
18:25 < ws-client> discord is almost as good as this
18:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> buggy
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> wot?
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> how
18:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> does it allow multi-line btw
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> no its irc based xd

18:35 < bridge> <Broso56> seems to work fine, ty lmao
18:36 < bridge> <Broso56> i just had to copy the killtile collision code which probably isnt the best idea but it works xd
18:53 < ws-client> test
18:53 < bridge> <bencie> anyone can send msges from there?
18:53 < bridge> <bencie> :justatest:
18:53 < bridge> <gerdoe> yup
18:53 < bridge> <bencie> seems like a disaster waiting to happen once 1 person abuses it
18:53 < bridge> <gerdoe> ez spam
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> yes pls dont abuse ._.
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> i can trust u guys
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> .. right?
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> worked wonderfully last time when lerato deleted the drive of my raspberry pi xd
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes trust me
19:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You can trust my bot. It only malfunctioned that one time and honestly it won't miss those files. 👻 🎩
19:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> yup
19:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think this is a good idea. instead, you should have to manually press /r after you die in /practice IMO
19:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's AMAZING, everyone will love you for this ^^ people usually say the opposite thing
19:19 < bridge> <Broso56> i mean that would work as well but i dont really see much of an issue with it auto rescuing you
19:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by doing it automatically, you might get weird effects
19:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. constantly being pushed into death tiles after /r
19:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or pushing other tees away from the place where you spawn with /r
19:20 < bridge> <Broso56> i guess yea
19:20 < bridge> <Broso56> but if it becomes too much of an issue they can /tp out no?
19:21 < bridge> <Broso56> the main thing that annoyed me was if someone didnt react fast enough they would have to /practice again and then /tp back to the spot they died
19:21 < bridge> <Broso56> tping out of a spot isnt as annoying
19:22 < bridge> <Robyt3> just put the player that hit death tiles in a special state where they can spectate and use /r to rescue
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that special state might also be good for death tiles after finishing in etam
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that you're out of the world, but not killed
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the kill immunity is really just a source of bugs ^^
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, it'd fix the problem of falling outside the map after finishing
21:17 < bridge> <miyo> i have want a make own client but i know nothing and where need i start?
21:17 < bridge> <miyo> hi i want a make own client but i know nothing and where need i start?
21:19 < bridge> <Voxel> wait, really? i always thought it was more of a flex when you coded your own prpjects
21:26 < bridge> <Learath2> It's more of a flex, but flex isn't appreciated as much as help
21:26 < bridge> <miyo> can somebody help me :shy:
21:26 < bridge> <Learath2> depends on what you need help with
21:27 < bridge> <miyo> how can i make own client
21:27 < bridge> <miyo> and which language use for this
21:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Only option is C++
21:28 < bridge> <Learath2> You just learn C++, clone the source and start modifying it
21:29 < bridge> <miyo> oh ok thx
21:30 < bridge> <gerdoe> look at Robyt3
21:30 < bridge> <gerdoe> he's literally shaping out this 20 years old project
21:32 < bridge> <Voxel> yea this puts it all into perspective
21:32 < bridge> <Voxel> i guess its easier for me to recognize patterns than create patterns
21:33 < bridge> <gerdoe> its like looking at somebody's artwork
21:33 < bridge> <gerdoe> you see every problematic piece
21:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> if you can understand process of art tho
21:36 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah definitely
21:36 < bridge> <Voxel> i guess my next step is to look at more complex code
21:38 < bridge> <Voxel> like i know how to send and recieve packets now, i know how to work namespaces, i know a tiny bit about how to treat classes
21:45 < bridge> <Learath2> I still think you'd benefit from doing a couple formal exercises. Like implementing a data structure, implementing an algorithm + making one program that you think might be useful
21:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> learn more about packet packing, data compressing and snapshot system in tw
21:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> they're quake alike
21:45 < bridge> <Learath2> doesn't have to be a massive program either, a lot of the people I tutor go for a todo program e.g.
21:46 < bridge> <gerdoe> so i mean they're not that hard to understand
21:55 < bridge> <Voxel> is packet packing different than creating and sending a packet
21:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> if you think that filling up *netmsg is packet packing its not
21:58 < bridge> <Voxel> im interested in these new terms :o
21:58 < bridge> <gerdoe> afair there's packer.h/cpp
22:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats because u need more xp
22:17 < bridge> <Voxel> i cant wait to become good at cpp and rust so i can help make ddnet 2.0
22:18 < bridge> <Voxel> since i know rust will become a heavy part of ddnet soon
22:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> why so?
22:19 < bridge> <Voxel> just ask ryoz
22:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah I see xD
23:08 < bridge> <Voxel> idk why im getting so curious over rust now
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> just learn it
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
23:19 < bridge> <Voxel> but its sooo complicated!!!!
23:20 < bridge> <Voxel> and idek what to make
23:20 < bridge> <Voxel> if anything i thought itd be funny to transcribe the vulkan code into rust
23:23 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I'm having fun getting entity data :YEP:
23:23 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109592322016039052/nobyfngmaprender1.png
23:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I need to program all of the rest gamemode entities too
23:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I wanna kms
23:24 < bridge> <Ewan> have you looked into tutorials
23:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> read the web book
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> the rust by example thing is sweet
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> Just Do It
23:26 < bridge> <Voxel> no because they're all "hiii heres how to write hello world!"
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to move yourself out of the mindset that you're above that
23:26 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> here is how to write "hello world" with results in segfault
23:27 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> here is how to write "hello world" which results in segfault
23:27 < bridge> <Ewan> your expectations of a guide can't be met because nobody knows your experience level in other languages & what you will and won't understand about this one
23:27 < bridge> <Ewan> so unfortunately you will have to learn about stuff you think you already know
23:27 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes you will be surprised about what you thought you knew that is actually different in x scenario
23:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u need to learn programming as is too
23:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u truly understand for loop,s do u know what arrays are, how to deal with em, etc
23:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk if u rly know that
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> known issue?
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 14 seconds worse on a 13 seconds finish makes no sense
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109593577165693038/image.png
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i think there have been time related issues jup
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> something to do with client version
23:29 < bridge> <Voxel> no because tutorials online dont teach that
23:29 < bridge> <Voxel> "hiii heres how to make a guessing game!!! 😁😁"
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> you're saying online tutorials don't teach you about loops & arrays
23:30 < bridge> <Voxel> not the ones i see
23:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tell me the server is old
23:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i fixed this
23:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> search the commit
23:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> . /info
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> which ver did the fix come out with
23:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet servers are not deployed on a tag
23:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rather master at a current time
23:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> mine has both
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> 16.9 and hash
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> usa1
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> but yea ig if they are re-rolled by commit and not tag that wouldn't matter
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2023-05-20 23:32:24 I chat: *** DDraceNetwork Mod. Version: 0.6.4, 16.9

23:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> which server?
23:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it doesnt have my commit
23:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> soi its broken cuz it hasnt updated
23:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Jupeyy_Keks  how do recommend learning Vulkan? Or do you recommend learning OpenGL first?
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vk is harder, so opengl helps, but in the end i'd recommend to just getting startet
23:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
23:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> best website
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the first week is random anyway, ur brain will not understand everything directly
23:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna retake vulkan someday
23:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> after using it a bit the concepts start to make sense
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i used this for example too
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also depends if u want to target desktop computers
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u can skip the "static" rendering pipeline, and use the modern dynamic one which is easier and more intuitive to start with
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "This extension allows applications to create single-pass render pass instances without needing to create render pass objects or framebuffers. Dynamic render passes can also span across multiple primary command buffers, rather than relying on secondary command buffers."
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering.html
23:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> cool gonna get started right away then :)
23:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> isn't starting with opengl makes it easier to understand vulkan in the future
23:50 < bridge> <gerdoe> bruh my english is so broken
23:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well what do u even want to understand is the question
23:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> opengl wont teach u anything about math
23:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it teaches u how to combine buffers with shaders basically
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so if u want to focus on getting started then yes opengl is good
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vulkan will teach you about memory management from GPUs/drivers etc
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> multithreaded in mind
23:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in theory u could simply write a OpenGL wrapper in VK 😄
23:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so OpenGL is kinda a subset
23:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm... I think I'm gonna read vulkan till I give up and read opengl after xD
23:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u cant betray vulkan
23:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252358080522747904/1109599218198401094/image.png
23:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can't
23:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I can knot
