02:07 < bridge> <xcwqw1> Is there a way for ddnet/ddnet server to determine which player a dummy belongs to?
02:07 < bridge> <xcwqw1> And the server can execute some specific content when the dummy connects.
02:07 < bridge> <xcwqw1> I am trying to make a login system, one account has two player names, and I hope that when the player is logged in, the dummy will automatically log in.
02:07 < bridge> <xcwqw1> I don't seem to see any way to distinguish them in CPlayer. Am I looking in the wrong place?
02:11 < bridge> <kebscs> you cant distinguish them, only way would be by ip
02:12 < bridge> <kebscs> but thats ofc not fully working if someone shares ip with someone
02:17 < bridge> <xcwqw1> It seems that in China, where there are many NATs, it is impossible to accurately judge, and it will cause other players in the same network environment to mistakenly think that they are the clones of a certain player.

12:24 < bridge> <always> nope
12:34 < bridge> <zelnix> <@749222324980416602>Hi, I have a problem with https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser I've been trying to transfer flood.py to 0.6 protocol for two days now but I can't get it to work, do you have an example of a simple bot for 0.6? I'm not the kind of person who gives up and asks for help but I've tried everything I can.
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> furo NOO :c
13:12 < bridge> <remakepower> Same bug also happens when you jump into a platform corner.
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> what happened?
13:12 < bridge> <remakepower> You will stuck in the block.
13:13 < bridge> <remakepower> And I forget how to solve it
13:13 < bridge> <remakepower> ‚òπÔ∏è
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> furo deleted his gh account wot
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zelnix adding a 0.6 example is on my todo since one year :D I can't promise i will do it soon. Any reason why 0.7 does not work for you?
13:30 < bridge> <Assa> Nice clip, if you take a deep look at the speedups and their orientation, you'll see, that the old speedups are just bullshit

13:53 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder if I should download this image and cross out everything except "apple"
14:51 < bridge> <zelnix> my friend's server, for which I tried to make a bot, works only on 0.6.
14:52 < bridge> <zelnix> I tried to run but wrote that 0.7 is currently unsupported, and something to do with the server friend does not want to(

16:51 < bridge> <patiga> all their dms to me are also deleted, maybe furo's discord acc is also deleted :c
16:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> same - no ddstats db access anymore :c
17:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @zelnix: tell your friend to update then
17:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That looks ddnet based should be just a matter of copy pasting the folder maps to maps7
17:56 < bridge> <sucrelol> is there an issue with DDstats ?
17:56 < bridge> <sucrelol> the repo on github doesn't exist anymore, and now there is a new git with only a new furo acocunt :

18:35 < bridge> <sucrelol> @blaiszephyr do you know how the population of DDstat website's database is implemented ?
18:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> wdym population? Furo fetches the DDNet DB and does sql magic
18:37 < bridge> <sucrelol> y'all need to populate the database to have the data in your "sql magic" üò≠ üò≠
18:38 < bridge> <sucrelol> my question is where you find the DDNet DB that you fetch, i can't find it at all mlskdfjglmsdvbjwxcmlvkbjstgh
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i host this https://db.ddstats.org/ (i made the ddstats domain before furo ddstats existed)
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/downloads/
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> here u can download it

19:46 < bridge> <belkka.underscore> Do you think it makes sense to teach `/lasttp` about `/tp <player name>`? I've created a post in #town-hall 
19:46 < bridge> <belkka.underscore> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1375165823332782082/1375165823332782082
19:46 < bridge> <belkka.underscore> 
19:46 < bridge> <belkka.underscore> There is a fallback to do `/tp <player name>` + `/tp` to imitate current behavior of `/lasttp`, so I think it would be a relatively "safe" change from the UX perspective
