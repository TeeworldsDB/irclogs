01:22 <@heinrich5991> Rafael: how do you do that?
01:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: either by setting it in skype proxy settings or using tsocks i'd guess
03:48 <+Rafael> http://puu.sh/pvvDv/35260d6b62.png Proxy Settings in skype ^^
15:27 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: deen: I'm using the webversion of skype for a month now, it has clearly better support than skype on linux and doesn't leak ip information
15:28 <@heinrich5991> does it support voice calls?
15:28 <@EastByte> nope (not on linux)
15:28 <@deen> EastByte: oh, but i don't like the web :P
15:28 <@deen> i'll give it a try though
15:28 <@deen> google hangouts works for video calls in browser btw
15:30 <@EastByte> well, in a chromium vm skype obvously is much more harmless than having a linux usermode process
15:30 <@EastByte> so I like that
15:31 <@heinrich5991> yes
17:05 <+minus> good idea
17:05  * minus uninstalls skype
17:18 <@EastByte> oh, I forgot to tell you that file transfer also doesn't work
21:44 < Ryozuki> someone ddosing
21:44 <+Ryozuki> what'ts that?
21:47 <@deen> yeah
21:47 <@deen> 10 second spikes of incoming udp traffic, looking like regular TW, from spoofed ip addresses
22:00 < ServerHoster>  yo Rafael wtf you doing letting illuminati ddos you and stealing your players ? go ddos them back
22:02 <+ServerHoster> yo Rafael wtf you doing letting illuminati ddos you and stealing your players ? go ddos them back
22:04 <@EastByte> ServerHoster: this kinda is the wrong channel to talk about Rafael's servers
22:05 <+ServerHoster> well it doesnt seem like it getting used much for anything else
22:05 <+jxsl13> pizza pasta salami
22:05 <+ServerHoster> his servers run the ddnet mod
22:10 <+Ryozuki> ddrace*
22:10 <+Ryozuki> ddnet it's the client and community i would say :o
22:13 <@deen> Ryozuki: the servers are also called ddnet
22:13 <@deen> even if your wiki likes to call them ddrace :P
22:16 <+Ryozuki> :o wait, doesn't ddrace refers to the gamemode and ddnet to ddrace network?
22:16 <+Ryozuki> thats why i made it like that 
22:16 <+Ryozuki> can be easily changed if its not like that
22:21 <@deen> Ryozuki: no
22:21 <@deen> Ryozuki: ddrace was the name of the mod ddnet is based on, at some point i renamed it after we had lots of changes
22:21 <+Ryozuki> oh
22:22 <+Ryozuki> so actually wiki is complitly worng
22:22 <+Ryozuki> ddnet now doesnt maintain ddrace but instead made another mod from it
22:22 <@deen> yep
22:23 <@deen> and then you list 5 other mods which haven't been updated for years which are also "maintaining ddrace" in some way^^
22:24 <+Ryozuki> xD
22:24 <+Ryozuki> and what's better, DDnet or DDNet
22:24 <@EastByte> DDNet
22:24 <@EastByte> well, nim style would be more like DdNet :p
22:25 <@deen> Nim is style insensitive, so DDNet = DDnet = D_D_N_E_T = Ddnet = DdNeT
22:26 <@deen> not that i agree with that choice :P
22:26 <@EastByte> right^^
22:27 <+Ryozuki> i don't understand it xD
22:28 <@deen> Nim is partially case insensitive: http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#lexical-analysis-identifier-equality
