11:00 < baklava-tee> What is this? http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html oO
11:00 <@deen> baklava-tee: ddnet client in your browser!
11:01 <@deen> it's pretty fucking great, made by eeeee 
11:01 < baklava-tee> That's unbelievable
11:01 <@deen> eeeee: I think we should get that out soon, would be really cool
11:01 <@deen> Can people on iphone and ipad use it?
11:02 <@deen> I think 2 things are needed: websockets in server and initial resolution detection so it has the right size on a phone
11:02 < baklava-tee> Is this on github or something?
11:02 <@deen> yes, i think so
11:03 <@deen> https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet/tree/js
11:04 < baklava-tee> Thanks
13:07 <@deen> ddos on GER
13:22 < CookieMichal_> !en-fr teeworld's server
13:22 < Nimda> Translation: le serveur de Teeworlds
14:31 <@deen> Hm, I think they have enabled some other anti-ddos measures
14:32 <@deen> can't ping ger.ddnet.tw anymore^^
14:34 <@heinrich5991> that's not a ddos measure I guess (?)
14:37 <@deen> why not? we used to have icmp ddos attacks
14:37 <@deen> maybe they came back
14:38 <@deen> i think they should just disable tcp except for my ssh connection
14:46 < coffee> "Serveur Teeworlds" is better than "Le serveur de teeworlds"
15:17 <@deen> eeeee: 90 players on GER2
15:22 <@deen> 110, wondering when the server starts lagging
15:28 < CookieMichal_> block server on GER was lagging like poop earlier
15:28 <@deen> yes, because that one specifically gets ddosed
15:28 <@deen> by its own players
15:29 < CookieMichal_> Someone is really retarded. How stupid someone has to be to attack game server?! 
15:34 <@deen> 400 players on GER and GER2 alone, nice
15:35 <@heinrich5991> just because you don't like someone they're not retarded...
15:36 < coffee> we should like ddosers
15:37 <@heinrich5991> that's totally what I said... I said "just because you don't like someone"
15:38 < coffee> Are you the attacker heinrich5991? :)
15:39 <@heinrich5991> no?
15:58 < Learath2> its prolly vanilla devs ddosing
16:21 < coffee> I don't think so
16:21 < coffee> Vali, captain nemo ?
16:23 < timme> both of them are mad
16:57 < timme> #teeworlds
16:58 <@heinrich5991> deen: you said that you could circumvent the "Stressing Network" ban?
16:58 <@deen> hm?
16:59 <@deen> not sure what you're referring to
16:59 <@heinrich5991> like using two different IPs
16:59 <@deen> yes
16:59 <@deen> they use 2 ips and quickly connect from them
17:00 <@heinrich5991> have you reported it to teeworlds/teeworlds or can I do it?
17:00 <@deen> i haven't reported any of the problems I found to teeworlds
17:00 <@deen> so go ahead
17:01 <@deen> I'm more interested in an implementation of eeeee's idea
17:17 < timme> eeeee's idea is awesome
18:05 < CookieMichal_> what idea? :I
19:08 <@deen> CookieMichal_: to add a penalty when a player reconnects too often, and then ban him after it's too much
19:52 < evil_saeid> hello
19:52 < evil_saeid> deen you here ?
19:52 < CookieMichal_> Hi there
19:53 <@deen> evil_saeid: hi
19:53 < evil_saeid> DEEN is block zombie mod are public ?
19:53 <@deen> NO IT IS NOT
19:53 <@deen> coffee made it
19:54 < evil_saeid> oo so impossible to run it in persian sure ?
19:54 <@deen> ask coffee
19:54 <@deen> I would like to run whole ddnet with block zombie and everything in Iran :P
19:55 < evil_saeid> i know it :D
19:55 < evil_saeid> but i say before ... :)
19:55 <@deen> I'm not allowed to give you the block zombie mod
19:55 < evil_saeid> sure :) np
19:56 < evil_saeid> for about 3 week , we have problem in iran servers
19:56 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'll try to cherry-pick your window-highlight stuff from ddnet into teeworlds, is that ok with you?
19:56 < evil_saeid> somebody use botnet to ddos persian servers :|
19:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: what's window-highlight?
19:56 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/59fccf18f0750c14bcdd45091a9ce4824af4808b
19:56 <@deen> evil_saeid: same on ddnet
19:57 <@heinrich5991> this is the second part, I'll search for the first one
19:57 <@deen> heinrich5991: sure
19:57 < evil_saeid> i manage my servers to switch intranet when ddos attack come , so only persian ips can see servers ! and when attack get off from servers , it switch for public ips
19:58 < CookieMichal> deen: Are you working on 128p ddnet? :o
19:58 <@deen> CookieMichal: i did, and it's mostly working
19:58 <@deen> i have a branch somewhere
19:58 < evil_saeid> atleast server will not down and persian players can enter servers :|
19:58 < CookieMichal> I saw
19:58 < CookieMichal> That's great idea :o
19:58 <@deen> CookieMichal: not sure =/
19:58 <@deen> I've stopped working on it
19:59 <@deen> would only be useful for the blocker server
19:59 < CookieMichal> deen: Imagine blmapVcookie 
19:59 < CookieMichal> :D
19:59 <@deen> and i don't like block anyway
19:59 < CookieMichal> Ye, ye
19:59 < evil_saeid> you already got ddos on ddnet servers ?
19:59 < CookieMichal> Block is fun
19:59 <@deen> all the ddos attacks come from block people
19:59 < CookieMichal> You can easily say who's good and who is not :>
19:59 <@deen> evil_saeid: yes, all the time
19:59 <@deen> in the last days 40 gbit/s
20:00 < evil_saeid> :| i get from one botnet with 2187 ip :| 320 gig/s :|
20:00 < CookieMichal> I will try to add icon to executable :>
20:00 <@deen> evil_saeid: sounds like a bit much
20:00 < evil_saeid> not bit , its much :D
20:01 < evil_saeid> FINALY i found this solution , switch servers for intranet so only iran ips can send request for server :| as all ips of his botnet are for none iran :|
20:02 < evil_saeid> [register]: server registered on local master sever
20:02 < evil_saeid> already server are under ddos attack right now :|
20:02 < evil_saeid> you can not see servers then 
20:03 < timme> wow
20:04 < evil_saeid> coffee you here ?
20:05 < coffee> i'm here
20:06 <@deen> coffee: tell him we need ddnet Persian to get block zombie to iran!
20:06 <@deen> :P
20:06 < evil_saeid> :D
20:07 < evil_saeid> deen if i accept to run ddnet in iran , you can not too
20:07 < coffee> Yes, evil_saeid, at this point Zombies mod is only running for and by ddnet.
20:07 <@deen> evil_saeid: what?
20:08 < evil_saeid> as persian server are under botnet ddos attacks , and i manage my server to switch intranet so only iran ips can eneter servers , also none iran ips can not see servers :D
20:08 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/DK5Qlg
20:08 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 0a1c906 def: Fix of water mapres (by Soreu, found by hi_leute_gll)
20:08 <@deen> evil_saeid: yeah, you could manage ddnet Iran like that, sounds good
20:08 <@deen> because our last Iranian provider threw us out after too many ddos attacks
20:09 < evil_saeid> my server are powerfull in iran , but i say before what i want :D
20:09 <@deen> I probably forgot^^
20:09 <@deen> You want cheats or what?
20:11 < evil_saeid> when server are under attack like now , servers can not regist for master server so we build local master so server can regist local master and persian players can enter servers :D
20:11 < evil_saeid> http://upload7.ir/uploads//67dd21b2eedd77ad021b86bdeab7ccbf8c684a3f.jpg
20:11 < evil_saeid> solo , pause , and r in novice server :D
20:11 <@deen> yeah, we have something similar in ddnet client
20:11 <@deen> ah right
20:12 < evil_saeid> each 10 min can use 1 time r
20:12 <@deen> I believe that destroys the game
20:12 <@deen> 1. people map differently, because the gameplay changed
20:12 <@deen> 2. people play egoistically, because everyone can just /r
20:13 <@deen> I think novice maps should be mapped in a way that new players can play them without cheats
20:13 < evil_saeid> noob players start game with novice maps and r help them much in this purpose
20:13 < evil_saeid> when they learn game , will move another server with no r
20:13 <@deen> I never played with r and neither did many others
20:14 <@deen> we cold have a "training" server with that stuff though
20:14 <@deen> but i really don't want official ranks with /r
20:14 < evil_saeid> we made rank table too :| for ddrace servers for iran !
20:15 < evil_saeid> same maps with ddnet
20:15 < evil_saeid> finish map and get point like ddnet !
20:16 <@deen> but no points on website, no player profile
20:16 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ranks http://ddnet.tw/players/deen
20:16 <@deen> no international comparison, no tournaments!
20:17 < evil_saeid> sure
20:18 < evil_saeid> just between persian players and who play in persian servers
20:18 <@deen> difficult to play in persian server when you cut off internet :P
20:18 <@deen> so, a separate training server would not be good enough?
20:20 < evil_saeid> one server with novice maps ? :|
20:20 < evil_saeid> with r ?!
20:20 < evil_saeid> or what ?
20:20 <@deen> not one server, one group of servers
20:20 <@deen> as many as you need
20:20 <@deen> i don't know how popular it will be
20:20 <@deen> we did that before, and no one played on them :P
20:20 <@deen> 1 group of regular ddnet servers, with international ranks, no /r
20:20 < evil_saeid> butyou wanna ddnet name on them but i wanna my persian pro name on them :D
20:21 <@deen> "DDNet Persian Pro" works for me :P
20:21 <@deen> you can call your /r servers whatever you want
20:22 < evil_saeid> HMMM you say , run ddnet in my server while my curent servers run ?!
20:22 <@deen> yes
20:22 <@deen> that would work
20:23 < evil_saeid> who wanna play on ddnet , play and who wanna play in curent one , play it :|
20:23 <@deen> But there is no DDNet in Iran
20:23 <@deen> people don't want to play with ping 150
20:24 < evil_saeid> but dont think more people will come ddnet , as people worked hard to get point in last 3-4 month :| and they will not want to loose them and start play on ddnet !
20:24 <@deen> Did you allow /r and so on only on novice?
20:25 < evil_saeid> novice each 10 min and anothers each 30 min
20:25 <@deen> ah shit
20:25 < evil_saeid> :D
20:25 <@deen> otherwise i thought we could maybe move ranks from Persian Pro to DDNet
20:26 < evil_saeid> u use sql table to points ?
20:26 <@deen> yes
20:26 < evil_saeid> same then !
20:27 < evil_saeid> but one problem out players points are with r , pause , solo :D
20:27 <@deen> So yeah, looks bad
20:27 <@deen> I'm 100% against /r, /pause and /solo
20:27 <@deen> they're all cheats for me
20:28 < evil_saeid> r are cheat in my mind
20:28 < evil_saeid> but pause and solo are not in my mind
20:29 <@deen> in some parts they can be used to cheat
20:29 <@deen> and they only help if the map is badly designed
20:29 <@deen> in good maps you have enough space
20:29 < evil_saeid> solo are good sometime when players are much and you can not move between players faster , so better use solo and move fast that part of maps !
20:29 < CookieMichal> deen: When unzooming, how client knows which layers should not be resized (background)?
20:30 <@deen> evil_saeid: alright, i guess we won't find a solution
20:30 < CookieMichal> Is it only for last group of layers?
20:30 <@deen> CookieMichal: if parax == 0 and paray == 0: don't resize
20:30 < evil_saeid> :D sure deen but you can run zombie blocK :D
20:30 < CookieMichal> deen: Thanks :)
20:30 < evil_saeid> what you use in your servers ?
20:30 <@deen> evil_saeid: hm?
20:30 < evil_saeid> linux ?
20:31 < evil_saeid> which one ?
20:31 <@deen> evil_saeid: yes, linux
20:31 < CookieMichal> Debian for sure
20:31 <@deen> preferrably Debian 7
20:31 < evil_saeid> i use ubunto 14 :|
20:31 <@deen> but debian 6, ubuntu and centos are also on some of the servers^^
20:31 <@deen> ubuntu would be no problem
20:31 <@deen> evil_saeid: right now you have windows?
20:32 < evil_saeid> no
20:32 < evil_saeid> ubunto 14 in server
20:32 < evil_saeid> my pc are windows
20:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/sw4sjg
20:37 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 bb766f2 def: Version 6.6.8
21:01 <@deen> Anyone know how to compile with boost on windows?: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/132#issuecomment-70422645
21:04 < coffee> I use a .bat script : http://pastebin.com/kPR7eKxf
21:05 < coffee> boost/variant.hpp is only header file I guess
21:06 <@deen> you can tell him on github?^^
21:07 < coffee> That was your first purpose hu
21:08 < coffee> sorry I can't my english is too approximate and I never compiled ddnet with sql library
21:11 <@deen> =/
21:14 <@deen> EastByte: you there?
21:17 <@deen> EastByte: would be nice if you can make a public post in ddnet forum about zclient having a backdoor
21:17 < coffee> wow
21:19 < Learath2> deen: ouch what kind of backdoor is it 
21:21 <@deen> Learath2: that's exactly why I want EastByte to write about it, he discovered it, he knows^^
21:21 <@deen> they have an update server and it can send commands I think
21:22 < Learath2> oh maybe thats what they are using to ddos ddnet
21:22 <@deen> I think the ddosers and zclient people are different groups
21:23 <@deen> the ddosers have their own client with dosing capabilities
21:23 <@deen> but they wouldn't ddos from their own ips of course
21:23 < Learath2> what is their client named ?
21:23 <@deen> they don't even play without proxies or anything
21:23 <@deen> no idea
21:23 <@deen> it's not public i guess
21:23 < Learath2> could go around banning them from everywhere 
21:24 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, try that and the server is down in 1 min
21:24 < Learath2> well thats not exactly useful but if you have a public client that is used alot you can use the clients to dos
21:25 < Learath2> you really should file a police report 
21:25 < Learath2> when you have time ofc
21:25 <@deen> they definitely don't have enough users for those kinds of attacks
21:25 <@deen> if each user had 1 MB/s they'd need 40 thousand
21:26 < coffee> That's why I only trust ddnet
21:29 < coffee> How works the updater ?
21:32 <@deen> we have a new autoupdater, but i haven't pulled it in because I don't know how to understand it
21:32 <@deen> you can check autupdate.cpp for the current one
21:33 < coffee> I won't because I totally trust in you ! autoupdate, then
21:39 < CookieMichal> deen: is zombie block map somehow protected from editing? :o
21:39 <@deen> CookieMichal: ehm, it's coffee's mod, and he didn't make it open source
21:40 < CookieMichal> I mean map
21:40 <@deen> oh, no idea
21:40 < CookieMichal> map file
21:40 <@deen> is it?
21:40 < CookieMichal> I cannot open it in DDNet Client :o
21:40 <@deen> coffee?
21:40 < CookieMichal> In map editor
21:40 < coffee> heh
21:40 < CookieMichal> what have u changed hax0r? :D
21:40 < coffee> I made a script to lock the map
21:40 < coffee> lol
21:41 < CookieMichal> But how does it lock? :D
21:41 < coffee> I can give the code
21:41 < CookieMichal> Yeah, would be cool :D
21:41 <@heinrich5991> CookieMichal: what happens if you open it?
21:41 <@heinrich5991> if you can code, just debug the editor
21:42 < EastByte> a new anti map editor exploit?
21:42 < coffee> nope
21:42 < CookieMichal> Nothing happens :> Editor just acts like I would never do anything.
21:42 < coffee> It's a tiny thing to prevent modifications from editor
21:43 < EastByte> deen: Tobii currently has control of the zclient control server btw.
21:43 < EastByte> coffee: how?
21:43 < coffee> just change the map version
21:43 < CookieMichal> x)
21:43 <@EastByte> hmm
21:43 < CookieMichal> I am off, cya! :)
21:44 <@EastByte> bye
21:44 < coffee> It means Tobii is an hacker?
21:45 <@EastByte> nope, he registered the domain zclient.tk
21:45 < coffee> What does that mean ?
21:45 <@EastByte> so basically it always was his server
21:55 < Learath2> EastByte: how sophisticated are the commands he can send from his server
21:56 <@EastByte> PACKET_EXEC = b"\x20\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xffexecquit\x00"
21:57 <@EastByte> it's any client cmd command behind "exec"
22:01 <@heinrich5991> so not completely bad, but still
22:09 < Learath2> yeah thats a bad use for a backdoor :(
22:11 <@deen> don't give them any ideas :P
22:13 <@EastByte> that actually would be the only good use of the backdoor
22:14 < eeeee> yeah i'm still working on both js client and websockets in server
22:14 <@EastByte> o/
22:15 < eeeee> websockets are mostly done, but still missing the wait for packet (select) part
22:15 < eeeee> so ping on websocket is a bit higher
22:16 <@EastByte> I still don't understand why emscripten tw runs that smooth
22:16 <@EastByte> kinda scary
22:16 < eeeee> js client is missing pointer lock (which is a bitch, spent a whole day yesterday still 1-2 more to get it finalized) and canvas scaling
22:16 <@EastByte> I'm afraid of touching it
