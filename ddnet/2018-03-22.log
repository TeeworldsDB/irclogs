02:50 <+jxsl13> . :D
02:52 <+jxsl13> 3 am and I laugh my ass of, how creepy that smiley is.
02:54 <+jxsl13> btw changed that thread spawning to two in memory caches and one thread pushing the caches to the database. but somehow something is still blocking and causing lags.. hm
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> jxsl13: Are you still waiting for the thread to finish with join from your main thread?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> I have managed to put teestalker on my server
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> https://teestalker.blazic.tech
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <モカツ〜〜〜> stalker
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> hehe
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Delirio> Hi guys, in Chilean servers we can't vote for the map Flux 2, pls fix 😁
15:15 <+jxsl13> @deen only joining the db writer thread on shutdown.
15:16 <+jxsl13> https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch/src/branch/onethread/src/game/server/teehistorian.cpp#L196
15:16 <+jxsl13> that's what's happening in the db writer thread
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Delirio Thanks for report, fixed
17:09 <+jxsl13> :'c
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is right now possible to do http requests from the ddnet server?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Delirio> 👌
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> can i put here troll map  ( very short )
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it already in general
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @texnonik what map
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Just a quick thought on "accounts". What about identifying users via PGP?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> @jao 
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> "how do you assign people to accounts?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> you would need to verify them
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> and that's hardly possible"
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sorry i don't know pgp
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Way of "signing" digitally with private and public keys
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so how would that work?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Client creates pair of a public and a private key
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> The public key is stored on a key server
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Wait a sec, pretty bad at explaining this
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it was more about verifying that X player is whoever he claims to be to assign the points to his account
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i think
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Would be possible to i guess
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and how would you verify that?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> You might assign points to an PGP identiy instead of a nickname
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> pls no PGP, are you want me to be nerd or something?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Could be done by the client
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u play teeworlds ur already a nerd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do you verify who gets the identity
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and when 2 players claim to be the same person how do u distinguish
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> or 10
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @noby teeworlds is a game for 12yo kids
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I am 14 though
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no kids allowed
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> out
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> first lola needs to learn how friend requests work
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I know already @jao
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😮
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> I think how it basicly works is that with the private key you encrypt and the public key decrypts vice versa
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how does that solve the problem of assigning accounts to names
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> You could assign a nickname to that PGP identity
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Or the points
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and how do you assign the identity to someone
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Via their private key
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :what:
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I am lola for example.. assigned whos next?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i am lola too
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dIeD> hi im jao
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> how do u solve that?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> shut up snail
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hi its deen i forgot the rcon can someone pm it to me
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Basic thought process is like
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 1. Create key pair, and store the public key online
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 2. Upon "login" the client tells the server "hey i'm PGP-ID XYZ1337"
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 3. With the public key the "accountserver" creates a challenge which is only solvable with the private key
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 4. Client sends back right awnser
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @CptDalv pls
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u keep repeating the same thing ignoring our answers xd
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you know the ddnet rank/point system @CptDalv ?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> their assigned by nickname i guess
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye and if you link existing names to accounts now, how do you verify that the person that gets the account for a certain name is the same person that collected points with that name
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I swear
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> No way in doing so i guess
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> No bulletproof one
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that's the issue 😃
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Reseting points aint a solution either ^^
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can only use accounts to ban/mute/punish people effectively i guess
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Nothing to stop them from recreating
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hm
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Except email verification
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> phone verification xd
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Like making an account inconvenient
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> *account creation
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Donate blood or something like that
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but that's too annoying
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @CptDalv yes, something like identifying users via public keys is planned in the long term
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> The sooner the better so players dont loose too much points
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> yeah no more RCON passwords
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you want to reset points?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Not my decision at all 😄
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> delete everyones points because they couldve been cheated
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> But as mentioned thousands of times from various people there is no way of assigning current points to new account
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Might be possible with the ones of share their name in the forum & ingame
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> But i think thats not the majority
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I am n000b
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Approved by me, deen - the one and only
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> When the time comes we assign nicknames to accounts i was "nameless tee"
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @CptDalv it doesn't solve everything, people lose their keys easily
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Add an option to recover (recreate) keys with a password
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> u ma @CptDalv
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> no u
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> u mad @CptDalv
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @CptDalv how?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that just destroys every upside we achieve by using public key crypto
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> yeah, people can share their private keys... hmmm
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people can share their private keys either way
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like that's not something you can stop
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Only thing accounts might achieve here is that you are able to end existing sessions on new login
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Please don't mess with accounts, I promise I'll do them soon 😄
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least yet ;P
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> merging a PR with crypto is gonna be so much fun :<
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially not you @heinrich5991, if you do it we are getting a rust authentication server and 60 new libs to link with 😛
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually now that I think about it if anyone else is going to do it, you should, don't want to end up with another unmergeable PR
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @CptDalv They wait your PR with PGP, go on
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh btw, accounts will never solve banning issues, if we ever have accounts they will be similar steam accounts
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> and how u solve name claims @Learath2
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already have a kinda working (sometimes (maybe))(tm) prototype of it with pubkey signing
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @lola very very simple, accounts are not associated to names
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> names are only for displaying, like in steam
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> so I can still be lola as always?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> As everybody
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but people will know if you are the lola they have added as a friend
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I don't care, just want be lola
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can be lola in the sense that your name will be displayed as lola, but people who have the real lola added will know that you are most definitely a fake
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which makes faking obsolete
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> but what if other lola is fake 😠
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but people that don’t have them in friends won’t know?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well at this point even I don't have any idea which one of you is real, I know one of you knows french one doesn't
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> je parle francais
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> je parle aussi
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> je suis lola
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao yeah, will add a way of adding people from forum as friends also will distribute mods/admins somehow, didn't think about the last one
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> no @CptDalv you are only trying
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> merde
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No je suis lola
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then you can still fake people and ruin their reputation and shit
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Non je suis lola
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 但是我会中文
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 我是LOLA
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> stop that
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 对不起
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao /points should reveal the faker
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> /points
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> see it works 😛
23:35 <+jxsl13> quote of the day: [22:12:00] +bridge:	[ddnet] <noby> u play teeworlds ur already a nerd
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how so 😮
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> omg
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao fake jao would have 0 points, real jao would have couple thousand
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I have a lot of points @Learath2 🙂
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sadly any form of accounts that is useful requires a reset of ranks
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> yay! will you reset all points?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Only "lola"s
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> no
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I gave this quite some time and I don't see any other nice way, if one of you comes up with one do tell
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if not yeah will archive old ranks as "legacy" and start with a new "season" of ddnet
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> reseting points is bad 😦
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why is it bad?
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then you could’ve also reset botters points already
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not talking about deleting any ranks, they'll just be archived
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> @jao You can't really tell if that botter was the "real" owner of that nick
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @CptDalv we can in the case of the botters we currently banned
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> ok
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I hope you know what you do @Learath2
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I obv won't do anything before discussing it to death, big decisions need to have quite some support
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> people will rq
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> The biggest drama ever coming
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I'm sure everyone would follow along if I offfer 50e to the person who gets the most points in 1 month
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> lol
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice manipulating people
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is a competition manipulation?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I for one would prefer if the community was a little more active and competitions achieve just that
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides I'd like to think most of the people still playing play because they enjoy the game, I don't know many that only play for points
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @bano do
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> and Starkiller
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> limited edition ddnet mugs for the top10 points? 😛
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> 3d printed tee merch
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways to conclude, if everyone hates the idea I just won't do it, but know that without some kind of "restart" accounts are useless so we might aswell just not have them
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whole ddmax server is there so people can farm points
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddmax server is there because we didn't want the maps to be lost
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I bet you gonna be the most hateful person even on the start of discussion @Learath2
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> more than heinrich?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> prob
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> 😮
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes, not because the maps are considered fun 😄
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are a bunch of archival freaks 😛 (the ranks are eternal rule, teehistorian, ddmax server, oldschool server)
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oldschool is different tho
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah yeah people do enjoy the maps there but the thing is even if they hated it we'd keep them
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that's bad
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> is there a reason to delete ddmax?
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would you think that? It's not costing us anything extra to host them nor is it annoying players in any way that we host them
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so you would be for hosting all maps that are out there
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh I'd be okay with making all "archived" maps 1 point, but the points system is a discussion for another time
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao that'd most definitely cost us extra 😛
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😮
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 does have a map archive somewhere though
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> after archiving all points, /top5 would show nothing on maps?
