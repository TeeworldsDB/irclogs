03:27 < Learath2> EastByte || deen vali is going around servers kicking people with bots
03:58 < Learath2> i have decided that ill fix him if you do have any info about how he does it do tell
04:47 < Learath2> well first ill finish up on my exams then ill fix vali
11:13 <@EastByte> Learath2: he is using public proxies and/or compromised servers to spawn votebots
11:15 <@EastByte> a few months ago I implemented DNSBL which could be used to mitigate most of the bots (however we didn't set it up in production, yet)
12:46 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: the token protocol seems to use the NET_CTRLMSG_ACCEPT which is not guaranteed to arrive, is that correct? i.e. it can happen that the connection establishment fails because a packet isn't delivered?
12:47 <@EastByte> yup, you already mentioned that im some ticket iirc
12:47 <@EastByte> I guess we should fix that
12:50 <@heinrich5991> I think I only noticed that for the vanilla handshake (where it's unfixable IIRC)
12:50 <@heinrich5991> I'm gonna open a ticket
12:51 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/500
12:51 <@heinrich5991> blergh. already opened a ticket. apparantly I forgot
12:51 <@EastByte> :p
16:16 < Learath2> yeah i was also thinking of dnsbl
16:40 < o_be_one> vali is like a virus ... And like "someone". Even if you do some things bad for him, he will continue anyway, cause his life is only to annoy people.
16:40 < o_be_one> (so, they have no life at all)
16:51 < necropotame> if it's true that he have no life, it doesn't mean that he is a virus. I mean, thanks god, vali can't reproduce himself or with the help of a host. So it appears that he is just some sort of annoying natural element. You know, like the bird poop that fall on you...
17:32 < Shishigami> why is this vali guy so mad
17:34 < Ryozuki> arguing it wont solve anything
17:34 < Ryozuki> u have to accept he is like it is
17:34 < Ryozuki> and prob he will never change
17:50 < Learath2> accept him like he is?
17:50 < Learath2> why do we have to accept him at all?
19:24 < Shishigami> Ryozuki, no seriously, I don't know vali, why is he doing this at all?
20:58 < Learath2> im guessing he cant handle it when he gets his feelings hurt
