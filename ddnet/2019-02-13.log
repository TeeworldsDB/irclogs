00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> no i think you have autism
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Whats the good things about persian client
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @texnonik that ingame? probably the client renders the ingame mouse and the editor mouse at the same time, it would make sense tho why is it shaking
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[Ä¢Ã¸Å´]Lickout> who is hosting Persian srvs ?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @LickouT we dont host it. It is hosted by  @Quick
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> why does red tele work like blue tele on some maps?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because of `sv_teleport_hold_hook`
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> thats a rly confusing command tbh
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u have no idea of it and it randomly happens
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> when u expect the red tele to be an actual red tele
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> maybe we need an ingame command like /tunes that would display the mapâ€™s specific settings
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> then u can see max team size, pauseable, etc
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think itâ€™s only used on justice?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and there everything is confusing ðŸ˜‚
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> when you spaghetti code
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> Hey all,
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> I wanna build a docker image based on alpine for my ddnet test server. Is there a way to download the latest release without having the version number in the url? Somthing like this: `https://ddnet.tw/downloads/latest.tar.xz`
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @jao nah
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i remember playing a map recently with fake red teles too
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i was consufing
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i was confused
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Wollwolke u could always clone master and compile
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe deen can make it handy for u
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Wollwolke actually we used to have a latest, but we removed it, not sure why
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, now we have it again: https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-latest-linux_x86_64.tar.gz
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, now we have it again: https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-latest-linux_x86_64.tar.xz
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> cool, thank you
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Wollwolke buti think the docker image would be more general if you made it compile it from source, right?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And please add the docker image to the README in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet when it's done ðŸ˜ƒ
19:20  * bridge [ddnet] <Headshot>  
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> @deen oh, but than I have to do it the right way xD
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> I have to think about how to use volumes...
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with all dependencies from the package manager etc
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyway, your choice
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> what do you mean with package manager dependencies in docker?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I haven't used Docker, but I imagine the best style would be to build DDNet from source and get all dependencies through the package manager so that they are up to date etc
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> I used it quite a lot lately and couldn't find an image. I see what I can do, maybe I can finally support this project^^
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks!
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> oh, wow, I can't paint into the game layer from the palette
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I think I might have randomly broken something.. ðŸ˜„
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Can anyone explain me why deepfly works always only for main as driver OR dummy as driver?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> If you use The "wrong" tee as driver the hammer wont be at the same time
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I use deepfly for normal hammerfly also and its annoying when my hammering tee touches freeze and doesnt hit the hammer in the moment i unfreeze him ny hammer for example
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Maybe because your main tee has strong hook
