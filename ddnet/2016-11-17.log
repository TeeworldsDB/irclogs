00:00 <+laxadedi> you could ask me anything about Nimda
00:00 <+laxadedi> why do you want is not to be op anymore EastByte ?
00:05 <+laxadedi> !reload autojoin
00:59 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: in this case, because it did negative things
01:00 <@heinrich5991> it voiced some user that we explicitly devoiced
01:00 <@heinrich5991> removing the operator status didn't work because of Q's autoop
01:00 <@heinrich5991> so kick of nimda was an easy option
01:04 <+laxadedi> alright, can't make nimda rejoin until +r is removed
01:58 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: ^
07:05 <+Ryozuki> laxadedi i just want to change the server and channel that it joins by default
07:06 <+Ryozuki> can't find it on the soure code
07:06 <+Ryozuki> (mb i'm blind xD)
07:07 <+Ryozuki> ok nothing, found it https://github.com/noother/Nimda3/blob/58d3bd5a5624fb3e7ef8b790c2ee158621956e6b/core/sql_updates
07:46 <+Fin> Who developed Nimda?
08:59 <@deen> Fin: based on the github link it looks like noother
10:47 <+laxadedi> Fin: noother
10:47 <+laxadedi> Ryozuki: everything is SQL configured
10:49 <+laxadedi> !lockdown
10:49 <@Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !lockdown.
10:49 <@EastByte> !lockdown
10:49 <@Nimda> Ending channel lockdown.
10:52 <+laxadedi> Next time, don't kick Nimda please ;D
10:53 <@EastByte> will see
15:37 < qshar> Any DDNet client developers here?
15:38 <@deen> qshar: hi
15:40 < qshar> hey deen =)
15:41 < qshar> Do you remember I wrote you about Interactive map modification that I'm working on?
15:42 <@deen> yes
15:42 < qshar> The modification that will allow to move objects using Quads and Envelopes
15:43 <@deen> yeah, i saw the forum thread, demo looked awesome
15:44 < qshar> Well, I'm almost done it. I'm planning to release it soon. But there are some issues that you might help if you agree to modify DDNet client a bit
15:46 < qshar> I'm mostly talking about Time sync for envelopes - they are resetting when player crosses the line. I'd like tomake it possible not to reset the time for DDNet players
15:47 <+Ryozuki> maybe some maps will get broken
15:48 <+Ryozuki> atleast visually
15:48 < qshar> As far as I see it - it can be done by adding a new map variable that will tell the client if the map uses interactive objects modification and add few lines for time sync
15:49 <+Ryozuki> ah, maybe yes
15:50 < qshar> so it will be only applied on such kind of maps, nothing will be changed on others
17:09 < mixtru> hello i have all the info about the DoSer
