16:14 <+necropotame> Someone can explain me teleport checkpoints ?
16:15 <@EastByte> it ports you to the last checkpoint you went through
16:17 <+necropotame> You must pass the checkpoint, then CFRM/CTO are enabled?
16:18 <@EastByte> I think so
16:18 <+necropotame> And the difference between evil and not evil teleport?
16:18 <@EastByte> the former one is evil
16:18 <@EastByte> deen: ^
16:21 <@EastByte> might have to do with hook relase on teleport or something
16:26 <+necropotame> Oh sorry, I've missread the manual
16:26 <+necropotame> Evil break speed and hook, hte other one kept them
16:27 <@EastByte> ah

18:18 <+necropotame> ^ EastByte -> Following the discussion of yesterday, my editor will clip each big shapes automatically, producing indirectly a form of space partition to accelerate the rendering of quads :)
18:19 <+necropotame> Maybe in 2 years, my PR on TeeWorlds will be accepted too :D
18:19 <@EastByte> necropotame: yea, sounds cool
