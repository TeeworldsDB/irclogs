00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the server that doesnt lag
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :(
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because I noticed that when GER2 gets ddosed, hetzner just shuts us down without warning or notification, and they don't even know why they did it exactly
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> evil hetzner .-.
12:11 <+Learath2> or maybe we should drop GER and spin up a couple more GER servers on hetzner cloud, how many of them can they ddos at once anyways? :P
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we can't transfer players to another server, and even if we could they could switch to the next server just as fast
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Learath2 You do not need a so big bandwidth to take down a tw srv
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> so they can run a lot of attacks at once
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol but what a kind of toxic guy is ddos the servers all the time.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> idk, i saw one of those type, but he changed now xD
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Learath2  just to give you an example, a vps from OVH, is downable with 5-10Mb/s min for tw
12:45 <+Learath2> seriously any isp who allows this shit on their network should be held liable for the attacks
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Learath2 it is ez downable cuz of the tw protocol
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> .-.
12:49 <+Learath2> yeah I know
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> and you can do nothing against it
12:50 <+Learath2> I might be able to do nothing but if isp's actually started cracking down on it these would all stop
12:53 <+Learath2> e.g. we still get reflection attacks, how are there still ISPs that don't implement anti-spoofing measures is beyond me
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> cuz you think thats easy?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> haha
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> am I missing something here? bcp38 is already implemented on most hardware yet it's adoption is still near 80%
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> egress filtering god knows how many networks still don't implement
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> thats way more difficult
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still say it's greedy businessman only thinking about themselves, the hardware exists they just don't want to pay up
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is why criminalizing it would be a nice motivator
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> You should realize more
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> the price
16:35 <@Nimda> Quick by Deeper just released on Solo at 2018-02-10 16:30
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> does someone knows how works token requests on the ddnet src?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> which functions are called & more
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> could be even better for an explanation of info requesting & tken
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> pv me if someone knows
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you mean for server info?
20:02 <+Learath2> Is anyone here using Atom?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Ryozuki there is more
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Ryozuki you have Server Info, when a client send a fstd & gie3 request, I'm already limiting that
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Ryozuki but i'm searching more, tken request, this is when a client asks for connect
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> I'm actually trying, something, if it works, then I'm done with that shit procotol
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ReiTW | Blizzard Team maybe this is useful https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/doc
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> thx, that explain correctly
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> but the best would be an explanation of functions
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> like a gdb
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> in gdb when you got your backtrace, they tell all functions that has been running
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> before crash
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> so you know the path
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> like gdb
