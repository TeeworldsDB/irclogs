22:03 < Learath2> Ryozuki: i know, idk where to put the rate limiting tho
22:03 < Learath2> i asked like a line or two abobe
22:03 < Ryozuki> you can make it wait 2 mins
22:03 < Ryozuki> till inviting again
22:03 < Ryozuki> or not inviting again
22:03 < Ryozuki> just wait till he accepts
22:03 < Ryozuki> or disconnects
22:04 < Learath2> yeah make it wait is what i wanted but idk where the rate limiting belongs
22:04 < Learath2> does it belong in CGameTeams or CGameContext
22:04 < Learath2> does it belong in the callback or outside
22:05 < Learath2> Ryozuki: can you join a server with me?
