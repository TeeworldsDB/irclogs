00:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks good read. I rate this blog 9/10. Finally understood Nagels algorithm.
03:03 < bridge> <gumbatw> big +1, really important features, for streamers, but also for minors etc
03:03 < bridge> <kjhd8283jsi2hfjsue3hsie727hdjw2u> yeah totally makes sense gotta have those features especially for streamers and to keep things safe for minors too üò≠ good call
03:03 < bridge> <murpi> uh huh
03:04 < bridge> <murpi> you smell
03:04 < bridge> <kjhd8283jsi2hfjsue3hsie727hdjw2u> whats that supposed to meanüíÄ?
03:05 < bridge> <gumbatw> LOL
03:05 < bridge> <gumbatw> I was so confused  that he wrote that in under 5s with same content
03:07 < bridge> <gumbatw> one time someone support me and its a gpt bot :pepeW:
03:10 < bridge> <yrrr_> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1117664860646408225/1160308622975303922/8017BDCB-95DE-4685-B770-9E16800B436F.gif?ex=6534309d&is=6521bb9d&hm=80621708fdde38e937b6a6e9c4718d44c29674da822f454138561dc2995056cd&
04:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does the client really not know if others are in a freeze tile or am i too blind to see it?
04:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is FreezeStart and FreezeEnd i was expecting a magic value like -2 in one of them if the player is in a freeze tile
04:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never played with freeze bars on but holy moly its not statically fully when in freeze?
04:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1715307511.png
04:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm found it :D there is the IN_FREEZE flag. Imo the freeze bar could use it and show full in that case.
04:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm I guess pickup heart is not considered IN_FREEZE ._.
04:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks pretty in freeze to me 
04:33 < pon882> halo
05:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah agree but freeze bar is usually off if the player is inside the freeze
05:28 < bridge> <Ewan> client doesn't know about ddnet hearts, they're not predicted
06:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga when LLM map search? I wanna go to https://maps.ddnet.org/llm and type in "faily solo maps" and get a list of maps :D

08:30 < bridge> <syrinok> The infamous magic edge, I guess. Teeworlds physics troll
08:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> never seen magic edge with speedups
08:30 < bridge> <zhn> you can try to save-load
08:31 < bridge> <syrinok> I've seen it a handful of times, very rare
09:15 < bridge> <teero777> I had >3 on Himalaya
09:15 < bridge> <teero777> It's cursed
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> gores is basically PVP
09:47 < bridge> <Ewan> that or it‚Äôs basically ddnet servers with 2 extra features and different maps
09:47 < bridge> <Ewan> pick
10:02 < bridge> <avolicious> DDNet is also PVP then, you can aswell use your dummy to finish maps as one person
10:04 < bridge> <avolicious> The separation of the used terms: pvp, race and ddnet ( which is not a gametype, its just the network ) is wrongly used.
10:04 < bridge> <avolicious> 
10:04 < bridge> <avolicious> PVP & PVE are the top categories
10:04 < bridge> <avolicious> Race, Gores, DDRace, ctf, fng are the second categories
10:06 < bridge> <Ewan> u misunderstood
10:07 < bridge> <avolicious> > **Assume every server** that does not have **ddnet or race** in its **gametype** to be a **pvp** server.
10:09 < bridge> <avolicious> > it‚Äôs(Gores) basically ddnet servers with 2 extra features and different maps
10:09 < bridge> <avolicious> Is wrong aswell.
10:09 < bridge> <avolicious> 
10:09 < bridge> <avolicious> KoG is based on DDNets server implementation to have as much feature support as possible, but its not "basically ddnet". We are KoG, DDNet is DDNet üôÇ
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> right
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> different name = different product right
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
10:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Different gameplay?
10:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Different maps?
10:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Shared community obv.
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any chance we could hop on a call or something on the weekend? To progress some of the stale 3. Redirects, 0.7 client and #7777 (mod/fork support).
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller i like your patient approach
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?xd
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean im being to pushy ._.
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> No
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i would just quit
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> impossible to get real code past the wall of nits
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious oh rite kog renamed the gametype from DDrace to Gores right? Opsi forgot about that.
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont have a lot of respect for kog
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan the thing is i solved all nits for a while. I am just being ghosted at this point. Everything that was asked from me is done on all those 3 issues i care about the most right now. And it has been like that for weeks.
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i think if gores was a part of ddnet the donation funds from gores only players could go towards better servers for all and obviously it would be open source
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but then they wouldn't have an excuse for the weirdest website and accounts system right
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> he does this to me too
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i cannot consider serious contributions to ddnet at this point
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> because i know it would be a tremendous waste of time
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean i get it. If ppl open prs or issues on my fork or ask me to do anything actually my average response time is like 5 years.
10:41 < bridge> <Ewan> well you also can't step down as the only maintainer of your repos
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Thats why i am wondering what i could do to speed it up for the things i care about. 
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xz mentioned xd
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i can't find my keys
10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> keyboard? home door? crypto?
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> car and home
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> and mailbox
10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> F
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i was going to go enjoy this cancer stick and then go to bed
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> now i have to find keys
10:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> timezone moment
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> my life truly is a nightmare
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry i couldn't get your thing building chiller
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> did melon manage?
10:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think he did
10:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> don't be sorry thanks for testing
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt want you to debug it. I was just curious if it can be built flawlessly already.
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't typically start such things at 4 am or whatever it was
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was same time as now no?
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but a bit later
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a bit ye
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was almost dark xd
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> gray for me rn
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if your keys are lost you can crash at my place tonite uwun
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks chiller
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> np <3
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> though it's actually the opposite issue
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> im inside apartment but want to go to car
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just smoke inside 
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> that would probably give my mom a craving
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> also illegal
10:48 < bridge> <Ewan> or at least against terms of lease
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> im actually beginning to get worried
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> never lost them before
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ah i let my brother grab something out of the car and he left them on the coffee table
10:57 < bridge> <avolicious> The donations are mostly covered by me, lol.
10:58 < bridge> <avolicious> But you can still run your own Gores servers? Even ddnet has some maps on their servers
10:58 < bridge> <avolicious> As long as you dont name your servers "KoG", its all fine
10:58 < bridge> <cyberFighter> KoGay
10:59 < bridge> <cyberFighter> (stands for amazing... yep)
11:03 < bridge> <patiga> ^^ would be fun
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
11:11 < bridge> <sedonya> morning
11:22 < bridge> <syrinok> Good morning
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238422806358786078/IMG_5364.jpg?ex=663f3a9d&is=663de91d&hm=d9f068c38168fb73389ff5bb03b5a0babc8c684ce04e16b00a3f9f5da0994b30&
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> went for a little drive and i was humbled by the aura that this sign gave off
11:31 < bridge> <teero777> :kek:
11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i had to stop and take a photo
11:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> corpos not having a windows key is just hilarious :kek:
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> they‚Äôre actually a nonprofit
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> they host plays, museum attractions, and have classes and stuff
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon check out https://elv.sh/
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> for x [*.jpg] {
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>   gm convert $x (str:trim-suffix $x .jpg).png
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:18 < bridge> <teero777> this looks so cool :D
12:18 < bridge> <teero777> ima go learn elvish
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> paralel each
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub extern fn puts(x: *mut u8) -> i32;
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub fn main() -> i32 {
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>     let x: [u8; 4] = [104, 0, 0, 0];
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>     puts(&x as *mut u8);
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return 0;
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> edlang now supports arrays
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> fixed size*
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> this prints 'h' xD
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```llvm
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ; Function Attrs: nofree nounwind
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> declare !dbg !2 noundef i32 @puts(ptr nocapture noundef readonly) local_unnamed_addr #0
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ; Function Attrs: nofree nounwind

12:28 < bridge> <learath2> :Celebrate:
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> Did I ever ask you what the purpose of this project is and then forget it? It really looks like you are reinventing rust üòÑ
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep it looks like that
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just having fun doing my lang
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> and not a interpreted one, a truly optimized one (thanks to llvm)
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> becoming a llvm expert also opens lot of stuff for me xd
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> I was chatting with a friend a couple days ago, he was adamant no sane profit seeking entity would pay a developer to spend time making a less capable rust
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> it helps at my current job, and future opportunities
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i just like doing it
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats what my company is doing too
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> bah ill share it here, its this https://github.com/lambdaclass/concrete
12:30 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, he and I could not really come up with why a company would spend time and money making their own programming language
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say the ceo which is the cto actually likes tech and programming xD
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> he adopted rust early at 2015 too
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> we all know its a long term project its like a side project of the company we make as long as other stuff goes well
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz it doesnt give money
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> So it's more like for the lulz side project
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well he actually wants to use it
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> if it becomes something
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> and the features it has are specially aligned with that the company wants
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> Understandable. Though no way I can convince that friend of mine that people do things like this üòÑ
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> as long as  i get paid i wont say no to fun stuff
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> He has a very neoliberal understanding of business and economy. If any business entity is doing anything that has a chance of not generating profit he immediately calls it stupid
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> That's the spirit
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> concrete is made with MLIR, while i make edlang with LLVM IR
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i learn both worlds
12:35 < bridge> <learath2> Iirc mlir lies at a slightly higher level of abstraction, right?
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 he wants a rust with a erlang/elixir builtin runtime
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> MLIR is a IR of IRs
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> it compiles down to LLVM IR if u target llvm
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u can target other stuff
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> the more i work with llvm ir the more im astonished at how good llvm is at optimizing stuff, it feels magic
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/Hirrolot/datatype99
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> meat
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> LOL
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```c
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> int sum(const BinaryTree *tree) {
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki>     match(*tree) {
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki>         of(Leaf, x) return *x;
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki>         of(Node, lhs, x, rhs) return sum(*lhs) + *x + sum(*rhs);
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Invalid input (no such variant).
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return -1;
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> elvsh seems coo
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> k
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> god damn
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i just smoked some germans in fng
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and then ran 1 map with a drunk buddy who i havent seen in a while
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and now it's truly bedtime
12:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is this cursed
12:41 < bridge> <learath2> What language is this even? üòÑ
12:43 < bridge> <Ewan> seems awesome
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> C
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> macros
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> c99
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> why doing this
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> usw switch
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> and win
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> Is this achieved by macro magic?
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> I can't imagine this being valid any other way
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I don't like it very much, macros that break rules of the language makes code hard to read
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dunno bout elvsh i prefer bash somehow :D  
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``for x in *.jpg; do gm convert $x $(basename $x .jpg).png;done`` does look better to me :p 
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://mathoverflow.net/questions/470951/is-the-largest-root-of-a-random-polynomial-more-likely-to-be-real-than-complex
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato why macro? can't this be done by regular functions with side effects?
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm yea it passes in a struct name as argument ok maybe that needs a macro
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> failing on undefined variables can also be achieved in bash
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> setting `set -u` in the interactive shell seems like a good idea actually. Why have i never thought about that.
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/assets/20344300/b7f2f9b6-d627-4ef3-862c-849e51ac9c8f
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so far i dont see any benefit of this shell. Also it does not look posix compatible.
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> did u just paste that into an issue and copy it back LOL
13:09 < bridge> <Ewan> The update servers in parallel example seems awesome
13:09 < bridge> <Ewan> peach‚Ä¶
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i did Ewan :D I don't have my hotkeys on mac for screenshots xd
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i might retake my vim workflow with https://www.lazyvim.org
16:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> This is what made me switch from vscode to neovim https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim
16:47 < bridge> <gumbatw> Which variable stores the actual teamnumber of ur tee in `chat.cpp` and which value corresponds to team 0?
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if it stores it at all
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might just generate the text color directly
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. if the team dissolves it still must show the correct color
16:50 < bridge> <gumbatw> nah thats not true i think, if u write a msg in team 1 it will sghow red in global chat but will switch colors afterwards when uleave the team
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
16:51 < bridge> <gumbatw> but we are stuck in implmenting a streamer mode and want to check if people are in the same team (that works) but also make an execption if u are in team 0
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it will probably do it by the name of the person that wrote the msg
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tbh i am surprised it does so
16:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> highly recommend lazyvim, its made for dummies, setting up LSP and TS is a breeze, and its a goated tool with its flawless lazygit integration
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs if u don't add a new message to the chat, the chat always uses cached data
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye it looks goated
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> name? i'd assume it uses clientid
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so if team change would not generate a new msg, it would not update
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr do u know what key combo is for file search
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always had it in control-p
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> <leader> f
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> so for default its space f f
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats the default leader xd
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> space
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> XD
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `int m_TeamNumber;`
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also stores a teamnumber, but dunno how it's updated
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr this is goated
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> IKR
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i love it has notifications xd
16:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> HAHA
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> neovim is so pog
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> afaict it does never update it
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am on my macos
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> space f f is for the root dir
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> space f F is for current work directory
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> with vscode  i used 12gb
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> on a big project
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> space f b searches open buffers (files) 
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> It really is an amazing tool

17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats for alacritty or the terminal
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> neovim is a tui program
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i'm pretty sure eventloop was like 10ms only

17:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> any tmux enjoyer here who knows how i can detach a layout and keep it after restart?
17:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> say i have this layout:
17:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> i can ofc detach it and reattach with `tmux attach`
17:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> but it gets lost after restart, which is annoying because i have to set it up each time
17:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238516102829441154/image.png?ex=663f9181&is=663e4001&hm=357cd704b55fe8a4df81ab7b1adec1d4cd6413f5cec802fc39df8f9f7a33515e&

17:50 < bridge> <teero777> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43362709/is-there-a-simple-way-to-save-tmux-pane-position-and-size

17:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> i did and as i said, it just doesnt work correctly for some reason
17:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> maybe its just me
