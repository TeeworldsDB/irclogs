16:47 < o_be_one> hi all :)
17:35 <@deen> Oh, and another bug: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1359&p=13319 =/
18:12 <@EastByte> o_be_one: what do you mean with scoreboard?
18:30 < Learath2> eeeee: the emote selector doesnt work too well btw
18:41 <@EastByte> eeeee knows how to argue with matricks :)

18:49 < fstd_> TeeIRC: I like big butts
18:50 < TeeIRC> DoNe@84.38.65.222:8305: lol
18:50 < fstd_> TeeIRC:
18:51 < TeeIRC> DoNe@84.38.65.222:8305: hi hoffi on #ddnet!
18:51 < HoffiPL> hi ^.^
18:51 < fstd_> you're doing it wrong
18:53 < TeeIRC> hi_leute_gll@84.38.65.222:8305: roflcopter!
18:55 <@EastByte> TeeIRC: blubb
19:06 < Learath2> deen servers are quite laggy :/
19:24 <@deen> Learath2: GER or GER2? ping, routing? tried a traceroute to find the culprit?
19:24 <@deen> And you can always contact GER's hoster directly, nfoservers
19:26 < Nimda> From Death to Destiny by Åmol & fikmesån just released on Brutal at 2015-04-24 19:22
19:27 < Learath2> GER
19:27 < Learath2> seems to be for everyone on the server
19:29 <@deen> I have stable and nice 20, weird
19:32 < o_be_one> EastByte, score is used to show admin level on some bin servers, so i suggest to use it to show the state of power (jetpack, many jumps, etc)
19:32 < o_be_one> i think that we can edit team name too, why not
19:54 <@deen> sounds really hacky
20:00 <@EastByte> deen: playerflags bit 5,6,7 and 8 are in use now by random clients
20:01 <@EastByte> today I saw bit 8 the first time
20:02 <@EastByte> following some discussions all the these clients seem to be private botting clients
20:03 <@heinrich5991> ban them by this bit :D
20:06 < o_be_one> yes its a little hacky :/
20:06 < o_be_one> you are able to change GUI in DDNet client too, so why not using this ?
20:06 < o_be_one> some guys add maps and other things, you can add indicators so
20:08 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: would be a better idea to wait until the developers are bored
20:08 <@EastByte> then we can take them out
20:09 <@EastByte> btw. 'hacky', what actually is not hacky in ddrace/ddnet?
20:09 <@deen> haha
20:13 <@EastByte> eeeee, deen: now, since the webclient is pretty usable we could start working on a livestream
20:14 <@EastByte> we could make the server dump all snapshots into a stream which is distributable via http
20:15 <@EastByte> + a little bit cdn and it's fine
20:16 <@EastByte> and we should encourage the community to make more novice/moderate non-dummy maps
20:16 <@EastByte> so we can actually stream something
20:16 <@EastByte> tournament maps*
20:18 <@deen> well, brutal maps have the most viewers actually
20:18 <@deen> novice and moderate are played more instead
20:19 <@EastByte> oh, well
22:36 < eeeee> yeah good idea EastByte 
22:36 < eeeee> there are many approaches for this though, we have to carefully select the best one
22:38 < eeeee> Learath2: i have some stutter in firefox on my overpowered gaming computer, are you also using firefox?
22:39 < eeeee> sorry i'm not very responsive right now, i've actually caught a cold and spend most of my day sleeping
22:41 <@EastByte> oh, get well soon then :)
22:41 <@EastByte> btw. in an hour I'm 20 years old :)
22:42 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I hope you are older then me :P
22:42 <@EastByte> argh I hurts to type this number
22:43 <@EastByte> it*
22:52 < eeeee> thats not old at all, can't even drink alcohol in 'murica
22:55 <@EastByte> pff murrica
23:07 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: why does that matter?
23:14 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: you seem to be born in 1995 aswell, doesn't really matter though^^
23:29 < Learath2> eeeee: tried firefox and chrome firefox is sttutering alot 
23:29 < Learath2> but chrome only stutters like for a second then goes away and like 30 seconds later again 1 second
23:37 < eeeee> yeah i dunno why firefox does that. i guess someone just has to go and update the tw opengl codez, make it use shaders and shit instead of fixed function pipeline
23:37 < eeeee> i feel like that would solve most issues
23:47 <@deen> but that's modern opengl and then you lose compatibility to older systems
23:47 <@deen> or not?
