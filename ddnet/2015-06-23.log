00:54 < Savander> or it's good?:D
01:15 < Ryozuki> hohoho
01:15 < Ryozuki> hi
02:44 <@deen> hi bye ryozuki
11:39 <@EastByte> aaaand failed again
11:45 <@deen> EastByte: ^^
11:46 <@deen> I just prepared all ddmax map releases
11:46 <@deen> 22 days of releases and we're done
11:46 <@EastByte> hurraay
11:46 <@deen> ^^
11:46 <@EastByte> no more ddmax :D
11:46 <@deen> what do you mean?
11:46 <@EastByte> it was a joke
11:47 <@EastByte> I don't invest enough time finishing the ddmax maps I guess
12:07 < Nimda> HearTcross by BooNi just released on Ddmax at 2015-06-23 12:04
12:07 < Nimda> Hook Fever by Tsin just released on Ddmax at 2015-06-23 12:04
12:07 < Nimda> Hell 1 V2 by Knight :3 just released on Ddmax at 2015-06-23 12:04
12:07 < Nimda> HeyYa by Saavik just released on Ddmax at 2015-06-23 12:04
12:07 < Nimda> Heroic by H'ero* just released on Ddmax at 2015-06-23 12:04
13:21 <@deen> Just got the offer to host xPanic for money
13:21 <@deen> they get ddosed by the hoster of zPanic
13:21 <@deen> but I wouldn't want to host that, because you can buy stuff ingame
13:22 <@deen> that makes it a great target for ddos attacks and I'm against that kind of stuff by principle
13:26 <@deen> which is pretty unfortunate, because people have asked me to host a zesc/infection/xpanic mod
13:40 <@EastByte> hm I never played these mods
15:40 <@deen> huh, i think YT doesn't like the video i just uploaded
15:40 <@deen> "Processing: 2815 minutes remaining"
15:40 <@deen> I guess I'll check back in 2 days^^
15:40 <@EastByte> haha
15:44 <@EastByte> deen: let's say you want to structure a nim project into folders, how do you import modules from parent directorys?
15:45 <@deen> import ../foo
15:45 <@EastByte> ah works
15:46 <@EastByte> though I think it's ugly
15:46 < o_be_one> hello :)
15:46 <@EastByte> hi o_be_one 
15:46 < o_be_one> what's new ?
15:47 <@EastByte> deen: does nim have parameters for import directories?
15:50 <@EastByte> o_be_one: eeeee figured out an ip spoof protection with vanilla support
15:51 <@deen> EastByte: you could add the other dirs to the path
15:52 <@deen> EastByte: i don't understand "parameters for import directories"
15:52 <@EastByte> like -I for include directories in gcc
15:52 <@EastByte> but the path should work
15:53 <@deen> yes: https://github.com/3dicc/Urhonimo/blob/master/examples/nim.cfg#L4-L19
15:54 <@EastByte> oh is nim.cfg automatically handled?
15:54 <@deen> yes
15:54 <@EastByte> cool
15:54 <@deen> used for project wide settings
15:55 <@deen> you can also make a foo.nim.cfg just for foo.nim
15:55 <@EastByte> oh nice
15:55 <@deen> (I think)
15:58 < o_be_one> EastByte: oh that's nice :o !
15:59 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
15:59 <@EastByte> unfourtunatly there weren't many of these attacks so we won't see any difference^^
16:00 <@deen> don't say "unfortunately there weren't many attacks" :P
16:00 <@EastByte> I'm talking about stuff like slot flooding
16:00 <@EastByte> lame ddosing has been there since ever
16:01 <@EastByte> you could probably fill all slots of the entire serverlist at once
16:03 < o_be_one> hey deen :)
16:07 <@deen> So I accidentally removed the planned map release for today from my list and can't remember what map it was, shit^^ http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1474&p=14539#p14539
16:08 <@EastByte> :P
16:09 < Savander> "Jaw'Eld"
16:09 <@deen> oh well, now my YT video is 95% processed
16:10 <@deen> Savander: your map?^^
16:10 <@EastByte> man there are so many maps
16:10 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, i want a selection of ddnet's top 10% of maps
16:10 <@deen> for the people who don't play 10 maps a day
16:10 <@EastByte> ^^
16:10 <@deen> back when ddmax was alive we only released the best maps and told the rest to go to ddmax because they released everything
16:11 <@deen> can't do that anymore
16:11 <@deen> Savander: I think it wasn't Jaw'Eld and you're just trying to trick me into releasing your map :P
16:12 <@EastByte> evil Savander 
16:14 <@deen> maybe i just misremember and there always was a hole, I'll just move up the other maps^^
16:17 < Savander> deen,  not true!
16:17 < Savander> it was my map, trust me!
16:18 < Savander> ^^>
18:03 < Savander> soo when ?:>>
18:04 <@deen> when it's doneâ„¢
18:05 <@EastByte> in the future
18:06 <@EastByte> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ecPRYIkuaM
18:07 < Nimda> NightSky by Zaiross just released on Moderate at 2015-06-23 18:05
18:09 < Savander> it's done
18:09 < Savander> but anyone want to test ! :CCCC
18:09 < Savander> im sad.
18:09 < Savander> xd
18:29 <@deen> yeah, we need more testers
18:39 <@EastByte> deen: any idea how to clean up all the binaries produced by nim?
18:40 <@EastByte> I have one binary per source file
18:41 <@EastByte> man, sometimes I hate the fact that *nix binaries don't have a file extension
18:47 <@deen> yep^^
18:47 <@deen> that's the annoying part
18:47 <@deen> you should say that in the #nim channel, araq will be happy
18:48 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/rdqvb5sn8911 don't like these kind of people..
18:52 <@deen> Savander: talked to him
18:53 < Savander> ;)
19:01 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/f0ZvY6a19006
19:01 < Savander> wtf
19:01 < Savander> xD
19:24 < Learath2> tried to open up a laptop
19:25 < Learath2> huge failure couldnt even get it open :D
19:25 <@deen> haha
19:55 < Learath2> in my attempt to open it i broke the only button i need on it and thats the button to enter bios :/
19:58 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:58 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 569
19:58 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:01 <@deen> great, avidemux can't cut 60fps videos
20:06 <@deen> seems to fuck up the video-audio sync
20:18 <@EastByte> Out of Castle is such an undoable map
20:18 <@EastByte> oh undoable means fixable
20:35 < Learath2> finally opened and closed it 
20:35 < Learath2> tip: dont be gentle
20:36 <@EastByte> huh?
20:36 < Learath2> was trying to open up a laptop
20:37 <@EastByte> oh that's interesting
20:38 < Learath2> half the keyboard wasnt working and touchpad was broken
20:38 < Learath2> both turn out to be unseated ribbons
22:27 <@EastByte> deen: have you read the conversation on #teeworlds ?
22:28 <@deen> no
22:28 <@EastByte> about rust
22:29 <@EastByte> "also, I wonder how much `unsafe` code is ethical", kinda reminds me of my work with nim
22:30 <@deen> heh
23:21 <@deen> Finally video conversion worked: Another of my favorite games: https://youtu.be/ook8ZDwMQNc
23:22 <@deen> maybe i should put it on ddnet.tw
