11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Can someone enlighten me on the current state of envelopes and sound sync?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Still waiting for progress on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1610
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> At some point using synchronize on envelopes was not tied to the game time anymore. Which broke makes that made use of that -.-
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Now I wonder how do i properly sync or start envelopes? And how does one add syned audio to an envelope?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know the state and how to get it fixed, never really looked into this
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do you happen to know the reason it got changed?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it used to work fine as in vanilla
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i thought maybe something related to qshars moving tiles or the new timer not sure
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not movingt tiles
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just found this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/479
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i did not read it all
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but did he complain about envelopes resetting on start line? that can be fixed by toggeling the sync button and that used to work fine in vanilla and ddnet forver?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah its a closed non implemented issue i see
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats not what broke it
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> so they could add PTUM support
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/601
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> seems like the branch disappeared

13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> raw in game footage. No video or audio edit xd
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> just had to `reload` the server 10 times to get it in sync \:D
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes 20min download time for the map lmao
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> lmao
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> yoyoyo I have a problem, I have implemented a protocol (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/322) because the number of players were wrong in the server list, so now its good (the number of players is displayed correctly) but i can't connect on the server (it says "flushed connection due to timeout. 1 chunks." in the terminal). any idea? my src : https://github.com/NouaaTW/teeworlds-BW/tree/vanilla-proto
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagih> hi dont you think ddnet new update should consider new silders
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagih> like for sound for example its hard to get exact number and old is ugly
