00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> hi developers
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hi lola
04:43 <+jxsl13> why is ddnet on mac so buggy :C
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not many users/dev using mac
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @noby
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i still use ddnet 10062
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it seems to be the least buggy version of ddnet for mac
11:26 <+Learath2> I have a mac now, but I don't have any time to do anything anymore :P
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Its the curse of all MAC laptops.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> laziness comes in one package with MAC
11:32 <+Learath2> quite the opposite for me, I'd been coding 8 hours non-stop before I went to sleep last night
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> true mac is pure productivity booster
13:11 <+Learath2> not because of the mac, but because I got the mac for work, the mac is currently being used as a ios simulator :P
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mac is nice because it runs fine and i have much less trouble there than on other oses
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good morning
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone familiar with react and can explain this joke? https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29571277_10160200273625716_4898952769515576229_n.png
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just woke up
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 a server crashed
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we were playing tropical island i think
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we cant find the server in the list again
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 30 min race :(
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u can check logs
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idont remember the port tho
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which server? GER?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can teehistorian be used to restore playing sessions for poor tees affected by server crashes?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically yes, practically, no one has written such a tool
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> would be cool c:
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't even thought of that yet
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but how to do it
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with saves?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but how does the right tee get the password
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does it even work without accounts
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it would work with timeout codes
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> timeout codes could be used
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> aww that would be fgreat
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 yes ger
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 "Bad URL date param" doesn't sound like a good joke anyway
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably fb doesn't want you to link to their images directly
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably just need to spend more time getting the actual link
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/928808041587314689
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The joke seems to be "bloat"
17:35 <+Learath2> the joke is most definitely bloat, especially in the boilerplate department
18:09 <+jxsl13> how do I check, if between two players are some collision blocks?
18:11 <+jxsl13> server side
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh that would be great to know .O
18:27 <+Learath2> `CCollision::IntersectLine` ought to be useful
18:36 <+jxsl13> int CCollision::IntersectLine(vec2 Pos0, vec2 Pos1, vec2 *pOutCollision, vec2 *pOutBeforeCollision)
18:36 <+jxsl13> what are these two last inputs supposed to do :O? and what doe sthis exactly return on success?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check where this function is used in code
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best way to learn how it works
18:38 <+jxsl13> NULL ...
18:38 <+jxsl13> nice inputs xD
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it is a output
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a pointer
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pass a vector and it guets filled
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats my bet
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess it tells u where it collides
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it does so
18:39 <+jxsl13> there are other usages as well
18:39 <+jxsl13> but first thing I saw, was both being null x)
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read what i said ! :D
18:40 <+jxsl13> what?
18:40 <+jxsl13> x)
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the last 2 parameters, is where the line intersects
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hue?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can python tell me that a funktion is not defined when i call it in a script but it works when i call it from the python interpreter
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/zQ43L/4cd3839748.png
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my script crashed because it said ``GetPlayerByName()`` is not defined in save_stats.py but when i launch ``$>python3``
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can:
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> >>> from save_stats import *
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> >>> GetPlayerByName("uadu")
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> without getting an error
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hoiw is this even possible?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have files that import cross-reference each other?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the functiosn that arent working are in player.py
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a thing that can be problematic
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> google that problem
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and player.py also imports save_stats.py
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh fuk
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and save_stats improts player?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> python sux lol .-.
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> yo guys could someone help me with a problem of a friend?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> A friend of him has a problem with his keyboard after his sister played some games at his computer, some keys aren't working anymore but the keyboard language is still the same
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> she probably raged too hard
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hardware can die
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> some keys aren't working or in a wrong way
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Xen you could try downloading a program that shows you the key presses you do
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in a wrong way? o.O
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wtf did he tried to ask his sis what she did?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> windows button -> computer shutdown
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> nope
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> she doesn't even knew what she did
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how old is she?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> 8
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> her sister is 8
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh then its probably body liquid
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would buy a new keyboard i dont think you can safe it from the software side if a lill girl attacked the keyboard
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> she tested already another one
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> she? xd
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> yes....2girls
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> i know
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> Check keyboard layout
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im confused
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> @cinaera which layout, that you can change at taskbar?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> @cinaera which layout, that one that you can change at taskbar?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> nvm
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Xen with another keyboard, it's the same?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> yes
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it's likely a software problem ^^
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/zQ5x8/6db1eba6a7.jpg
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> Possible, else check the system settings, or check for running processes or might be some accessibility feature
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> ok I will tell her that
