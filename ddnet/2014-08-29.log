00:01 < Savander> laxa
00:01 < Savander> want see smth?
00:01 < laxa> Why not but I am playing right now.
00:02 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/
00:02 < Savander> look
00:02 < Savander> :D
00:02 < Savander> not finished ye. but :P :D
00:02 < Savander> ty for status !:3
00:02 < laxa> nice
00:03 < Savander> one thing not works
00:03 < Savander> on this vps wtf
00:03 < Savander> ;D
00:03 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/9UQk0B6y
00:03 < Savander> xD
00:07 <@deen> laxa: can players even play it when it's on greenlight?
00:07 < laxa> I have no clue
00:08 < laxa> I think so
00:09 < _KinG> deen: password for block server doesn't work
00:10 <@deen> fixed
00:10 < _KinG> tnx
00:10 < laxa> deen: how people could vote if they can't play ?
00:10 < Savander> yaay
00:10 < Savander> all works
00:12 <@deen> laxa: looking at images and videos
00:12 <@deen> and a textual description
00:12 <@deen> laxa: i read the info page and they said to upload those, but not the game itself
00:12 <@deen> because usually the game is not finished when you greenlight it
00:13 < laxa> Hum, seems a bit gay...
00:21 < Savander> laxa: , now
00:21 < Savander> your status
00:21 < Savander> looks much better
00:21 < Savander> :D
00:21 < laxa> Is the framework working with 64 players ?
00:22 < laxa> Cause I have no clue if it does
00:22 < laxa> But text is wrong anyway.
00:23 < laxa> deen: if you put ddnet on greenlight, it would be nice to have streamers, don't you think ?
00:23 < laxa> you could stream your spectator mods...
00:23 < laxa> Sadly, I don't have the fiber, otherwise I would be glad to stream.
00:24 < Savander> laxa
00:24 < Savander> what?
00:24 < Savander> "text is wrong anyway"
00:24 < Savander> ?
00:24 < laxa> 0/16
00:24 < laxa> on 64 players server
00:25 < Savander> its
00:25 < Savander> your script
00:25 < laxa> No
00:25 < Savander> yes
00:25 < laxa> It's not mine.
00:25 < Savander> :D
00:25 < Savander> its your
00:25 < Savander> i only include it
00:25 < laxa> I gave it to you, it's open source script
00:25 < Savander> to my website
00:25 < laxa> Well
00:25 < Savander> ok
00:25 < Savander> but from you
00:25 < Savander> better?
00:25 < laxa> I am telling you, that I don't know if it works on 64 players server
00:25 < Savander> it's not
00:25 < laxa> better what oO ?
00:25 < Savander> i'll add it tomorrow
00:26 < Savander> maybe ;d
00:26 <@deen> laxa: yes, it would be nice to have streamers. but every time we had a stream servers were attacked
00:27 < laxa> and if we gain much players, I am ready to upgrade my server to be able to host some DDnet FRA xD
00:27 < laxa> then it would make sense
00:30 < laxa> deen: something's weird.
00:30 < laxa> deen: ddnet.tw:8305 went down, no restart.
00:30 < laxa> Well now it works again, guess it's ddos or something
00:30 <@deen> doesn't look down
00:31 <@deen> players are playing there
00:31 < laxa> well, I just had a CP
00:31 <@deen> and noone said anything about cp or lag
00:31 < laxa> and everyplayers on it seems to have timeouted
00:31 <@deen> maybe first check if the problem is local before reporting it to me
00:32 <@deen> laxa: is your name laxa?
00:32 <@deen> you were never on the server
00:32 < laxa> It's not local
00:32 < laxa> Everyone timeouted
00:32 <@deen> laxa: ddnet.tw:8305?
00:32 < laxa> I was in spec, so no timeout protection for me
00:32 < laxa> yeah
00:32 <@deen> no
00:32 <@deen> noone timed out, people are still playing
00:32 <@deen> and you were never on the server
00:32 < laxa> on RUS
00:33 <@deen> ddnet rus does that all the time
00:33 <@deen> and i don't know why
00:39 <@deen> made a support ticket, doubt it will do any good
00:40 <@deen> except that i get 50 russian spam mails from them again
00:43 < laxa> xD
00:44 < laxa> deen: open a dontation account on paypal and put a link on the website.
00:44 <@deen> i would never notice if they write me anything important, because it's always in russian
00:44 <@deen> laxa: we had that before and noone donated
00:44 < laxa> I will.
00:44 <@deen> same for the t-shirt shop where many said they would buy something and 0 people bought^^
00:45 <@deen> and donations for what?
00:45 < laxa> for server ?!
00:45 <@deen> no
00:45 < laxa> and to pay greenlight shit
00:46 <@deen> I'd rather get people to test maps so I have time for something else instead of donations
00:47 < laxa> Do you work deen ?
00:47 <@deen> in what way?
00:47 < laxa> Well, how do you pay for all those servers ?
00:48 <@deen> i hold the exercises for a class at university
00:48 <@deen> i guess that counts as work
00:49 <@deen> and i don't pay them all
00:49 < laxa> you pay china / rus / ger / south africa ?
00:49 <@deen> rus, ger, chile
00:49 < laxa> and you have to live too
00:49 < laxa> so you must have a pay / revenue
00:51 <@deen> also paypal sucks, they take too much of each donation
00:51 < laxa> give me your IBAN then !
00:52 <@deen> i don't know why you want to donate
00:52 < laxa> to help pay the servers ?
00:52 <@deen> not needed, i can pay them myself
00:52 <@deen> better pay for the persian server
00:53 <@deen> but i haven't found a good way of getting money into Iran yet
00:54 < laxa> No idea for that lol.
00:54 < laxa> They don't accept paypal in Iran ?
00:54 <@deen> i don't think american companies are allowed to do business with Iranians
00:55 < laxa> They don't take bank prelevement ?
00:55 <@deen> maybe _KinG nows
00:55 <@deen> no idea!
00:55 <@deen> i couldn't find a way to pay for Iranian servers myself
00:55 < _KinG> what?
00:55 <@deen> _KinG: how to get money to iran?
00:55 <@deen> but first we have to get the persian server popular anyway
00:56 < _KinG> not sure but i'm gonna run a website that changes money to all currencies in the world
00:56 < _KinG> but there are ways
00:57 < _KinG> deen: when chicken had servers all players were playing there but now ..
00:57 < laxa> deen: so you win money just by holding exercies in a class at university ?
00:57 < laxa> don't you do research ?
01:00 <@deen> _KinG: yeah, then it was the only persian server
01:00 <@deen> now everyone is used to Persian Pro
01:01 <@deen> laxa: i did research, but not for money
01:01 < _KinG> but it's bullshit
01:01 <@deen> laxa: and now I'm writing my masters thesis, but also no money
01:01 < _KinG> this is ddent
01:01 < _KinG> that is normal server
01:01 < laxa> I guess you don't earn that much from university...
01:01 < _KinG> nobs can't understand the diffrence
01:01 < laxa> Your parents help you ?
01:01 <@deen> laxa: no
01:01 < laxa> How come you are at home everyday xD ?
01:02 <@deen> classes haven't started
01:03 < laxa> Ah yeah, stupid me xD.
01:03 < laxa> Well, it was fun, but have to sleep for the last day of work of the week.
01:03 <@deen> good night
01:03 < laxa> Danke schÃ¶n, aufwiedersehn !
01:03 < laxa> Gute nacht, viel spass.
01:26 <@deen> I was thinking about switching the european ddnet server to OVH/kimsufi, since they seem to have one of the only serious ddos protections
01:26 <@deen> but lots of people report that it doesn't work at all
01:36 < _KinG> deen: i got many programs for ddos but they are fake all uses udp packages can u tell me how does ddos works?
01:37 <@deen> _KinG: the attacker has a botnet, he tells the botnet to send fake udp requests (dns / ntp) to public dns / ntp servers. The servers fake the ip address to be that of the attacked server. Then the dns/ntp servers respond (a big answer) to the faked server, sending it so much traffic that it gets overloaded or the network is overloaded.
01:38 < _KinG> the program i have just pings the server can be easily protected against it ^^
01:38 <@deen> there are many other kinds of attacks, but that is the one we get on ddnet mostly
01:39 <@deen> and a nice picture: http://nsfocusblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/dns-amp-pic-21.png
01:41 < _KinG> deen: i think i can make a program to do somthing like ddos but not to use it on a vps it's really hard to explain 
01:41 <@deen> _KinG: stop doing ddos attacks!
01:42 < _KinG> i don't have any vps to do that and i don't have a real ddos program ^^
01:42 < _KinG> my program just pings
01:42 < _KinG> :|
01:43 < _KinG> look the program i want to make gonna be on the server (victim) and it actually attacks 127.0.0.1 local host so all the trrafic is gonna be over loaded somehow but we should find a way to inject it into victim xD
01:44 < _KinG> i don't actually know how to make it but this is the plan
01:44 <@deen> _KinG: stop attacking servers...
01:44 < _KinG> i don't deen  xD
01:45 < _KinG> but deen when u see the ddmax attacks you on each tournoment how can u just stay and watch?
01:47 <@deen> yes
01:48 <@deen> i would rather stop ddnet than fight back
01:51 <@deen> ok, the OVH/kimsufi servers do get a lot of laggs, should stop considering them
01:54 < _KinG> seriously?laggs on non iranian servers?
01:55 <@deen> ^^
01:55 < _KinG> the server we got is the best of iran but still laggs sometime ^^
02:02 <@deen> even the expensive ddos protection i can find only withstands 700 mbit/s udp traffic, nowhere near the > 10 gbit/s we get
02:18 < _KinG> deen: have u tried speeking with ddmax? ^^
02:18 <@deen> _KinG: why?
02:18 < _KinG> to don't ddos
02:18 <@deen> i don't think they ddos
02:18 < _KinG> but they are the only one like ddnet and i think they don't like ddnet much
02:29 <@deen> ask laxa, he is a ddmax admin :P
02:31 < _KinG> so they are not the attackers ...
02:32 < _KinG> deen: how much is your download speed?
02:32 <@deen> at home?
02:32 <@deen> or on ddnet GER?
02:33 < _KinG> home
02:33 < _KinG> and german vps
02:33 <@deen> home 50 mbit/s
02:33 <@deen> GER 10 gbit/s
02:33 < _KinG> the download speed you get?
02:33 <@deen> yes
02:34 < _KinG> so you download about 5 MB/sec?
02:34 <@deen> 6
02:34 < _KinG> good :|
02:34 < _KinG> i download only 200KB/sec
02:34 <@deen> =/
02:35 < _KinG> takes time for iran to get better internet
02:35 < _KinG> the best ISP gives 4MB/sec download speed and that's so expensive
02:45 < _KinG> deen: do you have a steam account?
02:45 <@deen> no
02:45 < _KinG> owkay
02:45 <@deen> i don't play games except ddrace
02:45 < _KinG> me too since i play tee
02:49 < _KinG> deen: i suggest you to start watching "Extant" it's one of the best tv series i've ever seen 
02:50 <@deen> sounds weird
02:51 < _KinG> i'm downloading E 9 and 10 forom season 1
02:55 < _KinG> downlaod finished i'm gonna watch ^^
03:06 <@deen> have fun
07:30 < _KinG> deen: 
07:30 < _KinG> deen: WE ARE UNDER DDOS
07:30 < _KinG> server is fine pings are good but timeouts from server and look at network usage
07:53 < laxa> _KinG: bad news, deen is sleeping and won't come back before 11 AM I think.
07:53 < _KinG> yep
07:53 < _KinG> laxa: i'm at ts
07:53 < laxa> They are quite stupid to ddos now.
07:54 < laxa> Well I just woke up and I'll go to work, I won't come to talk lol
07:55 < _KinG> okay
09:35 < EastByte> I hate the timing/hooking differences on each server
09:36 < EastByte> on my server I can easily fall down slowly with a dummy
09:36 < EastByte> on this server its' impossible
09:39 < Chicken_> Hi @deen as you know Persian Pro DDrace are using ddnet servers, the version is 4.8.1, I was spectating some guys racing,and suddenly a server message: Said player Chicken timed out he would reconnect and ... but I was still in the server I mean I could spectate I could move, but I couldn't chat and couldn't see other players chat, and the most strange thing was that I saw some players chat mixed, like GoJE GrEEN !: Ali: Hello, but there was no Ali in the ser
09:39 < Chicken_> And Also he didn't even say that
09:40 < Chicken_> I tried to save a demo of this, but the demo didn't save I think because I was time out or smth I don't know exactly what happened
09:47 < EastByte> ofcourse, rocketfly is a lot of easier with strong hook -.
10:07 < laxa_work> EastByte: you can /spec to change strong/weak on rocketfly.
10:07 < EastByte> which kind of spec is that?
10:07 < EastByte> disappear?
10:07 < laxa_work> On ddnet yes.
10:08 < laxa_work> Not on standart servers.
10:08 < EastByte> but ddnet doesn't allow that
10:08 < EastByte> otherwis yes would work
10:08 < laxa_work> On few maps where it's needed to switch strong/weak you can.
10:08 < EastByte> I just /saved and restarted
10:08 < EastByte> ah
10:08 < laxa_work> deen said like there are 17 maps out of 500+ where you can use /spec
10:09 < laxa_work> rocketfly 2 at least is one of them, not sure for rocketfly1
10:09 < EastByte> deen: consider for hookrace: no difference in hook strengths or benefits in physics
10:11 < laxa_work> strong/weak hook is from vanilla too
10:11 < EastByte> sure it is
10:11 < laxa_work> apparently you would need a total rework of the physic to fix it.
10:11 < EastByte> but there nobody notices it xd
10:11 < EastByte> nah, I saw the fix
10:11 < laxa_work> Oh really ?
10:11 < EastByte> yes
10:12 < laxa_work> Hum ok
10:12 < laxa_work> Anyway, ddrace needs strong/weak
10:12 < EastByte> it's all about the order of character core handling
10:12 < EastByte> and can be fixed by post handling or whatsoever
10:12 < EastByte> well maybe
10:13 < EastByte> but I hate it, since all the timing changes
10:13 < EastByte> suddenly you are a noob
10:14 < laxa_work> Lulz.
10:14 < EastByte> atleast it feels like that for me
10:15 < laxa_work> It doesn't for me.
10:16 < EastByte> for example the second part in purple panic
10:16 < EastByte> with strong hook the wall through hammer is the easiest thing
10:16 < EastByte> but with weak hook I fail like a noob
10:17 < laxa_work> I don't feel like it matters for those kind of thing.
11:11 < Savander> YoooÅ‚
11:21 < Savander> someone said: DDmax attacks ddnet
11:21 < Savander> no :O
11:21 < Savander> who?
11:21 < Savander> noother?
11:22 < Savander> only noother has server...
11:22 < laxa_work> I highly doubt noother would attack anyone.
11:22 < laxa_work> But maybe Tsin is behind some attacks
11:22 < Savander> yes
11:22 < Savander> no
11:22 < laxa_work> Even ddmax was attacked.
11:22 < laxa_work> And ddmax might close if they are attacked again.
11:23 < Savander> Often talk with Tsin..
11:23 < Savander> yes, ofc
11:23 < Savander> because its on
11:23 < Savander> company servers
11:23 < Savander> you know
11:23 < laxa_work> Yup.
11:23 < Savander> and its not tsin
11:23 < Savander> because
11:23 < Savander> when ddnet had attacks
11:24 < Savander> Tsin had no computer
11:24 < Savander> :P
11:26 < laxa_work> Savander: your max players online is broken.
11:26 < Savander> i aww
11:26 < Savander> i see
11:26 < Savander> but don't know why
11:31 < EastByte> I hate it
11:32 < EastByte> I figured out why long rocketfly parts are really hard
11:32 < EastByte> after about 10 seconds my mouse goes to the border of my mousepad
11:32 < EastByte> and I can't move it up again
11:32 < EastByte> because I fail then
11:33 < EastByte> srsly
11:33 < laxa_work> Buy new mousepad then.
11:33 < EastByte> that's not the right solution
11:33 < EastByte> my mouse sens already is extremly high and my mousepad big enough for everything
11:33 < EastByte> but why do I always keep moving down
11:34 < laxa_work> Then you don't control your mouse like you should I guess.
11:34 < EastByte> ya
11:36 < Savander> laxa
11:36 < Savander> look at ddforce status
11:36 < Savander> ;]
11:40 < Savander> i have a question
11:40 < Savander> how to check
11:40 < Savander> max packet size?
11:40 < Savander> or smthlike that
11:40 < EastByte> max packetsize of what?
11:41 < Savander> its from TwRequest
11:41 < Savander> size = header_size + max_servers_per_packet * server_size = 14 + 75 * 18 = 1364
11:41 < Savander> to server 0.6.1
11:41 < Savander> but 16p
11:41 < Savander> where it came from?
11:44 < EastByte> when using udp there is a recommended max packet size
11:44 < EastByte> at about 1000-1500
11:44 < EastByte> or so
11:44 < EastByte> the serversize is 18 because it has an ipv6 (16 bytes) and port (2 bytes) in it
11:45 < Savander> ah, ok
11:45 < Savander> so, for ddrace64p
11:45 < Savander> it same value?
11:45 < Savander> 1364
11:46 < EastByte> you are currently talking about the master server response
11:46 < Savander> WOW< rly?
11:46 < EastByte> 16pl or 64pl makes no difference
11:46 < Savander> ah ok
11:46 < EastByte> it's just the ip
11:52 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/#tab4
11:52 < Savander> yay
11:52 < Savander> 64p works
11:52 < Savander> xD
11:54 < Savander> thanks for explain
12:12 <@deen> Chicken_: I know about that bug in 4.8.1, it's long fixed in 4.8.4
12:13 <@deen> EastByte: the fix for strong/weak is pretty bad. i added it to ddnet (and made ddrace specific fixes) and stuff like hammerfly doesn't work properly anymore. all pros complained
12:13 <@deen> Savander: you don't need a server for a ddos attack, just 5 â‚¬
12:14 < Savander> i saiid
12:14 < Savander> tsin had no computer
12:14 < Savander> When were attacks.
12:15 <@deen> Savander: i know it wasn't ddmax
12:15 < Savander> ye, it wasnt....
12:15 < Savander> im from ddmax too, but i have nothing to you and to DDNEt (im newmeh)
12:16 < Savander> and i know, it wasn't ddmax.. don't like if someone telling nonsense..
12:24 < Chicken_> Ok fine @deen
12:36 <@deen> Chicken_: Any idea why players play on Persian Pro instead of DDNet Persian?
12:44 <@deen> Is it just because they always played there?
12:45 <@deen> Or can we improve anything on DDNet Persian?
12:47 < Savander> wtf
12:47 < Savander> 120 ping on Persian Pro
12:48 < Savander> compared to ddnet, 220 ping
12:56 < Savander> deen: how player is killed when he used save or load?
12:56 <@deen> i don't know
13:18 < CookieMichal> @Savander fix font on ur website
13:19 < CookieMichal> and enable unicode or smth
13:20 < Savander> CO jest nie tak
13:20 < Savander> jest charset UTF-8 :OO
14:06 < laxa_work> deen: how is it going for the stream greenlight
14:08 < laxa_work> deen: http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/faq/
14:08 < laxa_work> don't know if you have read this
14:08 < laxa_work> I think you don't need to buy a game, just own one
14:08 < laxa_work> Take dota 2 for example cause it's free
15:20 < CookieMichal> I like Chicken_ :3
15:21 < CookieMichal> KFC om nom nom
15:21 < Chicken_> I like Cookies
15:21 < CookieMichal> :o
15:23 < Chicken_> yes?
15:24 < CookieMichal> Noone said anything, Chicken_
15:24 < Chicken_> You said Chicken xD
15:25 < CookieMichal> I like Chicken_ from KFC
15:26 < Chicken_> I think you CookieMichal
15:29 < CookieMichal> EastByte: Woah HTTPS :o
15:30 < EastByte> WOAHH
15:30 < EastByte> I take a shower
16:14 < ddnet> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/NI_7lQ
16:14 < ddnet> ddnet/DDRace64 2df6034 def: By default don't show demo speed
16:14 < ddnet> ddnet/DDRace64 489349d def: Use Ã— instead of x to indicate speed in demo player
16:14 < ddnet> ddnet/DDRace64 45a5f65 def: Add demo speed setting in menu
16:16 < EastByte> deen: lol didn't notice the unicode x
16:16 < EastByte> I think I copied that from demo player interface
16:17 < EastByte> oh wait
16:18 < EastByte> you changed it to the unicode x
16:18 < EastByte> what's wrong with the normal x?
16:20 < CookieMichal> it's letter
16:20 < CookieMichal> × is multipilierlier
16:20 < EastByte> xd
16:21 < CookieMichal> I hate that word
16:21 < EastByte> hm I see no difference in my charset
16:21 < EastByte> but yes it is
16:21 < CookieMichal> Multiplier *

18:18 < Sav> Hi
18:18 <@deen> hi
18:19 <@deen> afk
19:10 < ddnet> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #26: client fifo (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/GZ9Tog
19:30 < Savander> for what client fifo?;oo
19:30 <@deen> you can send any commands to it
19:30 < Savander> "to it"? to server?
19:30 < Savander> from client to server?
19:30 <@deen> no, to the fifo
19:30 <@deen> and the client then does that
19:30 < Savander> but
19:30 <@deen> like "say hi"
19:30 <@deen> or change tee skin
19:31 < Savander> okay, but you can do it manualu, its only one client
19:31 < Savander> no 120 servers
19:31 < Savander> xD
19:31 <@deen> sure, but what if you want to change color ever 30 seconds?
19:31 <@deen> ^^
19:31 < Savander> don't know
19:31 <@deen> or say hi whenever someone joins
19:31 < Savander> possible with this?
19:31 <@deen> yes
19:31 < Savander> it's possible
19:31 <@deen> you can just write an external script now, easily
19:31 < Savander> to send command
19:31 < Savander> at join?
19:31 <@deen> yes
19:31 < Savander> WOW
19:32 < Savander> teach me master
19:32 < Savander> xD
19:32 <@deen> but you need an external script, and the whole thing is unix only
19:32 < Savander> so, ye
19:32 < Savander> Meh
19:32 < Savander> :c
19:32 < Savander> so useless for me :(
19:32 < Savander> im sad
19:32 < Savander> :C
19:32 <@deen> you can port it to windows
19:32 <@deen> i don't know if there are fifos on windows
19:33 < Savander> don't know how it works..
19:33 <@deen> find out
19:35 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe
19:38 < laxa> I guess I could do that in C#
19:38 < laxa> But I am quite lazy xD.
19:38 < laxa> The .NET Framework 3.5 has added named pipe support
19:39 <@deen> doesn't sound as easy as on *nix where you just do: echo say hi > my.fifo
19:40 < Savander> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365590(v=vs.85).aspx
19:40 < Savander> wait
19:42 < ddnet> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/NrcqSw
19:42 < ddnet> ddnet/DDRace64 9f4ac93 def: fifoconsole cleanup
19:44 < Savander> tsin
19:44 < Savander> TSIN LOL
19:44 < Savander> sorry
19:44 < Savander> deen: , echo say hi > my.fifo
19:44 < Savander> same one windows
19:44 <@deen> nice
19:44 < Savander> don't know
19:44 < Savander> what it do..
19:44 < Savander> but when i did it
19:44 < Savander> echo say hi > my.fifo
19:44 < Savander> it do smth like
19:45 < Savander> add "say hi"
19:45 < Savander> in first line
19:45 < Savander> echo say hi >> my.fifo
19:45 < Savander> add "say hi" to next line
19:45 <@deen> it just writes "say hi" to the file my.fifo
19:45 < Savander> ye
19:45 <@deen> it would delete everything else, but it's a fifo, so it doesn'T matter
19:45 < Savander> yup
19:45 < Savander> exactly
19:45 < Savander> so on windows, it works ;o
19:46 < Savander> stream transmition
19:46 <@deen> with named pipes?
19:46 < Savander> ;p
19:46 < Savander> idk
19:46 < Savander> i don't know, how to test it
19:46 < Savander> so i can't tell you..
19:47 <@deen> on linux you would do "mkfifo my.fifo" and "cat my.fifo"
19:47 <@deen> then you can write to it
