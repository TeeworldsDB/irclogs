11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Robyt3 I have a report that client doesn't start. user has a cyrillic user name, so I guess that's the cause. It works with nightly, but not with 15.7. Do you know which change fixed this?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm considering just adding that one and releasing a quick 15.7.1
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I found this change: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4373
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Full list of changes: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/15.7...master
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> On the other hand, maybe I should just release 15.8

14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feels good doing assembly
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remember to set edx to 0 when doing division guys

16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pietringstz br> @Akari hi can you enter fng 4 please have people there closing the room

16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stallman is angry
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Good like prosecuting a chinese media giant. Hopefully tiktok will think it's too much hassle to fight and offer the obs people something and comply with the license
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If they do decide to fight it in court it'll be extremely painful for obs

16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> #4299 fixes fs_storage_path so it works with unicode usernames, but releasing 15.8 with all unicode fixes together would probably be easier
