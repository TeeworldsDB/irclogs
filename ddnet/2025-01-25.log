05:05 < bridge> <totar> @learath2 we don't put sqlite3 for mac in ddnet-libs and it seems like it doesn't want to use the version I install to linux so I have no idea how deen is able to cross compile from linux to macos
05:05 < bridge> <totar> this is the only thing it's missing, it finds everything else
05:05 < bridge> <totar> this guy has the same issue 1 year ago
05:06 < bridge> <totar> the resolution was "cross compilation doesn't work"
05:06 < bridge> <totar> but yesterday we decided native compilation doesn't work
05:06 < bridge> <totar> so I'm confused
05:09 < bridge> <totar> it used to exist, why did we get rid of it
05:11 < bridge> <totar> it got deleted here
05:11 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/commit/ae0eb60903b612f3d8c0b5a2f2661c9f14710fbf
05:22 < bridge> <totar> does deen not cross compile?
06:06 < bridge> <totar> ok I fixed that new issue
06:07 < bridge> <totar> rust...
06:10 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/112501
06:10 < bridge> <totar> why...
06:10 < bridge> <totar> people say to use the zig compiler
06:15 < bridge> <totar> ok I fixed that, new issue
06:17 < bridge> <totar> btw it doesn't mention this anywhere but I think you must use a specific macos target version or the mac libraries doesn't work
06:18 < bridge> <totar> btw it doesn't mention this anywhere but I think you must use a specific macos target version or the mac libraries don't work
06:21 < bridge> <totar> actually maybe that was a different issue
06:22 < bridge> <totar> ok I fixed that by installing sqlite3 with macports and specifing the library location, new issue

09:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> Deen does have a Mac, so I expect he just compiled on that
10:10 < bridge> <totar> I was told this
10:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is the poll in \#announcements about?
10:24 < bridge> <learath2> Why not just ask deen? @0xdeen do we still cross compile for mac or do you do a native release nowadays?

10:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> #ppl spectating you (and names) or not
10:49 < ChillerDragon> yo @davide55 connecting a dummy on ger3 is a bit wonkey sometimes he just doesnt want to connect
10:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> a feature allowing you to see when someone spectates you
10:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> the poll is about:
10:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> not adding it
10:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> adding it
10:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> adding it with the addition to see the names
10:50 < ChillerDragon> nice thanks
10:50 < ChillerDragon> ddnet slowly catching up with decade old 0.7 technology
10:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
11:04 < bridge> <davide55> Yeah.. I know, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9480
11:05 < bridge> <davide55> At least you don't get disconnected anymore
11:05 < bridge> <davide55> You just need to retry a second time to connect the dummy
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Are you a "sha" guy or a "S H A" guy?
11:53 < bridge> <steinchen99> Same, cannot connect dummy on server tho
11:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> a drawback to not needing to verify yourself on ger10 anymore. the same reason you now have a small delay when joining, i guess it just drops the attempt to connect the dummy
12:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i guess this could be fixed on our side rather than davides tho
12:26 < bridge> <pioooooo> trying to test my fix for https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1332659743507873822 and also learn some mapping basics, how can i place kill tile in editor üòµ‚Äçüí´
12:27 < bridge> <pioooooo> or other tiles as well if not opening an existing map
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> on the left side, the `Game` group and layer are selected by default
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> just press space, the tile selector will pop up
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> from there just leftclick whatever you want, and you will have it on your brush (cursor)
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> this is better fit for #mapping tho ^^
12:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> ok space thank you
12:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> also just crashed my ddnet client somehow
12:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> if you're on windows, look under %appdata%/ddnet/logs
12:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> and send the latest log crash dump to #bugs and state what you did please
12:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> dont forget to send your credit card info
12:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> mods and devs need to get paid somehow
12:36 < bridge> <pioooooo> should be something already said there
12:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> some tele group stuff i have no idea i was doing
12:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> some tele group stuff i have no idea what i was doing
12:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah jupsti mentioned that
12:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah unlucky then, dont do it again <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
12:41 < bridge> <pioooooo> proudly my first map
12:41 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1332676757874151434/3cb2845fae383726.png?ex=67961f73&is=6794cdf3&hm=b49d217ba37d0dd55e0d40dbd20a1f85592e223570e2180f19f88866902025de&
12:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> you may want to get this out of #developer still ^^ - waiting to see you in #mapping
12:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh i was also wondering if there is something wrong on my side
12:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> or #bugs if that's more fitting
12:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> this is test map so..
13:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like I successfully broke Discord's rich text parsing :santatrollet:
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did you really find the same bug as me in almost the same time üòÇ
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i was doing some auto mapper stuff and found it, and you did it by luck lmao
13:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> lmao
13:51 < bridge> <pioooooo> by unluck (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is nicer for a list of urls? A config with comma separation like ``sv_urls https://foo.com,https://bar.de`` or a command like ``add_url https://foo.com`` ``add_url https://bar.de``
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not for ddnet btw
13:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> command-based imo
13:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> just feels more flexible
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think so too
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> makes the config file look nicer because of multiple lines vs long lines
13:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> exactly
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then it also needs stuff like ``remove_url`` or ``clear_urls``
14:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> also makes adding/removing em easier, depending on the size
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which the user has to figure out
14:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> ye
14:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean having add_url del_url/rem_url is sane either way
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the comma also has to be figured out so ...
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> del or rem :D
14:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> maybe you can have both? `have add_url "https://foo.com; https://bar.de" work, but adding it as 2 seperate entries
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wowowo
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then it doesnt have the edit/remove capability
14:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> remove by index
14:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> add list_url(s) aswell <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof poor user
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``sv_register`` uses the comma array for example
14:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> but it only has two options
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so does ``sv_register_extra``
14:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> i can imagine it get really messy really quickly
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``MACRO_CONFIG_STR(SvRegisterExtra, sv_register_extra, 256, "", CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Extra headers to send to the register endpoint, comma separated 'Header: Value' pairs")``
14:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> depending on how many url's are needed for whatever you're thinking about
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am working on multiple http end points stats are sent to on a round end
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i am wondering in general
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had the same question while thinking about redirect tiles
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the command seems a bit supirior but it only shines if we actively start using it with a unified interface
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i am going for the comma variant for now just because it is easier for the user to figure out especially if only one url is needed which is the most common case
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but one day we should develop some array config standard for ddnet that works well with multiple values
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe config files just need a way to support newlines with a backslash then you can have config variable values spanning multiple lines
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but what if the values can contain commas?
14:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> what kind of values should contain commas? floats are dots, and no other variable is in need of comma seperation
14:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> right?...
14:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> i guess custom servers could have that, e.g hook_rgb 100,100,100 or smth
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> list of strings that will be displayed somewhere as text can contain commas
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such as censorwords, playernames, welcome messages, announcements 
14:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah yeah, makes sense, didnt think of strings there
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also omg heinrich once used ``comma-separated`` and in the line below ``comma separated``
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rage issue
14:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> most normal chillerdragon issue
14:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> i made a similar PR once. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8149
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> consistency is important for grepping
14:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> IKR
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> especially if this is the only type hint we get for the custom array config
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would open a pr and fix it my self but i cba to force push 6 times after every reviewer proposed a new way of spelling it
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> basically /cancleswap mentioned
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1737811043.png
14:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> damn calling me out like that
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1737811062.png
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this guy got trolled good
14:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> why on gods earth is the most nerdy boy in #developer using github light mode btw
14:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> :angy:
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also used discord light mode
14:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> EW
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was used to it from skype times
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like going with defaults
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gitlab i use darkmode
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and my selfrolled discord is darkmode only xd
14:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> ._.

14:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> may allah guide you my dear friend
14:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
14:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> because god just stopped.
14:30 < bridge> <pioooooo> can someone explain how game logic work in ddnet
14:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> mainly the prediction thing
14:31 < bridge> <pioooooo> like how does ddnet handle the "relativity" issue between client & server
14:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Chiller uses also some weird linux distros, maybe there is no darkmode available @blaiszephyr
14:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Today I had a weird bug, when I was typing ~4 characters in chat, the message was clearing
15:12 < bridge> <Solly> not again!
15:12 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1332714787397963860/image.png?ex=679642dd&is=6794f15d&hm=52a23787b061031ee5014ba4ae67eb9be8e7b32df7fdccc27f1b1b37e004ec89&
15:15 < bridge> <Solly> and its gone just as fast
15:42 < bridge> <Solly> would it be possible to add the hashed timeout code to the server json list for the purpose of clients identifying eachother (using auxillery server)
15:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> Sharing the timeout code in any way shape or form Is a bad idea
15:55 < bridge> <Solly> you would have to try very hard to unhash a timeout code
15:55 < bridge> <Solly> thers also multiple timeout codes (millions) which create the same hash (depending on the size of the hash)
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> and you have to guess the right one before getting ratelimited (idk if there is, i guess chat/command rate limit)
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> and also the person has to have timed out
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> and what risk is there
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> someone is now playing under your name
15:57 < bridge> <Solly> unless theres also an account system
15:57 < bridge> <Solly> but the risk is .. minute anyway
15:59 < bridge> <Solly> adding any other way for clients to identify eachother (or to share arbritrary data, but that wont fly) would also work
15:59 < bridge> <Solly> could be in the same way timeout codes work.. but not timeout codes
15:59 < bridge> <Solly> could be in the same way timeout codes work.. but not used for timeout recon
16:00 < bridge> <avolicious> identification never will be added to the client to preserve privacy
16:00 < bridge> <Solly> the code would be unique per connection
16:01 < bridge> <Solly> accounts allow clients to identify eachother (if clients can see if other clients are verified, probably via some 0 info thing to prevent servers from faking it) but is more persistent (account id or whatever)
