07:29 < shorefire> deen: apparently there's still a name exploit
07:29 < shorefire> some dude is in the game, with a dummy, both using the name 'shorefire'
07:33 < shorefire> (the guy doing it was 'fegus')
07:37 < shorefire> haha, yeah
07:37 < shorefire> this guy is annoying
07:37 < shorefire> thought this got fixed
07:40 < shorefire> He's trying to act all fucking cool because he knows a exploit
07:40 < shorefire> and then claims its 'magic' like some annoying script kiddy
08:58 <@deen> shorefire: why fixed? There are characters in other languages that just look exactly the same
08:58 <@deen> Latin: e
08:58 <@deen> Cyrillic: ะต
09:24 < shorefire> Pretty bad
09:28 < shorefire> It's annoying
09:28 < shorefire> Especially when you're trying to talk to someone and there's like 4 of then in-game
14:25 <@deen> And what do you suggest?
14:25 <@deen> I don't have a solution
15:18 < ochristi> deen you there?
15:18 <@deen> ochristi: hi
15:27 < ochristi> got a question concerning the client, some players noticed it does not come of clean on virustotal, could you explain how you compile that thing?
15:29 <@deen> Yes
15:29 <@deen> Using gcc
15:30 <@deen> i have mingw installed with gcc 4.6.2
15:30 <@deen> Don't like visual studio
15:31 <@deen> I compile by downloading the latest zip from https://github.com/def-/teeworlds
15:31 <@deen> bam release
15:31 <@deen> strip -s DDNet.exe
15:31 <@deen> strip -s DDNet-Server.exe
15:31 <@deen> and finally
15:32 <@deen> scripts/make_release.py 4.1 win32
15:34 < ochristi> hm ok I will try to reproduce
15:34 <@deen> Tell me if you need any other help
15:35 < ochristi> it was crazy to get that VC thing running, I usually do stuff only on linux
15:35 <@deen> me too
15:35 <@deen> that's why i didn't use VC
15:35 <@deen> and good old gcc instead
15:36 < ochristi> also I had an issue with the bam, on windows it does not call "python script.py", just "script.py", no idea what's the idea behind that
15:36 <@deen> huh? it works for me
15:37 <@deen> Hm, I think new versions of mingw ship with gcc 4.8.2 now
22:28 < PriZrak> Hi
23:00 <@deen> hi
