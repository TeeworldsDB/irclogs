07:41 <+bridge> <ReiTW> You can own /64 for very cheap lmao
07:42 <+bridge> <ReiTW> 2^(128-64) is kinda huge
07:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> With 2^512 we could give every atom in the these it's unique ip ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
07:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> With 2^512 we could give every atom in the universe it's unique ip ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
07:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
08:20 <+bridge> <sunshine123> Hi, I want to change my name, should I do it?
08:20 <+bridge> <sunshine123> please help me thanks
08:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> does your name have 3000 points or higher
08:24 <+bridge> <sunshine123> Yes, I own more than 10,000
08:32 <+bridge> <ReiTW> where did u get that 2^512 :hollande:
08:33 <+bridge> <ReiTW> ipv12
08:42 <+bridge> <murpi> Hey sunshine123, shoot me a direct message regarding your rename request.
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ipv6 will never come,so let's just skip it xd
08:48 <+bridge> <ReiTW> @Jupeyy_Keks people was supposed to deploy it world wide the 06/06/2006
09:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im spamming prs to a japanese guy in gh
10:16 <+bridge> <Matodor> anyone know opensource chat platform (selfhosted) with bots and android app? for example i want selfhosted telegram alternative
10:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you want from a selfhosted platform?
10:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> would matrix with its app element work?
10:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how well does matrix work in china @TsFreddie?
10:19 <+bridge> <Matodor> I need to send notifications to clients with interactive features (buttons, input field)
10:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> never used it
10:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think matrix doesn't cover that
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> does telegram have inpiut fields? o.O
10:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can use the chat itself for that
10:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but it does have buttons
10:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think matrix has that
10:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you could potentially emulate it with reactions
10:55 <+bridge> <Matodor> yes xD
10:55 <+bridge> <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113752659560775730/image.png
10:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's just the standard input field, no?
10:58 <+bridge> <Matodor> yes, that's enough for my task
10:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anybody here uses distcc
10:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i thought that while im home i may give my m1 a job, and compile it alongside my pc
10:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> since m1 is nearly as fast as my cpu compiling lol
10:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ohh this could work nicely to compile firefox in gentoo
11:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't
11:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u think with distcc, i can use m1, which is aarch, to compile x86 zen3 programs?
11:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u used distcc right
11:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> Been almost 6 years since I last set it up, but yes
11:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> When my old laptop had gentoo aswell
11:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> read my comments
11:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if u can
11:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they explicitly say they support cross-compiling
11:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so I guess yes
11:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> Sure you can, iirc you just need to get the correct cross compiler setupa
11:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know how hard it is
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://retroflux.net/blog/distcc-adventures/
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> meh this is the reverse
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and windosy
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/SergioBenitez/homebrew-osxct
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think i can use this
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> seems old
11:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, idk where one gets cross compilers on osx
11:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> might clang be a cross-compiler by default?
11:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> alternatively, zig
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> CFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is this a real thing
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think clang is
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but what if i use gcc on gentoo
11:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ```sh
11:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> $ clang -arch aarch64 a.c
11:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> clang-15: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-arch aarch64' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]
11:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> arch is for gcc i think
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok no
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
11:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `-target aarch64-apple-darwin`
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i want my target to be ryzen zen 3 x86
11:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but I seem to lack a lnker
11:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can i use lld systemwide
11:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> Mh, you can try
11:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> Problem with those configurations is that no one is actively testing them, so you might get bugs and will have to deal with them on your own
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why is even ld the default on the current linux world
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its the slowest
11:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> It works ðŸ˜›
11:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm guessing the reason is that the only people that bulk compile stuff are gentoo users and distro maintainers
11:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can test lld and make it better \o/
11:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: ruby help available?
11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i never had problems with lld
11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the problem is i think i cant use lld with gcc? or maybe not with gcc and lto
11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont use lto tho
11:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> don't wake Jupstar
11:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can link with lld iirc. But don't remember if lto works
11:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -fuse-ld=lld"
11:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill add this
11:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and pray
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> luckily i think the kernel is outside the scope of this flags
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> right?
11:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> If you are brave, do a full rebuild ðŸ˜„
11:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What's with me
11:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, kernel doesn't use emerge conf
11:43 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ur the lto person
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> package.env exists
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just found out today
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its a nice thing
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for example to enable lto to select packages
11:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Lto is only worth for static linking enjoyers
11:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> A world yet to be created
11:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust
11:47 < ws-client> <Jupstar> the greatest part about rust
11:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> they knew how to lure me :joy:
11:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 ye same as in python
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> try ``help Array`` in ``irb``
11:57 < Ryozuki> another day in the good old irc
11:58 <+ChillerDragon> pog
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who needs weechat when there is webchat
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685613547.png
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> quality cde highltght
11:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> lazy code highlight xd
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Jupstar get pingerd
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I was too stupid to figure out the `help` function in ruby on my own btw
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ```rb
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you mean?
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> >> help
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Nothing known about .help
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> >> help(help)
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Nothing known about .help(help)
12:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> btw parenthesis are considered bloat in ruby
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> true rubingers say ``help help``
12:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
12:02 < Ryozuki> xd xd
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> you need ruby docs installed
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> ``gem install rdoc``
12:04 < Ryozuki> Learath2: i joined #c and #c++ on liberas
12:04 < Ryozuki> i got my popcorn for those c standard discussions
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> lmao c people last irc users on da planet
12:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> #c is reaaally knowledgeable
12:05 < Ryozuki> i mean ye
12:05 < Ryozuki> u have people who still use irc
12:05 < Ryozuki> i expect them to know their  bits
12:06 < Ryozuki> im also on ##rust
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> i can see rust people using discord over irc :p
12:07 < Ryozuki> ye
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich u got da help workin?
12:07 < Ryozuki> but ##rust is quite active
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> when #edlang
12:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: yes
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> pro
12:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that wasn't what I was interested in originally, but it's also interesting ðŸ˜„
12:07 < Ryozuki> ##rust offtopic chatter - unsafety allowed until further notice
12:07 < Ryozuki> epic channel
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> what were you looking for?
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: go add reply support to mattermost thank
12:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how to define module functions
12:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but I figured it out already
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> pro
12:09 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: memes aside
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> i thought u wanted to generate docs for huffman
12:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `:module_function` or so
12:09 < Ryozuki> is ruby worht learning
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> u dont need to learn ruby if you know english
12:09 < Ryozuki> xd
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> so no not worth it
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> just use it
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> but it doesnt have many applications
12:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: no. theoretically everything is done and I could publish the ruby/python package now
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> it helps when you want to read gitlab source code tho
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> very pog heinrich
12:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> however, not sure how easy it is with an unreleased version of uniffi ^^
12:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe I'll try
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: homebrew/gitlab/meta sploit exploits use ruby but yea it just reads fine even if you do not know it
12:10 < Ryozuki> why do metasploit use ruby
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> idk
12:11 < Ryozuki> its an interesting framework
12:11 < Ryozuki> but i never got into it 
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> not all but some
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> me neither
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> i just watch 10h HACKING ETHICAL DOUBLE PENETRATION COURSE FREE  while playing minecraft
12:11 < Ryozuki> there is a channel in rizon called #truth
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> and they talk about it
12:11 < Ryozuki> its quite funny
12:11 < Ryozuki> > The room dedicated to current events, politics, gender, race, science, cryptocurrency, economics, entertainment, history, religion, philosophy, or any other type of knowledgeable discussion.
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685614330.png
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> ruby is trash because there is no way to compile or add any kind of type annotations
12:12 < Ryozuki> oh
12:12 < Ryozuki> i need my types
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> even python has better typing
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> and even python compiles to some degree
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> shipping a ruby desktop app usually involves shipping a ruby interpreter
12:13 < Ryozuki> like python
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> in python its a bit better
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> better ecosys around it
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> also python compiles
12:14 < Ryozuki> ruby is used cuz ruby on rails
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> to python bytecode
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> yes
12:14 < Ryozuki> like elixir is used cuz phoenix
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> like rust is used cuz ferris
12:14 < Ryozuki> https://www.phoenixframework.org/
12:14 < Ryozuki> lot of ppl love this
12:14 < Ryozuki> rust exist cuz C exists
12:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> isn't elixir based on erlang?
12:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, it compiles to the erlang VM
12:15 < Ryozuki> ye
12:15 < Ryozuki> its a BEAM language
12:16 < Ryozuki> elixir has "better" syntax (lol) 
12:16 < Ryozuki> erlang rly has bad syntax
12:16 < Ryozuki> anyway elixir can use otp too
12:16 < Ryozuki> but
12:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> otp?
12:16 < Ryozuki> i personally would use https://gleam.run/
12:16 < Ryozuki> another beam lang, but typed
12:16 < Ryozuki> otp is erlang/otp
12:16 < Ryozuki> what makes erlang so good
12:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> still don't know what otp is
12:17 < Ryozuki> OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging and release handling tools.
12:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform
12:17 < Ryozuki> ye
12:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is erlang that thing where you can upgrade a running process?
12:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds like a very desirable feature
12:17 < Ryozuki> it is
12:18 < Ryozuki> u can do that ye
12:18 < Ryozuki> erlang is the language made by ericson
12:18 < Ryozuki> massively scalable
12:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have docs on that?
12:18 < Ryozuki> whatsapp uses erlang iirc
12:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how does it handle data structure changes
12:19 < Ryozuki> i think u can replace a module
12:19 < Ryozuki> with the updated version
12:19 < Ryozuki> erlang is composed of modules
12:19 < Ryozuki> https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/07/27/a-guide-to-hot-code-reloading-in-elixir.html
12:19 < Ryozuki> oh
12:20 < Ryozuki> u can upgrade a module, a package, the entire otp
12:20 < Ryozuki> aka the instance
12:21 < Ryozuki> https://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2007-July/027816.html
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> You should view versions of your systems as progressing from state1 to
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> state2 to state3
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and so on.
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Then you need transformation functions that take state N to state N+1 AND
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> (importantly) state N+1 to state N.
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> To make a state change in you system your put it into a stable state,
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> then roll the state forwards or backwards then resume operations.
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Meta code for this is:
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>      suspend all relevant processes
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>      roll  to state I+1 or I-1
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>      resume all relevant processes
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> erlang is a functional lang btw
12:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> immutable
12:23 < Ryozuki> the mailing list is nice
12:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i got a new pfp hope u enjoy
12:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :troll:
12:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Lol. Back to the year 2000
12:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> We had a camera exactly like this one ^^
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> watf how old u jupsti
13:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 72
13:02 <+bridge> <Steinchen> hi is ddnet 2 content in progress? or even planned whats comin?
13:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Only time can tell
13:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Planning often happens here and there
13:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Esp for accounts
13:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Jupstar is coding on a version not bound by backcompat
13:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> everyone is incrementally adding features to normal ddnet
13:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't knwo about an explicity ddnet2 goal though
13:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> mh Rustians: i have a problem.. i want to panic inside Drop... that's not a problem. But i cannot write should_panic tests for it, because of https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/97
13:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Any idea?
13:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why do you want to panic inside drop?
13:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you should also not throw in destructors in C++
13:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i want to make sure a resource is never dropped when it's still in use basically
13:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u can panic on drop
13:11 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I wondered if ddnet would be good implementing it in Godot, it has both Vulkan and OpenGL compatibility, native language set (so cpp and C# can be used for compliling) and has better control over memory, as in it's object oriented
13:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u panic on a panic
13:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it aborts
13:11 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I want to make it happen in Godot, but only I can do much at the time xd
13:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> the panic isnt the problem. the problem is i cant write a test for it @Ryozuki
13:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> at least not with should_panic
13:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it's ok that it aborts, this is a fatal error anyway
13:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Jupstar: you probably have to hand-roll your test here
13:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can't do it with `#[should_panic]`
13:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Consider that C++ (which is normally very conservative with breaking changes) made the same change in C++11: destructors were changed to be `noexcept` by default, which causes any exceptions which escape them to abort the process instead.
13:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting, TIL
13:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
13:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Jupeyy_Keks it seems the RFC isn't accepted yet?
13:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3288\
13:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3288
13:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Mhh i get `panicked at 'panic in a function that cannot unwind'` tho
13:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
13:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> anyway i ignore the test for now :D
13:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in theory it works :joy:
13:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113790333386489949/FxdjdlKXoAQgv_W.png
13:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 there is a new discord rust lib
13:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://twilight.rs/
13:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i might look into it
13:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> have u used serenity before?
13:39 < Ryozuki> rly tiny bit
13:39 < Ryozuki> never rly much
13:40 < Ryozuki> cant comment on it
14:40 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> @Reteah I think using classes to instance different kinds of libraries into one script can be more powerful in Godot and would allow me to use more extensions into one script. My idea would be to have my VScript library create all the other classes like VCharacter2D, VPanel2D, etc. to access them and use them inside another script. Also I see how you wanted me to use classes now, didn't know it worked like that xd
14:40 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGOiiR9ZKg
14:40 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> It would make my tw client dev making much easier
14:41 <+bridge> <ReiTW> this guy definetly use Motion Canvas for his videos
14:41 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> probably, the quality of his videos are really good
14:42 <+bridge> <ReiTW> yea
14:42 <+bridge> <ReiTW> motion canvas is a rly cool projec
14:42 <+bridge> <ReiTW> motion canvas is a rly cool project
14:43 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I may want to use that program for my own tutorial videos for Godot, if I get to a point, where I want to teach people something new
14:43 <+bridge> <ReiTW> good luck
14:43 <+bridge> <ReiTW> motion canvas is mostly full code animations
14:43 <+bridge> <ReiTW> typescript lang
14:44 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> if it's a set of functions, then it's ok
14:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://motioncanvas.io/
14:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> TIL

15:39 <+bridge> <ReiTW> the editor is only a way to debug things & set "sleep" delays
15:39 <+bridge> <ReiTW> but the animations are made using typescript
15:40 <+bridge> <ReiTW> he could make so that animations are made with the editor but he said that he wanted to make everything with code mostly, because he likes it
16:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> is it new tho
16:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk if new xd
16:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i found it
16:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i only new about serenity
16:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> iot seems well made
16:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im making ryochan rn
16:24 <+bridge> <gerdoe> serenity is kinda huge framework
16:24 <+bridge> <gerdoe> twilight looks like dpp
16:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats ddp
16:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dpp
16:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> twilight is unironically everything discord offers
16:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> discord api wrapper in cpp written by Brain
16:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> discord api library
16:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> aegis superior
16:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anything non rust is out of question
16:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway im liking twilight rn
16:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> dpp was really small at start
16:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and covered whole dapi
16:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> twilight doesnt seem small to me
16:38 <+bridge> <Arrow> is it possible in some point to make a search bar to find a tile/group/quad etc..  when your list is too crowded? if it is awesome
16:38 <+bridge> <Arrow> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113839038684725421/screenshot_2023-06-01_00-30-43.png
16:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ravie is this something we want or not
16:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> a filter like in vscode file list could work for this ^^
16:43 <+bridge> <Ravie> doesn't seem very useful to me, if you get lost in your layers then maybe group and name them better
16:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the resident chieft editor decided
16:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the resident chief editor decided
16:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:00 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Ig that's still useful
17:00 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Wouldn't take much place tho
17:07 <+bridge> <Voxel> normal layer areas dont have a search function
17:11 <+bridge> <Krain> Hello devs! Any idea why I can't use Vulkan 1.1.0? I select it, reload the game, and it jump back to OpenGL 3.0.0! 
17:11 <+bridge> <Krain> I tried with steam version, and downloaded version
17:11 <+bridge> <Krain> I saw on forum that adding ```gfx_render_thread_count 1``` to ```settings_ddnet.cfg``` could help, but it didn't.
17:11 <+bridge> <Krain> 
17:11 <+bridge> <Krain> Here are my gfx analysis, after selecting vulkan:
17:11 <+bridge> <Krain> ```
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> gfx_3d_texture_analysis_ran 1
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> gfx_3d_texture_analysis_renderer "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060/PCIe/SSE2"
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> gfx_3d_texture_analysis_version "4.6.0 NVIDIA 528.49"
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> gfx_render_thread_count 1
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> ```
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> line gfx_backend "OpenGL" is missing, but I still see Vulkan in settings :3
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> 
17:12 <+bridge> <Krain> Thanks for your help!
17:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What's your client version?
17:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Do u maybe have a laptop?
17:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> On laptop maybe the Intel GPU is the fault
17:15 <+bridge> <Krain> No laptop!
17:15 <+bridge> <Krain> How can I give you the client version?
17:15 <+bridge> <Krain> 17.0.2***
17:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> F1 top right
17:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok
17:16 <+bridge> <Krain> v0.6.4, 17.0.2 :>
17:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Use steam?
17:16 <+bridge> <Krain> Yup, but I tried on both
17:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Maybe u selected the OpenGL option in steam
17:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Then it forces ogl
17:17 <+bridge> <Krain> I'm trying this because somone told me Vulkan is actually way better.
17:17 <+bridge> <Krain> Should I war to use Vulkan, or not really ahah
17:17 <+bridge> <Krain> I'm looking into steam settings!
17:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Look at my profile picture xd
17:17 <+bridge> <Krain> Ahahah
17:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> you're talking to jupstar- yea
17:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> jup is vulkan rep here
17:18 <+bridge> <Krain> Any idea where this ogl setting is in steam?
17:22 <+bridge> <Krain> And the difference between both is obvious? Are we sure it's not just the settings page that is badly updated, but the game correctly use Vulkan?
17:27 <+bridge> <Krain> I uninstalled steam version, to avoid conflicts. Trying to update my nvidia drivers in case.
17:27 <+bridge> <Krain> 
17:27 <+bridge> <Krain> I really don't understand, because Vulkan is supposed to be the default renderer, but looks like my game really prefer ogl 3.0.0 ;-;
17:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> vulkan is better
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> after starting the client, does F1 mention something why vulkan failed?
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can you select vulkan in the client
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> close the client
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> look into settings_ddnet.cfg
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> search for gfx_backend
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and see what it says
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe your client crashes before writing the config file
17:38 <+bridge> <Krain> ```
17:38 <+bridge> <Krain> 2023-06-01 17:37:58 I gfx: Created Vulkan 1.1 context.
17:38 <+bridge> <Krain> 2023-06-01 17:37:59 I gfx: unable to create window: Installed Vulkan doesn't implement the VK_KHR_surface extension
17:38 <+bridge> <Krain> ```
17:38 <+bridge> <Krain> OHOH
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh lol
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did you plug your monitor into your mainboard instead of the graphics card?
17:39 <+bridge> <Krain> Wtf no
17:39 <+bridge> <Krain> oh but I use a kvm!!!
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah you on linux?
17:39 <+bridge> <Krain> Nope
17:39 <+bridge> <Krain> I use it to switch my screen between two computers
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok maybe i dunno what a kvm is then ðŸ˜„
17:40 <+bridge> <Krain> https://www.amazon.fr/Switch-Commutateur-USB2-0-Brancher-Ecran/dp/B08H4FKJPN/ref=asc_df_B08H4FKJPN/?hvadid=454735878876&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5881411235968907278&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9040843&hvtargid=pla-968027552616&psc=1
17:40 <+bridge> <Krain> something like that :>
17:40 <+bridge> <Krain> You plug in your 2 pc on it, and it will redirect all usb and dpi from one pc to the other in one click
17:41 <+bridge> <Krain> I'll try to plug my screen directly to the graphic card, rb
17:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh ok
17:44 <+bridge> <Krain> Nope, still not working!
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Krain another thing that could be a problem is, if you use a 32bit client or windows
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can you verify both is 64-bit?
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the client says in F1
17:45 <+bridge> <Krain> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113855763656478721/image.png
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but you tried without steam right?
17:45 <+bridge> <Krain> I uninstalled steam version!
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in the ddnet dir, do you see vulkan-1.dll?
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> next to the .exe
17:46 <+bridge> <Krain> Yup!
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can u delete it and try again?=
17:46 <+bridge> <Krain> Still not working
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if that still doesn't work, i assume it's some programm blocking it
17:47 <+bridge> <Krain> vulkan-1.dll didn't came back
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> e.g. firewall
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> discord
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> some mouse drivers with overlays
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u actually dont need it anyway
17:47 <+bridge> <Krain> ahahah
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's for computers that dont have a vulkan driver at all
17:47 <+bridge> <Krain> am I sure I have thoses drivers?
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you have vulkan drivers but for some to me unknown reason it cannot create a surface
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> a surface is basically the window itself
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can u maybe try without fullscreen?
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in "windowed mode"
17:48 <+bridge> <Krain> still nope
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do u have some weird overlays active?
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> similar to discord overlay
17:49 <+bridge> <Krain> um I don't think so :/
17:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u updated your drivers to latest now,right?
17:50 <+bridge> <Krain> let me double check that
17:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 535.98  WHQL
17:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is the latest
17:50 <+bridge> <Krain> uuh scary name
17:51 <+bridge> <Krain> Oh, driver update didn't worked, I am trying again
17:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can also try a clean driver from nvidia directly
17:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/205173/en-us/
17:52 <+bridge> <Krain> I'll try that
17:52 <+bridge> <Krain> looks like geforce cannot update my driver?? Problem mght be deeper than just a Vulkan thing ahah
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ^ and a fresh install?
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u reinstall, i'd highly suggest to use a tool like DDU
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It removes all the config files etc.
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So it's an actual reset of the driver
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But better try without first ðŸ˜„
17:54 <+bridge> <Krain> oh. Disk full ^^'
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah lol ðŸ˜„
17:59 <+bridge> <Krain> oh. Disk full ^^' edit: I free some space! Brb :<
18:05 <+bridge> <Krain> IT WORKED ahahah
18:07 <+bridge> <Krain> so it was my drivers I guess ^^'
18:07 <+bridge> <Krain> Thanks for your help, and sorry for the time loss ^^'
18:08 <+bridge> <Krain> I don't really see the difference :w
18:08 <+bridge> <Krain> But if it's better, it's better right? ahah
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> btw setting gfx_render_thread_count higher usually gives more and more stable fps
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it uses more cores to create the render calls
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But i cannot guarantee it for every hardware^^
18:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> That is what @DDNet uses
18:08 <+bridge> <Krain> Oh! ok ok!
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it also depends on the CPU, but usually it should give around double the FPS
18:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im making my own
18:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> better than yaddb
18:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and its named ryochan
18:09 <+bridge> <Krain> Oh.. I was already max fps ahah
18:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> considering u have `gfx_refresh_rate 0; cl_refresh_rate 0; gfx_vsync 0`
18:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> Better than yaddb is not a very high bar to clear. Yaddb was supposed to be a debugging tool
18:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i see, it also depends on the map
18:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in entities u usually have more fps anyway^^
18:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tbh idk whaty addb does
18:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just said it to be cool
18:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> It handles banning people on servers ðŸ˜„
18:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nvm then
18:10 <+bridge> <Krain> wait.. is it my fps?
18:10 <+bridge> <Krain> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113862110540218368/image.png
18:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its like @DDNet
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the first number
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:10 <+bridge> <Krain> ahahah
18:10 <+bridge> <Krain> overkill? naaaaah
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it is
18:10 <+bridge> <Krain> ahahahahaah
18:10 <+bridge> <Krain> I love it ahah
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> best is you use gfx_refresh_rate 1000
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or smth like that
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> world record goes to chillerdragon with a rtx 4090
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110987446897881088/image.png
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 17k fps xD
18:11 <+bridge> <Krain> AHAHAHAH
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but only possible on linux ðŸ˜„
18:11 <+bridge> <Krain> It's so dumb ahahah
18:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure chiller didnt self compiled with march native and lto
18:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure chiller didnt self compile with march native and lto
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tru
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and Ofast
18:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and using wayland
18:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and native march kernel
18:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even my shit pc reached 15k fps
18:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tuned for the cpu
18:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> gentoo
18:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> overclocked hardware
18:12 <+bridge> <Krain> You lost me guys ;-;
18:12 <+bridge> <Krain> Thanks again for the help Jupstar! You converted somone else to Vulkan gg wp :>
18:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao xD
18:15 <+bridge> <Krain> Just in case, I already asked 3/4 month ago, but in case:
18:15 <+bridge> <Krain> I have around 70 ping on ger2, but 25 on ger10.
18:15 <+bridge> <Krain> Not using VPN or anything on my network
18:15 <+bridge> <Krain> 
18:15 <+bridge> <Krain> I'm just doomed, because of how routers are linked between me and the ger2 server right?

18:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, basically yes
18:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u lucky a router restart fixes it
18:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i also like heinz ketchup
18:20 <+bridge> <Krain> Already tried! :D
18:20 <+bridge> <Krain> Thanks for all the work you are doing on the game ;)
19:04 <+bridge> <Arrow> and what about a auto save?, sometimes when you are generating for example a hook tile quite large the game crashes
19:07 <+bridge> <Ravie> autosave would be nice, especially since it doesn't need any ui
20:17 <+bridge> <Arrow> and what about an auto save?, sometimes when you are generating for example a hook tile too large the game crashes
20:24 <+bridge> <Robyt3> open issue please
21:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> afternoon
21:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> so many abstractions over net in libtw2 huh
21:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> server re-registers new peer every disconnect
21:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> with same addrs
22:35 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> YES! YES!
23:12 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: I wonder when we'll be reaching the point, where we hit a limit on what a real life simulation (UE5.2 project for example) needs and out of thin air, NVIDIA will make a 3x stronger the official limit GPU
23:13 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think with the 4090, the limit is already broken, as in you can simulate real life interactable environments in 60+ fps
23:13 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and anything less will always produce the absolute best, so I don't see a reason to have stronger GPUs
23:13 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and anything less will always produce the absolute best, so I don't see a reason to have stronger GPUs for the casual person
23:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> For ddnet the bottleneck is the CPU anyway
23:13 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> well obviously
23:14 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> with 17k fps, the CPU has to produce those
23:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 4090 probably chills at 50% load for 17k fps ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
23:14 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> bruh
23:15 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> how is the new Starwars game?
23:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The problem is. We actually need 16k screens, virtual reality, more fps. Etc so it feels actually real
23:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So I guess we are still far away from that dream sadlyðŸ¥¹
23:16 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> for virtual reality, it's natural, for real life games, idk
23:16 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I just want to see a fair prize share for GPUs and not let GPUs be used for crypto mining
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I guess the good old days are over for the next years coming
23:17 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ye
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Chairn once shared a graph
23:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The cost for new cpu manufacture nodes are simply too expensive
23:18 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yes, a 1080 for 300â‚¬, not even a decent purchase when it comes to the release prize of a 3080
23:19 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and you only see lower for the prize of 250~
23:19 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> menacing prizes really
23:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ^
23:19 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think AMD still goes as the best affordable GPU
23:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah^^
23:20 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think AMD still goes as the best affordable GPU market
23:20 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think we are just fucked with NVIDIA :kek:
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Tho tbf the cost might have increased, but the money they earned ofc increased too by the globalization
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> They are pretty Monopoly xd
23:21 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Just so that the cycle could repeat itself
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Especially if u consider every field, not just gaming xd
23:22 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> in every field it's absolutely fine, let the tech guys have it for a reasonable prize, but if you wanna advertise the GPU for gaming, then it's another issue
23:22 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> 4090 literally was advertised to run Cyberpunk at 60fps with ray tracing
23:22 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> .-.
23:23 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> which is fucking stupid, the game's fucking unoptimized but ok nvidia
