06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> Friend of stitch?
07:45 <+pinkieval> not really
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> Oh
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> I am so in in creating map , that i dont eat ... the idea is too good ....
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Cant wait to show
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> eat anyway
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't want to read in the news in a few days "Computer player days while mapping for DDNet"
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't want to read in the news in a few days "Computer player dies while mapping for DDNet"
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> rofl ! xD i need to go to work ... cant die ...
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet the killer game. Addicted tees die of hunger lulz
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜‚
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> People of DDNet, is it possible to disable the display of the ingame cursor in the DDNet client? I would expect it in the HUD tab, but I do not see it inâ€™t.
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how would you enable the cursor again? ðŸ˜›
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess a console command might be ok
20:42 <@deen> Just move the cursor to the side?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
20:43 <@deen> or edit gui_cursor.png
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Differentiate between the ingame cursor and the menu cursor â€¦
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> edit `game.png` ðŸ˜›
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> I mean, we can disable the score display, disable the rest of the HUD like the hearts and shields, but not the ingame cursor.
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> if i remember
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> you can
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> cl_showhud_cursor 0 ?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Because after playing around with cl_mouse_followfactor it came to me that I actually do not need a cursor at all.
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> There is no such thing
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> you can't cl_showhud_cursor 0 ?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> i guess so it has been removed, i can still use it
20:45 <@deen> doesn't exist in ddnet
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> ohh
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> I am running a compilation from today.
20:46 <@deen> but feel free to make a pr
20:46 <@deen> we already have thousands of useless options, what's one more?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> my bad for github
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Well it is useful. I  imagine being better without an ingame cursor.
20:50 <@deen> the key word here being "imagine"
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Well if I set cl_mouse_followfactor to 1 the ingame cursor is almost gone  ðŸ™†. But it can ghost about.
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> But it is almost impossible to play with it.
20:54 <+Learath2> hud.cpp:L603 if you want to patch it out
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> I do not know C++ sadly. Somebody else has to do it. Hey, at least I have mentioned it.
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> remove line 603, `RenderCursor();` and recompile DDNet
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜‰
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want, there are tutorials about how to compile ddnet in the forums
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> But it should be a setting, and it creates a merge conflict when I make a new git pull.
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then you'll be able to determine whether you actually want the feature "no cursor"
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Maybe I am able to determine it a priori. Also, it is not only about me :/. Even if I do not want it, it cannot be excluded that others want it once they get the idea.
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Socialdarwinist try it and we'll see
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if other people want it, they'll annoy us as well, don't worry? ðŸ˜›
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> I have tried it for two rounds FNG. One can get used to it, one can even wonder why people thought that the TW client needs a cursor in the first place. Close combat in FNG has been a bit better for me, distance shooting a bit worse. It can definitely be a thing for people more autistic than me.
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "one can even wonder why people thought that the TW client needs a cursor in the first place"
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I aim with my cursor ðŸ˜„
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> The tee moves its head, the weapon moves too, so this is why it is not strictly necessary.
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol cursor is needed
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> next version of ddnet without cursor confirmed
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no pls
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Maybe you suggest it to oy. Iâ€™d claim some chance.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oy? haha
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no cursor = train your aim
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Socialdarwinist> Then you can recommend the DDNet client by saying: You can have a cursor in the DDNet client.
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://image.prntscr.com/image/4vC0-6nqTkOOV7LC1Tfw2g.png hey, tw added whispering support at 11 dec 2017
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can see teeworlds dev goes really fast
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> should work better now

22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> @Ryozuki well I coded it almost 7 years ago, review took some time it seems
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just look at learath pr from 2013
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> yeah, I also wrote a bit of it, seems like I bring no luck ):
23:15 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1034: Try to find external GLEW, pnglite and Wavpack  (master...pr_ddnet_cmake_deps_oldstyle) https://git.io/vAY0r
