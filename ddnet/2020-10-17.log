07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> GUYS
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> Hello and sorry for disturb
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> Why i have closed eyes for all tees on mine personal DDNET server?
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> what command to able use eyeemote
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> I mean: all tees on server have closed eyes, what command responding for it?
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> close eyes may be because your tees are set as afk or you have /pause
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @Obiwan try to use command /emote
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> nono
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> not in afk, just ingame
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> kind no paused, and other
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> but you gave me one idea
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> i setted: events 0; sv_emotional_tees 1; and i trying to make eyemote, but nothing happens
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> but in server console writing this:
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766902357253947412/unknown.png
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> have you tried other emotes than normal?
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> really weird thing
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> ye
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> tryed all
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> i searching for a problem rn
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766905351303725076/screenshot_2020-10-17_09-07-59.png
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> eyeemote not works on server but saying: you can no use preset of emotes
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> eyeemote not works on server but saying: you can no use the preset eye emotes
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> @Moderator
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> @Moderator HALP ^^
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> @Moderator HALP
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> @Souly Hey
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> I repaired
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> But... wtf how it works
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> seems ddnet doing same as discord: Getting much new features with non-normal explaining how it works (as you noticed when i always asking, the Deen answering to me all time) and still buggy
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> I changed value in this command: sv_max_afk_vote_time from 0 to 300 (default) , but idk how "vote_time" is refers to eyeemote ~_~
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> I changed value in this command: sv_max_afk_vote_time from 0 to 300 (default) , but idk how "vote_time" is refers to eyeemote ...
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> because the afk state changes your eye emote
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> it's 300 by default, so it's your own fault
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If you are on fng There is an extra command for wheel and it must be set in cfg before start
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> The problem was in non-working eye emotes, on server i cant do any eye emote, but i tryed to search for some functions to work it kind: sv_max_afk_time; sv_input_info and another, but problem was in "sv_max_afk_vote_time" - (The time in seconds a player can be afk and his _votes_ still count (0 = disabled)    300) but cant imagine how VOTE VOICE TIME refers to EYE EMOTE. If somebody will have same problem, set "sv_max_afk_vote_time" to any n
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> I done!
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :kek:
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> cant understand, sorry
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> @Jupstar ✪ About what extra command you told?
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> @Jupstar ✪ About what extra command you told? And for what wheel: eye emote or just emote?
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Is it even fng server else nvm
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> Yes, but i interested, please, can you explain more in details?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just read fng.cfg
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And the github page
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It explains everything
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> oh, okay, thanks
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> Statistics don't look good on phone
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766942733503561738/Screenshot_20201017-103558_Chrome.png
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try to fix
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik better now?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes @deen thank you
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> oof I expected to be able to rejoin with timeout after ``pkill -f DDNet`` seems like it sends a SIGTERM and ddnet closes and disconnects cleanly :/
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, use kill -9
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> yea now i know
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> kill sounds so strong i should keep in mind it trys to be gentle
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> gnome bugged on me i never had something like this beofore :/
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> time to switch to KDE @Patiga :D
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> !
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> be sure to enable wobbly windows in the desktop effects!
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> omg it happend again
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> i blame ddnet client
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet is virused gnome crasher
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> ok it was a joke
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> but now im serious
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> when i get pinged in ddnet chat my gnome crashed
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> 2 times in a row
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I nkow what's causing this
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> cl_notifications 0 it is for now i guess
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 8ce6de6d8e
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try reverting that
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does anyone know the reasoning behind map sounds being allowed to be external btw?
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> reverted can someone come ingame and ping me? :)
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just because it's the same in images
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> surived ty @Patiga
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> deen too slow xd
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^^
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> ok seems ur guess was right
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> i wasnt running master before but the ddnet-git aur package but it should be the commit anyways
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah ye i also dont really understand why the images are not automatically sorted into external/embedded
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> oh cmn i lost map progress again due to CTRL-C xd
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> i suck
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> guess now i know
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait guys the test was flawed xd
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> i had cl_notifications 0
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> rip
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> ok @deen seems like reverting 8ce6de6d8e520f96724d9e2c4c8da8f24e3e72a8. did not help
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> i can try to bisect somewhen else but im currently in the middle of something
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> ill open a issue for now i guess
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> lmao i manged to get pinged in chat in a message without my name xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602931225.png
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Written in **JavaScript** and C
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it cannot be taken seriously 😄
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> both fine and fun languages
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you think using things like JS for core system components is OK?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> a lot of people were making fun of Windows when it had some GUI things integrated in the kernel, and now core of main Linux desktop environment is written in JS.... 😄
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> is the core written in js? tbh idk i thought its more for the extensions and stuff
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> btw coming from the dude who runs a electron app to chat xd
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> :fire:
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Discord's web version works well
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> no reason to use that Electron junk 😄
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not much difference between running it in a browser or in electron. Might aswell get the better integration of electron
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> when you run in it web browser, it can't mess with your system much
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but with Electron it can
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> sneaking what apps are running etc
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> when you run it in web browser, it can't mess with your system much
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> I finished the grass_doodads svg version btw https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres/blob/master/svg/grass_doodads_chiller.svg Idk how to export pngs from it properly and its untested but at least its finished xd
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice looks good
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> :)
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 a2b3f45f8b105ebbd6e391c48a2c529ddb1ed09c broke our configurations
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `Cannot execute game command 'sv_team', put it into the map config or start the server with 'sv_test_cmds 1' to enable it` most critically `sv_solo_server`
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen is ger4 not compiling it's own server?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is every single one of our servers running a different version? :/
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: Want to add ultra hd option in client?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 they are all built on ddnet.tw and scped from there
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 so solo server is currently broken? Should we quickly revert and deploy?
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so all servers should run the same version, depending on when they last restarted of course
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm just going to revert `7e84e1ef43516beeab579a850d664242e91d2843` @heinrich5991 can re PR when he is around. We basically need some sort of unsafe-exec or atleast a time when we can unsafe-exec
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, thanks
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do I get it to deploy to all servers btw?
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, before map start would be great
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `ssh ddnet.tw "cd src; ./build.sh`
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> "
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `~/servers/all-restart.sh` afterwards to start running a bit earlier
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also on ddnet.tw, no need to connect to the other servers manually (they are too many for that now anyway)
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> @deen is this a question or a request?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> A joke/request/question combo
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mostly just an idea of what we could do with the svgs
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know that it's not trivial to revert merge commits?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> revert all changes in the PR in reverse order
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and squash that with `git rebase -i master`
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is what I would do
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Odd that git doesn't have that as default
17:29 <+ChillerDragon> @deen well i just made the individual doodads for my movie and website and did the whole tileset on request on Jupstar. I play in high res I would love to see better graphics but I currently do not plan to thinker with client code reagarding this 
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I assume git revert -m with the correct parent would do that
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but apparently that has the weird behaviour of still leaving A and B in the repository, so after @heinrich5991 fixes it, re merging it would apparently only merge the new commits he makes
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/revert-a-faulty-merge.txt
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, never used that
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen are you perhaps editing build.sh on ddnet.tw?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I opened it in vim, but only read
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because you asked me about it 😄
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still think we should add the git hash of the server on the finishes
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would help with bugs
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is it in the teehistorian files?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then we could extract it retroactively from all existing teehistorian files
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep it is
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `"server_version":"0.6.4, 15.0.5 (d3691bf221c2d6d2)"`
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so basically we have the info already, it's just not so easy to access
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen Copying to servers seems to hang
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 it's done slowly and some servers (CHN) can do 5 KB/s
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that might be a good reason to compile on those servers
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ps aux|grep scp shows the CHN servers are the ones
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but `git pull` can also take 5-10 min or just fail
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazing 😄
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no one plays solo on CHN anyway, you could still restart the rest already
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is CHN last on the list though?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are copied at the same time
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, great
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> all others are done
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: hi
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen btw `cat: all-locations: No such file or directory` we should probably make all our scripts cd to `~/servers`
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, yeah
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hi @TsFreddie 🌈
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw you could have put `all-restart.sh` in terms of `execute-all.sh` instead of `restart-ddnet-on-empty.sh`
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't write that script, but feel free to rename
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> saw you guys talking about CHN servers, and I realize I have no idea what you guys are doing
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so carry on
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Solo servers are broken, Learath2 is reverting the change and deploying to serv ers
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and CHN has slow internet to ddnet.tw main server
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oof. ye, you can probably close CHN solo servers, nobody would even notice
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are no dedicated solo servers anyway
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay that should be all the servers
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now I'll join the servers they are cheating on and kill those by hand
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: wait so what is broken
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> see #bugs, solo mode
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you can touch others
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen since we'll have to delete the solo ranks from today anyway, I'll just restart the solo servers that are running the old version even if people are playing on them
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how will you enforce that people don't change server type to solo on other running servers?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think you have to pw-protect all, or alternatively remove solo option from votes (but that is super hacky)
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (and disable /map)
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen hm, ok Ill pw-protect old servers
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or remove all votes?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and disable sv_map
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean most people never change map anyway
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be less painful
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so sv_map 0, clearvotes
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what about servers that are already solo?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hard restart
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or get in with gdb and set them to solo 😄
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel bad for the people playing 😄
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it has to be done
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tell them you're sorry?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, version.h is broken again
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen somehow servers running 282508 show up as 15.0.5. 282508 is 15.1.3 :/
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well apparently all servers show up as 15.0.5 bow
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now*
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, I know why
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's my fault
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cmake caches the version and overwrites the one in version.h with a define
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have the same problem locally. A clean build should help. @heinrich5991 as the cmake expert might have a better idea
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh cmake gets it from version.h but caches it?
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> i have no eye on the ddnet proj so idk baut current issues so maybe this is known already see kill feed https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602950996.png
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that I can overwrite it for RCs and nightlies
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically cmake automatically detects when the version changes by looking at the git dir
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but we have consistently managed to break it
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: how to reproduce? Not known to me
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as a precatuion, maybe it would be good to just delete version.h (or wherever that thing is) before the build on ddnet.tw
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that information is kind of crucial and hard to see when it is wrong
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> idk saw it first time @deen its probably the ppl reconnecting I can also provide the demo if it helps
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: if the demo reproduces it, would be great
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> k hope i dont forget after the run
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 but version.h is not auto-generated, it just reads the define. I guess a `touch version.h` should work
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As a precaution we should always rm -rf the build dir and create a new one
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I do that for the releases
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean in build.sh
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking maybe we should get rid of version.h
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could add a game/generated/version.h instead which cmake can generate
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This reading from version.h sounds redundant to me
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> timeout code 123 last stage at Patchwork 6h time tho xd timeout any minute
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, cmake seems to have no way to distinguish between a variable set in the cache and a variable set on the command line
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767074237025746994/2020-10-18_00-30-59.mp4
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :nervous: really can't beat real dyncam
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> me playing fng with my dyncam without changing habits. still suck at aim with that thing on.
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but at least i won't feel sick i guess?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 did you delete ranks and teamranks on solo maps already?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not yet
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^ can i somehow view the 4 surpressed clang-tidy errors?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the first one is easy to fix, are the 4 surpressed ones irrelevant or do i first get to see them when i fixed the first one?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> '1 warning treated as error'
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe shouldve read the whole message
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: you around?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> whats dis
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> oh
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> dev
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Дядя Женя what gpu u have btw
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you know that ssh reads from standard input?....
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CHL really is one potato server...
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's wrong with Chile?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's having trouble connecting to the debian mirror took like a minute
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, not too bad
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> recently they shut down the server every day for 4 days because they thought I didn't pay, bu tI did
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then they broke the system clock
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we noticed because people had finishes before maps were released
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I set up a little script to get the versions of finishes from teehistorian files on the servers
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Jupstar ✪ gigabyte gtx 1660 ti
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ty
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't have a fallback to our actual teehistorian database so it can only check however much we have on the servers, but I think that should be enough
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 not sure I would do that straight on servers, might cause lags
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe do it from our teehistorian mirrors
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's rather trivial to parse the header
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's in json
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm still syncing back my teehistorian backup, so my server is not complete yet 😄
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen hm, /root/.ssh/authorized_keys doesn't seem to be the same on all servers
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rus's seem to be missing ddnet.tw's
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chl too
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rus, chl, usa, jap, sgp, zaf all seem to be missing root@ddnet.tw's key on their root so the main server can't ssh to them
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With this many servers we really should look into something like ansible to deploy these so they end up identical
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CHN3 can't even resolve it's debian mirror
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even though it's mirror is located in china
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk who hosts `http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com` but it seems to be out of commision and chn6 and chn3 use it
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oof
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fix it
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> looks like Alibaba's
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The apt settings are generated with some cloud magic I'm not familiar with, not sure if I'm allowed to even touch it
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> There should be other mirrors. I remember both Peking university  tsinghua university host mirrors for a lot of things
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> There should be other mirrors. I remember both Peking university  and tsinghua university host mirrors for a lot of things
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/debian/
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> They do
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> debian has a load balancer mirror in cn too, the problem is idk where to change it 😛
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> usually the mirror would just be used in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath using a linux with systemd :monkalaugh:
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apt is not part of systemd yet thank god
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :dabbing:
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though it's the first time I've touched a system using cloud-init]
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Windows guy here, I'm out
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Oh right can I get a role
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which role would you like?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are the music bot now
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://guix.gnu.org/
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stallman approved distro
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 t it uses GNU Shepherd instead of the now ubiquitous systemd.
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Coded in scheme, lmao
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made with https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is why we can't have nice things, people who can't stop creating their own languages
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see how this prevent nice things
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Person A wants to create nice thing A-thing, A instead creates awesome-A-lang then codes A-thing in said lang. No one can read thus contribute to A-thing. So A-thing will never be nice
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wrong
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u assume people wont learn A lang to do said thing
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a rather fair assumption. When is the last time you learned an entire language to contribute to something or use something?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love learning new languages
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i have yet to find a project in a language unknown to me
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> C++ for ddnet
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I personally just use an alternative that is in/uses the 7 or so languages that I (and most of the programmers out there) are familiar with
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast it looks cute
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767125321279340574/kid-programming-a-robot.png
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't learn Guile to contribute to Shepherd, I'd use/contribute to OpenRC, minix, runit, busybox
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wow discord ruins it
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767125372890120222/unknown.png
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, transparencygang
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i would learn guile to contribute to GNU shepherd so gnu stallman recognizes me as a gnu propheyt
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gnu guile*
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How can alibabas debian mirror die? :/
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, tsinghua uni's mirror works fine
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hope I didn't break anything 😛
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ../src/engine/external/json-parser/json.c:402:65: runtime error: applying non-zero offset 5 to null pointer

22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ Should we exclude external?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but still sounds bad?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (we should probably update json.c)
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just ran it with all
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we pass in some bad json object?
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh or that
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, but doesnt sound healthy xd, but could ofc be false positiv
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, but doesnt sound healthy xd, but could ofc be false positive
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what is null at L402
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> CServerBrowser::LoadDDNetInfoJson()
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is the caller
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `(*(json_char **) &top->u.object.values) += string_length + 1;`
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ how did you figure out the caller btw?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> call stack from ubsan
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw east added the json parser 6 years ago, last commit on the json parser is from a year ago, an update might not be the worst idea
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I updated it to 1.1.0 3 years ago
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And there has been no new release since then
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/udp/json-parser/tags
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ can you print out the json we are passing json_parse_ex, see if it's malformed maybe?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=7003&p=68629#p68629
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (but even if a string is malformatted json the parser should not run into ub)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen #3108
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3108
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the fix
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, let's merge that?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we look into a more robust json parser?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, then i am finally free again
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and should I downport it into a new instant release?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because next release will take a few weeks at least
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> idc, just do what u want
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll remove the gl code that is not 3.3 some day
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and in 17 years we just default to 3.3
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when teeworlds gets 30 years old
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess teeworlds will be staying with gl1 for a loong while
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ u think anyone would be around in 17 years
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will*
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i rq before
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Of course we'll all be around and discussing about whether we should finally add accounts
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw @deen someone with intel had a crash even in gl 1.x ;D
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dont tag me then
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😄
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😦
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > btw @deen someone with intel had a crash even in gl 1.x ;D
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ then whats the point
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of the downgrade
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How come you tell me this after I prepare the release
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont get tagged or blamed xD
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But you changed most of the graphics code
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen ???? i tagged u
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if an older client helps them not crash
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/766714731188191282
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so there is something wrong in our code, but we can't reproduce it
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is something wrong in intel xD
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we had no such crash reports for years before
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i had no crash ever
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast not one i provocated
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the "we can't reproduce it" part
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd kill to see a crashdump :/
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen maybe the issue exist since forever but we didnt have enough players with x setups to get that
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it happen to anyone tech savvy enough to run it in a debugger?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all normies
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki no chance
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 enough to integrate the crash reporter?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen heh, I wish I had the time, maybe I can slowly work on it at nights
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295908390956433410/767003311290843136/unknown.png
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this for example would be a prove for a bug OUTSIDE the gl code,
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i checked and we never render such a huge quad, nor are we buffering chat text in not gl 3.3 in VRAM
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe we should ask someone who had the crash to give us teamviewer access?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295908390956433410/767003311290843136/unknown.png
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this for example would be a proof for a bug OUTSIDE the gl code,
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>

23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we install a debugger?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I'd be willing to help someone with it but it needs to be someone patient
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the worst is most of times they dont even speak english
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and someone that has good internet because Visual Studio is like 20G now
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gotta love windows
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt mingw smaller
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant u debug there
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Does gdb work on Windows?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh we actually cross-compile with mingw
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should be able to use gdb yeah
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but we don't have symbols, so I'll have to pray the crash still happens when I build on the guys computer :d
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, find me someone and I'll make it happen
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Then let's make a special build with symbols for that
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we get 1 guy reporting this issue per day, there must 100 more who don't report it
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, btw it's probably not the driver itself crashing, driver crashes lead to bsods on windows. It's probably either our code or the userspace part of the driver
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be evident on the crash screen btw, if the userspace part of the driver crashes windows will tell them
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw we did debug the crash
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the one guy with the intel gpu and me
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for like 1h
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and found nothing
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and when we updated his driver it instant worked
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't crash under debugging?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so do you have some backtrace, where did it crash exactly?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it random places
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well it just didnt continue processing
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so not a real crash, true
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it freezes?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt show anything anymore
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that was different from intel to intel
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you interrupt the program with a signal, where do you land? does it appear the program is still running?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes all threads were working
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no infinite loops
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nothing
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all threads are working as expected but nothing on the screen?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it internally died
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and on other intel platform probs the same behaviour caused crashes
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> instead of, whatever u want to call this
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, graphics debugging I'm not really good at
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not really possible
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on linux maybe with open source drivers
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but never heard of any bug or crash in linux the last 2-3 years
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there a way to make opengl verbose?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> already did that, but nothing really interesting
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice to have as a setting btw, something like `gfx_debug 1` we can tell people to enable so we can see it in the logs
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it requires opengl 4.3 tho
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well atleast the driver needs to support it
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I seriously hate all the graphics people
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> I F3
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did people debug their damn programs before 4.3 then???
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well amd and nvidia probs have tools
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but no standard
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ there are extensions for opengl 1.0 tho
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> U fix my problem @Jupstar ✪
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> :happy:
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i fixed nothing XD
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> u did
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> :c
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel fixed it for u
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> D:
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they successfully support gl 1.x
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> *clap*
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <☠BlackWolf☠> :brownbear:
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 btw its very hard to crash opengl
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bascailly only when uploading or deleting buffers
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everything else is defined somewhere in the specs
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> all drawing and shit is not allowed to crash
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how would you crash opengl anyway? it's just an api
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it says what the impl has todo
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its more a standard
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, i gave tw a try for modernization, failed, doesn't matter whom to blame, me or intel
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll stick with borderfix for the next 10 years 😄
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait, that means we need borderfix again?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well we need all gl 1.x stuff again
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was the idea of the new renderer xD
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I need to also revert all the fixed graphics?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nvidia and amd have like 90% marketshare.. so they all could easily get opengl 4.5 running
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just for 0.0001% of ppl
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ that is only for dgpu
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Intel has 60-70% total gpu market share
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> steam charts
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> everyone has intel cpus and they come with integrated gpus
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wow
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt mean its used
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have 4 computers in my household, all only with Intel

23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen let's revert #3108 for now and try to debug instead?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3108
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reverting all the graphics changes will be a whole mess
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but if it doesnt work, it doesnt work xD
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and borderfix being necessary again is another mess 😛
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Is the 0.7 client crashing for these people too?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought borderfix was independent since Teeworlds 0.7 also doesn't need borderfix and has opengl 1?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem is 0.7 still uses mostly 1.x code
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i'm aware, they use 3d textures without mipmapping
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen go in 0.7 load multimap into editor
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> zoom out
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0.7 try is completly useless
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you dont create mipmaps you can also NOT use 3d textures
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are we linking to GLEW correctly?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r we using glew?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 there are actually long error messages for glew linking specifically: https://ddnet.tw/downloads/win32.log
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ are there things like validation layers for opengl? xd
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767141152272416818/unknown.png
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is validateprogram
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can basically only crash opengl when creating binary data
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u may not crash opengl but u may be doing things wrong
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and not know it
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or drawing too much
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we need a crash xd
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh? what is even compiling glew.c??
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ does checking in order for `KHR_debug`, `ARB_debug_output` and `AMD_debug_output` sound about right?
