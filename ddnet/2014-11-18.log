09:42 <@deen> hi NOOOOOOB 
09:43 < NOOOOOOB> hi
09:45 < NOOOOOOB> i want change HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = 1; to dummy active weapon how i can do it ? who can help me ?
09:46 <@deen> What do you mean by "dummy active weapon"?
09:46 <@deen> in client or in server?
09:48 < NOOOOOOB> in client.cpp i want when dummy weapon is rifle example fire with active weapon dont change it to hammer (hammer fly)
09:49 < NOOOOOOB> some maps need dummy laser me its usefull or grenade under me
09:49 <@deen> ok
09:49 <@deen> client.cpp, line 555
09:49 < hannibal> hey all )
09:49 <@deen> HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = 1;
09:49 <@deen> change it to
09:49 <@deen> hm, or maybe just remove it^^
09:49 <@deen> hi hannibal 
09:50 < NOOOOOOB> i removed it later but its not work
09:50 <@deen> dummy should just keep his normal weapon, right?
09:50 <@deen> whichever it had right now
09:50 < NOOOOOOB> maybe need change 1 to m_ActiveWeapon
09:51 <@deen> ah yeah
09:51 <@deen> true
09:51 <@deen> HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = DummyInput.m_WantedWeapon
09:51 < NOOOOOOB> w8 for test
09:55 < NOOOOOOB> hmm its work ok but when i deactive cldummyhammer and turn on it again weapon change why ?
09:57 <@deen> i just tested and doesn't happen for me
09:57 <@deen> maybe you changed something else too?
10:01 < NOOOOOOB> hmmm idont think so i mean if you got all weapon when your active weapon is grenade if turn on cldummyhammer , dummy fir with grenade but when you turn off it and turn on it again weapon change to another weapons
10:02 <@deen> ah, i see it quickly changing
10:02 <@deen> but going immediately back to grenade
10:02 <@deen> ok, and now it breaks, you're right
10:03 <@deen> ah no, i tried with wrong code, sorry
10:03 <@deen> it works for me
10:03 <@deen> the only change i have is:
10:03 <@deen> 			HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = DummyInput.m_WantedWeapon;
10:04 < NOOOOOOB> i use original source i changed any thing i use HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = DummyInput.m_WantedWeapon; too
10:07 < NOOOOOOB> after turn off and turn on cldummyhammer weapon change idk why
10:07 <@deen> are you sure you recompiled?
10:10 < NOOOOOOB> ye
10:10 < NOOOOOOB> see
10:10 < NOOOOOOB> my code
10:10 < NOOOOOOB> http://img5013.photobox.co.uk/849145121b7709f27f048171c6c879cd3ae56c593169207d94a0dd4311420c7b0c80c3b8.jpg
10:10 <@deen> yeah, looks good
10:11 <@deen> sorry, i don't know why it works for me but not for you =/
10:12 < NOOOOOOB> hmm ok thanks for help and time 
10:12 < NOOOOOOB> <3
10:12 <@deen> np
10:38 < hannibal> deen: 
10:38 <@deen> hannibal: 
10:38 < hannibal> if i have a new entity-idea
10:38 < hannibal> where do i post it?
10:38 <@deen> forum sounds like a good idea
10:38 <@deen> but you can also tell me
10:39 < hannibal> Client / Server
10:39 <@deen> Server
10:39 < hannibal> i can't decide
10:39 < hannibal> ah
10:39 < hannibal> k
10:39 < hannibal> no i want to write it nicely, to make it sound like a good idea :D
10:39 < hannibal> wait for the post
10:48 < NOOOOOOB> deen: 
10:48 <@deen> yes?
10:48 < NOOOOOOB> i found it
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> why its not work for me
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> :D
10:49 <@deen> so, what's the reason?
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> becuase you change weapon with number keys 1 2 3 4 5
10:49 <@deen> aaah
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> but if u use scroll
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> mouse
10:49 <@deen> yeah, totally forgot about that
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> its not work :d
10:49 <@deen> mouse scroll doesn't set wanted weapon^^
10:49 < NOOOOOOB> yes
10:50 < NOOOOOOB> any way exited to fix it ?
10:50 < NOOOOOOB> existed*
10:52 < NOOOOOOB> i mean how can fix it ? work with scroll too ?
10:53 <@deen> hm
10:57 <@deen> i think just don't set m_WantedWeapon at all
10:57 <@deen> but then it randomly changes weapon for me
10:58 < NOOOOOOB> yes randomly change weapon for me2
10:58 < NOOOOOOB> brb 30min for launch , more think about that :p
10:59 <@deen> ok, fixed
10:59 <@deen> 			HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = DummyInput.m_WantedWeapon;
10:59 <@deen> 			HammerInput.m_NextWeapon = DummyInput.m_NextWeapon;
10:59 <@deen> 			HammerInput.m_PrevWeapon = DummyInput.m_PrevWeapon;
11:14 < hannibal> deen: 
11:14 < hannibal> wall of text for you in the forum 
11:23 <@deen> i don't like it at all
11:23 < hannibal> shit :(
11:23 <@deen> but i could have told you that if you just wrote me 1 line^^
11:24 < hannibal> i liked to write it :D
11:24 < hannibal> but why
11:24 <@deen> it's entirely different game
11:24 < hannibal> not if you use it.. carefully.
11:24 < NOOOOOOB> deen: thats it 
11:24 < NOOOOOOB> its work ok now 
11:24 <@deen> NOOOOOOB: =)
11:24 < NOOOOOOB> :D
11:25 <@deen> hannibal: and i don't imagine it to be easy to implement
11:25 < NOOOOOOB> deen: thank you sorry i take your time 
11:25 <@deen> NOOOOOOB: no problem
11:25 < NOOOOOOB> <3
11:25 < hannibal> that was what i was thinking too. very hard to code
11:25 <@deen> i don't see how it fits into ddrace to fight enemies
11:26 < hannibal> that's what my examples are for!
11:26 <@deen> yeah, they don't sound like ddrace, they sound like shooter games
11:26 <@deen> actually that's what i love most about ddrace, that you just help others and don't fight^^
11:26 < hannibal> but.. but. they are not real ;D
11:27 < hannibal> the real ones are still friends :D
11:30 < laxadedi> hannibal: bots would not be in the spirit of ddrace
11:30 < laxadedi> I agree with deen
11:30 < hannibal> imagine yourself without weapons, a bot running after you. there is 1 kill tile somewhere in a gore part and you have to make him walk in there or something
11:30 < hannibal> soooo many
11:30 < hannibal> possibilities to make it ddrace-spirity
11:34 < laxadedi> Not at all, it would be a different mod to me
11:35 < laxadedi> the only enemy in ddrace/race is the time, and it's should not change
11:35 < hannibal> i don't like freeze tiles either.
11:35 < laxadedi> the problem is not the freeze tile
11:35 < laxadedi> the problem is mapper
11:35 < laxadedi> that does'nt understand that they should use unfreeze tile nearly everywhere
11:36 < laxadedi> but apparently, I am the only one to think that...
11:36 < hannibal> :D we are talking about different things.
11:36 < hannibal> but i guess you are right.
11:37 < hannibal> it would be a new mod
11:37 < hannibal> DDRPG or something :D
11:44 < hannibal> hm.
11:44 < hannibal> still thinking :D

18:56 < Nimda> Welf is currently playing No Name 1 on server : DDNet GER - Test #2 [DDraceNetwork].
19:38 <@deen> good job maple
19:38 < maple> ??
21:33 <@deen> laxa: i think TS server is down
21:34 <@deen> or not and forris is just banned^^
21:34 < laxa> no
21:34 < laxa> it's working
21:34 < laxa> and forris isn't banned
21:34 < laxa> make him try ddracepro.net
21:35 <@deen> i found out today that my recent problems were not caused by the intel compiler...
21:36 <@deen> instead 2 bits of my main memory are not working
21:36 <@deen> lucky that you can disable part of the memory in linux
21:37 <@EastByte> ^
21:38 <@deen> i think that's the first time memory has failed for me
21:38 <@EastByte> how did you check the memory?
21:38 <@deen> memtest86+
21:38 <@deen> it told me the defective byte, then disabled it with memmap kernel parameter
21:39 <@EastByte> neat
21:40 <@deen> much better than removing 2 GB of RAM or buying new hardware for this old computer
21:42 <@EastByte> hmm, the next time a friend tells me his ram is dead, I'll demand it ^^
