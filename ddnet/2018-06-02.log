12:54 <+jxsl13> does anyone know how to pass the "r" interactive command to gdb using a bash script? like gdb ./executable <<"r" ?
12:54 <+jxsl13> to invoke the debugging using a bash script
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> hi developers
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im just guessing but isnt the | pipe operator used to pipe one output into another programm
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe its ``echo "r" | gdb ./exe`` but as i said im just guessing didnt test it
14:27 <+jxsl13> for now I'm using a command file, that is supported by gdb which contains the commands to execute.
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah oke
14:28 <+jxsl13> --command filepath
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah cool to know
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> could it be that the master servers of teeworlds don't support ipv6 connection?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://i.imgur.com/02jKlWz.png
14:29 <+jxsl13> aaaa is ipv6?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> y
14:30 <+jxsl13> if they got no ipv6 how to add those records?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> but kinda hard to imagine that they don't support ipv6 connections
14:30 <+jxsl13> that's not what that message say, I think
14:31 <+jxsl13> I think they do supports ipv6, but their domain does not have an own ipv6 adress?
14:31 <+jxsl13> address*
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> well tried to make IPv6 default for my script and it can't resolve the host apparently
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> ```  protected 'message' => string 'socket_sendto(): Host lookup failed [-10001]: Unknown host' (length=58)```
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> masters dont support opv6
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> masters dont support ipv6
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> so the servers itsself can't run on IPv6 only?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> since you can't register it on the master servers?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the server it self has ipv6
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> y but wouldn't be findable if IPv6 only
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> k can scrap the issue to make IPv6 default then i guess
14:38 <+jxsl13> btw, any of the tw forum mods wanna buy some viagra? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12480
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 2001:41d0:2:a651::eb12
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats the ipv6 of master3 btw
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxD jxsl13
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> classical sp someone respond xd
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> reverse lookup of this ipv6 is twmaster3.teecloud.de though
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://i.imgur.com/ONUBNRZ.png
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye ikr
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Anderson is hosting master3
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 do you know which image is used for overlay entities?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lemme check
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> okay
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> data/editor/entities_clear/ddnet.png
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well thats it, not too easy to read code on a phone :P
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> okay thanks
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ðŸ˜„
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I'm mostly working on server side code, so idk much about the client one
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye client sux
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @ChillerDragon such a better overlay to play c:
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/452501077187887114/screenshot_2018-06-02_17-56-08.png
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> grr
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u cant even tell what map it is without design
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> default tw look is best o.O
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ye  it looks better than norma entities
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yeap, but I always play like that because it is easier for my eyes
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but you can't count blocks if necessary
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> grass main is pretty difficult too sometimes
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if u play in the same zoom u get a feeling or even if u play in different zooms you could assume tiles in zooz even without borders
20:44 <+jxsl13> @noby online?
20:44 <+jxsl13> @onby
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> anyone online ._.?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I'm trying to implement a nickname ban, but somehow it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt ._. I check if the nick's in a ban list after it is set in the gamecontext.cpp after the SetClientName() calls, am I missing some other parts ?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> and forcing a server()->kick()
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or not that i know
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> weird
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> somtimes is really werid
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> lol, what's the difference when accessing the name via pMsg->m_pName or via Server()->ClientName(ID) the first one works, the seconds one doesn't
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if its still connecting the nickname will be (connecting)
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> otherwise theyll be the same
22:27 <+jxsl13> @heinrich5991 would you mind explaining the teehistorian format to me, so that I could do a c implementation to read it?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what are u working on jxsl13?
22:30 <+jxsl13> nothing for now
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Devloperz btw im having super slow out tabbing expirience on my ddnet 11.1.8 client since the new windows 10 update today
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woops i didnt ment to ping i even wrote it different
22:31 <+jxsl13> I have added a player tracking to my mod, so if I see players that looks like a bot (especially grenade bots), I track them using the teehistorian file format, until they leave the game
22:31 <+jxsl13> thus I'd like to analyze the data
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why not tracking 24/7?
22:32 <+jxsl13> what sense does it make to track 24/7?
22:32 <+jxsl13> I need positive cases
22:32 <+jxsl13> separated from normal players
22:32 <+jxsl13> if I want data from normal players, I could do 24/7 tracking :D
22:32 <+jxsl13> also possible, tho
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where do u know that people use bots in grenade lol?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean how
22:33 <+jxsl13> I played against one
22:33 <+jxsl13> :D
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> english on point
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how do u know?
22:34 <+jxsl13> Reaction time  and accuracy as well as movement predition of that bot was inhumane, thus it was a bot
22:34 <+jxsl13> harder to see when it's concealed
22:34 <+jxsl13> but it was a 1on1 and it was clearly visible
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo btw some1 reported me he can't connect to exec servers with win10 and newest ddnet client because client crashes on connect. I asked vali and they have some new anti spoof idk how it works but i saw dm1 for one sec when connecting. Ik we dont have to support custom servers but crashbugs can be very dangerous for people mapping with ddnet client and not saving every time they close it.
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Would be cool if some1 with debbugging skills could take a look at it c: 
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I couldnt recreate the crash but some namless tee said he had it every time
23:24 <+Stitch626> is anyone of the ddnet admin team online right now?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> Yes I am here. What's the problem?
23:25 <@deen> Stitch626: what's up?
23:26 <+Stitch626> this server here (https://mein-twserver.de:8877/screenshot_2018-06-02_23-18-35.png) is claimed as official server, is it really a official one?
23:26 <@deen> nope
23:27 <+Stitch626> you should request a ban then maybe
23:27 <@deen> if it's not listed here it's not official: https://info.ddnet.tw/info
23:27 <@deen> well, i don't think we have some trademark for "ddnet official"
23:28 <+Stitch626> I think it could confuse players
23:28 <@deen> certainly
23:29 <+Stitch626> however, I was just here to report that. I'll be off again
23:29 <+Stitch626> bb
23:31 <@deen> thanks
