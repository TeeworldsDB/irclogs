00:51 < bridge_> <peter0x44> You just need to hit the API manually to get rid of them
01:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> ah
01:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> i made a ticket anyway but i will do that sooner or later
01:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe mine will send it over the edge and get somebody looking at the issue
01:18 < bridge_> <peter0x44> https://discord.com/channels/792780131906617355/814785640667152404/1420298899754848408
01:18 < bridge_> <peter0x44> it's exactly the same thing described here
01:18 < bridge_> <peter0x44> you aren't the first
01:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> obvious and evident by the thread you send me
01:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> they have to have enough complaints about a certain issue to justify getting a dev on it most of the time
01:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> you still should use the official feedback mechanisms
13:01 < Giraffe> [chat]: Aoe: I sucked off a black dude before
13:05 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> wot
13:05 < Giraffe_> I was looking through old demos
13:10 < Giraffe_> [chat]: Aoe: gdin: Forris is my cock slut
13:16 < bridge_> <aegisub> :mariolook:
14:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hmm how realisitic is it that a snapshot from a teeworlds 0.7 release contains garbage values? <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653>
14:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im stuck once again ._.
14:09 < furo> Impossible, 0.7 has no bugs!
14:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** The hex byte 0x44 unpacks as int to a -5
14:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `CUnpacker Unpacker;unsigned char aData[] = {0x44};Unpacker.Reset(aData, sizeof(aData));log_info("unpack", "int %d", Unpacker.GetInt());`
14:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `2025-10-13 14:09:29 I unpack: int -5`
14:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** I am looking at the following snap `10 04 02 59 13 f3 4e 3d df 5c a6 dd bf 6e 53 1c b4 7b 8c c1 19 b4 58 ff ff ff 9a ad b8 01`
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** which contains two messages
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** only the huffman decompressed snap single looks like this `00 22 11 BA 26 04 8F 71 1B 00 01 00 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 44 00 00`
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it is a obj character
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** this is not the first snap so it is a delta
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thus we have all the 00
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** note the 44 at the end
14:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that is the emote
14:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so the emote is set to -5 which is illegal i suppose
14:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** anyways its fine because its just a diff
14:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait what even is the emote is that emoticon or eye emote?
14:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh
14:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thats eyes isnt it
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `Emotes = Enum("EMOTE", ["NORMAL", "PAIN", "HAPPY", "SURPRISE", "ANGRY", "BLINK"])`
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** aaaaaaaaa
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok fair
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so the tee stopped blinking
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** blink is 5
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 5-5=0
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** we end up normal
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oo
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** all good. I thought it was emoticon and there was no prior emoticon
14:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fakin eye emote vs above head emoticion naming, sry

14:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I got drunk every day of sober doctored
14:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> October
14:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if i got corona again lol
14:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> last time i was thaat sick it was corona too
14:40 < bridge_> <Teero> Nah you don't have corona
14:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks Dr. Web
14:40 < bridge_> <Teero> you use rust
14:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes but my friends not
14:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Rust is also a fever dream
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my whole life is a fever dream
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> heating system is broken since weaks
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> warm water breaks once per week
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> almost burned my flat last week
14:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now i was almost dead by illness
14:42 < bridge_> <Teero> Idk bro at least you have a good cpu
14:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i deleted my ssd xDD
14:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how much can a single jupstar handle
14:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> before his pysche breaks
14:42 < bridge_> <Teero> clone yourself
14:44 < bridge_> <blue bencie> I'm afraid Jupsti doesn't implement copy
14:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I say nothing to that
14:44 < bridge_> <blue bencie> :topkekMate:
14:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Rust book is online
14:45 < bridge_> <Teero> Wouldn't have happened if he was writing c code
14:45 < bridge_> <Teero> He would be on the streets by now
14:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Let's face it. I transformed from Rust coder to vibe coder
14:46 < bridge_> <Teero> the clock was the final push
14:57 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> whole data or only partition tables?
14:58 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> they can be recovered using testdisk, either manually or read the sectors for fdisk
14:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i could restore some stuff, tbh idc anyway. reset is like being reborn
14:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> new life = new chances
14:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> new chances = adventure
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how u doing
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my kernel dev been slowed by... gaming
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i hope i dont forget all the details by the time i work on it again
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what r u even gemin. still dota?
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dota, ffxiv, hackmud
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mainly ffxiv xd
18:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> what an awful day to have 16gb of ram :feelsbadman:
18:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1427332355621654679/image.png?ex=68ee7a58&is=68ed28d8&hm=2fd73ede585ff9b2dd54dca9689c2cbe108ac7ded1e475196338987b6f0595ee&
18:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you llvm contributor now. you smth better
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> go in hardware store
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and tell them
18:30 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it's time to use nano for viewing big C++/Rust projects
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and then take the ram and leave
18:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Did you see the pr? It's one character change xdd
18:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Out of the way. I am llvm contributor
18:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ppl will make you way
18:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It just has to sound important
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so who is to blame for all the bugs i have in wayland but not in x11?
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** can we fix that in ddnet?
18:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i play one gores part and then it changes my desktop background or opens a gnome web page on my second screen
18:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i change my mouse position in client on screen 1 and if i click i fire in client on screen 2
18:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** moving clients from one screen to another with the keyboard shortcut takes like 6 tries
18:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** depending on the direction xd
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> your second screen
18:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i used to player hammerhit maps on 2 clients
18:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** now i cant even do basic gameplay
18:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh so i need to disconnect screens to fix wayland? xd
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's called wayland not waylands
18:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i see xd
18:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so x11 breaks on the 12th screen?
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you understand the logic
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i want x11 back
18:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> honestly.. me too
18:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or smth new that works
18:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i need my system to be multi screen gaming optimized
18:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its what i do
18:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i was hoping someone would fix the bugs
18:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i have the feeling i have to complain my self
18:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i just dont know where
18:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my the sdl goats can help
18:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno i bet it's some gnome bug xd
18:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> did it ever work with wayland active?
18:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
18:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe i should switch to hyperland then it has hyper in the name it must be pog
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> going more hipster always worked to fix problems with stability
20:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
20:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> the hyprland is like 12 years old but somehow the compositor itself seems very solid
20:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> the hyprland developer is like 12 years old but somehow the compositor itself seems very solid
20:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> would you look at that, I reported it through the official mechanism and got an official response
20:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1427366480978251848/image.png?ex=68ee9a20&is=68ed48a0&hm=2cdfa860abd807580fd9a4c7f02fb0d31a63b6f6c00b04c35fde8cf5ab5e1f91&
20:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> i didn't see a single GitHub representative on that thread lmfao
22:10 < bridge_> <Assa> @robyt3 can you explain to me, what's the issue with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/11006 ?
22:10 < bridge_> <Assa> As I am currently porting unique to the latest ddnet version, I'd really like to know
22:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't know more than what's written in the comment. The community admins were contacted and some haven't provided any timeline for when their servers will start sending community tokens.
22:33 < bridge_> <Assa> I am talking to heinrich rn, it looks like we could easily make half of unique servers do that, but the other half needs the library, atm I am just waiting from an answer from tim
22:41 < bridge_> <Assa> oh and thank you :3
23:45 < bridge_> <totar> lol?
23:53 < bridge_> <totar> I wonder if it's because ninja movebox doesn't apply ramp? so it checks a huge distance?
23:53 < bridge_> <totar> I wonder if it's because ninja movebox doesn't apply ramp? so it checks a huge distance?
23:54 < bridge_> <totar> but ramp might already be applied at that point idk
23:55 < bridge_> <totar> @teero777 what do you think?
23:56 < bridge_> <Teero> am ingame rn gonna check in a bit
23:58 < bridge_> <Teero> yes that is it. remember that ramp is only applied and then unapplied after calling movebox. but ninja doesn't do that.
23:59 < bridge_> <totar> oh it's unapplied after movebox
23:59 < bridge_> <Teero> so you can have infinite sideways speed. nice
23:59 < bridge_> <totar> yes then that's it for sure
