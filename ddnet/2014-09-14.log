00:01 < Nimda> Translation: Wurst
00:13 < Savander> deen: 
00:13 < Savander> its possible to set
00:13 < Savander> amount of ammo
00:14 < Savander> for example, grenade will have only one shot?
00:14 < Savander> in area?
00:14 < Savander> meh you know :D
00:14 < Savander> you pickup grenade with one ammo
00:15 <@deen> no
00:15 <@deen> impossible and i think it is against the holy spirit of ddrace
00:15 < Savander> but for some parts
00:16 < Savander> It' may add new things
00:16 < Savander> new ideas
00:16 < Savander> ^^
00:26 < Savander> btw, gores servers is not that bad.. I think, gores it's another type of map, for skilled players and with different gameplay than other maps :), So, own server for gores will be cool.
00:26 < Savander> :)
00:29 < Savander> deen: 
00:30 < laxa> there is already gores server...
00:30 < laxa> Qshar
00:30 < laxa> even if it is really badly configured
00:31 < Savander> but
00:31 < Savander> i talking about ddnet.
00:32 < Savander> not "Qshar"
00:32 < laxa> yeah
00:32 < laxa> steal players
00:32 < laxa> is b ad
00:32 < laxa> in order to host a gores server
00:32 < laxa> you would need to take all their maps
00:32 < laxa> and if you look at the poll on the forum
00:32 < laxa> more people are against than for this
00:33 <@deen> laxa: there is qshar in iran, south africa, usa, south america, china and russia?
00:34 < laxa> that's right
00:34 < Savander> for me, Gores server will be good
00:35 < Savander> maybe with ddnet, mappers will create more good gores maps..
00:36 < laxa> Well to be honest
00:36 < laxa> I don't know how to make the difference between a good gores and a bad one
00:37 < Savander> I don't said, current gores maps are bad?
00:37 < Savander> i just say, "mapper will create MORE good gores maps"
00:39 <@deen> maybe someone could also create block maps?!
00:40 <@deen> they always play the same boring block maps
00:40 < laxa> I think
00:40 < laxa> we should not try to create maps from a mod we don't like
00:40 < laxa> *for
00:40 < Savander> a lot of ppls like block maps
00:41 < Savander> it's doesn't matter what we like? i guess
00:41 < laxa> block is boring and mostly only noobs play it
00:41 < Savander> if ppls want block maps
00:41 < laxa> gameplay is really simple
00:41 < laxa> that's why so many people play it
00:41 < Savander> Maybe, but ppls like it :P :D
00:47 < Savander> Max players seen online: 43
00:47 < Savander> HAH
00:47 < Savander> xD
00:47 < Savander> Yay, new record
00:47 < Savander> xD
00:47 < laxa> I'd like to know the max players seen online for ddnet
00:47 < laxa> but deen doesn't like this feature :(
00:49 < Savander> ^^
00:56 <@deen> 407
00:56 < laxa> nice
00:56 <@deen> earlier today
01:02 < Savander> good night
01:02 < Savander> :)
01:48 < laxa> deen: the master server doesn't know about the 64 players right ?
02:06 < laxa> deen: I think your status page is doing something wrong
02:07 < laxa> I feel like teamspeak users are counted into the total players !
02:07 < laxa> I just finished to code my script to get total players on ddnet
02:07 < laxa> and I have a difference of players inside TS
02:15 <@deen> laxa: no they're not
02:16 <@deen> laxa: yes, masterserver doesn't know
02:16 < laxa> Hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
02:16 < laxa> what is wrong in my script then !
02:16 <@deen> laxa: maybe you don't get all ddnet servers
02:16 < laxa> I do that
02:16 <@deen> how would you know all?
02:16 < laxa> if (strpos($server["name"], "[DDraceNetwork]") !== FALSE || strpos($server["name"], "[DDNet]") !== FALSE)
02:16 <@deen> that's wrong
02:16 < laxa> from list of masterserver
02:16 <@deen> ah
02:16 <@deen> you have bad connection to chile
02:17 <@deen> you will never get all players from there
02:17 <@deen> i always have packet loss to chile
02:17 <@deen> so i request each server 3 times
02:17 < laxa> I get servers from masterserver
02:17 < laxa> lol
02:17 < laxa> I'll do my own, max seen online for ddnet :p
02:18 < laxa> do you know if
02:18 < laxa> $mySQL->query("update online set online=".$total.", created=\"".$date."\" where id=0");
02:18 < laxa> create the entry if it doesn't exist ?
02:19 <@deen> no it doesn't
02:19 <@deen> but there is a way to specify it
02:19 <@deen> and google knows
02:19 < laxa> you too xD
02:19 < laxa> but I'll create it by hand
02:19 <@deen> no, i don't know, but i can google for you
02:19 < laxa> No !
02:20 < laxa> I make it by hand
02:21 <@deen> you could just wget the ddnet.tw/status website
02:21 <@deen> and there you have the max players value
02:26 < laxa> boahhhhhhhhh
02:26 < laxa> I still have a difference of 2 players
02:26 < laxa> I really feel like you are counting the TS users :p
02:29 <@deen> no
02:29 <@deen> just count...
02:29 <@deen> on the left side in the menu it says server count for each server
02:30 <@deen> also, TS is empty right now
02:31 <@deen> ah, and player count fluctuates a lot
02:31 <@deen> can be +- 10 in a minute
02:32 < laxa> oh, it's refreshed every minute
02:32 < laxa> ok that explains it
02:40 < laxa> fuck my life
02:40 < laxa> my script doesn't work using wget
02:41 < laxa> and that's cause I am fucking retard !
02:42 <@deen> it's refreshed every 2 minutes
02:56 < laxa> deen: question
02:57 < laxa> is it possible to not receive any mail from a crontab job ?
03:07 <@deen> yes
03:07 <@deen> i think i should just ignore you or you will never start asking google
03:09 < laxa> xD
03:09 < laxa> yeah I found out about that
11:21 < Savander> hi
11:22 < EastBite> good morning

12:25 < laxa> Savander: I have made a script to record max online for ddnet, you want it ? :p
12:27 < Savander> but
12:27 < Savander> i have one from you?
12:27 < Savander> or not?xD
12:27 < laxa> Yeah, but this one uses less CPU and is made for crontab
12:27 < Savander> Ah
12:28 < Savander> this use?
12:28 < Savander> another language?
12:28 < Savander> :P
12:28 < laxa> no
12:28 < laxa> I get users by getting ddnet.tw/statujs
12:28 < laxa> instead of loading from TwRequest
12:28 < Savander> oh
12:28 < Savander> okay, so if you want give me :D. :3
12:35 < laxa> http://pastebin.com/eA72nGUB
12:36 <@deen> nice Savander =)
12:41 < laxa> Savander: that's only the recorder, I hope you'll know how to display it if you want then :p
12:42 < laxa> deen: saw the new video I linked for hall of fame ?
12:44 <@deen> yes
12:46 <@deen> 20 subscribers already!
13:11 < Savander> thanks :)

13:13 <@deen> Savander: nice that you have regular players
13:13 < Savander> ahh
13:13 < Savander> ye :)

13:13 < Savander> every day 30+ players
13:13 < Savander> :D :D
13:13 < Savander> im really happy
13:16 <@deen> hi XXLTomate 
13:16 <@deen> and welcome to DDNet
13:16 < XXLTomate> Hey deen
13:17 < XXLTomate> thank you :-)
13:20 <@deen> 60 players on HDP_Obstaculos^^
13:20 < Savander> Hello :)
13:20 < Savander> thanks laxa  :P :D
13:21 < Savander> :)
13:22 <@deen> full server, that happens rarely outsideof tournaments
13:22 < laxa> that's the proof that people like simple gameplay...
13:22 < laxa> I feel like this map is really boring
13:22 <@deen> yes, it is
13:23 <@deen> but fun with big groups
13:34 < laxa> I hate big groups
13:36 <@deen> i must have pulled at least 30 people through this part right now^^
13:36 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/xSlBlvWC7705
13:36 < Savander> yay
13:36 < Savander> laxa: i fix your script a bit :P
13:36 < laxa> wtf you say
13:36 < laxa> my script is perfect
13:36 < Savander> no
13:36 < Savander> ;D
13:36 < Savander> first.
13:37 < Savander> You use reference in bad way for php 5.4
13:37 < laxa> ?!
13:37 < Savander>  preg_match("#DDraceNetwork Status: ([0-9]{1,10}) player#", $page_status, &$array);
13:37 < Savander> &$array
13:37 < Savander> no &$array
13:37 < Savander> $array
13:37 < Savander> for PHP 5.4 is fatal error :P, (deprecated i guess)
13:38 < Savander> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8971261/php-5-4-call-time-pass-by-reference-easy-fix-available
13:38 < Savander> read this
13:38 < Savander> and next (only for me)
13:38 < Savander> id=1 to id=0, ncm
13:38 < Savander> nvm :P
13:39 < laxa> id=0 should be ddforce max seen online
13:40 < laxa> unless you create another database with another table
13:40 < laxa> I didn't knew for the reference, so I'll fix it now
14:27 < Savander> no problem
15:41 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/1OAJP6yt7842
15:41 < Savander> again LOL
15:41 < Savander> XD
15:59 < XXLTomate> So DDNet seems to be the new hope for DDRace
16:00 < XXLTomate> It's nice to see someone invests so much time and effort into it :-)
16:06 <@deen> =)
16:06 <@deen> XXLTomate: Will you be there for the tournament at 20:00?
16:06 <@deen> On the servers or livestream
16:06 <@deen> Although the website may go down, but i hope to keep the tournament alive during the ddos attacks
16:10 < XXLTomate> A ddnet tournament? Or another game mode?
16:10 <@deen> yes, ddnet
16:10 < XXLTomate> I try to be here but can't promise
16:11 < XXLTomate> oh will try, its at least 2 years ago when I played ddrace the last time
16:12 <@deen> Should be something like this: http://youtu.be/WQ17c5gh7bs
16:12 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Novice Teeworlds DDNET Tournament [FullHD] | Rating: 5.00/5.00 | Views: 2,211
16:13 < XXLTomate> haha nice, with a moderator
16:53 <@deen> laxa: is your script running to record the new player record in 10 minutes? :P
16:53 < laxa> deen: it's in crontab with * * * * *
16:53 <@deen> so what's the max you've seen so far?
16:54 < laxa> ddracepro.net/status
16:54 < laxa> look the bottom of the page
16:54 < laxa> 388 currently
16:57 < Savander> hi
16:57 <@deen> hi
16:57 <@deen> i really miss my hi-bind on irc
16:58 < Savander> xD
16:59 < Savander> wow
16:59 < Savander> DDRace FRA - BLOCKER 33 players
16:59 < Savander> mhm
16:59 <@deen> yeah, it was the fullest server in teeworlds earlier today
16:59 < Savander>  :}
16:59 < Savander> n1
17:00 < Savander> still
17:00 < Savander> fullest servger
17:00 < Savander> ;o
17:04 <@deen> oh shit, i accidentally shut the tournament servers down again^^
17:42 < laxa> deen: if you there could I ask you a question ? :)
17:43 < laxa> btw, you can delete/move Not Adrenaline 4 demo too, it's not rank 1
17:43 <@deen> ?
17:44 < laxa> ok
17:44 < laxa> kill `ps aux | grep -i -E 'gores|pro|private|ddnet|jeet|encore|zcatch|oldschool|ctf|race|teeworlds' | awk ' { print $2 } '`
17:44 < laxa> this line returns : process xxx : no such process
17:44 < laxa> I have no idea why
17:45 <@deen> this sounds really dangerous
17:45 < EastBite> it's not :D
17:45 <@deen> if an important process contains the word "pro" it is just killed...
17:45 < laxa> yeah I know that
17:45 < laxa> but I don't have any other way to kill the servers
17:46 <@deen> killall?
17:47 < laxa> hum
17:47 < laxa> I'll investigate :p
17:47 <@deen> laxa: i think your max players happened when ddnet and ddmax had a ddos attack
17:48 < laxa> Max players seen online : 56 the 2013-07-02 15:31:35 CET/CEST.
17:48 < laxa> that was July 2013
17:48 <@deen> yes
17:49 <@deen> oh wait, that was before ddnet^^
17:49 <@deen> actually just a few days before we started
17:50 < laxa> That's what I am saying :p
17:50 <@deen> I'm really bad with dates
17:52 <@deen> New player record!
17:52 < laxa> xD
17:52 < laxa> you don't want this feature
17:52 < laxa> but you sure do it by yourself :p
17:52 <@deen> yes!
17:53 < laxa> Congratz
17:53 < laxa> 408
17:53 < laxa> !
17:53 <@deen> 1 more than yesterday
17:54 < laxa> I can do regexp with killall ?
17:55 <@deen> i always do the explicit name
17:55 <@deen> so i don't accidentally kill something else
17:59 < laxa> kill `ps aux | grep -iE "/home/laxa/Teeworlds_servers/" | awk ' { print $2 } '`
17:59 < laxa> should be 100% safe and good right ?
18:00 <@deen> no idea!
18:00 < laxa> xD
18:00 < EastBite> I would rather store the pid and make a process handler for it
18:00 < laxa> I am too noob for that :p
18:04 < laxa> ok
18:04 < laxa> I know what's wrong in my script
18:04 < laxa> that kills the grep command, but it's already dead when it tries to kill
18:08 < laxa> ok fixed :p
18:12 <@deen> EastBite: yeah, that's the proper way
18:15 < laxa> deen: more and more players are doing this shit DDRace drag through all map !
18:16 <@deen> huh?
18:16 < laxa> ddnet.tw:8308 and watch artkis :p
18:17 <@deen> busy
18:18 <@deen> if GER stays up i'm hoping for 500 today
18:19 < laxa> xD
18:19 < laxa> artkis is like a dictator
18:19 < EastBite> deen: and atleast a hundred gigabyte traffic :D
18:20 <@deen> yeah, I'd guess it will be over 100 GB for all servers combined
18:21 < EastBite> artkis and everyon just switched the server
18:21 <@deen> well, thanks to a DDoS earlier today we already have 80 GB on GER alone^^
18:21 < EastBite> oh cool
18:25 <@deen> ddos on fra incoming
18:25 < EastBite> lol
18:26 < EastBite> there are no players except blocker
18:26 <@deen> what? there are 90 players on FRA
18:27 <@deen> only 37 of them are blocker
18:32 < laxa> it's really funny, some people are calling him Arti-chan
18:32 < laxa> and he is so mad xD
18:41 < laxa> Max players seen online on DDNet: 443 the 2014-09-14 18:25:01 CET/CEST.
18:41 < laxa> !
18:41 < laxa> deen: do you allow me to make a plugin for the bot ?
18:42 < laxa> like this one
18:42 < laxa> !peak
18:42 < Nimda> Current channel peak for #ddnet: 14 users online at 2014-09-11 19:17:23 (2 days, 23 hours, 24 minutes and 45 seconds ago)
18:46 < EastBite> deen: then I couldn't see the server because of timeout
18:49 < EastBite> laxa: I thought you are running the bot
18:49 < laxa> I am
18:49 < laxa> but since deen doesn't want this feature on the website
18:49 < laxa> maybe he doesn't want it on the IRC chan
18:49 < laxa> who knows !
18:49 < EastBite> hem
18:50 < EastBite> I guess mapmapmapmapmap is the tournament map for today
18:56 < XXLTomate> deen: would you mind if I cherry-pick the spoof protection into XXLDDRace? https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/bf5fdadcd6482bdc0522ab7712a48fdb66470056
18:57 <@deen> XXLTomate: sure, i didn't even write that myself
18:58 < XXLTomate> good! Do you know who wrote it?
18:58 < XXLTomate> o_be_one: ^
19:02 <@deen> Yes, I know who, but he doesn't want to be known
19:02 <@deen> The people who use these bugs are not kind to people who fix them
19:02 <@deen> laxa: meh, do what you want^^
19:02 <@deen> also, FRA is still getting ddoses
19:02 <@deen> ddosed*
19:02 < laxa> how to get process's name ?

20:43 <@deen> hi
20:43 < o_be_one> does DDNet support the fast emote delay ?
20:43 <@deen> no
20:43 <@deen> i don't like it
20:43 < o_be_one> oh ok :(
20:43 <@deen> you can set it on the server, but i haven't
20:44 < o_be_one> i'll need to patch it so ...
20:44 <@deen> no patch needed, just a setting
20:44 < o_be_one> oh ok but we can set it ?
20:44 < o_be_one> cause there is a flood bug by default
20:44 < o_be_one> did you fix it ?
20:44 <@deen> i fixed many flood bugs
20:44 <@deen> don't know about this one since we never used the feature
20:44 < o_be_one> ok maybe i need to take a try so :)
20:44 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands
20:44 < o_be_one> ok well when its the ddrace feature, players can flood it and make other players crash
20:45 <@deen> maybe i really should use a server to constantly simulate a ddos attack on FRA^^
20:45 < o_be_one> ok its the original emote delay, not the fast :s
20:45 <@deen> i guess OVH wouldn't like that though
20:46 < o_be_one> setted at one, you cant make 10 emote by sec ^^
20:46 <@deen> can't you use sv_eye_emote_change_delay
20:46 < o_be_one> ill need to patch it so
20:46 < o_be_one> no
20:46 <@deen> eeh, who needs 10 per sec..
20:46 < o_be_one> emote change delay is for /emote
20:46 < EastBite> eveeryone!
20:46 < o_be_one> ahah all blocker players !
20:46 < o_be_one> i'm the first who flood this stupid shift button :D
20:46 < EastBite> blocker players think, ddosing & flooding is a tw feature
20:46 < o_be_one> when something make you laught, you push like 5 times the emote button to show that its funny for you
20:46 < bor> hi deen
20:46 <@deen> hi
20:47 < bor> king asked me to come here and ask you to run a tournament server for ddnet persian , some players want to participate in tournament from here
20:48 < EastBite> the tournament just finished
20:49 < o_be_one> is there a xxl like feature ?
20:49 < EastBite> what's that?
20:49 <@deen> bor: I'm pretty sure i was running one
20:50 <@deen> at least i ran the same script on every server and it ran everywhere else
20:53 < bor> ok , thanks..
20:57 <@deen> bor: yeah, i just checked, it was running, but somehow the server name is wrong
20:57 <@deen> my bad, but there were 2 playing
20:59 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/464.png
21:00 <@deen> i think an admin forced a mapchange in iran, which is why the name was wrong

21:23 <@deen> would be more interesting to make a graph of the number of players
21:26 < laxa> we could use tools that already exist for that
21:27 < laxa> and afaik

21:27 < laxa> http://www.teeworlds-stats.info/
