00:00 <@deen> It looked terrible to just fill the screen with 200 german flags :P
00:30 < Chairn> well, then its buggy
00:30 < Chairn> i appear with no flag
00:31 < Chairn> and in last month points, i got german flag :D
00:31 <@deen> Chairn: that means you have the flag of the previous one
00:31 <@deen> Chairn: yeah, i presume you play on the GER server mostly
00:31 < Chairn> oh
00:31 < Chairn> it server's flag :D
00:31 <@deen> of course, ingame flags are totally useless, people just set whatever
00:32 < Chairn> for some yes ^^
00:32 <@deen> 50% have no flag at all, 30% have wrong flags, so meh
00:32 <@deen> anyway, looks like no one understands my flags in ranks, hm
00:32 <@deen> i really like seeing on which server someone mostly plays
00:33 < Chairn> you already see it in player profile
00:33 <@deen> yeah, but i'm annoyed to click on 500 player profiles and click through them all
00:33 <@deen> for example i wanted to see who's the best chinese player
02:56 <@deen> Kobra 4 Tournament on Sunday: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1911
03:02 < Edible> yay, kobra! i dont know... but novice has gotten harder and harder
03:18 <@deen> For example?
03:18 <@deen> Which maps are hard? I remember the first Novice maps weren't exactly easy either, For Idiots 1 or GlassBox 1
03:23 <@deen> Edible: ^
03:25 < Edible> sooo many
03:25 < Edible> sooo many examples
03:25 < Edible> so many i cant think up of one right now.
16:27 <@deen> meskalin is attacking the game servers now
16:27 <@deen> with his spoofed ip addresses
16:28 <@deen> and we have nothing against it still, i guess
16:29 <@EastByte> what kind of attack?
16:29 <@deen> fillingthe slots with them
16:29 <@deen> but he can also call votes from what I've just been told
16:29 <@deen> and when he can vote with 40 at once he can kick everyone
16:29 <@EastByte> well should be normal ip spoofing this time
16:30 <@deen> yeah, since he has a server for that now
16:30 <@EastByte> yep he told me
16:33 <@EastByte> well allocation less anti spoof would be nice now
16:33 <@deen> yes
16:33 <@EastByte> I tried to continue working on eeeee's patch but it seems like the http mapdl causes crashes doing that hacky handshake
16:34 <@deen> =/
16:34 <@EastByte> only the 32bit version, couldn't figure out why yet
16:38 <@deen> anyone done the win10 update?
16:38 <@deen> I'm trying in my ddnet compilation VM
16:38 <@deen> but the win7 updates take forever
16:38 <@EastByte> not yet
16:39 <@deen> i think i could compile ddnet much faster with wine^^
16:39 <@EastByte> right^^
16:40 <@deen> or even mingw for linux
16:40 <@deen> which can cross-compile to windows
16:42 < Sadale> I guess I'll wait a few days before upgrading :p
16:42 < Sadale> I'm watching what's bad about windows 10
17:10 <@deen> oh well, i gave up on updating, takes too long for me^^

17:35 <@EastByte> can we inject js into the webchat to remove this 'feature'?
17:35 <@deen> EastByte: feel free to make our own webchat interface i guess
