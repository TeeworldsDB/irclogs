11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd i guess that creates conflicts with my discord bridge pr but this was never ment to be merged anyways i guess its just a proof of concept
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are we using gitlab for?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AyQZx/2546ced06d.png
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gg
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is gitlab? i cant connect t their website
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stop haxxing gitlab pls @Learath2
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its similar to github, but it has some nice features, and you can make closed source projects for free
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitlab is semi open source github
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's always slow and overloaded xd
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah i see xd
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guess ddnet uses it for the private web stuff
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this logo reminds me of something i found yesterday but i forgot the name
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it was some provider for backend stuff for web and mobile stuff
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AyR5o/c732ecdd93.jpg
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah it was firebase
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AyRyw/4ae93cbcde.png
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its funny that they advertise with velocity xd
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mor ads for speed than for closed src gg
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> U can't access it because Github is being bought by Microsoft
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> and a lot of dev are migrating their repositories on Gitlab
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wooot? microsoft buys github?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so they hav access to all the private repos? And could secretly steal it into their closed src projects?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> idk, it's up to them
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shit microsoft and his monopolization
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it depends on their ToS, I think if they promise they won't steal code and they do, they'd be facing very serious charges, doubt it'd be a good business strategy to steal customers code
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ima put some backdoors in my private repos and haxxor windows
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> microsoft needs to own every thing that succeeds?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it pisses me
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sad that microsoft gets github, really hoped they'd go public or sell it to someone else
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki why does people having money piss you off? üòÑ
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it pisses me that its microsoft
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/8obdgs/microsoft_is_going_to_buy_github/
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> List of things Microsoft ruined haha :
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at comments
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie>

15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everyone doesnt trust microsoft and is going to gitlab
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are monopoly laws, very strict ones in europe. If this sale got past those they aren't big enough yet üôÇ
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt skype by microsoft? did they buy it too?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> they bought it yes
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lul
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Microsoft is a shitty company imho, but no need to get angry over things you have no control over
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought i was always their product
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i want to be angry about this! :toptri:
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 we could take them down we have teewoods ddos powaz xd
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon xD
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> They had msn before, but since msn got rekt by skype they bought it
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon let's petition vali to ddos microsoft
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> now they will need to buy discord xD
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they will buy discord and add their shitty adds
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ads*
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ._.
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> see if they buy discord i'll never use it again üòõ
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> skype ads are worst xd
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that one is a serious privacy issue
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 5‚Ç¨ for videocall in discord
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thing discord knows that if they get bought by microsoft it will end
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they will get the money
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we wont sell teewoods !
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teewoords ? xD
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> companies that don't care about their users is nothing new
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teewars
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye teewars xd
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the nice thing is that gitlab has a github importer
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd rather send conventional mail then use discord DMs if they do that üòõ
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets go back to irc
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> microsoft cant buy that
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do publicly log irc tho
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> I wait to see what they will do with github first
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interestingly currently the only messaging form i'd trust with anything private would be whatsapp
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check this
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> Whatsapp xD
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the list is big
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> it has been bought by facebook you know
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> facbook shops stuff too
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Amu~Cookie whatsapp has amazing end 2 end encryption
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it would be funny if a hughe shopping company shops another one
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not too funny i guess
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> microsoft, google, facebook they will all cower before the giant that is amazon
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a bit dangerous i know but we could say hehe one time to the shoppen company
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its like agar.io
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> I dont mind if microsoft make better versioning tool in their IDE with github, like vscode
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faceless> In 50 years we'll have the big one shit called "Bigsoft"?!
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Microsoft + GitHub = Empowering Developers" they always manage to create these cringy titles
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd be very grateful if someone bought out Visual Studio, just to copyright the name and the software and secure erase the source code
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would like to see window die and linux get better gaming suppoort
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> f3
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that one won't happen without linux becoming systemd and I'd rather dual boot

15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well at this point they prolly cleared it with the european courts so it'll go through, sad

15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "We're seeing 10x the normal daily amount of repositories #movingtogitlab"
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just started loving github ._.
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this really sucks
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> u will love gitlab then
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gitlabs design sucks
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't worry too much, just stay with github until you see what they do with it
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried gitlab time ago and it had lot more features
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> design > features
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> design > bug > features
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as said, stealing code is not a good strategy for them
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im defnetly going to stay i have so much stuff going on there would be a lot of work to change
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bugs > features > design in importance
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not having any private rpos anyway but microsoft likes to ruin the prouct it self
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nonono
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> design > all in importance
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> If Github wasn't profitable, they will make it to be
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am having my github tab open the whole day on my second screen im watching the goithub site 14 hours a day
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont want to watch ugly things
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont consider it ugly
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> design > all is how we end up with shitty software...
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> macOS does a great job :p
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that was going to be my example
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no u
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont u dare
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or razer ‚ù§
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> design kingz
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "it all works well together" until it doesn't and you will have no support for it nor will we give you any documentation for it, you can either figure it out or go fuck yourself
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok my razer laptop cant run teeworlds but i give windows the fault .-. and windows is ugly hehe
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but the until it doesnt case never happens :p
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> okey it almost never happens
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It happened on my brand new macbook pro, it just rebooted when I wasn't looking and got stuck on the installer screen
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wooooooooot
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am using apple since my birth
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> "mac'
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> "mac"
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i had many macbooks that never happend to me
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and usually im the guy who always gets the weird bad cases
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's all fine as long as you use it like grammy or steve aoki would use it
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe its because i didnt use the brand new stuff yet i i decided to buy an older model because i don tlike the touch of genius stuff
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/De0ZRwhV4AAVdk0.jpg
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who is "grammy and stve aoki"? xd
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this a thing?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> grammy is your garden variety grand mother and steve aoki is your run of the mill music producer
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh u have no idea what i did to my poor macbooks in my childhood back then xd

15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> followed every weiro tut in the web to do some stuff i was interested back then
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> who codes a virus for macbooks, pls

15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nothing is the best part about my story

15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -> Bundle Github Business Plans and Office 365 which includes Microsoft Teams I guess.

16:55 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> Thankfully I was never much invested in github 
16:55 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> Only ever created an account due to Starbound dev
16:55 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> never was a fan of centralisation, social media or well, git (find their cli pretty awful)
16:56 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> it's funny tho on reddit "embrace extend extinguish" people are like "why would microsoft extinguish github"
16:56 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> totally missing how it works with an acquisition
16:56 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ofc they wouldn't extinguish github after paying $7.5 billion that would be pretty stupid
16:56 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> what they extinguish is the open ecosystems with the extend part ‚ò∫
16:57 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> make it easier to use their tools than anything else, through increasing incompatibility
16:57 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> that's how value is extracted

17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> is it hate?
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :GWfroggyPoggers:
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no gay isnt hate
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> keep this chat clean and take your artistic writing to somewhere else
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gay means hapy c: but its an lie because jao isnt too gay
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gay means happy c: but its an lie because jao isnt too gay
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :ww:
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u dont seem to positive .-.
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because I don‚Äôt write like you?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because i have to impression that you spread some negative vibes
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you‚Äôre literally hating on something and say that I spread negative vibes üòÇ
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont say that i do any better
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> #offtopic pls this is dev tlak here
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon try being civil
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is it because i said jao is even worse than microsoft? o.O
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it was hyperbolic ofcourse
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but im sorry i am not allowed to use creativity in my language .-.
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @deen don't be an ass :troll:
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Microsoft is the biggest open source contributor on github.. Ofc they want to own it. I also don't see the reason ppl are so upset. Ms has much bigger server capacity. Not like most ppl trust google their passwords etc. Xd
22:16 <@heinrich5991> it's a bit telling if you say "I don't see a reason why ppl are so upset" ‚Äì maybe try to understand what they think :)
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they think ms makes everything worse and steals shit
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tbh, ms might be shit, but they got better in the years
22:24 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't sound like someone who doesn't like the merge would agree with your representation of their argument
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it strongly sounds like you all ms haters
22:27 <@heinrich5991> really. setting up an us vs them?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> my point is more... if you would decide to move away from github... with an open source project ... bcs of ms, then i would strongly think ppl are just haters..
22:34 <@heinrich5991> meh. I'm not impressed by your discussion
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> meh, i am not talking to you
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> scroll up and see what i mean
22:35 <@heinrich5991> "then I would strongly think [you] ppl are just haters"
22:36 <@heinrich5991> that's about as useful as if someone would tell you that they think that you're a "total ms shill"
22:36 <@heinrich5991> classifying people. meh
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> THESE ppl
22:36 <@heinrich5991> but whatever
22:54 <@heinrich5991> ok. backlog is indeed a bit more extreme than I would have expected :o
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes we are full ms haters
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and free speach haters xd
