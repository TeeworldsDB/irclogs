08:33 < bridge> <zhn> also where's subwoofer
08:49 < bridge> <louis> what are those speakers?
08:51 < bridge> <louis> you should try raising them to head level
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> monitors
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
08:52 < bridge> <louis> raising to head level is recommended for monitors
08:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> mmm ok but idk how
08:53 < bridge> <louis> it's not tooo noticeable in my opinion so its up to preference
08:54 < bridge> <louis> but setup is clean lol
09:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> Dude has a sick af mic Setup But ive yet to Hear him speak once
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> didnt u move to a different flat xd
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but looks pretty clean
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i give it 8/10

10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > When will people learn?
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 1. Stop putting mission critical systems on Windows, it's not the reliable OS it once was since MS has cut off most of its QA
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 2. AV solutions are unnecessary if you properly harden your system, AV was needed pre-Vista because Windows was literally running everything as Administrator. AV was never a necessity on UNIX, whatever MS bundles in is usually enough
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 3. Do not install third party software that runs in kernel mode. This is just a recipe for disaster, no matter how much auditing is done beforehand by the OEM. Linux has taught multiple times that drivers should be developed and included with the OS. Shipping random binaries that rely on a stable ABI may work for printers, not for mission critical software.

10:23 < bridge> <reitw> Btw windows has eBPF support
10:23 < bridge> <reitw> Windows stills sucks tho
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> why would companies trust a closed source OS?
10:24 < bridge> <reitw> Idk, I'd leave windows when anticheats would stop their shit
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> the funny thing is, i wonder who in the companies get the idea of running Winshit on data centre grade hardware

15:17 < bridge> <learath2> Ddnet if people stopped using bam
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ddnet stopped using bam
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> yo i was making my own demos using the snap builder and stuff and im a little confused. 
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> problem is:
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> grenades are not interpolated
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> my code goes like this
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> 
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> CProjectileData ProjData = ((CProjectile *)pEnt)->GetData();

15:25 < bridge> <teero777> where did the embed go? huh
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is there to interpolate if the position never changes?
15:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I removed the embed because it was only taking space
15:27 < bridge> <teero777> oki
15:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why did you cast the `pEnt` pointer to a 64 bit integer?
15:27 < bridge> <teero777> well projectiles positions are calculated on the fly as i remember. for grenade it should be CalcPos
15:29 < bridge> <teero777> the clientside prediction somehow always returns -1 upon calling GetId() and the snapshot builder obviously doesn't accept that
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah, i remember that was the case for grenades
15:29 < bridge> <teero777> i have no idea why tho
15:29 < bridge> <teero777> the clientside prediction somehow always returns -1 upon calling GetId() and the snapshot builder doesn't accept that
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     void *SnapNewItem(int Type, int Id, int Size)
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     {
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>         dbg_assert(Id >= -1 && Id <= 0xffff, "incorrect id");
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>         return Id < 0 ? 0 : m_SnapshotBuilder.NewItem(Type, Id, Size);
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     }
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> 
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     template<typename T>
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     T *SnapNewItem(int Id)
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     {
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>         return static_cast<T *>(SnapNewItem(T::ms_MsgId, Id, sizeof(T)));
15:31 < bridge> <teero777>     }
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> ```
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> these are the snap thingies functions. (also copied straight out of the serverside code)
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but now you're generating random IDs based on memory addresses. that sounds wrong. are they consistent from tick to tick?
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> the addresses of the entities should stay the same
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> also they can't be conflicting. im not sure how i would handle the sound snaps if GetId actually worked since they need a id too
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> although they could just be random
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> logs of GetId
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1263852207837544548/message.txt?ex=669bbd97&is=669a6c17&hm=494308cbe5d3edfae7a8f25e94cec5d8a3cd177ddaec0725917c52fc2c00438a&
15:40 < bridge> <teero777> ah ik why they are not set
15:42 < bridge> <teero777> new entities that are created within the prediction don't get ids assigned it seems
15:42 < bridge> <teero777> they only get set in the NetObjAdd func
15:46 < bridge> <teero777> although i don't think the ids have to do with the interpolation do they?
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just debug the client where the grenades are rendered
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> best: only do a single grenade projectile
15:50 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 the error is `Unknown Architecture 'unknown'. Supported: x86, x86_64, ppc, ppc64` https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds/issues/109
15:50 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> i think bam support is nice and i want the teeworlds pipelines to pass
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm. sounds like it does indeed not support building on arm üòÆ
15:52 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> i searched matricks/bam issues no mention of bam
15:52 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> its been a while since m1 macs are a thing
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can that be possible
15:52 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> and running tw servers on raspberry pis was a thing 
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it almost seems bam development is inactive
15:53 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> maybe its not arm idk what the github pipeline does on macos
15:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> *is a thing* mine runs off a raspberry pi 4 :P
15:53 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> good old x86_64 raspbeery pi 4
15:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, actually, it says "unknown architecture: 'unknown'"
15:53 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> yea it COULD mean arm
15:53 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> thats why i want to verify
15:53 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> before i open an issue
15:54 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> nono jopsti bam dev booming
15:54 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1721397270.png
15:54 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> 6 months is pretty pog
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better than teeworlds at least
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
15:55 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> better than 90% of the projects i maintain
15:56 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 sus fake demo generator
15:57 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> First we get deep fakes and no video or image can be trusted anymore. Do you want to take away the last proof that would hold in court? The non fungible TWDEMO FORMAT!?
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> every demo is signed off with chiller dragons private keys for max trust
15:58 < ws-client1> <ChillerDragon> I mean seriously "i got a demo bro" did mean something
16:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> juicy demo deep fakes when?
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> This gave me an idea. It might be a good idea to insert a signed, finish message into demos. It would allow everyone to verify a demo is real, and it would make rename requests in the future easier
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in future we have accounts anyway:brownbear:
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> But when that doesn't happen we'd be glad we atleast added a signature to keep track of ranks
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it already happened
17:31 < bridge> <teero777> XDD
17:31 < bridge> <teero777> i found the issue
17:31 < bridge> <teero777> i think im missing some kind of snap info. s_LastGameTickTime seems to be the same thing every time
17:37 < bridge> <teero777> .....
17:37 < bridge> <teero777> i had to add an empty `CNetObj_GameInfo` to the snap for the rendering to work
17:37 < bridge> <teero777> because it checks if the GameInfo exists and only then sets the LastGameTickTime
17:37 < bridge> <teero777> it works now.
17:37 < bridge> <teero777> nice :D
18:02 < bridge> <teero777> lmao my laptop gave up in the middle of rendering
18:02 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1263888759288631316/image.png?ex=669bdfa2&is=669a8e22&hm=ba5babb1ea4ac685a6b6fd5740766d7213d84da983cb819a6dc3a3c0f1c996bf&
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it triggers me slightly that device lost is non-capital letter
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
18:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1263891349426409543/image.png?ex=669be20b&is=669a908b&hm=9627cd0d5e4b7c2016a9d5ae959e5081ffc2043254ffa8e27f92626df0faf99f&
18:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i laughed hard
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to state that today  i wrote c++ against my will
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```cpp
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> extern "C" void mlirModuleCleanup(MlirModule mod) {
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>   auto x = unwrap(mod);
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>   for (auto &op : x.getOps().begin()->getBlock()->getOperations()) {
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>     if (llvm::CastInfo<LLVMFuncOp, Operation>::isPossible(op)) {
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>       LLVMFuncOp x = llvm::CastInfo<LLVMFuncOp, Operation>::doCast(op);
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>       if (x.getSymName().starts_with("_mlir_ciface")) {
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>         x->setLoc(mlir::UnknownLoc::get(x->getContext()));
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>       }
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>   }
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i could use it from rust :gigachad:
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's true, they would never get "critical process died" bluescreen, because kaspersky is not critical xdd
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bloatware
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> check the readers note
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @avolicious the [A] servers of KoG are still not filtered out when I enable "no login required" in the ddnet serverbrowser. please fix that by 2024-08-19 the latest, or shut down these servers
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why do you even need to clean it up, where is RAII xd
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki do you still upstream stuff to llvm?
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not a clean up of memory
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz a bug
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon: i expect you to be at the premiere of my new yt video so you can watch my fake demo of run_guy_25
21:27 < bridge> <reitw> bahahaha
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
22:27 < bridge> <egyt> Does it run DDNet?
23:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> auto demo folder

23:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try compressing it

23:57 < bridge> <learath2> I've been thinking about the crowdstrike thing and honestly who thought self updating kernel driver is the best approach to cybersecurity?
23:58 < bridge> <learath2> Literally giving ring 0 RCE to an external company can't be the best way to do this
23:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> tgz compressed
23:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> One of my friends told me that in Hungary, one of the cassiers held the line because their cash register got a blue screen
23:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/funny-hahaha-gif-22505124
23:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> that local client demos?
