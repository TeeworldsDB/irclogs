02:20 < bridge> <pathos3005> So I've had some series of bad luck when it comes to my Internet both in NL and US for the past 5 years or so. My wifi would be rather jittery. This makes the server browsing experience really bad, where it sorts the server list by ping, and I can't find the server that should be near the top. Is it possible to roll this back to how pings were updated before, or is that too much DDOS-like behaviour?

05:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Instead of going back, we should store  the avg 90% best ping or smth instead of using the latest
05:46 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah like median
06:58 < bridge> <louis> whats the best predictor of those
06:58 < bridge> <louis> like average of middle 50% ? any statisticians
06:59 < bridge> <totar> median is probably fine
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Does anyone know what's this?
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> `DDNet.exe - Entry Point Not Found`
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> `The procedure entry point clock_gettime64 could not be located in the dynamic - link library D:\Works\DDNetPul\TEST\build\DDNet.exe.`
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Does anyone know what's this?
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> `DDNet.exe - Entry Point Not Found`
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> `The procedure entry point clock_gettime64 could not be located in the dynamic - link library D:\Works\DDNetPul\TEST\build\DDNet.exe.` translated to English
10:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Tried to build myself, but can't open the file
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I think it means exactly what it says, function `clock_gettime64` is called but it wasn't found in the dynamic library. Do you have the source code available somewhere?
10:30 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> It's forked from ddnet, and can be built normally on github, and i didn't edit anything except game/client/components/
10:30 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> https://github.com/K1nop1c0/TEST/tree/BE-Final
10:32 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> It's weird that this can be built&run on my school pc, I also tried ddnet client from ddnet.org, no bugs occured on that one
10:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does this error happens during compilation or when you start the executable?
10:33 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> start the exe, all exe can't get started
11:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Delete `libwinpthread-1.dll` from your build folder before building, it's not compatible with latest MSYS2
11:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Delete `libwinpthread-1.dll` from your build folder before and after building, it's not compatible with latest MSYS2
11:03 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Wow it works, thanks
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @0xdeen how does one obtain merge rights?
11:44 < bridge> <learath2> This has been talked about for a long time but no one did it. It would be nice. First thing I would do is discard outliers, but not immediately. Say after an hour or so
12:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is a saturating sub as fast as a wrapping sub? or it has overhead
12:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks like arm has a instruction for it
12:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess x86 too
12:53 < bridge> <learath2> On x86 there is overhead (unless there is an instruction I'm forgetting about)
12:53 < bridge> <learath2> Arm might have something, idk, not very familiar with arm assembly
13:16 < bridge> <teero777> does ddnet.org have some sort of API for ranks?
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think no
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can download the db
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> but
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can use my service
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://db.ddstats.org/
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://db.ddstats.org/ddnet-6bc8ed3.json?sql=select+rowid%2C+Map%2C+Name%2C+Time%2C+ID%2C+Timestamp+from+teamrace+order+by+rowid+limit+101
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> for some queries it might not be fast but well
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> for simple rank queries should be cuz indexes
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> and repeated same queries should be cached
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh the best is that u import the db i guess
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish we supported psql
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> tuning psql for more memory is easier
13:25 < bridge> <melon> oh yeah, good reminder
13:25 < bridge> <melon> @learath2 whats about porting ddnet to psql
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> sqlite is bound to a single core afaik
13:25 < bridge> <melon> :mlem:
13:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @teero777 i assume you know this endpoint https://ddnet.org/players/?json2=n9
13:28 < bridge> <learath2> It might not be the worst idea, but idk might also be a waste of time
13:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 could i get merge rights in the ddnet repo?
13:29 < bridge> <melon> wasnt there an idea to port ddnet to use Materialize
13:30 < bridge> <learath2> I can get a vote on it, but you'd have to promise to follow the standards and rules we do. No merging your own prs, no merging things without some consensus
13:30 < bridge> <learath2> I think deen imported our db and it used multiple hundred gigs of ram, so we decided not to
13:31 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
13:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 goes without saying i guess
13:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** any non obvious standards i dont know about?
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> No, just don't go off on your own, that's pretty much the only rule
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh idc about materialize i just want to use psql instead of mariadb
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> It is 100% possible, but we do have mariadb working pretty well. Idk if it's worth spending time on psql
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller any prs u want me to check
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> psql has support for time series dbs
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe that would be useful
13:34 < bridge> <teero777> i found some stuff thx
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> I think I had prs that needed changes :/ let me rebase and update those
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh ididnt remember
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> Materialize was meant to fix the rank queries taking obscene amounts of time
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> Nothing else
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki oh yes please i have about 100 prs that i would like you to check
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** checkout this list https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pulls

14:09 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 any opinions on issue https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10502 ?
14:09 < bridge> <Assa> 
14:09 < bridge> <Assa> Thing is, we add a label "needs-discussion", so we need maintainer opinions
14:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I haven't looked into it

14:18 < aaahhhhhh> hello there, is this ddnet irc ?
14:19 < bridge> <learath2> Gave opinion
14:19 < aaahhhhhh> if so,, i have an issue about "bot client" can someone help me?
14:20 < aaahhhhhh> i have been banned from ddnet
14:20 < bridge> <Assa> depends on your issue, does it not work, or does your server has too many bot clients on it?
14:20 < aaahhhhhh> i dont have bot but i have banned...
14:20 < aaahhhhhh> someoen hacked me or something?

14:24 < aaahhhhhh> can someone help me?
14:24 < bridge> <Assa> We want to get the new variable door length tiles, but need to have a map showcasing them. IMO there is not a lot to showcase besides that your map can now use fancy door lengths instead of regular ones
14:24 < bridge> <Cammodude> got it
14:32 < bridge> <Cammodude> @essigautomat could i get a client download with the variable length already implemented ?
14:33 < bridge> <Assa> yes, [here](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/16265388338?pr=10514>), the link might not be endlessly available
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> scroll down and select windows-latest I suppose
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> scroll down and select windows-latest I suppose under "#Artifacts"
14:34 < bridge> <Cammodude> well ill try windows with wine if ubuntu doesnt work
14:34 < bridge> <Cammodude> i found some download link but the client didnt start
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> ubuntu should work
14:35 < bridge> <Assa> we have ubuntu-latest and ubuntu-22.04 as download links there
14:35 < bridge> <Cammodude> ah yeah it works
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> do you need any help? You can configure the length with the switch number I think 🙂
14:37 < bridge> <Cammodude> nah all good
14:38 < bridge> <Assa> ~~do you need any help? You can configure the length with the switch number I think 🙂~~ Nevermind you did the nice video, shouldn't you have the client and everything already setup? xD
14:38 < bridge> <Cammodude> imo putting it on delay wouldve been better
14:38 < bridge> <Assa> can you tell me why?
14:39 < bridge> <Cammodude> what i did was download a client from when the change was first proposed and reimplement changes on that, it doesnt have new speedtiles
14:39 < bridge> <Assa> I am not so familar with all switch mechanics
14:39 < bridge> <Cammodude> usually when making a big switch contraption its easier to select a door thats already placed and up the switch number by 1, but doing that would ruin the variable length
14:40 < bridge> <Assa> the new one should have all mechanics I suppose 🤔
14:40 < bridge> <Assa> but can't you delay door opening? I wonder if this would cause side effects
14:40 < bridge> <Cammodude> like this
14:40 < bridge> <Cammodude> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1398283860122271825/2025-07-25_15-40-29.mp4?ex=6884ccd3&is=68837b53&hm=d8abe98be612c78ab62d8d6a803af49659ad1a1151a98ccf3cc0c2d9759cc1a6&
14:41 < bridge> <Cammodude> you can only delay buttons afaik
14:41 < bridge> <Assa> other issue is, the delay time doesn't gets rendered in the editor, so you can't see the lenght immediately without checking the tile
14:41 < bridge> <Assa> or do you?
14:42 < bridge> <Cammodude> delay renders just fine
14:42 < bridge> <Cammodude> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1398284291284140203/image.png?ex=6884cd39&is=68837bb9&hm=7bfb24c800c85ba770fa7eecd109cac73d692ef00403d17b9ab40fb11bd3ca3a&
14:42 < bridge> <Assa> yes you do I am stupid
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> Guess this is good feedback, I'll change it to delay
14:57 < bridge> <teero777> furo: does ddstats.tw block non-browser request?
14:58 < bridge> <teero777> can't even curl it
15:07 < bridge> <avolicious> Chiller, what server do you run for matrix (if you are self-hosting) & what experimental features can you recommend?
15:08 < bridge> <melon> he setup a json endpoint for me once, but i think its ded/unmaintained
15:09 < bridge> <melon> i would check but furo rm -rf'd our dms before dipping
15:09 < bridge> <teero777> gg
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> bruuhhhh XDD
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> if i do traceroute it just drops my packets after 16 hops
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> wow
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> nice routing
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> why does it work in my browser then?
15:30 < bridge> <teero777> okay now browser doesn't work either
15:30 < bridge> <teero777> nice
15:30 < bridge> <teero777> cool
15:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @avolicious i dont self host. And i dont recommend matrix in general xd
15:34 < furo> @teero777 It's currently down. It will probably be quite a few hours until it's online again.
15:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** one can ping furo on irc and it works? xd
15:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** furo which client do you use?
15:37 < furo> I'm on HexChat, but I only logged on to reply to that message.
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> hi furo
15:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how did you know u got the message?
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> i was so confused xd
15:38 < bridge> <teero777> man i was just trying to revive #records
15:38 < bridge> <teero777> is there any other way to get data like https://ddstats.tw/misc/rank1s-searcher/category/All/ ?
15:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** who cares about #records it doesnt show on irc anyways
15:38 < bridge> <teero777> it doesn't exist anymore yea
15:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** woah rly?
15:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it got removed
15:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** explains the brokecxd meme
15:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk how to type that name sry
15:40 < furo> ChillerDragon: I sometimes check https://ddnet.org/irclogs/
15:41 < furo> @teero777 What do you mean by other way? Do you want it in a different format (e.g. json) or wah?
15:43 < bridge> <teero777> json would be nice but i meant to be getting the data from a different site like ddnet.org instead of ddstats since it's down right now. but i don't think i can get that data from ddnet.org easily
15:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> i literally wrote a whole comment explaining that lol
15:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1398299919952908288/image.png?ex=6884dbc8&is=68838a48&hm=44aa3897c00f53516069870744ce708b0d3c5c381ba6d5260883f60b0d49cc3f&
15:54 < furo> @teero777 Well, ddnet provides SQLite exports (http://ddnet.org/stats/ddnet.sqlite.zip) updated every 24 hours. I recommend building from that. I already have some code to recreate "#records", but haven't pushed it yet.
16:23 < bridge> <Assa> took me way to long to understand, that the action performed on layer drag is just wrong, and not the values inside it
16:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> furo go sign up on https://chat.zillyhuhn.com it’s updated faster then irclogs! Sign up token is nimrocks
16:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller have u scraped irc logs before
16:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> for the sake of knowledge

19:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @.zokra why not its an open channel 
19:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> only 10% of this channel is actually used for ddnet development
19:34 < bridge> <Assa> You can collapse groups idk what you did
19:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Deleted the game group apparently
19:34 < bridge> <Assa> 😮
19:34 < bridge> <Assa> yeah you did 💀
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> You know what would be a great way to implement infallible undo-redo? Using patigas json representation for maps and keeping diffs 😄
20:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 yea that was my plan to track maps in git
20:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sadly githubs file size limit is annoying
20:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so in any real map you just get to see a "file too fat go download raw" and nothing else :c
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't use it for tracking maps in git. I would want it for undo/redo purposes within the editor
20:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i know
20:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i mean its the same concept right?
20:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** diffs because text is nice
20:20 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, text diffing is pretty much a solved problem, so it'd be easy. However, if we want to avoid that, we need to start representing maps in a format that is easier to diff and work with diffs anyway, instead of keeping a log of actions
20:24 < bridge> <learath2> But unless you are careful with it it'll create a lot of copying, so yeah, not easy to get right

21:54 < bridge> <louis> any split keyboarders in chat
21:56 < bridge> <Ewan> nah
21:56 < bridge> <Ewan> like the classic MS ergonomic kind?
21:58 < bridge> <louis> the ones that are actually split
21:58 < bridge> <louis> i have my eyes on lily58 pcb :justatest: but its like 200 buckaroonies
21:58 < bridge> <louis> i have my eyes on a lily58 build :justatest: but its like 200 buckaroonies
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> I've seen but never tried
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> I don't really see an advantage because typing is a two handed experience and I already have to move one to my mouse. the difference now is I have to learn to adjust to a physicaly separated keyboard
22:13 < bridge> <louis> i think the main advantage is you would be able to put food between your keyboard on a small desk
22:14 < bridge> <louis> 😁
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I can see that
