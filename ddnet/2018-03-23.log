00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or you mark archived ranks differently or smth?
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Those we can all think about together later üòÉ
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Those we can all think about together later üôÇ
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> could maybe show the archived ranks with a * at the end or sth
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only one thing is certain, if we want accounts we definitely need either a way to verify nick claims or a way to separate old and new ranks. First one I and the couple people I discussed it with think is impossible.
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I agree if I'll stay lola
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so you have to figure out if accounts would have enough benefits to be worth to remove all ranks
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we can make verification via discord :p
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or via discord+forum
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> sounds fair
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Removing is a strong word, there are compromises that can be achieved, all old ranks will basically be unverified
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and what about the 500 people that aren't on discord or the forum?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is one big problem
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then you have to figure out if making everything more complicated is worth
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how can we know if the user on the forum is the one on tw?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon isnt the only ChillerDragon
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> neither is lola the only lola
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shiet
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :thonkery:
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao it definitely won't be complicated after a while, as people keep playing the size of verified records will increase and it'll look just fine
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont remove old ranks
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or archieve
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> yes @fokkonaut thats what they gonna do
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that would be even worse
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Defuq
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stop saying that without providing any arguments...
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> EVERYONE HAS INVESTED TIME?!
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Instructions unclear, removed archieves
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Don't remove accounts. Why? It's bad"
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> yes @fokkonaut we already decided its better for everyone
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wasted time on playing and finishing maps
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> first you need accounts
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> remove all points so people get frustrated and come play ctf or fng or something instead
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then you can remove :thonkery:
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is fucking dumb
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and did you not enjoy finishing those maps?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are you a masochist?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> removing ranks for dumb accounts
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> learath pls get good arguments
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i finished maps solely for points
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> lol @Learath2 its coming
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> everyone did
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not the one coming here with "don't remove ranks"
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lets create a poll :) no one will say remove ranks for accounts
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc they won't if you present it like that
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its just what you said
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Ranks are very important., we all invested time, we need our points Accounts are shit"
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need time to write up good arguments in favour of it, and I don't have the time to present my case right now
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you want to get people on your side by promising them money üòÇ
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet gets worse by the time
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just gave that as an example, besides why does the motivation matter? If a thousand people want to run for a trophy noone bats an eye.
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Worse by time? I didn't change anything and won't do anything before I have support for it
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Good
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fokkonaut can also invest some money to motivate people to join his side
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> We might contact cambridge analytica on that one
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @Learath2 It's ok we'll just hire the PR manager and buy some ad in prime time, everyone agree for account at the end
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not offering money for supporting me at all, I'm offering an award for a specific objective
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that's manipulation
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tournaments offer awards all the time
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How tho? If most everyone is willing to abandon their points for a shot at the award (whatever it is) or don't care at a;;. how am I manipulating anything?
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> or we could just buy points 10 euro for 1k pts
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> money will make people blind, whether you want it or not
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm all for discussion but stop coming at me with these 1-word arguments "bad, sad, manipulation". I do my best to formulate a coherent answer to each and every one of your arguments
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :what:
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fine I'll offer a 3d printed tee instead
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> for how many points?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The point is it was just an example
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> When discussing the account system i my pov its more about the benefits in the long term. A tournament would be a nice to have but not the crucial argument
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @lola it's all hypothetical, top(as many as I can afford + anyone else willing to contribute)
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @CptDalv exactly, it's just one of the things we can achieve with it
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> And if reseting poitns will lead to a legit way of proofing someone achieved those points by himself i think thats a big perk
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> good linking between discord, forum, website and ingame aswell
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> definitly
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> reset forum accounts too? üòÑ
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> reset bank accounts? Might help me out at the end of the month
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you aren't being sarcastic, I was thinking of letting a forum user associate his ingame account using a key generated by the client or a link
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess this is it for now, I have website that I need to get ready for launch before monday so I'll be busy with that üòõ
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> lola is tired, lola go to bed, cya üíã
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> salut
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> bon nuit
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> good luck with resetting everyones points
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bon nuit mon cheri
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bon nuit fake lola
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Êàë‰πüÂæàÁ¥Ø.ÂÜçËßÅ
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> are you chinese
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> lived there for 2 years
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ooh that's amazing
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> great country, bad gov. but thats another topic
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> cya
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Whoho the Never ending acc discuss popped out agian o.0
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Better use ddnet++ it has accs and puts igns in the Web Ranking
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xxxD
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What is this pic fok?
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is that you ?
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nope
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a skateboarder
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't worry, I won't let @Learath2 delete ranks üòõ
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut "X only gets worse by the time"
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sir @heinrich5991 the 1st, Protector of the ranks
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> guess you need to spend your 50‚Ç¨ on heinrich
01:56 <+Learath2> I should've just went with another example, forgot people around here love to obsess about small things
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Delirio> Hi guys, with who I have to talk about transferring points to another name?
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> no transferring points
05:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> http://prntscr.com/iv4yxj
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> can someone help me with sockets?
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i wrote a python script that sends messages via socket to my android phone
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> but it only works in LAN i guess?
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i dont know if its a stupid question but: how do i make it work, so that the script can send me messages when i am somewhere else
05:49 <+Learath2> I'm really tempted not to help you tbh
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> right now the python script runs at my desktop; the android phone connects to the desktop via IP (192.168....) and then the desktop can send messages
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> have a grudge on me? üò¶
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> im sry
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> evil botter dont get no help
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> its not teeworlds related
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> but i guess that wont change ur mind
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> he is just stubborn about you
05:50 <+Learath2> For all I know it could be a notification sender for your botnet that you use to ddos ddnet :P
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> lol
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> hmm
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> it is something forbidden
05:51 <+Learath2> Hey anything is possible with you people, you never cease to amaze me
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> but still not related to tw xD
05:52 <+Learath2> You need a way to track the ip of your phone while you are outside
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> the dekstop is the server
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> only need his ip
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> phone connects to desktop
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i think ill google a bit more
05:53 <+Learath2> Not a good architecture to send "notifictions"
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> how would u do it?
05:53 <+Learath2> Your phone will need an active connection all the time to get messages or you'll miss them
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> is that bad?
05:54 <+Learath2> In a push notification scenario you actually make the phone a server, and the person sending the message connects to the phone to deliver it.
05:54 <+Learath2> I don't know what you are using it for
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> cuz i want a active connection all the time
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i scrape a website and when some numbers change
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i send a notification
05:55 <+Learath2> If you are fine with missing messages when you go through a tunnel sure
05:55 <+Learath2> You should look up push notifications instead
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> thx
05:56 <+Learath2> there are apps you can download on your phone that can send arbitrary push notifications and you can send a notification to your phone by calling an API endpoint
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> ye i dont like em
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i need an alarm in the night if the numbers change
05:57 <+Learath2> Then you'll need to implement your own, which is a server on the phone, a way to track the ip of the phone (dyndns || an api endpoint on your "server"), get phone ip from (dns || "server), connect to phone, drop message
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> how about something like tcp: desktop sends to phone, if phone doesnt ack -> send again until ack
05:59 <+Learath2> you need a way to track the phones ip either way
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> god its way more complicated than i thought
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> fuck
06:00 <+Learath2> which is why you should just use one of the push notification providers
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> üò¶
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> @ZimE if you have a webserver you might send a post request there which stores your ip adress and forwards it to your computer
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Might secure that with an access token
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Or you install something like dyndns on your phone
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i give up, shit is frustrating af
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZimE so what's the problem you're tackling?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you want to be informed on your phone when some web site changes?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or when a number on some web site changes?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> hmm
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i got to the point where i get the notification
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> but
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i tried to use dns (fritzdns)
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> and i get a timeout
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i turned off firewall
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> it doesnt connect
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> its alright
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i just send a skype notification to my phone then
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> way easier
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay ^^
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @qshar   is your labyrith mapping tool easy to use, and if yes can you send it to me please?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its fully working in ddpp
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum 
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/DDNetPP
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``bam tools_ddpp_release``
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> create a mapgen/ folder in your maps directory and then navigate there with cmd and execute ``map_gen.exe input.map output.map``
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe zeta-hoernchen also wrote a labyrinth tool
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt he the nut mapper?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes, he made nut short race 9. probably the biggest labyrinth map
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> still ez rank2
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nut "short" race 9
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well, its only 1:30 if you know the way
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the other short races are a lot shorter üòõ
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like 10s, 8s, 3s, etc.
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> he just couldnt resist with his tool
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure @Im 'corneum trained a neural net to map unlimited creative dummy maps
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> xD
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you should watch out for freezestyler maps. he did a great job on a dummymap he showed me. easyly sushi quality
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @Im 'corneum ye, sure. you can download it from qshar
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> com
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> link is on ddnet and our forum
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i hope i can use it. as i know me i dont understand this stuff.
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> well, write me in pm if you have problems with it, I'll try to help
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im gonna try chillers first
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> gg cant even download it
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ??
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is the problem with the download? @Im 'corneum
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> my browser didnt even know how big the file is. and afte some time it canceled and said network problem
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lul
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then dont use browsers :p
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wat
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u could use git directly instead
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or i can send u the exe
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye pls
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/426736483777511443/map_gen.exe
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> map_gen.exe  stopped working..... oh i get the feeling that this is gonna be great
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what os do you use?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> windows
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what arguments did u provide?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean how did u start it?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> click on the exe?  do i have to save in ddnet folder or what
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nope
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i put it in the maps/mapgen folder to directly load the newly created maps ingame but u can put it anywhere
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it needs the input and output map as argument
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so dont double click it in your win gui you have to use cmd instead and execute it from there
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``map_gen.exe input.map output.map``
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that means you have to call it from the command line `cmd` in `win+r`
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it is still weird why it crashed
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it doesnt crash on my machine even if i simply double click it
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> man i havent felt this retarded lately
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are u stuck?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i type map_gen.exe in cmd and it doesnt find it
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you have to navigate to the directory
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u ever used the command line?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not really
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> allright
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> on the left side before where u type a command
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is the path to your current working directory<
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and you can change your dirctory with ``cd`` command
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so you can copy your path in the explorere and paste it in command line
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where is your map_gen.exe located ?
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if your old windows you could also use shift + rightclick in the explorer to directly open cmd there but newer windows versions removed the feature .-.
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i put in on desktop now
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok great
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so you can open cmd and write in ``cd Desktop``
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is this a one-time precedere or do i have to do it all the time?
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> all the time .-.
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you could also write a batch file which starts an cmd line there i guess
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah no
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but its only ``cd Desktop`` before you start
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not too much work
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> stopped working
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u provide the maps as arguments?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no only typed map_gen.exe
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and were the maps located on your desktop aswell?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> typing map_gen.exe is same like doubleklicking

14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> out these two maps on your desktop
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and then ``map_gen.exe map1.map map2.map
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and then ``map_gen.exe map1.map map2.map``
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it defenetly did something
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> now what
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can open map2 in mapeditor or put it on a server
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then you can do it agian and see that the map changed
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> alright. cool   can i somehow change the map size or make it non gores?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nope
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> pff
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im still working on figure out how the code works but i suck
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only produced a client crasher map generator
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @qshar  can i do that on your tool?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats his tool
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why i have no idea how it works
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hmm is zeta hoernching dead?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> he probably is inactive for long
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guess would be hard to contact him idk him or his gang
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon I'm part of his gang üòõ
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum I'll tell him that you want his map generator
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ouuh  thanks
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lul
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my ddnet10 client crashed .-.
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmmm ... it happend agian ? o.O
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> my computer sprerging rubbed off on you

16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmkay .-.
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im hoping for zetas tool without freeze and perhaps more possebilities
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guess he got it running
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> removing freeze is not hard
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> idk what is zetas tool
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> yep, just remove freeze layer from base map
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/0be454a0665a70501455892aa1aa2930
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> well, you can put any map generator inside my code. it all should work fine
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991  is this hard to use?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends. have you used python before?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i act like ive never used a computer before
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it's a little harder, but I can show you in the evening
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im back at like 10pm

21:15 < Paralix> sorry guys
21:15 < Paralix> how restart server teamspeak3 with putty?
21:42 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heh w/ putty? ‚ò∫
21:43 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> guess it depends how you installed it
21:43 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> # eix -c teamspeak-server
21:43 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> [N] media-sound/teamspeak-server-bin (~3.0.13.8): Crystal Clear Cross-Platform Voice Communication Server
21:43 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> hm maybe I'll install it here. could come in handy
21:45 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> is teamspeak more popular generally than mumble?
21:45 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> prefer to keep non-FOSS bins to a minimum
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sadly people wont be assed to install mumble for you but they generally have ts üòõ
21:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> boo manual tgz download
21:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> so primitive
22:02 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> bah. screwit. I'm not bothering w/ updating portage to the latest
22:03  * bridge [freenode] <nemo> puts it in /opt instead
22:03 <@heinrich5991> now people seem to partially move to discord
22:03 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> oh god
22:03 <@heinrich5991> you're on central servers there
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is discord
22:04 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> well. for you
22:04 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and I know
22:04 <@heinrich5991> ?
22:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I know it is bridging to discord.
22:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> aanyway
22:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> nautilus teamspeak3-server_linux_x86 # TS3SERVER_LICENSE=accept ./ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh
22:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> that seems to launch it fine
22:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> for Paralix's benefit ‚ò∫
22:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> guess I should actually open up port 1011 at some point
22:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> er 10011
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nemo: gentoo on a server? How has it been treating you? I've been avoiding it for some time
