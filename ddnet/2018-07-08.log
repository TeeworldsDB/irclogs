00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> Basically a vanilla client -like, but based on DDNet. Not removing the current one, but making a light version of it?
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> its not rly supposed to be like vanilla and yea there are useless features that only very few benefit from but does anyone have a disadvantage because of these things? i mean u rly have to have a rly rly rly shitty pc for tw to lag
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> it appears to me like u just dislike the ddnet client and love vanilla client lol. so just use vanilla client
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> easy fix
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> Once DDNet is clean enough (it's not gonna be done tomorrow), give it a try, please.
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> why did u make a different bullet point to state out what the "try" is supposed to be about? xd
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> Stitch626
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy>  Because the block community is rude
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> oh ye
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> bitch626*
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> Stitch626
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> You are right, ddnet has already taken over but thats bad I think. Teeworlds is Teeworlds and not DDNet.
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> why did ddnet take over tho? people seemed to like ddnet more than vanilla teeworlds
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> nice logic
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> rude community -> stop the mod
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> ?XD
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :ww:

16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1514#issuecomment-403250497 it's closed now üòÉ
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ezy I love your answers‚Ä¶
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ezy Yes, some features make the game lag, no matter what. There are also bugs. I can have an intel E5, it won't change the facts there are bugs.
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ezy yes, I like the vanilla client because it's very clean, maybe too much, but I like it. DDNet has features, but my opinion is there are too many
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ezy and as of "just do this lol" well, no? DDNet is maintained, and fixes a lot of bugs. Teeworlds is dead. If I want to keep playing with a secure software I need to play DDNet, at least I add my brick to the project in a way cuz I don't code
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> man i just woke up
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Good mirnong üëç
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> teeworlds client is for vanilla and ddnet is for a modification
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> went to sleep like 9 am
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> xd
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> dude
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I knoooow that
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> but DDNet is becoming more than "just a mod" at this point
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> yes because more people like ddnet than vanilla
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> yep
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> yea thats not ddnets staffs problem infact its not a problem at all
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> my opinion is it should be simplified, that's all
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> do u for real
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> lag with ddnet client?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> x
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> d
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> so basicly u want to use teeworlds client but it has bugs and ur secure software doesnt allow u to use it? xd
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> well ddnet is okay
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> but it has a lot of things that are weird
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> like the laser thing when you hook etc
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> and two tabs for the servers, that can't be normal
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> what laser thing when u hook? xd
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 1 tab for all srvs
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 1 tab for lan srvs
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 1 tab for favorite srvs
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 1 tab for ddnet srvs since its the fukin ddnet client
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> all tabs are useful
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> btw i dont even use ddnet client xd
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> i use more op client but u wouldnt like it since u dont like a lot of skins
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> oh ya
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> forgot to say
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> for people like u that actually think ddnet has to many skins
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> theres an actually useless feature thats only usefull for u and its called "vanilla skins only"
17:06 <+Learath2> @Gabbo, which features of ddnet is too much for you? I don't think we have too much clutter tbh
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can just delete skins from the skin folder or even enable vanilla only skins
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Vanilla client don't need, hookcollision, respawn bind, dummies
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i don't want listen everything, just remove ddrace-things and it would be good for vanilla
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> Hi, I'm here for asking some factual help if some developper may want :s
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> what fact
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> Well I know DDNet's got some updater
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> And there's this game named ninslash which the developper is actively working on which is based off teeworlds's engine
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> But the one and only developper doesn't want to work on an updater while tehre are often updates and most people are only asking for it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> Wanted to know if some may want to share knowledge or code with him ?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> probably means that teeworlds doesnt have an autoupdater
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> that's what I said ?..
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Learath2 the emote/expressions when shift is pressed is a bit weird
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> hey developers! long time no see!
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> wat
