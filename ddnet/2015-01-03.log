03:35 < WolfAlex> deen, are you there?
03:37 <@deen> hi WolfAlex 
03:37 < WolfAlex> hey :)
03:38 < WolfAlex> just a feature request, what about a time slider for the envelopes in the map editor
03:39 <@deen> I don't understand envelopes and the editor^^
03:40 <@deen> what do you want to do?
03:40 <@deen> you want to move a point left or right (time axis)?
03:42 < WolfAlex> nothig specific.. i thought it would be nice if i, for example have a long animation to skip to specific points to look at the transitions
03:42 <@deen> ah
03:42 <@deen> i won't implement that
03:43 < WolfAlex> why?
03:43 <@deen> so much work, so little benefit
03:43 <@deen> i can make an issue on github in case anyone else wants to implement that
03:45 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/122
03:45 < WolfAlex> so if someone else implements it, you will probably add it? (looking at EastByte :)
03:45 <@deen> yes
03:47 < WolfAlex> is there a way on github for me to indicate my interest in this? or do i have to comment? 
03:50 <@deen> you have an account?
03:51 <@deen> on the right you can "Subscribe"
03:51 <@deen> under "Notifications"
03:53 < WolfAlex> already done :)
03:54 < eeeee> Learath2: okay so can you check http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html now to see if it's still playable or is any better?
03:57 <@deen> eeeee: hangs on "Connecting to" for me
03:58 < eeeee> try different server?
03:58 <@deen> tried 4
03:58 < eeeee> hmm
03:58 <@deen> maybe just a problem between me and the proxy
03:58 <@deen> it worked before
03:59 < eeeee> can you try refreshing the page?
03:59 <@deen> same
04:01 < eeeee> okay yeah proxy crapped out again
04:01 < eeeee> Unhandled 'error' event in dgram.js
04:01 < eeeee> fuken node.js. sigh
04:08 <@deen> don't worry, nim has similar problems :P
04:08 <@deen> I'm debugging asynchronous networking right now
04:45 < eeeee> it's still not as bad as certain libwebsockets methods
04:46 < eeeee> like when you try to get the client's IP libwebsockets first takes the remote ip from the socket fd, then resolves it back to a hostname, then resolves the hostname to a list of ips and then returns you the first ip from that list
04:47 < eeeee> so it might return you the wrong ip or just an empty string if one of the steps failed
04:48 < eeeee> luckly it exposes the raw socket fds so i don't actually have to fix the ilb
04:48 < eeeee> lib*
04:53 <@deen> hahaha
