00:05 < bridge> <chairn> maybe skin loading was different before
00:05 < bridge> <chairn> like try without any skin for both version, including downloadedskins folder
01:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> mark my words
01:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2024 is the year of linux desktop
02:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> still using windows
03:35 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo in 20 years: 2044 is the year of Linux desktop
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> exactly
09:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure if I find motivation for that today. Got so many things on my todo. If nobody can reproduce it it’s maybe not that bad and I stay outdated until I have time.
09:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have no extra skins and dl skins is off for me since it was added
09:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe mapres I have some of those
10:35 < ChillerDragon> today i had to use ``git push -fu`` hihi
11:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if there was a good nvidia drivers, i was using linux millennia ago
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are (?)
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using a nvidia 3080
11:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i am noob in linux, i don't wanna fry my gpu trying to install it's drivers
11:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i fried one before
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> god bless ignorance
11:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> lazy
11:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> sry i get annoyed when ppl say overly stupid stuff xd
11:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 😐
11:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> go fix your blog, it's outdated
11:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont
11:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
11:28 < ChillerDragon> i didnt install shit
11:28 < ChillerDragon> you turn on linux and it scales right up
11:29 < ChillerDragon> well ok nvidia package
11:29 < ChillerDragon> but installing one package from package manager i wouldnt call "installing drivers" sounds so complicated
11:29 < ChillerDragon> its way less complicated than installing ddnet on windows
11:35 < bridge> <Fussel> btw: »-Wno-nullability-completeness« ← what's that for?
11:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems to disable some warnings on macOS
11:41 < bridge> <Fussel> pff. mac …
11:57 < bridge> <Fussel> another good news: it compiles and runs with c++20 🙂
12:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 5 years ago i installed debian on my potato "geforce gt 240, pentium q8400, 4 gig ram" computer.
12:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> that was my first time, i didn't know shit about linux, it took me a whole day to install the nvidia legacy drivers, trying to add non_free download source for my package manager with vim editor, and every 2 minutes my sceen goes black cus my gpu fan was not working :|.
12:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in day 2 everything was lovely, trying to make my sounds going on in the kde environment and learning to work with terminal and  basic vim commands.
12:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in day 3 i was messing around with my packages to learn from and i broked my graphic driver, after couple of tries to reinstall it, my graphic card was broked because of overheating. i pulled my graphic card out and used debian with only my cpu for 1 year after, it was a good experiment
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u gotta use linux with modern hardware
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn pentium
12:02 < bridge> <Fussel> »5 years ago« …
12:02 < ChillerDragon> debian
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often hear linux is good for old hardware, but i'd say that's not directly true.
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it might run better than windows on old hardware because it is often more lightweight
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:02 < ChillerDragon> so its 10 years old linux
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but drivers are less tested etc.
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is no trouble with getting it to compile c++20 the problem is old distros with old glibc
12:02 < bridge> <Fussel> there is a problem: spectating doesn't show any tees
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk if u mean ddnet or another thing xd
12:02 < ChillerDragon> isnt that reported already?
12:03 < ChillerDragon> #7569
12:03 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7569
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah pls fix
12:05 < bridge> <Fussel> @chillerdragon he who smelled it, dealt it. Therefore you have introduced this bug and you have to solve it. I give you 10 minutes!
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> was this bug added due to 0.7 code?
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> remove 0.7 code!
12:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> my next go for linux will be arch 🙂
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use gentoo btw
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> hi fellas
12:11 < bridge> <Fussel> @ryozuki but why? gentoo isn't written in rust!
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> linux isn’t written in rust
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet isn’t written in rust :justatest:
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> discord isn’t entirely written in rust :justatest:
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> both linux and ddnet have rust code
12:12 < bridge> <Fussel> rusty code != rust code
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> discord backend uses rust
12:12 < ChillerDragon> no bugs in 0.7 code
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> copium
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> notice i said entirely
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> mimimi
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> my efforts at accuracy go unnoticed 😢
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> you ever watch zoolander
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont watch many movies
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> nostly sci fi
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> mostly sci fi
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> me neither
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i like that there are still good movies and tv i have yet to discover
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> you ever listen to music
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> leetcode should host aoc sandboxes
12:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see it
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mamad_melanin if u stay long enough in this channel u will become a rust dev
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
13:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> after mastering c++ i will go and check rust
13:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> didn't happend with me :pepeW:
13:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> didn't happen with me :pepeW:
13:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Hop on rust. Its blazingly fast 🔥🔥 , thread safe, borrow checker included, FEARLESS CONCURRENCY
13:51 < bridge> <deen> Huge thanks to Sweeeeet GM :>, not sure what your Discord account is though 😄
13:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> sweeeet
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say mastering c++ is harder than rust
14:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> @nobosaurus  😛
14:32 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so after mastering c++, i pushed my brain capacity and then i can learn rust with ease :feelsamazingman:
14:39 < ChillerDragon> @Patiga thanks for twmap you enabled yet another project for me :) i would never have the nerves to build that in C++ https://github.com/ChillerDragon/twmap_6to7
14:53 < bridge> <Ewan> the only real cpp experts around have over 15 years of experience in it
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> most coders haven’t even coded for that long
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> I would make the bold claim that no one here mastered c++
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> very true
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its rly rly hard
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i would say nearly impossible
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i went and saw jason turner the other day
14:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i could never hope to understand cpp at the level he does
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is just so many details so many ubs so many things
14:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i really used to enjoy his tweets but i never watched his cpp weekly vids cuz i dont like his Minecraft avatar thing
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> which rust makes a bit more managable
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
14:57 < bridge> <Ewan> rust is a young language anyway
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not really young anymore xd
14:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it will look very very different in like 25 yrs when it is as old as cpp
14:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i love you guys, i thought i am stupid to not understanding the things i reading ❤️
14:57 < bridge> <Ewan> most code is just tedium
14:58 < bridge> <Ewan> the  super extra experience really mostly helps in really big picture scenarios like designing systems or in edge cases
14:58 < bridge> <coke1465> are u 25 years old?
14:58 < bridge> <Ewan> no sir
14:58 < bridge> <coke1465> 21
14:58 < bridge> <Ewan> no sir
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 18
14:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yes sir
14:59 < bridge> <coke1465> 😄
14:59 < bridge> <coke1465> sweet
14:59 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with 18 you know nothing
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with 30 you still know nothing
14:59 < bridge> <Ewan> true
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can be the biggest cpp expert, you still make mistakes. awesome human brain
14:59 < bridge> <coke1465> depends if u sitting 24/7 into ur room
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nope, independent of that
15:00 < bridge> <Ewan> well u can obsess over things and get 99.99th percentile knowledge but then you lack in other ways
15:00 < bridge> <coke1465> 3 yo when i started the game 😮
15:00 < bridge> <Ewan> you will never know enough
15:00 < bridge> <Ewan> crazy
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> coke be like 50
15:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> now its scary
15:00 < bridge> <coke1465> im young
15:00 < bridge> <coke1465> 28
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> granny
15:01 < bridge> <Ewan> why are there 2 testing roles and why do u have both
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apparently it's when u sub to a map testing thread
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the other Tester role is the real one
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the orange name one

15:03 < bridge> <coke1465> cool
15:03 < bridge> <coke1465> 😄
15:03 < bridge> <coke1465> not even that is working
15:03 < bridge> <coke1465> we wait long time for the new roles
15:03 < bridge> <coke1465> but sadly nobody care
15:03 < bridge> <coke1465> but whatever
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> never realized map info channel had so many threads
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i pity whoever wrote all that
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> read by a total of 2 ppl
15:04 < bridge> <coke1465> u would be impressed how much channels the dc have
15:04 < bridge> <coke1465> 😄
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> probably
15:04 < bridge> <coke1465> its like 80% of them just testing
15:04 < bridge> <coke1465> maybe 85
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #admin
15:06 < bridge> <coke1465> hope its done in near future without my help
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Probably true. I'd guess not even close
15:14 < bridge> <Fussel> \*yawn\*
15:15 < bridge> <chairn> depends what you call mastering
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> er
15:16 < bridge> <Ewan> mastery
15:16 < bridge> <chairn> nice truism
15:16 < bridge> <chairn> i feel like we've made a huge step forward the definition of mastery
15:16 < bridge> <chairn> i feel like we've made a huge step forward to the definition of mastery
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> Have you ever stored a type in a container?
15:17 < bridge> <chairn> who ?
15:17 < bridge> <chairn> and what do you mean "a type", like just storing int, float rather than values ?
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> Anyone here
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
15:19 < bridge> <Fussel> @learath2 this doesn't even make sense. containers store ›things‹ that have an address, types do not even have a size
15:19 < bridge> <learath2> This is why Ryozuki's claim of there being no one that has mastered C++ holds some water 😄
15:20 < bridge> <Fussel> you can store `type_id`s in a container, if you mean something like a vector of types, this is a tuple
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbf if you mean with mastering knowing everything the language offers. then you cannot master some languages 😄
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> proc macros in rust basically mean infinite potential
15:20 < bridge> <Fussel> metaprogramming makes wide use of this stuff, and since c++20 it became usable ^^
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> I would like to welcome you to the world of `boost::hana` where types and objects are seemingly interchangeable
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> Completely powered by template blackmagic that none of us mere mortals can even hope to grasp
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i did in rust kinda iirc
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> I never quite found a use for it tbf. But the mere possibility and the fact that it's just powered by normal templates is so impressive
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> well idk what u mean exactly
15:27 < bridge> <Fussel> you can easily store types in tuples
15:27 < bridge> <Ewan> only variadic templates
15:27 < bridge> <Ewan> parameter pack
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> Yet you told me the mere concept didn't make sense. What gives?
15:28 < bridge> <Fussel> container means sth. like vector, map list
15:28 < bridge> <Fussel> container means sth. like vector, map, list
15:28 < bridge> <learath2> Hana has those too worry not
15:29 < bridge> <learath2> It's truly a different way of thinking about what a container can contain
15:30 < bridge> <learath2> These are also quite full of syntax many people haven't ever experienced. Especially when you add C++17 fold expressions into the mix
15:31 < bridge> <Ewan> fold expressions are the bomb
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this storing types or entirely different? xd
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1183415620335837184/Screenshot_2023-12-10-15-30-20-442_com.github.android.jpg?ex=658840ae&is=6575cbae&hm=010ee4f9fac842f1d692e5d6289a0e683667d1842340a8e4a09a15fae1f90de6&
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to understand what does it mean to store a type itself with no value
15:32 < bridge> <Fussel> @learath2 I do know Hana, and every page of its documentiation I read just posed me the question »For what is this of use?«
15:32 < bridge> <learath2> This is kinda cheating by using a typeid but yes, that's kinda the idea. Now imagine you could truly just have the types in there
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its a rust thing
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> every type has a typeid
15:33 < bridge> <Fussel> clearly a ›rust thing‹ since `type_id` doesn't exist in c++
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> That I agree with. If someone tells me they've mastered C++ I'd expect them to know all the template blackmagic too
15:34 < bridge> <Fussel> neither does `std::variant` that makes use of it
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @Fussel do u claim to be a  cpp master?
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> name all the possible ubs
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> :Trolldespair:
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> Name all women kinda question
15:36 < bridge> <Ewan> people have tried listing them but never finished
15:36 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz you know
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was happy with c++ cuz i didnt even know ub existed, now i treat c++ like a minefield assuminf im always doing something bad
15:37 < bridge> <Fussel> @learath2 I don't like the idea of ›mastered‹ at all, but I wrote a whole template driven language parser framework that automatically generates the associated EBNF of that grammar as `std::string`, I did this on my _smartphone_ and I did at completly offline. It wasn't that difficult, thanks to C++20
15:37 < bridge> <Ewan> okay well that’s cool and all but not at all what we are talking about
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel u would need a lot more knowledge for example to make a kernel
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will require u to know all about memory and how cpp handles around it
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> also the possible hidden allocstions whathever
15:38 < bridge> <Ewan> kernel is most likely something u need language agnostic expertise for
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but also language knowledge definitly
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> linus hates cpp
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> that guy hates a lot of things
15:39 < bridge> <learath2> Well it is a loosely defined concept
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> it requires u to know what the code does under the hood as in what it compiles to etc
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> u definitely can become a python master
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ill look at u weirdly if u tell me ur a cpp master
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldn’t call knowing when memory is and isn’t allocated near mastery of the language
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just using it
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> one of the parts
15:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> no u need to know lower level details when ur close to the machine
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> You can also become a C master. The smaller the language or the more well behaved the language the more possible it is
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> as far as optimizations go if you want something a particular way then you need to be explicit because optimizations change over time and are not always guaranteed
15:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes, altho c has lots of ub too
15:41 < bridge> <Ewan> this is why most pedantic cpp ppl will have u use constexpr noexcept etc
15:41 < bridge> <learath2> But the set of things that is defined to begin with is small, so maybe there is hope
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes u can be pedantic but the door is open and easier to mix and just go and use old cpp
15:42 < bridge> <learath2> C++ standard is like 10 times the size, and it has sooo many moving parts
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> also unique ptr  is not zero cost 🤓 but rust box is
15:43 < bridge> <Ewan> hmmm
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> its true
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> we had this discussion already
15:43 < bridge> <Ewan> you should not have to rely on smart pointers usually
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> check backlog
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> It do be true, the overhead is very small but yeah
15:43 < bridge> <Fussel> could you name these ›costs‹?
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> You can scroll up like a year or so, we had a nice discussion about it here
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1113389502870859836
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> move constructor moves code
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> runs
15:45 < bridge> <learath2> https://youtu.be/rHIkrotSwcc?si=VVCUnfIhiQQkBR8w I think we also talked about this cppcon talk
15:45 < bridge> <Ewan> no way it was a year
15:45 < bridge> <Ewan> 3 months maybe
15:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust box is tho :brownbear:
15:46 < bridge> <learath2> I was studying so much for the last year that time is diluted for me
15:48 < bridge> <Fussel> `new_pointer = old_pointer`, and where is the problem?
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> That runs the move constructor. Which is not equivalent to assigning a pointer to another which is just a MOV
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> Thus the abstraction is not 0 cost
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> move ctor should also usually be avoided… code moves and object lifetimes in general are so often over complicated in cpp that some features just ought to be avoided for most cases
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> they are a huge bug source
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> There is also exception overhead but I think when we were discussing it we were talking about even without exceptions
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> why am i up at 8 am
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> another proof of no mastery
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> so many subtle things
15:55 < bridge> <learath2> Are you perhaps a responsible adult now?
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> THE OPPOSITE
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> a solution is to use rust
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> u say it like a) it’s just that simple and b) most new projects requiring C++’s speed and low level functionality aren’t already using rust instead
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> try applying the “just use rust ideology” to inherited code
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Ryozuki would totally say they should migrate too 😄
16:10 < bridge> <Ewan> he’d be the poor sucker porting all the code then
16:14 < bridge> <Fussel> ›just a MOV‹ would be wrong behaviour. the target has to correctly destruct it's current content (`delete`)
16:15 < bridge> <Fussel> ← again afk
16:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> im learning c++ for two days now, lest look at the ddnet source again
16:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> im learning c++ for two days now, lets look at the ddnet source again
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> It's more expensive than just a mov + a destruct too, I just assumed it was an already clean pointer. Whatever, just watch the video if you are curious
16:22 < bridge> <Fussel> k sry, didn't want to bother you
16:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> cooool
16:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what editor do you use for changing the code ?
16:30 < bridge> <Ewan> for ddnet?
16:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Qt Creator
16:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can i open ddnet if i make a link on website with href="ddnet://server_path"?
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
16:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it doesnt work for me :D
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
16:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to fix this? 🙂
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> er
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> fix it
16:51 < bridge> <bts._.> works on my machine!
16:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> good to know
16:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Do u use steam version or self compiled ddnet?
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> o yea u will need steam spwxificiciciicc url iirc
16:58 < bridge> <bts._.> @milkeeycat https://ddnet.org/news/ddnet-links/
16:59 < bridge> <bts._.> dont know if this actually helps or not
17:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I don't have . desktop in applications directory
17:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why doesnt it add this file by default?
17:08 < bridge> <bts._.> 🤷‍♀️ is it working now?
17:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I didn't add file yet, it's tea time
17:35 < bridge> <Fussel> don't see an overhead
17:35 < bridge> <Fussel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1183446855275790535/image.png?ex=65885dc5&is=6575e8c5&hm=de0805a2f5d2b57af40ea73a1c11f828cdb5f91d58ef0f25e9b0bebd37930c92&
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> I mean you are doing nothing with it, I'm not exactly surprised
18:01 < bridge> <learath2> https://godbolt.org/z/xKr9Yr9fd here is the construction demonstrated within the talk, as you can see t2 clearly involves 2 extra indirect reads
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> And you can try the same with passing by value, you'll get another different piece of overhead, it's not that every case has unoptimizable overhead, especially with LTO
18:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> for me this started working only after `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications` command
18:35 < bridge> <Ewan> self compiled or from pkg mgr?
18:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> self compiled
18:35 < bridge> <Ewan> then ofc the desktop file won’t be there
18:35 < bridge> <Ewan> the game isn’t installed
18:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> CGameControllerDDRace::~CGameControllerDDRace() = default;
18:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the purpose of making a explicit destructor when the compiler make it by default. and what is the default keyword doing here ?
18:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the purpose of making a explicit destructor when the compiler make it by default. and what is the "default" keyword doing here ?
18:54 < bridge> <teero777> just for clarity
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc u need to when class is virtual iirc
18:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> or you make it special with default keyword :poggers2:
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok idk i forgot c++ imagine doing oop stuff when u can have rust
18:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i thought you are a C guy
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im the rust guy
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> also C doesnt have classes
18:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i love c, it's simple :feelsbadman:
18:57 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it's for this clang-tidy check: https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/virtual-class-destructor.html
18:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> classes make my head explode
19:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thanks
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it is good to be explicit about your dtors. especially when you have a trivially destructible or movable class and you need to specify a virtual dtor, having a = default or using :: is good for clarity
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> virtual dtors are such a massive trap for beginners
19:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i don't know anything about virtual and dtors
19:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> CGameControllerDDRace::CGameControllerDDRace(class CGameContext *pGameServer) :
19:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     IGameController(pGameServer)
19:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and what is this, is this a constructor that inherit from a class ?
19:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> brah
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> the statement after the : is explicitly initializing the parent class instance alongside it
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> basically like calling IGameController::IGameController(pGameServer); as the first statement in the ctor
19:22 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to do this when the parent class marks its ctor as explicit
19:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and i need to go learn what explicit will do in classes
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> c++ grammar is really stupid and convoluted
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> keywords mean different things based on where you use them
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> basically just write code until you understand stuff
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> or #1 most ignored advice of all time, just pick up a book 🙃
19:32 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> to think of it that c++ made a keyword "explicit" for just constructors in classes for a shitty reason 😂
19:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> this is stupid 😂
19:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=only-explicit-specifier-c
19:33 < bridge> <learath2> It can also be used for conversion functions
19:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how much bigger the ddnet code would be if you just used C language ?
19:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> x3 ?
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> No idea
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> true but it doesn’t work for some people
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> adhd ppl
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not too much bigger it would just be structured super differently
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> I have the attention span of a goldfish, if I can make it work so can you 😄
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> lol maybe
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> but yeah, not everyone learns well from books, but there is no harm in trying
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> they are far far far more efficient than you trying to pattern match in the spaghetti we call ddnet full of bad patterns and bad practices
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> unfortunately i have not the attention span
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> American public school taught my to lie and cheat
19:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i will add my spaghetti code into ddnet eventually :troll:
19:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> after my first moded block sv i like to make a ddnet + terraria thing
19:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> teecraft
19:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> as a client btw
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
19:48 < bridge> <teero777> chillerdragon: whats the video upload size limit on your site
19:48 < bridge> <teero777> chillerdragon: whats the video upload size limit on your site?
20:07 < ChillerDragon> u mean here? https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/
20:08 < ChillerDragon> there are no uploads at all so i guess 0? xd
20:08 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 why u askin
20:20 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: awesome project! glad that twmap helps you :)
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i doubt this applies to anyone here but here's a cool ass post <https://leduccc.medium.com/improving-the-performance-of-a-windows-10-guest-on-qemu-a5b3f54d9cf5>
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> wish i had this when i was running a windows vm on a linux host
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> http://t3x.org/t3x/0/book.html
21:17 < bridge> <shyzo.> hello
21:17 < bridge> <shyzo.> can anyone send me ddnet 17.4
21:17 < bridge> <shyzo.> website downloads dont work for me anymore
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://shorturl.at/cmwRY
21:18 < bridge> <robyt3> What doesn't work about it? https://ddnet.org/downloads/DDNet-17.4-win64.zip
21:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Do you get an error message?
21:19 < bridge> <shyzo.> it just doesnt load. and then it says download failed. check connection. or smth like that
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> where are you
21:19 < bridge> <shyzo.> link doesnt work for me xD
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> restart your browser
21:20 < bridge> <shyzo.> tried a different browser. still doesnt work
21:20 < bridge> <shyzo.> its a problem on my side?
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> The links work for me
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> replace casing
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Try rebooting the system
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Restart the router
21:21 < bridge> <shyzo.> thats so weird
21:21 < bridge> <shyzo.> will do, ty
21:25 < bridge> <cyberfighter> why do default binds have numpad bound to eye emotes
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> because someone coded it like that
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t see why it doesn’t make sense anyway
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> this toolset is sick for someone not wanting to use a patched live USB. in this case it's fickle to get a non-disk image to be seen as bootable by qemu (vhd/x) so i want a patched iso <https://github.com/AveYo/MediaCreationTool.bat>
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> Quick_11_iso_esd_wim_TPM_toggle.bat
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> send me a file.... megaupload
