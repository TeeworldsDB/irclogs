00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is release mode server on linux also faster than debug?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rls mode is always going to be slightly faster than dbg afaik, idk if its enough to be noticeable, and it doesnt matter which os
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, it should be "way" faster. I remember when I played around with 256 tees in 0.6, in rls mode it was no problem, in debug tho it lagged very much xD
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think dbg mode turns off compiler optimization and rls mode turns it on
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if that causes the code to become *way* faster then maybe it could be manually optimized a bit?
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 256 players is a number where you should probably stop doing O(n^2) algorithms
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 :D i am using it on 128 right now
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> Hi, I can't open DDNet don't know why, can someone help me please?

01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Pauline can you see if you find /usr/lib/libGLEW.so.1.xx in your system, where XX is some number?
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> wow uh what is it?@RafaelFF
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> i write `/usr/lib/libGLEW.so.1.xx` in terminale ?
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> or this?
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/703753550198603876/Capture_du_2020-04-26_01-45-08.png
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Try running `ls /usr/lib/libGLEW.so.1*` in the terminal
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Pauline
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> ls: unable to access '/usr/lib/libGLEW.so.1*': No such file or folder @RafaelFF
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> What distro are you using?
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> linux mint 19.03
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> `dpkg --list | grep libglew`
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Pauline what does the above command return?
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/703758472738504734/Capture_du_2020-04-26_02-04-48.png
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> this
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Your DDNet expects a libglew version older than what you have now. You should rebuild/reinstall DDNet
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> oh okay, i will try thank you ^^
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I get several reports for lag on my server, can it be the 128 player algorithm @Learath2 @heinrich5991?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how would we know, profile it and you'll know
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have pretty inefficient O(n^2) algorithms all over the code
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as @Learath2 says, it's hard to say what exactly causes it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the more players you add, the more problems will come from O(n^2) algorithms
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for both the collision checks and the playermap you can take a look at AABBs or quadtrees or map chunking
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AABB?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> axis aligned bounding box
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> American Association of Blood Banks
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> definitely not that ðŸ˜„
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, spatial hashing is also interesting
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I think I would start with just chunking up the map)
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know spatial hashing except for soing something like h(p) = p.x+p.y
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> I'm trying to build again ddnet like @RafaelFF told me, but the command `cmake ..` and `make` doesn't work, someone else what to do please?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/703952491103911956/Capture_du_2020-04-26_14-54-30.png
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @SHROD what distribution do you have?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> @heinrich5991 Linux mint 19.03
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> type `sudo apt install build-essential`
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> it's done
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then try `cmake ..` again
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/703959195921154098/Capture_du_2020-04-26_15-22-21.png
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `sudo apt install libnotify-dev`
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> okay ty
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> it's done
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then try `cmake ..` ðŸ™‚
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> yes its good ðŸ™‚
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice!
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> ohh thank you very much! ðŸ™‚
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome. if you run into any more troubles, make sure to ask here ^^
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> ok thank you very much ^^ I may have a problem but I will first check if it does with this version before telling you about it ðŸ™‚
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> ah yes i have
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> in fact I can't hammer and hook at the same time I don't know why, I can hammer and hook but if I do it at the same time it doesn't do either
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> you know what to do or not please?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it might be that pressing left and right mouse button at the same time emulates a middle mouse button click
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you select some text in the terminal and press both mouse buttons?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does the selected text get pasted then?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> and we could settle that?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> wait i test
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> yes
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you use a mouse pad or a mouse?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> a mouse
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> and suddenly you know how to fix it or not please? :GWchadThink:
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm trying to figure it out
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> okay thank you ^^ :GWbruhThonkNoHands:
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you go into the cinnamon settings, under mouse and disable "middle mouse button emulation"?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> I will see
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> here I have disabled
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pauline> it's good it's settled, thank you very much!
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hi, I want to save a date (for example 26th April 2020), and them compare it to another date (for example 20th May 2020). Is it possible in an easy way? Or do I have to write my own functions that care about things like 29th February etc. I want to have a check like `if (date2 >= date1 + x days)`
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in C++ probably chrono, but i haven't used it
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Whats that?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not just convert it to unix time
