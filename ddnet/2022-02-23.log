10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> gs
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> lol xd
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> how do we garantuee packages on steam btw?
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> e.g. we dont ship curl
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> is there some setting in steam that checks packages for existence or does it simply fail, if the required package is not installed?

12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dood
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> well that's annoying
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 can u ban him on irc side
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or put it on +v or smth
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah maybe thats matrix
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <kamala Haris> Guys Just wanna let you know that I invested $500 in Bitcoin and got back $10,000 in 4 hours it 100% safe and legit..
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is so much demand for frontend devs where i live
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i might have to become one
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we just hope that curl is installed
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ok, then we can also hope that the vulkan loader is just installed xdd
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> how do you link against libraries for macos? molten vk for example
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> libcurl is installed basically everywhere @Not Keks
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we include on macos what isn't by default on system
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah ok, then ffmpeg or whatever
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we include that
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i mean for linux
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> was answering heinrich
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> steam has a dependency for libcurl ðŸ˜„
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> steam package suggests vulkan
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i mean it kinda makes sense since DXVK is used alot by steam play
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but its not dependency
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> steam also still chills on 32bit, i guess the dependencies are only 32bit then anyway (?)
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> @deen i guess we should build dr mingw with the patches here https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw/issues/32
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ASLR on 64bit makes it impossible to recover the addresses
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> under wine it simply didnt do this, so i didnt see it
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> oh no
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think it's great to take 3 unreviewed changes from 2018
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I'm wondering why they don't fix it. Disabling ASLR is also not great
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> why not add it
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> the patches are like 100 lines
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> actually probs only like 50 lines xd
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> because then I have to make sure they keep applying
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> would be better if they can be submitted upstream
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I haven't even tested dr.mingw, so i won't be able to judge if everything is fine with the patches
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> the upstream code is also from feb 2021 XD
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i tested only 32bit on windows and 32bit ASLR is just a static offset
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but 64bit does crazy stuff
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (an ez to guess one to be precise)
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs bcs limited address space
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ASLR exists to be unguessable ^^
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but 32bit ez af xD
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's one of the last lines of defense protecting users against exploits
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just replace the first two hex numbers with 40
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/946076589446283315/unknown.png
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 I couldn't find where in ddnet's code it explicitly allows connections of the same port when someone is timeoutprotected
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you try and find that for me? My guess it its in GetClientSlot() just returning the old slot instantly
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but in that case it should work on my server too, since it checks for a current slot first aswell
20:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on private server. if login as main i cant use commands as dummy even if logged in how to fix?
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> known bug, isn't fixed yet
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ok
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ok thx from noctua it was his problem ^^
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh nice the dummy rcon is a ddnet issue? I was sure itâ€™s my fork and I procrastinated looking into it since forever
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Awesome!
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But itâ€™s super old. How come Itâ€™s the first time I hear about it in ddnet.
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, was introduced in 15.9
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if you had it before, you have a different bug
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and I just set bors r+ on the fix for it by heinrich5991
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Do you know when the bug was introduced? Maybe 15.9 was released recently and there are just not enough nightly running dummy using rcon users
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I do merge with upstream a lot
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I try to Resort issues more and faster and check if itâ€™s a ddnet issue. To help released get more stable. \:)
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I try to report issues more and faster and check if itâ€™s a ddnet issue. To help released get more stable. \:)
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> just check yourself: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4721
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh from January yea that kinda old I was talking. And lmao fokkonaut reported it. @fokkonaut do you remember when I said my rcon is broken and you said I messed up my client \:p ?
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I feel kinda guilty letting a bugged rls happen when I could have stopped it.
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, would just have to check if the same bug happens in ddnet ðŸ˜‰
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But already too much effort for lazy dragon
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wonâ€™t happen again \:)
