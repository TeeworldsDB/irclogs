01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is intriguing, it'd be even cuter if it compiled to SQL98 instead of trying to invent a new db engine
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it compiles to psql
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sql can do well with a rewrite
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh so the underlying db is psql?
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the queries are turned into psql queries
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's actually nice. I might give this a go in some small project sometime
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've always found writing SQL a little too tedious
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> PostgreSQL is kind of the new "standard" of SQL. Lots of new database softwares reuse its frontend to have full compatibility
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @louis  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5550 what did you mean with triggering checkpoints out of order
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how on earth did you open a PR without github bot noticing it?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> draft i guess
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but ur pr was found
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and yours was draft from start
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> while codedev made it draft manually
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe the bot or gh just had a timeout, but first time i saw this ðŸ˜„
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I made it draft in I guess less than 2 sec... so maybe the bot did not poll it in that moment
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok but deen also made a draft pr, its just weird ðŸ˜„
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh I see
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but also as I created the PR github lagged really hard... I had to reload the page to see my PR as draft. Maybe they had a short downtime
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok^^
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Other topic, does someone know what @louis  could have meant with allowing to trigger checkpoints out of order? 
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I do not see a real improvement in allowing this.
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Currently you can trigger time Checkpoints out of order, but only in one direction. If you trigger for example CP 10 before you triggered CP 1 to 9, you can no longer trigger CP 1 to 9 but only 11 and further.
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> We could also ignore the fact that checkpoints have a ascending order because and just trigger a checkpoint if it was not triggered before in the race
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> We could also ignore the fact that checkpoints have a ascending order and just trigger a checkpoint if it was not triggered before in the race
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats probably the best, yep
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no not really if i think about it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there are for example solo maps, where you go through a specific part multiple times
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mesnt that u could do like 10 > 5 > 8 > 12
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> in case there are large skips in a map
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> progress is being made
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31967221
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i cant use it :/
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tunneled ipv4 sucks hard with teeworlds xD
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> I think /timecp cmd doesn't work
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://auctions.ipv4.global/prior-sales
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ipv4 ips go for 50$ now

19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> its the new bitcoin
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> did they run out?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> is it actually new, that there is a message when loading ddnet client?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes it tells what it's loading now
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> YOO
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They ran out long ago, so now corporations/universities that have many for historical reasons start selling theirs. The more expensive they get, the more will be sold.
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> dude, that looks so pro. xd i now install plymouth, even though it will show up half a second xd i just like this look.
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wonder if anyone collects cool ip numbers
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Whats the ipv4 market cap?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Whats the ipv4 address market cap?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cloudflare and google have them
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u also count ipv6, facebook has
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2a03:2880:f10c:83:face:b00c:0:25de
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> which includes "faceb00c"
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Only 215 million I guess
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Only 215 billion I guess
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 215 are still buyable or what?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wait billion
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> never
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it only has 4 bytes
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> No I mean the value of all of them if they each sold for 50 dollars
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bro
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i think facebook also has a 1337 ipv6 address, i don't know if that's rare
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the market cap
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not how much are there
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so the market value
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Market capitalization, commonly called market cap, is the market value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares. Market capitalization is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> as if everyone would know that
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> as if everyone would know that ðŸ˜…
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should i guess
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it literally says its the market value
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so why not use market value xD
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u say that people would think about the current market value of the share
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so 50$
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> human language is just too confusing
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Why couldn't they just had 3 more 3 digit numbers onto ipv4 and call it a day, they had to get so clever with it
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ipv6 is better
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and future proof
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> real question is, do we ever need 128 bits? ðŸ˜„
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if not behind a cgnat its even more perfomant
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I was mostly joking
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its never enough
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Market cap is not equal to value. For stocks (or IPs, or crypto currencies) if you try to sell a lot, the value will be affected negatively. By having low supply at the moment, you can inflate the price and thus the market cap, but you could never get out as much as you'd expect based on market cap if you sell a lot
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this website is a good resource to learn this stuff
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its based on american stuff but works
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> what's the term for limit for price of single address? if there is
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think u buy single addresses
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just buy blocks
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the smaller the block you buy, the more ips you waste
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> because there is gaps of not used addresses?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> anyway... not know about this.
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still bad naming xd
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cap is maximum, what justifies this weird shortcut xD
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its Market Capitalization
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cap is just short
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> see
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats what im saying
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bad naming
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> cap is maximum thats why i thought there is a limit for highest price for adderss/block
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk i dont find it that bad
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then call it MC or smth xD
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> better than a naming collision
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> doesn't "it's capped" mean it's limited to some price/value? like fps
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, network address, gateway, and broadcast, so you lose 3 ips per subnet you make
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well obiously, but not in this case
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cap != capping. cap = capitalization here
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> @deen do you need a domain name ddrace.network ?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds expensive xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 70$ usd / year for me
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, we have https://ddnet.org/ and want to switch to it
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that looks cleaner
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I would prefer dd.net ðŸ˜‰
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats a lot actually
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can get it for 30â‚¬ / year even on a german seller
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> yes, that's why I suggest, I just pay for it for two years and don't use it in any way))
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And someone is still redirecting http://ddrace.info/ to us
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we have enough domains, but thanks for asking
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ðŸ˜„
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> greyfox maybe ðŸ˜„
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ddrace domain collection
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> get dd.net
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u pro
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok, i am annoying now, but can't you still use one gateway, broadcast and everything for differenct "fragments". i guess it's not possible. like a virtual block of ip addreses, containing of different blocks not connected, not continuous
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Can you have 2 letter domains?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but then you don't have full control over the subnet. if you just get a regular server, they won't give you a subnet for that reason, but just assign you a single ip
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, they are just very expensive
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://g.co/
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Google says you need special authorization to own one
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> doesn't daimler/benz even have d.ai domain or something
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ye https://d.ai
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since 2 letters only have few combinations, its almost impossible anyway
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Nvm just some of them
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ye http://d.ai
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> dd.net would be extremely expensive xd
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the "old" top level domains especially hard
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they exists since ever basically xd
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> How I can compile client for arm(android)? xD
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> read the readme in scripts/android
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i think sdl2 master is broken for android, at least it was last week :D, maybe its fixed again
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gotta manually check out an old version if still broken
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sdl2 main*
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we should get ddnet.university. then we cool
21:01 <+b3z> but we no university
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ofc, i tought few ppl gores
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> university of applied teeworlds physics
21:03 <+b3z> then offer a degree
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> finish insane first
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> xd
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> finish multieasy first ðŸ˜…
21:09 <+b3z> https://ddnet.tw/players/Fin/
21:09 <+b3z> lol lot changed since i stopped
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> with 128bits, you have enough ip for each atom on the surface of earth ðŸ™‚
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> future proof
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but what when we colloniaze mars
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we need 512bits
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's more atoms than in the universe xd
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's more than atoms in the universe xd
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 256 would already be enough (slightly lower than lower bound atoms in the universe)
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what bout multiverse, lets go with 4096 bits
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what about multi-multiverse
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets go with variable length xd
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> does anyone know what are these dark red messages?
