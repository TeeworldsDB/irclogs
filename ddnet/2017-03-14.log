08:46 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vyPh3
08:46 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 7f407aa Dennis Felsing: Remove useless comment
18:55 < Ryozuki> why all ddnet issues look boring to do :/
18:56 < necropotame> Because the funny ones will be rejected :D :oy-style:
18:56 < Ryozuki> xD
18:56 < Ryozuki> btw isn't this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/478 fixed?
18:57 < necropotame> Arabic is still not working, but it's not related to SDL
19:00 < Ryozuki> " necropotame commented 5 days ago@Learath2, you know that in C++, one can just put the entire code in one line, and save a lot of break lines? :P :troll:"
19:00 < Ryozuki> http://www.ioccc.org/2015/endoh1/prog.c
19:00 < Ryozuki> xD
19:00 < Ryozuki> psss (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/657)
19:08 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: because the boring ones are the ones which remain
19:08 <@heinrich5991> the funny ones get fixed :)
19:08 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: you haven't ocmmented in there yet
19:10 < Ryozuki> ocmmented?
19:11 <@heinrich5991> commented
19:11 < Ryozuki> where i should comment? :o
19:12 < Ryozuki> clang-format uses allman braces?
19:12 < Ryozuki> i like allman braces
19:30 < Mekrioz> can some1 come on Light Grey DDrace and Ban Catholic for blocking?
19:33 < Mekrioz> nvm he left.
19:44 < necropotame> DDNet discord server is garbage
19:44 < Ryozuki> yep
20:05 < Learath2> how can i gather some pitchforks to kill allman style braces?
20:05 < Ryozuki> don't :(
20:08 < Learath2> K&R style bjarnes variant is obviously superior in every sense
20:08 < Ryozuki> no
20:08 < Ryozuki> i hate it
20:08 <@heinrich5991> obviously :)
20:08 <@heinrich5991> I don't care, but let's just stick to the one of the code base
20:08 < Ryozuki> yeah :D
20:08 <@heinrich5991> I edited code bases with both
20:09 < Learath2> thus i need some pitchforks
20:09 < Learath2> you hate it is not a great argument
20:09 < Ryozuki> c:
20:09 < Ryozuki> for me K&r it's so unclear
20:10 < Learath2> for me allman style is so unclear
20:10 < Learath2> single statement in an if block looks orphaned every time i see it
20:11 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: btw, if doing another brace style, I would propose "no blockless if, while, do while(!), etc."
20:11 < Ryozuki> nono, stay as it is
20:11 < Learath2> why are you all so against no blockless if?
20:11 < Learath2> s/no//
20:12 <@heinrich5991> because you can always insert statements that way :)
20:12 < Learath2> i mean if you are coding while drunk its your fault, not like single statement ifs are hard to identify by the corner of your eye from 60 miles away
20:12 < Ryozuki> xD
20:13 < Ryozuki> i think it's a matter of taste
20:13 < Ryozuki> or what u work well with
20:13 < Learath2> no its wastefulness
20:14 <@heinrich5991> poor bytes (and screen space) getting hurt
20:14 < Learath2> the industry blessed you with diskspace now you fill up your source files
20:14 <@heinrich5991> duh, disk space is not an argument
20:14 < Ryozuki> xD
20:14 <@heinrich5991> screen space might be
20:14 < Learath2> this is the same mentality that makes games that use 13gb ram
20:14 <@heinrich5991> LOL no
20:14 < Ryozuki> no
20:14 < Learath2> its like im running a CAD program wtf
20:14 < Learath2> lol yes
20:15 < Learath2> disk space is not argument now because you get this shiny newfound 6zettabyte drives
20:15 <@heinrich5991> no
20:15 <@heinrich5991> disk space wasn't an argument back then
20:15 <@heinrich5991> not for this kind of change in style of source code
20:16 <@heinrich5991> maybe for punch cards
20:16 <@heinrich5991> images and the like might actually take up space
20:16 <@heinrich5991> but bytes for the extra line and tab in source code?
20:16 < Learath2> point is allman style is wasteful
20:17 <@heinrich5991> not of disk space, that's just ridiculous
20:17 < Learath2> sure its idiotproof but who wants idiots coding anyways
20:17 < Ryozuki> you can allways uglify ur code
20:17 < Ryozuki> always*
20:17 < Learath2> ill withdraw that argument becaue it seems to distract you
20:17 <@heinrich5991> good :)
20:17 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: people make mistakes, I do too. I like it if most errors are prevented without even thinking about them
20:17 < Learath2> i always code in proper K&R style first then style my code for pull requests
20:18 < Learath2> heinrich5991: i hate it if errors are prevented without thinking about them given thinking is essential to coding and all
20:19 <@heinrich5991> but if a category of errors can be excluded, then it frees your mind up to think about other stuff
20:19 < Learath2> are you actually saying that you can not identify a blockless if while wasted?
20:20 < Learath2> I'm pretty sure you identify them better then me given your crusade against them
20:20 < Ryozuki> i like blockless ifs too
20:20 <@heinrich5991> I'm saying that if a code style can make it easier to code, then I'll take it
20:20 < Ryozuki> allman + blockless
20:20 <@deen> who cares about code style? just stay with the current one
20:20 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:21 <@heinrich5991> ^w?
20:22 < Learath2> can't believe i got beaten by "Keep the status quo because (nullptr)" again
20:22 < Learath2> it happened at the debate tournament in prague aswell
20:23  * Learath2 was not even arguing to change ddnet's coding style
20:23  * heinrich5991 thought so too, which was the reason for the quick yes
20:23 <@heinrich5991> "yes"
20:24 <@heinrich5991> yes, but that's not what we're talking about
20:25  * Ryozuki test?
20:25 < Ryozuki> :o
20:30 <@deen> I just glanced over and saw something about brackets and then disk space :D
20:32 < Learath2> http://paste.pr0.tips/Zr?c this illustrates the only place i find allman braces useful and thats 8 length tabstops
20:32 < Learath2> the huge tabstops make code instantly unreadable for me
20:35 < Ryozuki> "Formatting styles is like religion, there are always those that disagree. No matter how much evidence is shown that one is better than the other, people will not accept it."
20:35 < Ryozuki> xD
20:37 < Learath2> oh maybe if i make a catchy looking website @ www.savethelines.com and declare a day for lines
20:38 < Learath2> or hmm stop abusing your enter key day
20:59 < Learath2> just noticed the amount of mods we have on GER
21:03 <@heinrich5991> notice the lack of mods on other servers
21:29 < necropotame> Oh, I'm happy to have missed the discussion
21:29 < necropotame> Could be cool to have that much energy to review and comment PR :3
22:45 < laxadedi> I don't really care that much about bracket style, but the 8 spaces indentation is really killing me
22:45 < laxadedi> Haven't seen that much indentation anywhere else
22:56 < necropotame> I don't understand this indentation things. It's not a personal choice that everyone can set in the IDE since the code use tabulations?
