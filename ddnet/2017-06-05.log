00:18 <+Learath2> deen: what theme is the current forum theme based on?
00:19 <@deen> Learath2: since it's called prosilver-ddnet I guess prosilver
00:20 <+Learath2> eh no way to get a clean diff, i'll just have to re-do it i guess
00:22 <@deen> well yeah, since I started with some old version and then remerged and added stuff
00:22 <@deen> so I also had trouble finding out  what I changed in the end :D
00:28 <+Learath2> even the CSSs don't cleanly diff :D
00:39 <@deen> I tried to change as little as possible
00:40 <@deen> but then with new versions noticed that some stuff stopped working, so had to add more and more stuff
00:42 <+Learath2> the second you include the css from the main site it starts to break :)
15:28 < void_> I dont' get a pChar ref if i try adding a new ddrace command. Can someone help me with that?
15:46 < void_> nvm, i'm fucking dumb lol
