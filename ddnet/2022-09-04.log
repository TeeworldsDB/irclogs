00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ravie Senpai hope u didn't came back to annoy people
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Progress: I added this to gamecore.cpp and gamecore.h; now all i have to do is to figure out how to call it inside where i need it.
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015750624769490964/unknown.png
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ok i found out how i think
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tbh u don't even need to break if you return
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> break is only to avoid unecessary condition check after
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015752671153635328/unknown.png
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is this even right?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015752824858099722/unknown.png
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015753032102846484/unknown.png
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> found a good explanation
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you didn't initialize Tuning
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Harper_breey> It's a cryptocurrency investment which you can start with as little as $200 and earn a minimum of 8% profit weekly. You can also earn up to 16% profit weekly depending on which investment plan you invest in.
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Harper_breey> 
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Harper_breey> It is an officially licensed company that provides it’s clients with all required guarantees.https://t.me/Etxcapital1
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how do you initialize pointers? isn't it something with the & symbol?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk ur code but depends on what u're doing
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah and didn't see
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but here you attempt to use `CGameClient *m_pClient;` which isn't initialized too
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also to be clear with that
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> m_ means it's a class member
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's just easier for people to know that
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> fair ennough
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> p stands for pointer
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I changed Tuning to pTuning then
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I don't have much experience with client-side to help you for the rest, will let others answer you
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I don't have much experience with client-side to help you for the rest, will let others answer you (can only help abit for server-side)
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looked rly fast, why don't you just return m_<weapon>FireDelay
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you're inside CTuningParams class
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015760705242284152/unknown.png
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then from there you just call your function GetWeaponFireDelay
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> smth like
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```cpp
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> float CTuningParams::GetWeaponFireDelay(int Weapon)
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> {
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     switch (Weapon)
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     {
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     case WEAPON_HAMMER: return (float)m_HammerHitFireDelay / 1000.f;
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     case WEAPON_GUN: return (float)m_GunFireDelay / 1000.f;
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     case WEAPON_SHOTGUN: return (float)m_ShotgunFireDelay / 1000.f;
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     case WEAPON_GRENADE: return (float)m_GrenadeFireDelay / 1000.f;
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     case WEAPON_LASER: return (float)m_LaserFireDelay / 1000.f;
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     case WEAPON_NINJA: return (float)m_NinjaFireDelay / 1000.f;
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     default: dbg_assert(false, "Invalid weapon.");
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     }
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> }
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> m_pClient is unitialized
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try with GameClient() instead
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then smth like
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```cpp
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bool IsActive = !m_pClient->m_aClients[ClientID].m_Afk || LastAttackTime < m_pClient->m_aTuning[g_Config.m_ClDummy].GetWeaponFireDelay(Weapon);
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then smth like
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```cpp
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bool IsActive = !m_pClient->m_aClients[ClientID].m_Afk || LastAttackTime < m_pClient->m_aTuning[g_Config.m_ClDummy].GetWeaponFireDelay(Player.m_Weapon);
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea one sec
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Idk but what I said is maybe the better way to go
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'll try it
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Idk but what I said is maybe the better way to go Instead of accessing CGameClient from CTuningParams
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also to answer your questions:
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015765187921457262/unknown.png
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is this a good placement for this?
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015772558152441946/unknown.png
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I don't want to create a new tab in appearance dedicated for 1 option.
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I don't want to create a new tab in appearance dedicated for 1 option. (Or two, depending if you would want running state as a toggle as well)
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I don't want to create a new tab in appearance dedicated for 1 option. (Or two, depending if you would want running state as a toggle as well. Both are off by default)
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you check how this would look for ninja?
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Sword still in same position
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015790639528554578/unknown.png
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also I'm going to create an animation tab in appearance; because it's more readable, and Kill Messages also only has 2 options.
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Both setting ticks work! Uploading the commit
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> The build works just fine, but I think I need to add a return here, since github says it doesn't really work if it doesn't.

11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I don't know what you mean
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> swapped sides?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I did not. I just don't like people that are using other peoples stuff (maybe again this time) without giving credits or ask for permissions at least. If you DoS a game with small server capacity (that requires 0.01% skill and knowledge), then stay to your origin and agree to the accusations of being a script kiddy since years.
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 💀
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well said
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does our ddnet bot support discord.js?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wdym support?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want to use js to create skin previews for #📬submit-skins 
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i dont want to use python bcs i hate python xd
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015945970493698120/test.mp4
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao its like 0.7 client, pet the skins
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you could maybe create a js api to render the preview and then make a request in python to upload the resulting image to discord?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you could maybe create a js api to render the preview and then make a request to the url in python to upload the resulting image to discord?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i tried that
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://aliveclan.de/ddnettmp/skinsrenderer.html?skin=https://ddnet.tw/skins/skin/2005tfo.png
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we defs need an extra layer
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be cool if discord could just preview it^^
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> well you need to upload the image as an attachement
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> well you need to upload the image as an attachement i guess
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes but how long would discord wait before timing out?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> timing out?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i need to fetch the data, then render the canvas, then render smth on the canvas
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if discord is too stupid it will just thing there is an empty page with an canvas
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if discord is too stupid it will just think there is an empty page with an canvas
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> well it's not discord
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> it would be python
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah if smbdy will do that xd
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i dont want to touch it
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i could try
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but i'm seeing a redirect from the url you gave?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok easiest would be if the python sends it as base64 string to the renderer
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it creates a blob as soon as the canvas is finished
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i see
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> the skin as base64 string?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> how would the request look like
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else if u know how to create images in python i can also give you the js code
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its rather small
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015949230474539078/render.ts
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> you could also use this https://github.com/teeworlds-utilities/tw-utils
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the preview already looks wrong 😄
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i used client code now, so its accurate
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> true, it looks a little bit off
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> i rewrote it completely for my discord bridge too, but only because i found out of this after i had already finished it
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you use a nodejs server on your discord then?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> yes
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> its completely in nodejs
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> even the client is in nodejs/typescript
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok well that would indeed be easy for this then too probably 😄
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i think ddnet bot only uses python rn
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> ye idk xd
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015955130190938222/unknown.png
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Harper_breey> https://t.me/Etxcapital1
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> rewrite it
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> discord.py is ded since a long time
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont even know who hosts the bot xD
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> eeven if they use some cmds
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the bot should stop working soon
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if they don't migrate to a fork that is up to date or else like discord.js or serenity
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if they don't migrate to a fork that is up to date or else like discord.js or serenity (Rust)
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway for now i want to try to make a new webpage for ddnet
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kog and skins.tw look much more modern, ddnet looks like some 2005 website xdd
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but at least ravie already hater xdd
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> KoG website.. Where the light mode is bugged because of the black mode....
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015961580904644669/unknown.png
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not about if the website works xd
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I'm talking about the design
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> The design looks ugly as hell
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno it looks unfinished true
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Also making a new DDNet website isn't worth it
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but generally its clean and has some layout idea
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i click through the sites
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, it’s not that ugly. It’s just a cookie cutter modern website though. Very standardized looking
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can quickly upload my current progress, but i am not yet focusing on design purly
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most logic isnt finished
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I consider that as ugly. I don't know if I'm weird, but I want something more unique. That looks like every bootstrap template on the second page of search results
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://aliveclan.de/
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly prefer something more unique aswell. Just bootstrap on everyone and their mothers projects is just annoying
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> currently the skin database is my working ground
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fixed spacing, rendering and made it mobile friendly
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it can only render rn, no searching etc 😄
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some box shadows and it actually looks quite promising
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c4324f17a80c94776832430007ad40e6
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh dunno yet 😄
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes ik that
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ho
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk that
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It looks a bit like a PDF with chapters for now (no hate)
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> LOL I only knew when he was dead, good news
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Too much scrolling down
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and how would you rate the current site against that?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it has the exact same content 😄
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> That's exactly what I want you to say
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It's just the same but with other colours and more "pew pew"
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i generally think the current page looks too overwhelming
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> too much different colors, doesnt look clean
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> by that I meant that you're known for doing shit illegal stuff
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I don't
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’d experiment with some padding in your larger containers sides. Maybe just for the contents of the inner container or even just the outer container to mimic a bit of a “border”
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m not a big fan of the seamless look with container sides 😄
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i am not a fan of borders in borders
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m a fan of borders in borders. Clear hierarchy ❤️
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> rip schengen
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its really ugly show me one site that does that and doesnt look trash xD
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> But if you have any problems with me, just pm me. We don't need to run a conversation like this in a public place.
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Don't need to, people already know u
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Do they
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i prefer to eliminate all randomness, see on current page for example
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> weird random boxes everywhere, too much random space
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015964856685445150/unknown.png
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you wouldn't like latex then 😄
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> trash is a bit of an overstatement, but sure, design is subjective afterall
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015965468550500372/unknown.png

14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno imo the hierarchy is already given by using different colors
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this just creates extra unused space
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So does the centering, aesthetic decisions usually do that. Just 20 px off your screen compared to the massive grey bars on the outside
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If space efficiency is the goal we could d
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> o
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> binpacking 😄
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, the keyboard on this mac is dead, it randomly sends enter
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it's not possible to make a system like that.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thats cute
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm not hater, it just needs a design that has some soul
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about a largeish vector tee slightlydarker than the background in the background that is invariant to scrolling? Soul = added
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and have it be saddo? Souly = added
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do u know this wide putin walk?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we need that with deen skin in background
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm thinking about something with ddnet colors and some customized elements so it's not that bland
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but PLS no orange
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> orange is awesome
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this color is so ugly also in the logo
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hater
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are the designman, you tell us. We are codeppl, eyes not very good
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why does skins.tw logo look better than ddnet?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs it doesnt use this intense orange xD
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Orange and blue works well on the light theme. On dark not so great, it gives a permanent halloween vibe
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ehh it looks a tiny bit botched to me. idk why
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don’t they have a large text with yellow orange and brown
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> havent we once talked about other skins on the logo
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that would give it some detail and not being so boring
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> have we? i dont remember
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> because the current ddnet.tw dark theme was literally meant as a halloween theme
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aha, that explains a lot 😄
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt u even make a sneakpeak?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if it had more blue and less orange I don't think it would feel like halloween
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i would need to find it again
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> i like the ddnets website
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> i like ddnets website
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The current one?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok u made some cat
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/965634025752494110
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but rather looks like a joke
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> yeah
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but still looks good imo xD
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh yea that LOL
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i did make a serious version too ove sec
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i did make a serious version too one sec
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> FBI
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To be fair minus some padding issues and color choices it honestly doesn’t look too bad
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is quite unique in it’s design too
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the homepage is quite nice, only the forum feels like 2005
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some more accenting with backing boxes and fixing stuff like the news header being on a block of it’s own for whatever reason would actually go a long way
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> looks a bit like a blank stare now that i look at it but i think it would be funny if you could change the logo tees in the settings
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015979166534991892/gui_logo.png
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i am 100% a hater, but imo ddnet always looks so cheap
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The logo is mhh not bad but also doesnt look convincing
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> website looks dated, but spacing as u said. 
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> misses cool functionality (e.g. easier filtering for maps etc)
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and colors(in dark design) are horrible 😄
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah that one is the one i meant actually
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i could swear u posted it before
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think i did, but i forgot when
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015979318595309699/unknown.png
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what would be even funnier? If every time you opened the webpage you got a different logo 😄
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> phpBB is still amazing if u ask me, modern forums are cluttered and just annoying to look through
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> x_logo skin
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah could be better, but a redesign also feels out of place
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the logo especially
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My main complaint is the way we generate the site with python scripts
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this convinces me more xDDD
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok u cant compare ofc
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015979822368956487/unknown.png
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this looks like a cheap mobile game ngl
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Voxel draw us some photorealistic tees for the logo
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A modern skin over it might be nice, but honestly so little people use it that it really wouldn’t be worth spending time on it
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> noooo please no
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> csgo actually looks sick
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015980065525354516/unknown.png
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont think id want to do that 😨
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so simple yet powerful
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cs has a great logo yeah
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let’s steal it. @Voxel do your magic. Replace CT guy with tee
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDRace <insert-tee-silhouette> Network 😄
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> LOL
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah i WANTED to help redesign steam's advertizing a bit but everyone was like "nahh wait until new freeze ice cube is out"
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xdd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tru
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we are never getting an ice cube 😦
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> :/
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An ice cube that’d fit every skin just can’t be a static asset
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> id want it to be procedural
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did briefly experiment with procedurally generating a frozen skin for each skin, but I’m shit at art, so my procedural art is also shit 😄
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Can I see it?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I covered every non transparent piece of the tee with a hexagonal grid. But I just never figured out what the hell to draw onto the grid
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I just had hexagons with an opaque blue edge and a semi-transparent light blue inside for testing
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m a little busy right now, but maybe in a week I can dig it up
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> What frozen ice cube tee are you guys talking about?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah no rush
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a lot of branches just named “test[0-9]*”
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we're planning on inevetably replacing freeze ninja
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we're planning on inevitably replacing freeze ninja
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Isn't there already an option to disable it
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah but i mean **replace** replace.
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you get a weaponless tee. Doesn’t look “frozen”
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> With what?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Draw an icecube over the tee when frozen?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ice is tetraedric crystals, maybe you can try with triangles ? Writing that, i realize that hexagones are just two triangles, so should work the same way
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well i mean with this approach the base would look fine, but how would shading work? how to match the shine with the shape to have it not look flat?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> what?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I am pretty sure you need at least 5 triangles
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk actually
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Definitely not 2

16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup, im stupid 😄
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least 3
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 3 if you share sides, 5 if you share vertex
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> mr design man has tried something, it's very rough obviously but kinda what I have in mind
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016000662280077372/ddnet_site.png
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i like the big logo with background
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that would only work on main page probs
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it could display a random map there
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> definitely a lot more aesthetically pleasing
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but the 2 link groups seem redundant
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's more modern
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> needed filler text
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it could be different stuff there
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where would you put the remaining links tho?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> can u do design for my website xDDDDDD
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know its just some basic showcase
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Looking at it i'd say
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good:
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a top bar for the icons and download button and maybe the most important links is good
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the logo is cool, but only works on the main page, the front page video would be dropped, bcs both together won't work
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> There would either still be a (left navigation => makes it uglier again) or (a dropdown navigation required => less practical to use)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah the logo with background is meant as a front page, it wouldn't be in other pages
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and front page video doesnt matter? ^^ or could u imagine it looking good below itr
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and left navigation thing is nice imo, it could be different tho
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but would it be left from the logo too? else it jumps around
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when u switch pages
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I put the video as just some random front page stuff, could be videos or news or anything else if needed
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> could also get rid of the left navigation thing and put everything on the top bar but that's messy
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> currently we have way too many links to pages to fit on top bar so something like the left menu is needed
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> content-wise, I would love to see a "about" page explaining a bit more what the game is bcs I found it quite confusing when I started playing
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think thats the wiki's purpose
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no need to bloat the website
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Floms> can anyone point me in the right direction to get this lua file? I already tried recompiling bam to no avail
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Floms> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016023789882052658/unknown.png
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet does not use bam anymore
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since like 5 years
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Floms> ok so the tutorial I found is just archaic xd
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Not Keks
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016025274246238259/ddnet_site2.png
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just read the readme
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, yeah I guess the topbar menu could work out, should test that out, especially in mobile where width is more of a problem than desktop, left navigation looks too bad compared to the topbar which looks much more modern
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but generally its not too far from my approach i'd say
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you save one layer in the container where the maps are, which i like, tho i use it to put all the filters (ofc the filters are currently a bit too much, need better sizing etc)
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But except the topbar menu, i'd not directly say it has more soal, would you? and if so, why exactly?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The text under "Map releases" for example ofc sucks in my version, its what the current page uses i just copied pasted, that's defs in the range of change anyway
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016027360555958292/unknown.png

18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> can't go too crazy either or the website will look really out of place but I'm trying to make it not look like it came straight from some material template
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> little accents with ddnet colors etc give some soul
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i customized the colors indeed xD
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the original colors where much darker
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i used the ddnet dark design colors
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i have nothing against other colors
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but orange on dark design, pls no
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is a reason google choose a light blue i guess xD
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also mine takes elements from the old website
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but only good elements xd
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean the good thing about these ui frameworks is that you can customize the components itself
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u usually try not to invent more components, else redesigning gets harder
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I never complained about the frameworks, only that almost all websites made with them feel the same
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm unsure about the left menu now tho, something has to take space there for the whole website's height, otherwise it will look offcenter and bad
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I put an empty rectangle there but if there's nothing to use that space then left menu needs to go
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> unless the left menu extends all the way down like in your screenshot

19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kimmartial> (@louis)
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> this actually doesn't feel too bad either
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016031946809290923/ddnet_site_3.png
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe only the front page can have the left menu
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah ofc, less menu is always nice, menu is also what i hate most about mine, but question is how practical that is
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> On the topic of ddnet.tw redesigns, here's what I made a few months ago. Project kinda abandoned as I kept running into problems. https://ddnet.qwikz.eu/ :)
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the stuff inside the boxes can be better displayed too imo
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> where dark theme
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think having the left menu below the big centered ddnet logo will make it not feel like the whole website shifted when you click a link
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> instead of difficulty: xxxoo points: 12 u can just have 5 stars
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you explain, the sentence confuses me a bit, what exactly shifts?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if the left menu take up the whole website's height and then you go to a page with no left menu then it will feel like everything jumped to the left
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how is it made, just out of interest?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah, you are right
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but if it's just a little rectangle below some big thing that is centered, it should feel ok
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016035048291586068/ddnet_site_4.png
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so the left menu could just be like a front page hub thing
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we use it for example in ranks too, would you go with an approach like @kiwq page then?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> NodeJS, nothing fancy. Dunno exactly what you want to know, but feel free to be more specific :D
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it pure typescript?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or a framework?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> react?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> JSX?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> Server-side generated
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but how did u code it
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> Nunjucks
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok never seen it ^^
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in that case the ranks page could also have a little side menu
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't like the idea of keeping every page just a big centered rectangle
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I see on kiwq's ranks page a horizontal rectangle with filters on top but a lot of unused space to the right of `Global ranks`
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean ok, that could defs work, only use the menu where its needed
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yep it only feels weird with it disappearing if it takes up the entire left side of the screen
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now the question is, is "status" and "ranks" not important enough for the topbar? 😄
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just use icons?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> contents in my mockups are debatable, it's more about the general layout and style
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem is, adding 2 topbar items makes it ugly again
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it looks good, bcs its pretty clean
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think an actual website would be wider than my mockups, the scale is a little weird
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so you can probably fit one or two more things on the top bar, if not then something like skin database can go to left side menu cause it's not THAT important
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mobile, small browser window
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well true
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> possibly could have dropdowns on the top bar and group some related stuff
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also `Map releases` -> `Maps`
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i had a dream last night where robyt had authority to change commit names, and he decided to change my `Try return 0.0f as builf failsafe` commit to just `Try return 0.0f`. and then for some reason he started hacking the entire PR LOL
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> some people do have "authority" to change your PRs
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> does this include names of commits?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they can force push them
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its a visisble change
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i defs need ur dreams dude
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> uh, what?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :greenthing:
