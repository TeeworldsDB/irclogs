00:47 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> wv
02:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> ok i pushed some stuff
02:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> ðŸ˜…
02:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134650286586208317/image.png
02:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think im just gonna ignore the clang-tidy & clang-format checks until i do the final pre-merge cleanup
02:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> running those checks locally doesn't sound like fun or like a good use of time
04:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/746534464984973323/1134499395413475358
04:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> uhhh
04:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> why is his game offset like that
04:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> sdl sometimes reports incorrect window border sizes, but why is that being messed with at all
04:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> and you'd need to explicitly mess with a bunch of things to get the background translucent like that while keeping the native border xd
10:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think that's just Windows Vista/7 Aero design
10:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think you still need to set your hwnd as a layered window on win7
10:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> for bg to be transparent
11:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> he says it's a fullscreen thing?
11:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> If you pc is faster than potato GitHub pipeline its a good use of your time since you spend less time on try and error. You can just copy paste the command from the GitHub action yaml
11:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@mpft)
11:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> can u guess when i started the master server viewer?

11:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on my server, but its with all services combined
11:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134782562347274271/image.png
11:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im adding skin rendering rn
12:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pog
12:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134791273841184789/image.png
12:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no custom color tho
12:20 < ChillerDragon> already better than kog
12:21 < ChillerDragon> btw @avolicious when make kog.tw web scale? its blazingly slow
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> are you reading @patiga's reference on tee rendering? ðŸ˜›
12:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no
12:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i copied the script i edited from ddnet.org
12:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
12:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wanted to do smth fast
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://ddstats.org/
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now renders skins
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rly barebones
12:40 < ChillerDragon> patiga wrote a book? where can i buy it?
12:43 < ChillerDragon> kog cant even do default colors xd wtf is this
12:43 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1690627421.png
12:44 < ChillerDragon> there are so many tee renderers for the web out there 
12:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> when do web demo renderer? :p
12:50 < ChillerDragon> pretty sure patiga is on that
12:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu
12:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> todo self note: make a simple api service given a skin and colors it renders them
12:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think kog might have one
12:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and ddnet? not sure
12:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont use closed source
12:54 < ChillerDragon> kog is closed source and broken af
12:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mine will be agpl
12:54 < ChillerDragon> didnt teeskins have one?
12:55 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut what were you using again for your discord bridge?
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they have a api to get the skin but not render i think
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and definitly not with colors
12:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't know which of my mentioned renders are open-source
12:55 < ChillerDragon> i thought fokko used the teeskins api for his discord bridge which had colors if im not mistaken
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet uses tee.js a less than 100 line script i edited
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:55 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 dont mention closed source projects
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> view-source:https://ddnet.org/skins/tee.js
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/AlexIsTheGuy/TeeAssembler-2.0/tree/main
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this exists but
12:56 < ChillerDragon> yes this pog too
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i had a hard time adapting it to my simple use case
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> too much bother
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but good source
12:57 < ChillerDragon> https://ddnetpp.zillyhuhn.com/players.php
12:57 < ChillerDragon> i used teeassembler here
12:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i see
12:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i dont wanna use raw js scripts in my svelte app
12:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he should have  made  it with a simpler api
12:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not inserting dom elements xd
12:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway ill just make a api that returns a image
12:59 < ChillerDragon> as i said pretty sure that exists
12:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well if u find it and its open source tell me
13:00 < ChillerDragon> gotta wait 2days for @fokkonaut to wake up he can tell you
13:00 < ChillerDragon> not sure if its open src
13:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a thing i noticed is quite a lot are using skins not even in skins.tw
13:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> skin names such as EDBE6725B8099D9F793D5CA
13:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Pom Pom
13:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:01 < ChillerDragon> Pom Pom ?
13:01 < ChillerDragon> wot people still use custom skin packs in 2023?
13:01 < ChillerDragon> Bro, checkout this skins.zip
13:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im not in the list sadge
13:02 < ChillerDragon> which list?
13:02 < ChillerDragon> a
13:02 < ChillerDragon> that yes
13:02 < ChillerDragon> its super old and far from finished
13:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not that old if u list timakro as timakro and not DoNe
13:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ðŸ˜‰
13:03 < ChillerDragon> this guy is DoNe since forever
13:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
13:03 < ChillerDragon> you may notice that im big sp someone fan

13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Info: SP | Someone is a known troll on the ddracenetwork servers. He found many bugs and exploits in whole teeworlds. He also happily abused them to troll as much as possible. Thats why many people think he is also ddosing ddnet servers and the staff has a negative opinion about him. To name a few exploits he found:
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > - Using names on ddnet including ";kill" to kill far players by convincing them to type '/points plz;kill;me' in chat
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > - He found a way to abuse the weak crc (cycle redundancy hash) used in teeworlds for downloaded maps
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > - He found a bug in AllTheHaxx client to spam users in chat
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > - He managed it to get the ddnet and noby fng server rcon multiple times
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
13:04 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u also should add
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he spammed t he wiki in 2015 with deen is <bad word here>
13:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in every page
13:05 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:05 < ChillerDragon> epic didnt know
13:05 < ChillerDragon> there was a wiki in 2015?
13:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
13:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i closed it sadly cuz stuff
13:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it reopened when zwelf did stuff on his wiki
13:06 < ChillerDragon> idk how to edit this list anyways
13:06 < ChillerDragon> i think its some kind of sqlite db
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/news/ddrace-wiki/
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 2016
13:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon u said kog is slow, does ddstats.org feel slow?
13:18 < ChillerDragon> my internet is slow af
13:18 < ChillerDragon> so it loads a bit
13:19 < ChillerDragon> but on kog to take the screenshot of my ugly skin i waited like 2 minutes then closed the tab to later reopen it when it was done xd
13:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> loading a user takes a lot
13:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 40 secs so far and still hasnt
13:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wont bother
13:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:19 < ChillerDragon> ikr xd
13:20 < ChillerDragon> blazingly kubernetes
13:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kubernetes amirite
13:20 < ChillerDragon> axaxax
13:20 < ChillerDragon> debian moment this mf ``deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware`` did not let me install php
13:20 < ChillerDragon> adding this boi fixed it ``deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main non-free-firmware``

13:56 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> sudo is still cool bro
13:56 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> fun cves
14:14 < ChillerDragon> real gamers use root user
14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i was root in sv anyway
14:32 < bridge_> <learath2> I was also root on all the servers anyway
14:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon: https://koshka.love/babel/irc-forever.html
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now i just need to learn to render the skin
14:44 < ChillerDragon> tldr
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> new rust project
14:45 < ChillerDragon> but nice title
14:46 < ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/blazingly_07.mp4
14:46 < ChillerDragon> blazingly 0.7 support
14:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> definitly not fast
14:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess it doesnt do prediction
14:47 < ChillerDragon> idk waddup with this drunk flag
14:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> prediction?
14:47 < ChillerDragon> it cant keep up with my insane movement that does not include mouse usage
14:47 < ChillerDragon> isnt the flag attached to a tee?
14:47 < ChillerDragon> i didnt expect its position to be independent
14:48 < bridge_> <teero777> when do we finally get a bigger emote wheel? xD
14:48 < ChillerDragon> wot d
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> https://canary.discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/252358080522747904/964743736443666482
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> need this
14:50 < bridge_> <teero777> especially the speed emote XD
14:51 < ChillerDragon> sends a discord link
14:51 < ChillerDragon> yea i can imagine what a bigger emote wheel is 
14:51 < ChillerDragon> but wh xd
14:51 < ChillerDragon> why
14:51 < bridge_> <teero777> for more emotes xD
14:51 < ChillerDragon> o more
14:52 < bridge_> <teero777> what else could it be? xDD
14:52 < ChillerDragon> thats compability breaking
14:53 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm then dont allow new emotes on servers below a certain version.
14:53 < bridge_> <teero777> i would love to see more emotes
14:53 < bridge_> <learath2> It's definitely doable
14:54 < bridge_> <teero777> just in case
14:54 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252358080522747904/964743735768412160/unknown.png
14:54 < bridge_> <teero777> from voxel
14:56 < bridge_> <teero777> and if the player uses a old texture then ignore the new emotes
14:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is the name teerender taken
14:57 < bridge_> <teero777> whatcha wanna do with it?
14:57 < bridge_> <teero777> you mean ingame name?
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as a project
14:59 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 the server doesnt care much its more about the other clients that do not know the emotes
14:59 < bridge_> <teero777> ye ik so the client checks whether the emote ids that are incoming are possible for the client?
15:00 < bridge_> <teero777> old client still probably check whether a emote id is valid right?
15:00 < bridge_> <teero777> old clients still probably check whether a emote id is valid right?
15:02 < ChillerDragon> yea it might show nothing so its not compability
15:02 < bridge_> <teero777> it sure would take a while till everyone has updated to a new version but it would bve pretty cool in my opinion
15:02 < ChillerDragon> breaks all the emote muzzle memory
15:03 < bridge_> <teero777> xD
15:03 < ChillerDragon> its a thng
15:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok teerender name is now mine
15:03 < bridge_> <teero777> nooo i made a lost project 5 years ago with that name that nobody will ever see
15:04 < bridge_> <teero777> jk
15:05 < bridge_> <teero777> hey where is the src for the map webviewer thing?
15:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a question, does skins.tw have more skins and the same skins that ddnet.org has?
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks is there a url to download all skins?
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the one on web seems dynamic
15:07 < bridge_> <teero777> probably since on skins.tw everyone can just upload stuff
15:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but idk
15:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> closed source
15:10 < bridge_> <teero777> well you definitely wouldnt find 17 diffrent color variations of the nanami skins on the ddnet skin base
15:10 < bridge_> <teero777> xD
15:11 < bridge_> <teero777> ðŸ˜‚
15:11 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134835571253071882/image.png
15:11 < bridge_> <teero777> well you definitely wouldnt find ~~17~~ 25 diffrent color variations of the nanami skins on the ddnet skin base
15:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 is this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3b273500c54b718e25eb57cba4accfe9a30a23d0/src/base/color.h#L134 how to convert the player body color to smth like rgba?
15:17 < bridge_> <learath2> As in from the decimal packed teeworlds format?
15:18 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm? ColorRGBA has a overloaded constructor for that right?
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> player_color_body 7985705
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> player_color_feet 9568511
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the one master  reports
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which is this i think
15:19 < bridge_> <learath2> You'll need to go through `ColorHSLA`
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Ddnets skins can all be downloaded in the database
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Skin tw dunno
15:19 < bridge_> <teero777> ```    color4_base(unsigned col, bool alpha = false)
15:19 < bridge_> <teero777>     {
15:19 < bridge_> <teero777>         a = alpha ? ((col >> 24) & 0xFF) / 255.0f : 1.0f;
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777>         x = ((col >> 16) & 0xFF) / 255.0f;
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777>         y = ((col >> 8) & 0xFF) / 255.0f;
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777>         z = ((col >> 0) & 0xFF) / 255.0f;
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777>     }```
15:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah from browser, how from cli
15:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh nice
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> There is a skins.json which holds all paths
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> But else u cant
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> directly above the snippet you posted
15:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what format is it tho
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> ColorRGBA inherits that from the color4base
15:21 < bridge_> <teero777> so its int to ColorRGBA
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.org/skins/skin/skins.json
15:22 < bridge_> <teero777> you can just say `ColorRGBA playercolbdy = ColorRGBA(g_Config.m_ClPlayerColorBody);`
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> bruv
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im not using c++
15:22 < bridge_> <teero777> huh what are you using? xD
15:22 < bridge_> <teero777> rust?
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ofc
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
15:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ew
15:22 < bridge_> <teero777> xDDD
15:22 < bridge_> <teero777> shoudve expected that
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im doing a single web api endpoint
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to render skins
15:23 < bridge_> <teero777> well then its just rgba format
15:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
15:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]

15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh a typo lmao
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 9
15:25 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't think you can do this
15:25 < bridge_> <learath2> The numbers are packed hsl, not packed rgb, the color will be wrong
15:25 < bridge_> <learath2> In the code we do `color_cast<ColorRGBA>(ColorHSLA(col))` iirc
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> template<>
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> inline ColorHSLA color_cast(const ColorRGBA &rgb)
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> {
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float Min = minimum(rgb.r, rgb.g, rgb.b);
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float Max = maximum(rgb.r, rgb.g, rgb.b);
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float c = Max - Min;
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float h = RgbToHue(rgb.r, rgb.g, rgb.b);
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float l = 0.5f * (Max + Min);
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float s = (Max != 0.0f && Min != 1.0f) ? (c / (1 - (absolute(2 * l - 1)))) : 0;
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     return ColorHSLA(h, s, l, rgb.a);
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
15:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do i need to do this
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```cpp
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> template<>
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> inline ColorHSLA color_cast(const ColorRGBA &rgb)
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> {
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float Min = minimum(rgb.r, rgb.g, rgb.b);
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float Max = maximum(rgb.r, rgb.g, rgb.b);
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float c = Max - Min;
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float h = RgbToHue(rgb.r, rgb.g, rgb.b);
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float l = 0.5f * (Max + Min);
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     float s = (Max != 0.0f && Min != 1.0f) ? (c / (1 - (absolute(2 * l - 1)))) : 0;
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     return ColorHSLA(h, s, l, rgb.a);
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with the result from my function?
15:26 < bridge_> <learath2> If you need rgba, yes. If you are doing sth web you can also just use hsl iirc
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but the function i passed
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is it hsla?
15:26 < bridge_> <learath2> Not the correct one
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the 9 is a 0 its a typo
15:26 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah this looks fine
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so thats hsla
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok
15:27 < bridge_> <learath2> Yep, normalized hsla too
15:31 < bridge_> <teero777> ah i forgot. youre right
15:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Do you have some pointers where the bug in my font render overhaul could located? I can also share the code but it's like 2k lines diff already. :pepeW:
15:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134845357986160761/screenshot_2023-07-29_15-48-25.png

16:38 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
16:41 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> ahah fr ðŸ’€
16:43 < ChillerDragon> @jupeyy_keks thanks for your consultation! I made my r/place very webscale keeping db inserts but also having seperate blazingly web scale bitmap and array cache
16:43 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> yes
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> What is your bug?
16:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Looks at the screenshot in fullscreen, the text is blurry
16:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134859406253772800/screenshot_2023-07-29_16-45-51.png
16:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ingame even more
16:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> I guess it has something to do with the internal screen resolution?
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It's either while u can create text container. Or while u render the text.. or your font size calculation is wrong
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Guess u could print these stuff in current vs current master
16:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> With render doc you can look if the font textures are correct
16:48 < bridge_> <robyt3> the font size seems correct, so I think it has to do with GetScreen returning different values at different points
17:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ok, I got it, I used the wrong font size when looking up the glyph from the atlas
17:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> Prepare to review 2000 lines :justatest:
17:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> Is it possible to prevent the flashing text when clearing the font atlas due to changing the language?
17:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134871705576296519/DDNet_2023.07.29_-_17.31.33.01-1.mp4
17:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Atlas needs to be cleared for CJK languages
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> isnt this rly niche thing
17:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ppl dont rly change langs
17:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> ye, but if it's easily possible I'd do it anyway
17:40 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, maybe just recycle the old frame until the atlas is regenerated?
17:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> hmm, I see, maybe the problem is just that we clear the atlas in the middle of a frame
17:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> Nice, it works perfectly when the actual language change is delayed until the next client update
17:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> so is robyt completely revamping the text rendering engine?
17:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> Should change nothing about how it actually looks except for CJK users
17:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think some don't like how text looks on 0.7
17:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Just adds support for selecting font family based on the language
18:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i hate 0.7 text
18:16 < bridge_> <learath2> You also hate everything else about 0.7 so that's not very surprising ðŸ˜„
18:18 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 pog
18:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do u rly like 0.7 text
18:23 < bridge_> <learath2> Not particularly ðŸ˜„
18:34 < bridge_> <bencie.> ddnet.org is down?
18:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> nope side is up and running

18:36 < bridge_> <bencie.> works now :Shrug:
18:38 < bridge_> <ilygrain> does anyone know how long it takes that a support ticket will be answered?
18:40 < bridge_> <devinci24> Idk, shouldn't be too long ig.
18:40 < bridge_> <devinci24> It's written that they don't offer tecnical support tho (just saw your question)
18:40 < bridge_> <ilygrain> Oooh damn
18:40 < bridge_> <ilygrain> Thanks for the info tho :/
18:41 < bridge_> <devinci24> Someone else might help you, but might take a while ^^'
19:42 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> dude
19:43 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I just realized, TeeworldsCN got a 10 year anniversary this month
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Wow it was released directly after ddnet?
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Pros
19:44 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> How do you release a community
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Dunno, host a website?
19:44 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> Also i think we started hosted ddnet servers in 2014 or 2015
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Start a chat
19:44 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> Ye the chat what started July 4th 2013
19:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> So even before ddnet
19:45 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> Ye the chat was started July 4th 2013
19:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Ddnets first finish
19:46 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> Oh wait that means I am already an adult when i started it
19:46 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> Well almost
19:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Old
19:46 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I'm 27 rn and my birthday is in November
19:47 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I still remember when i go to the police station to register teeworlds.cn
19:47 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> When I'm 17
19:47 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
19:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Police Station lmao
19:47 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> Ye, you have to do that in china
19:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Weird af xD
19:48 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I think the police are also weirded out by a kid registering a website
19:49 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I thought they really wanted to be rude but don't know how against a 17yo
19:50 < bridge_> <vy0x2> @robyt3 Do we really need this overhead in translation files?

19:51 < bridge_> <vy0x2> ##### /authors #####
19:51 < bridge_> <vy0x2> 
19:51 < bridge_> <vy0x2> ##### translated strings #####
19:51 < bridge_> <vy0x2> ```
19:51 < bridge_> <vy0x2> I wrote a script that will reorder the translations alphabetical and i would love to remove this while doing it.. i mean we have git nowadays, why should we keep this in the files?
19:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> Hmm, maybe the duplicates could be removed at some point, I don't see a need to list multiple edits, but an author list is okay I'd say
19:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> Translations are sometimes added by other devs and not by the translators themselves, so git history would only show the author if it was added to the commit message
19:54 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Yea but iirc deen always mentions them if they use their translations
19:55 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Yea but iirc deen always mentions them if he uses their translations
19:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> Hmm, the header also has a somewhat random format in all languages
19:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't mind either way, I guess we can open a discussion issue
20:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> The script will be nice though, we can probably include it in the check style pipeline
20:04 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Ah, i wrote it to manually fix it now once and hopefully new translations will get inserted into the right place
20:05 < bridge_> <vy0x2> I dont know how and how much work it would be to write it for the project
20:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> I see. I'm not sure if new translations get inserted at the correct position already be the script
20:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> I see. I'm not sure if new translations get inserted at the correct position already by the script
20:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> We have hundred of translations and those are the only lower case ones. The url is ok but the rest is wrong imo
20:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134909885696442429/image.png

20:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yes, they should all be upper-case in source code
21:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> Why do I get `-nan is outside the range of representable values of type 'int'`  on a text cursor position? Only happens in the CI, not locally on Ubuntu with UBSan both with normal and headless client. https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/tree/TextRender-Font-Index-File
21:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> commented on this
21:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> check my answer
21:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is there a backtrace? what ci?
21:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/actions/runs/5701991407/job/15453235883#step:7:35
21:08 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Thanks for the input.
21:08 < bridge_> <vy0x2> I agree if the attribution would be consistent, but some contributors add themselves, some not and some add themselves 10 times
21:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Watch for nans then u can find it
21:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/actions/runs/5701991407/job/15453235883
21:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah we could reduce repeated names to 1 line with the dates of contributions
22:48 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> china moment
22:48 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@tsfreddie)
23:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> With this script you can sort the translations in alphabetical order. Could it be used in the pipeline? Or just have it as a script in the /scripts folder?
23:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1134955181654691960/reorder_translation_file.py
23:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> To run it in the pipeline it must be able to not modify anything
23:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> So it needs an option `--dry-run` where it will only output if something needs changes but not change anything
23:12 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Ah i see
23:14 < bridge_> <vy0x2> It should go through all languages automatically yes? Since atm i have to tell it what language file i want to check
23:14 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah
23:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> The existing `scripts/languages/update_all.py` should also be checked/updated, so new translations are also added at the correct position
