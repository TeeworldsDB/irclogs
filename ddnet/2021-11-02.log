10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How do you guys punch your NAT's ? \:D
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I use some ssh tunnel with autossh from some NAT client to my vps and then i can connect over my vps to that client. But it seems to die from time to time and then keep the port blocked so it can not be reestablished.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> echo "ServerAliveInterval 60" >> ~/.ssh/config might help
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as a backup, all my ssh servers are available as tor hidden services
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that way, they are always reachable as long as they're somehow connected to the internet
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't punch them, just forward the ssh port in router
13:29 <+SaintsDB> anyone round
14:01 <@deen> hi SaintsDB 
14:02 <+SaintsDB> hey i emailed u
14:03 <@deen> yes, I responded
14:03 <+SaintsDB> lol playing on my phone ill go chk
14:50 < Saint2> its been fine for roughly 45 daysish
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes routers

15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i built a github chrome extension showing the stars of forks in the network tab. Can be useful to find good downstrea projects for example when the upstream got archived or similar.
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if you are interested you can pre order the extension now!
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait wtf that looks broken what is the 20 next to ddnet/ddnet xd
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oops it shows watching not stars lemme fix
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the number of people watching
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye fixed

15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> here u go
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i assume ahead or behind upstream is also interesting
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should sort by stars
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea

16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i am such a UI genius
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> so proud
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Should hire you for UI design.
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ikr

16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fixed it \:)
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> now automatically find the branch that has most +diff
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> longest fork chain too
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for +diff, the most lines changed
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you can sell it xdd
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> does anyone other than me even miss this feature?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What would be the best way to get fontsize of teeworlds in the server code?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> A static table of widths and heights?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for each letter
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, maybe i dont need the best/cleanest way, but one that will easily work without many libraries or so
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Assembly is actually a high level abstraction"
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/905178873652715520/unknown.png
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when you are at the level of that guy, assembly is indeed high level
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH0F9r0siTI
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this the vid btw
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I watched it a couple times by now
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur a pro watcher
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just have a lot of free time as a failed human being
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If u have a lot of free time add 0.7 support to the client \:p
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorry, can't work while depressed
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe next month if my brain decides to allow me some serotonin
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just watch anime
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and if u watched all good anime there is, read manga
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on the second stage
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to watch kimi no na wa tonight, or maybe violet evergardens movie
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or I could read witch hat atelier, but not really in the mood for that
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know one movie that fits better than those is Byousoku 5 Centimeter
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me the best movie of this kind as of now
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that is on my watchlist too
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> definitly better
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can actually feel identified somewhat
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to get the manga for that, but people told me the film is better
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye movie movie
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i watched it 3 times already
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb food
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > "Takaki T≈çno's life and his relationships with the girls around him. "
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to identify with that lmao. Please, I've been programming since I was 12
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They really should make it illegal to touch computers until you are 18
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> i agree that asm is high level. It's still being processed on and interpreted to something specific for that HW.
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This definition of high level is not very useful. I think the only way one is supposed to talk about this is in relative terms
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ASM is higher level than bytecode indeed. It's also lower level than many other languages used currently
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> yeah high level just really means it's "floating" (as in some sort of abstraction) over the hardware
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, this is too on-topic, you are supposed to use the on-topic message as a branching point to something completely off-topic
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> if you're like manually moving wires around on a bread-board or using something like verilog, that's low level i guess
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> or no level? idk
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> yeah that's right we are getting high in the developer chatroom
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "floating" isn't really a useful definition to me is my point, if all languages are high level then there is no use to the definition
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> honestly high level low level etc isn't useful at all either
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> it's just an abstraction from talking about anything real
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Saying C and C++ are relatively low level to what is thought today is fairly useful to talk about
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> the truth is, you could write hardware that only accepts Rust or something, transforming that directly into HW related stuff
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> but yeah i guess it's all a general purpose case
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go get some food and sit on the floor, night üëã
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> I think the more practical case, that is slightly off the normal case, is asm can be high level when you consider IRs like llvm
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> alright good night üëã
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats exactly why u should watch it
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a movie about regretting your past
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has 3 stories btw
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or 3 arcs
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw its by the same director as kimi no na wa
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Shinkai, Makoto
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> truly a mastermind on anime movie making
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> set it manualy
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I really liked kimi no na wa üôÇ
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Supposedly if you don't cry while watching it you aren't human
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol i didnt cry
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 there is a anime movie about suicide
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Colorful"
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i liked it
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda a hidden gem
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you are probably a psycopath
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://myanimelist.net/anime/8142/Colorful_Movie>
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hard to cry with a 1-2 hour thing
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clannad is better
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> violet evergarden was quite nice if you are looking for something emotional üòõ
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seen it
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its beautifuly animated
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk thats it
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only movie that made me go to bed thinking hard is 5 centimeters
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the music is great too imo
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> grave of the fireflies is also supposed to be good, didn't watch yet
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is definitly good
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seen it
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is one even more obscure than it
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> barefoot gen
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> holy shit
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont like old movies then pass it
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its good
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (83')
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpAgmvjJCtI>
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its on youtube
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont take it off
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> beware there is some horrifying scenes
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah you know what I'll do, I'll finish up squid game before starting anything else
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atomic bombs are not good looking after all
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im addicted to japanese anime movies about the atomic bomb
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a 3rd i dont remember
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In This Corner of the World
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wth
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> violet evergardn much more sad than your name
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and better imo
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i didnt find your name sad at all
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> By≈çsoku Go Senchimƒìtoru is superior
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk about much sad animes but i watched some and they were all pretty dull except v. evergarden and your lie in april
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you didn't watch clannad + clannad 2
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nah i heard it's good tho
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a classic
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a must watch if u like anime
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 5 cm per Second is a movie that takes a story of growing up and makes it into something that cannot be described as anything less than a masterpiece, with astounding themes, storytelling, art and sound. If someone told me I could watch one movie before I died, I'd undoubtedly choose this one.
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i agree so much
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weebs in
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too offtopic
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i notice a common scene in sad animes is they meet up again after like 20 years in public and pass eachother and look back at eachother then walk off again
