01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I created https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60566097 ðŸ™‚
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 nice
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 so that's where the release versions in distros gets generated from or is it something separate?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still get a completely black screen on mac even with gfx_borderless 0
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the opengl renderer being on or off doesn't change anything which leads me to think it's sdl
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> downgrading sdl to 2.0.8 doesn't help either
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tried older versions of the client to see if it was a specific patch but no, I think it's mac os being retarded as always
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the one we release on the site works fine though, so it's a problem with my specific installation...
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can join a server randomly clicking around so the input still works ðŸ˜›
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @heinrich5991 isn't the full name DDRace Network?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I always think that DD means Dummy Drag
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> shouldn't the Name be DDRaceNetwork and also known as DDNet
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If anyone has any idea how to even start debugging this gimme a highlight ðŸ˜›
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> What's the last update about ? I updated my game and now it's all laggy, flickering
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 11.7.2 just reverted one change that caused an editor feature to stop
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Hm weird then, I think I haven't missed a single update and it was perfect before
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> It's not about the fps, it shows 700
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u update from aprevious version or did u skip 10 versions?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Pipou did u try a clean version from the website?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> No but I will
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I'm not really well versed in the gfx code, do you know where I could just push a solid color onto the screen?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why do the laser particles only have about 20 fps?  if you dont understand just slow down a demo where you get shot by them and you see how choppy they are. makes some parts really annoying since they also speed up so fast and you only have  1 frame for 3 tiles they move
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 u can just set the clear color in backend_sdl.cpp
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or does it need to be on top of something?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Im 'corneum i think it's more like this:
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> srever only sends snapshots every 2 ticks
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tw has 50 ticks
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 50 / 2 = 25
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes when i alt-tab ddnet changes resolution, im on linux using fullscreen, borderless is not an option because it is bugged and doesnt use 144hz for some reason
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly funny
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> suprisingly, i tried the ath client and it doesnt happen there, even alt-tab is blazingly fast
