08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Any idea about Mac OS X not working with 15.3? https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/4366772972629839473/
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen update failed
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> On Windows? I know
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Who know Kurosio
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> @deen regarding the mac thing i could reproduce it on steam https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/yY
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> after updating to latest big sur and fixing compilation i can confirm that building from source works fine when run probably the steam release has some library messup
12:16 <@deen> ok, i can fix that
12:25 <@deen> hm no, I'm not sure why it's not there
12:30 <@deen> discord sdk lib is totally missing on Mac
13:00 <@deen> ChillerDragon: can you please try the releasecandidate on Steam?
13:14 <@deen> or someone else with Mac?
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> @deen now it works :) what was broken? how did u fix it?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It was missing the discord sdk dyllib file, I included it, see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3613
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought people tested the RCs on Mac OSX before but apparently not :/
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> not tryna be to annoying but its been called macOS for a while now
13:32 <+ChillerDragon> osx sounds like middle ages :D
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the more you know
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds like they broke the pattern by not renaming it again in 2020.
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> didnt the world end in 2012 anyways?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, havenâ€™t been using my macbook this month. Only tested the rc on windows this time
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> so who cares about 2013+
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> when merge prs
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> they so good
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/02/11/Rust-1.50.0.html
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the difference between eminent and esteemed?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> one of it contains "tee"
14:41 <+ChillerDragon> :D
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> has one ever used gprof for ddnet codebase? I can not get it setup when i do ``CXXFLAGS=-pg CFLAGS=-pg cmake ..`` it does not create a gmon.out file during buuild ._.
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt do it during build
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it does it after you ran it
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea true that also doesnt help tho
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i did it once with gcc 10 and it worked
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe try -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=...
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> maybe ctrl+c aborts it? but passing shutdown as arg
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh k
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah, you need to close it properly
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice now its created :)
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> hm when running with grpof it closes instantly
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u dont run it with gprof
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u convert the output to a readable format
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gmon.out is already the profiled data
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> oh
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just run gprof in the dir where gmon is without any arguments
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> wew i read it wrong
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> ty
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> what did u use to visualize?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nothing
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i didnt find any good tool
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just took the text file ^^
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wish there would be any good tool like kcachegrind
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> ye kcachegrind bae :) but the slow runtime is not an option 
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> kde has so many good tools i wonder if their desktop environment is also better than gnome but too lazy to try
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> kde has endless configuration stuff
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i only use it bcs its closer to windows ^^
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> never really liked gnome
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Floccous . . . æ‹³> put points on servers that you connect yourself, but without being like connecting with ddnet servers
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> #3631 is what is used for the current steam release right?
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> yea should all be fine
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> why am i even debugging steam and discord stuff i hate these things :D
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon I used gprof2dot to visualize it when I used it but I think I like perf much more now
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Why I cant see Key Presses?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If I enable it
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I cant see it :(
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if they donâ€™t show prediction also doesnâ€™t work?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> wdym
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> key presses is only for other people
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I cant see any key presses
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> maybe hidden by nametag?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> nope
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 the pythong thing? yea thats what some so dude recommended but it crashes for me on utf8 stuff
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i loaded the wrong file that was before jupstar enlightend me :D
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what's the command to disable menu animations? I don't like it when things move too much
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yo, does anyone have that old teeworlds structure scheme?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "structure scheme"? what is that?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> connections between classes and structures in code
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't know that existed
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Learath2 sent it a long time ago (joke, it was 3-5 months ago)
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I generated it with libclang
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://learath2.info/kek.png
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still have it ðŸ˜›
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might be quite out of date

21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> would it be pinned here? ðŸ˜„
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh yeah, cgc is god
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does it look good?

21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i just don't know how to decomposite it better
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie no, there's no setting for the menu animations

22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay we need two new moderation features
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> +m mode? ^^
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> +m needs accounts to be efficient can't voice by hand

23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ah

23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> :monkalaugh:
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> not that i dont trust u
23:26 <@deen> you have to set "logfile foo.log", then you can read foo.log
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> just that i want to be sure
23:26 <@deen> but have to do that before update
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> sad
