00:41 < bridge> <teero777> mb. the deffault x11 clipboard is ass
00:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why
00:41 < bridge> <teero777> it removes whatever was in it as soon as the application that it was taken from closes
00:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that is because it lets you... do some really weird stuff
00:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but no one uses it
00:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so clipboard managers fix that

09:10 < bridge> <zerolacqua> I'm not sure what the expected behavior is. I open a local server and connect to it. Sometimes it auto auth, and sometimes it prompts for a username and password on my Windows. However, on my Ubuntu, it works fine.
09:10 < bridge> <zerolacqua> 
09:10 < bridge> <zerolacqua> Unfortunately, I haven't been able to reproduce the issue reliably — it occurs occasionally.
09:10 < bridge> <zerolacqua> 
09:10 < bridge> <zerolacqua> I connect to the server via the LAN tab using the IP address 192.168.xxx.xxx, with the default server config.
12:03 < bridge> <teero777> I just found out it's possible to fly just with hook bounces. this is ridiculous
12:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
12:25 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> when hook bounce fly tas for just pseudo fly?
13:36 < bridge> <Assa> since when are bounces needed for this?
13:39 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> no hammering
13:40 < bridge> <Assa> no I mean you can hookfly without thouching at all.
13:40 < bridge> <patiga> the previous message was a sort of challenge:
13:40 < bridge> <patiga> > when [technique: hook bounce fly] tas for [map: just pseudo fly]?
13:40 < bridge> <patiga> iiuc
13:41 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> yes
13:42 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> yeah i know but you can also fly while the other tee is for example deepfrozen and cant hammer or hook ya
13:43 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> bounce fly or whatever you wanna call it
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> you found it out couple of times now xd
14:43 < bridge> <vahemaaa> hello zhn
14:46 < bridge> <01000111g> i had 0 problems reading it, i guess i'm in too deep :justatest:
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> no no no I mean just having a dummy below you and hooking straight down
15:12 < bridge> <zhn> dat what i mean, didn't u discover it months ago
15:12 < bridge> <zhn> hi
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> No? That was afkfly.
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> That's hammer+hook on an afk tee
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> Just hooking is wayyy harder
15:13 < bridge> <zhn> when vid
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> soon

17:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the freeze is a **bit** over the top
17:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i know they did it on purpose
17:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "while performing services for WMS"
17:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> means that anything created while at work is their property
17:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> of work you can do whatever
17:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if they gave you explicit permission for your dotfiles maybe it meant either
17:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1. they played along with your ignorance
17:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2. they assume you werent ignorent and allowed you to contribute to your config whilst at work
17:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this applies to any output during work, closed or open source, if you say something funny, they own it (given its ownable)
17:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you would have to say something pretty long and funny for it to be ownable and worth owning
17:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like if you wrote a book... it would be theirs if you did it on work hours
17:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it means you can contribute to anything as long as... its not in work
17:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> TLDR: you can contribute to anything as long as... its not in work
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how does thsi work

18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this looks like 10hz... but its run once for every player, so only 1 player every 10hz gets a skid sound
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but in game is >10hz?
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but in game is >10hz for every1?
18:17 < bridge> <Ewan> the person who approved it doesn’t know exactly what I signed, the in-house employees have their own contracts which are more restrictive, maybe they thought i fall into that
18:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and cool i guess
18:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i will have to ask what was meant because if i’m not contractually restricted that’s one thing but my boss’ boss giving me explicit warning that I can’t do OSS is another
18:23 < bridge> <bencie> Is this still accurate, now that we have controller settings and all?

18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> good catch, idk if anyone has tried it using steam input but it’d probably work
18:25 < bridge> <bencie> although it does seem kinda annoying to setup the movement binds and stuff. just doing it from the Controls page, it'd overwrite your keyboard binds so you'd have to use console and bind them back
18:35 < bridge> <soulyvevo> always worked for me
18:36 < bridge> <robyt3> You can't use the UI with controller alone so it probably doesn't quality to really support controllers
18:37 < bridge> <bencie> you can move your cursor
18:37 < bridge> <bencie> can you not click
18:37 < bridge> <bencie> lemme check
18:39 < bridge> <bencie> ah yeah only thing missing is being able to click
18:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, I guess adding settings to configure which joystick buttons trigger mouse left, right and middle mouse and mouse wheel in the UI would mostly solve it
18:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, I guess adding settings to configure which joystick buttons trigger left, right and middle mouse buttons and mouse wheel in the UI would mostly solve it
