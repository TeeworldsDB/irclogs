00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> it is possible to recover a deleted folder from github D:
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a folder being a normal folder that is still in the git history or did you delete the repository @Nouaa  ?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes only the repository
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?xd
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wat did you delete

13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :troll:
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried looking for this bug a week or two ago, it seems to happen randomly and I have this odd feeling that it is a php issue. If any of you are familiar with php it'd be nice to get another pair of eyes on it.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Error: `"PHP message: PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 67108922 bytes) in /var/www/bep/ban.php on line 14`
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This string is somehow growing to insane sizes and it doesn't always happen, so I could be invoking some ub somewhere and accidentally passing the entire generated file to `escapetw`.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a bit of a mess and will be entirely rewritten in the future (it kinda grew organically to accommodate feature requests from mods)
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Two identical requests don't reliably trigger it, so it's not easy to debug at all
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah php
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only know u can increase the script size, but if its using so much mem its prob a bug
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how to help u i suck at php
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt know u are bep
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hi bep
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> <a:AmberSweat:782407598015250472>
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weeb
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also its rly hard to help u with what u sent
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe just give it a read going backwards from line 14? I've looked at it so much I might be blind to simple mistakes now
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh its public
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh regex
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this some kind of regex ddos
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I considered that but 2 problems with that, the regex has no backtracking in it, and the regex is applied to the banfile generated if it was catastrophic backtracking it would always happen since the file doesn't change
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love reading php
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "explode"
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea explode
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes sense
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and functions that use snakecase and others that just simply dont
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> php ftw
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, php is fairly consistent in it's snake_case for stdlib functions, and PascalCase for it's oop interfaces
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> strlen
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not str_len
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> str_replace
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> basename
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not base_name
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> realpath why not real_path
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont follow it
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> strpost
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> strpos*
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, libc functions retain their name and there is a subset of libc derived functions that are named like that ðŸ˜„
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, less spam, more longer posts so my poor question doesn't get buried
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 hav u tried preg_replace
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> instead of `str_replace`? I could but I don't see what that's supposed to tackle
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah actually preg_replace is worse
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the file rly big?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if banfile is ending up in `escapetw` it'
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's about 21K
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (but if the code is executed properly it should never end up in there)
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk then
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u even debug php code
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or profile
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, xdebug, but I can't debug a problem that randomly happens
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is my recommendation for you
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/866649472313851934/1llubk4wl6b71.png
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could try to log everything that ever ends up in escapetw, but it's trying to allocate 67MB, cant exactly output that to the error log :D
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe change memory_limit
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on php.ini
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it doesnt crash maybe its easier to debug
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use memory_get_usage to check if its over 67mb maybe xd
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is me last night after spending 2 hours injecting a proxy connector into twilight to find a ratelimiter bug
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:

14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. â€“ Robert Sewell
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/java
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would take rust over both so this animegirl is not an accurate representation of me
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more quotes here
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now make is C or C++ and it'd be a fairly accuratd conversation between me and you
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye xD
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/is/it/
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ requesting more phppl
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus i think u use php
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur the only last one standing
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> whats up
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read this
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u know
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/ban.php
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here the file
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i bet rewriting it in rust would solve it
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜‰
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> If you want to increase your allowed memory size, configure your `php.ini` file and set I think `memory_limit` to something higher
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> If you have a memory leak or smth I'll have a look at this take
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> code
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's trying to allocate 67 megabytes, whatever it wants to do it's an insanity
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw it's probably a good thing that it dies in escapetw, I don't want to know what would happen if I executed a 67 megabyte ssh line
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for more context escapetw only ever works with single lines
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> `exec("sudo -n -u teeworlds ". $twdir. "execute-all.sh ". escapeshellarg($run). " > /dev/null 2>&1 &", $out, $rc);`
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> what does this bash script do
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it will ssh to all servers and echo the line given to it to a fifo
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 its not possible u ever pass a empty string to replace right
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=79951
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its prob not this xd
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that's intriguing, let me take a look
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are interested ^^ it's fairly simple in what it does though
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> This probably isnt the problem
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (i have stupid question about mem_copy, if someone wants to answer, ping me pls xd
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there are so many mem_copys in tw code with references inside, isn't dest = source more idiomatic for cpp?)
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 maybe try using strtr
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well teeworlds is more C than C++, so `mem_copy`s are mostly a legacy
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For POD types it's safe to do a byte by byte copy, so it's safe
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> huh, thanks for answer
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is byte by byte copy called bitwise copy
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, but the smallest addressable thing is a byte, so I thought I'd use that ðŸ˜„
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i learnt the name bitwise copy from rust
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see an empty string ever making it to escapetw so that's not it
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also this thing makes me feel curious
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ```cpp
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     // it is not allowed to aim in the center
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>     if(m_LatestInput->m_TargetX == 0 && m_LatestInput->m_TargetY == 0)
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe>         m_LatestInput->m_TargetY = -1;```
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why? xd
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I wonder if it is somehow an uninitialized member in one of my classes
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd make the angle undefined
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uh oh
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath pro
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so fast
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> tw wizard
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks a lot again :p
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One could instead define the center to have angle 0, but I guess matricks decided it's safer to just never allow this 0/0 case to happen
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really don't see how I can end up with an instance of `Ban` with uninitialized members though, can I even avoid calling the constructor somehow?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Learath2 Try to use the 4th parameter of `str_replace` and set it to 1
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, that won't work, I need to escape all instances of these in the string, not just one
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Maybe you have some sort of recursion of each instance, when replacing \\ with even more \\
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah that's what I was thinking too, but wouldn't that be reproducible?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I'll try a couple things, that sounds feasible
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ok good luck
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that could indeed be it, I wonder why it's `might`
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/866656889790398524/lol.png
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, this doesn't apply to me since I'm not doing multiple replacements
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I couldn't figure it out so I added an error handler so next time it happens I have a backtrace
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ðŸ‘€
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it literally was in the wrong folder, nothing interesting ðŸ˜„
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I get a 404 for the ban.php link
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Today I learned a rust trick, you can force a reborrow of `t` using `&mut *t`
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 have a minute for my incompetence?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is it?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and why u want that
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/0x?rust clippy is confident I can elide `'a`, I don't see how
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't look like you can, according to the rules I know
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 try &'_
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/B2?rust this, took a while to figure out what was even going wrong ðŸ˜„
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Already tried it, eventhough I knew it wouldn't work
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I guess clippy bug since the ppl in the rust discord don't seem to see it either
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Almost wrote `reboot` on ger2, a lot of ppl would be a lot of mad
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do it
