01:51 < bridge> <murpi> Ah :)
01:52 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, that's what I wanted to ask. The TS server is offline (for quite awhile too I believe)
03:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which one? I made like x versions of that game. None of them are interesting btw. You control an ascii hashtag left and right‚Ä¶
07:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: one made with rust doesn't work for me
07:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When i connect to server and press a it just moves to left all the time
07:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And one in c++ i had to include different header file and add other lib to linker to make it work xd

09:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh I thought I was still in #off-topic
09:27 < bridge> <learath2> LCG generators are usually badly behaved. Is this one any different?
09:29 < bridge> <learath2> LCGs are usually badly behaved. Is this one any different?
09:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 idk but found it interesting how simple it is
09:31 < bridge> <learath2> All LCGs are rather simple. The only difference this has seems to be that c = 0
09:32 < bridge> <learath2> It is quite bizarre how seemingly unpredictable and random it becomes though yeah
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> Given the dynamic nature of the area, it is difficult for nonspecialists to make decisions about what generator to use. "Give me something I can understand, implement and port... it needn't be state-of-the-art, just make sure it's reasonably good and efficient." Our article and the associated minimal standard generator was an attempt to respond to this request. Five years later, we see no need to alter our response other than to suggest the use of 
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice quote
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```c
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> uint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> {
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return *state = (uint64_t)*state * 48271 % 0x7fffffff;
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:37 < bridge> <learath2> Xorshift is almost as simple, much better behaved and better performant
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can avoid the div
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```c
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> uint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> {
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki>     uint64_t product = (uint64_t)*state * 48271;
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki>     uint32_t x = (product & 0x7fffffff) + (product >> 31);
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki>     x = (x & 0x7fffffff) + (x >> 31);
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return *state = x;
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:44 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah without the div it probably performs about the same
09:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/peter-griffin-but-i-want-it-now-gif-26307521
09:48 < bridge> <learath2> Anything better than an LCG or xorshift is usually far too complex (PCG) or far too heavy (Arc4Random, Mersenne Twister, Fortuna)
10:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```bash

10:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why  i can't access to the array of players in server.cpp ?
10:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to add some bots to my server and update they inputs accordingly, but first i want to detect with one is debug dummy
10:32 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to add some bots to my server and update they inputs accordingly, but first i want to detect which one is debug dummy
10:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why  i can't access to  GameServer()->m_apPlayers[ClientID] in server.cpp ?
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> if it‚Äôs a private or protected member you cannot access it
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> mark it as public or use setters/getters
10:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's public
10:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wonder if it's abstract thing ?
10:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the server.cpp in total is weird for me
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> Nonono
10:42 < bridge> <learath2> The engine server doesn't have access to the internals of the gameserver
10:42 < bridge> <learath2> It accesses it through an interface, an abstract base class
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> Notice how it says `IGameServer` not `CGameContext`
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> If you need to access stuff from `CGameContext` in the engine there are two options. Either your code doesn't belong in the engine or you need to add a getter method in `IGameServer` and implement it in `CGameContext`
10:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you give me an example of a getter in the code so i can mimic it ?
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src%2Fengine%2Fserver.h#L338 e.g.
10:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> The interface should be as minimal as possible. So if your code truly doesnt belong in the engine, just move it out
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> But I guess you just need a `IsPlayerDebugDummy` there. That should be fine
10:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just want to detect which player is a debug dummy then i can control them
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> quick c++ question.
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> in what order will these variables be initialized?
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> ```c++
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> class Foo
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> {
11:32 < bridge> <teero777>   int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
11:32 < bridge> <teero777>   Foo() : a(c + 8), b(a + 3), c(b - 2) {}
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> }
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> ```
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> from outer to inner or the other way around
11:32 < bridge> <teero777> from outer to inner or the other way around?
11:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> in the order they appear in the class iirc
11:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> so:
11:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> `  int b = 0, a = 0, c = 0;`
11:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> this would change the order, for example
11:34 < bridge> <peter0x44> I think it's ridiculous
11:35 < bridge> <teero777> ah lol thx
11:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2669888/in-what-order-are-non-static-data-members-initialized
11:36 < bridge> <teero777> clangd was throwing warnings in my face
11:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> I think this is what you're asking?
11:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> I think it's ridiculous it works that way tbh
11:36 < bridge> <teero777> yea thx
11:37 < bridge> <peter0x44> np
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://twitter.com/MaxPrilutskiy/status/1772871058783154245
12:45 < bridge> <teero777> yo wtf
12:45 < bridge> <teero777> cool
12:46 < bridge> <teero777> haha germany is kickin
12:51 < bridge> <learath2> What way do you think it should work?
12:52 < bridge> <peter0x44> I'm not sure but this is a pretty common "wtf" moment when most people learn
12:52 < bridge> <peter0x44> At least it was for me
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> It is not very obvious, but I fail to see any other option
14:19 < bridge> <aegisub> usually compilers warn if your member initialization order doesn't match the order in the class
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> where does the menu code freeze the input upon opening a menu? ive been searching for half an hour
14:39 < bridge> <teero777> it seems to only set the input playerflags to PLAYERFLAG_IN_MENU but doing so manually doesnt seem to work
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> unrelated:
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> 2024-03-27 14:49:50 I chat: *** 'Teero' entered and joined the game

15:13 < bridge> <rekman1> Hello, can i suggest something?
15:18 < bridge> <rekman1> Can we make a skin whitelist (only a specified player/players can equip a skin)?
15:28 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no
15:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Hello, I also a suggestion as well
15:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Add accounts
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> i was about to

15:31 < bridge> <teero777> you troll

19:15 < bridge> <APFFF> Why do the country selectors for servers always "reset" when launching the game?
19:17 < bridge> <pluskz> Yeah its kinda weird
20:34 < bridge> <patiga> I was not reachable at the time, are you talking about Rust or Python twmap? :)
20:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When twmap in new language? :justatest:
20:36 < bridge> <patiga> :p
20:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> In gleam for example
22:00 < bridge> <nouaa> the link to the datafile doc refers to an incorrect URL at https://ddnet.org/libtw2-doc/map/
22:00 < bridge> <nouaa> shouldn't be map/datafile
22:41 < bridge> <teero777> Rust. But it's already solved <3
