10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay i know what it was shutting the whole window now
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> shift + right click into the folders
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ger2 ddos all the way
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ger seems normal tho which is nice
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how to deactivate that inputs get stuck on turning of dummy copy move?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> There is a cmd called like resetonswitch.
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> doesnt effect that
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it only resets on switch
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> btw `events 0` doesnt make the kitty ninja go back so you fucked up the code for it
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and that is gay
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> never touch kitty ninja
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Maybe do a bind that does all inputs switch in short? Not perfect but sth
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont think it is possible to bind dummy moving inputs
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is no such thing as +dummy_left or +dummy_right
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> No I mean swap to dummy do a key which does all inputs and switch back
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Like xyx then
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats useless
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> swiching to my dummy already killed the move
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it would be more effective to simply stop pressing keys before deactivating copy move
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> How to set a specific tee/skin  as freezed tee/skin
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> ?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> replace x_ninja, I guess
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> thank you!
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @sorgaxD ðŸ˜ƒ
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexander Sorry for breaking it. how did Kitten ninja work?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> lol
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i mean
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> it just changed the default ninja skin
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> to kitten ninja
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> hi? i have a problem with ddnet
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> how can ic help you @osv ?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> it gives me fps jerks
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> what settings do you have ?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> 
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/527250337460125697/unknown.png
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> set the refresh rate to your  monitors refrash rate to avoid overusage off you cpu and gpu
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> if I did it, what happens is that even if it has 60 or 2000 fps, it's the same
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> try to use the open  gl 3.3  option
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> still the same
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> are these issues new or do you have them since you got the game ?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> download ddnet 10
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its more stable than ddnet 11
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> he is right in amd platfor mthe client  is more stable
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> is new, yesterday I had a new pc, with a 2080 and a 8700k
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> than you maybe need to install all the divers for your vidio card
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> I have them all, it happens to me only with ddnet
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> maybe the game is poorly optimized for this gpu architecture?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> idk :/
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> try to reinstall the game
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> I also tried it xD
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FRALEX> send me a detailed info of your specs from the device manager
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> pc specs?
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <osv> I did not understand xD
