17:10 < Hamid_Jigool> hey evrybody
17:10 < Hamid_Jigool> how can i fix random finished maps or unfinished maps on DDnet?
17:10 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
17:11 < Hamid_Jigool> when we vote random unfinished maps it say to us no map set yet
19:35 <@deen> laxadedi, laxa: TS seems to be full again^^
19:42 < o_be_one> oO how many slots you have ? Oo
19:46 <@deen> by "full" I mean there are people in each channel
19:46 <@deen> no empty channel remaining for new people to talk in
19:52 < o_be_one> oh :/
20:16 < laxa> lol
20:16 < laxa> ok
20:16 < laxa> 4 empty channels right now
20:17 < laxa> Btw, there is a german CTF tomorrow !

20:27 < Gabeee> deen: then open a mumble server? :P
20:27 <@deen> Gabeee: i'm not interested in either mumble or ts
20:28 < laxa> people prefers TS anyway
20:29 < Gabeee> deen: :(
20:29 <@deen> I could run an IRC server for them and they can make their own channels :P
20:44 < o_be_one> lel
20:44 < o_be_one> In TS its possible to allow users to create channels and/or sub channels
20:44 < o_be_one> so its more a permission config to enhance
20:49 < laxa> people can create temp channels on the teamspeak
20:52 < will_> hello
20:52 < will_> and bye
