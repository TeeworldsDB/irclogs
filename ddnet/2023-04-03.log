01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> is there any existing drag & drop mechanism within ddnet UI
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> not like from external apps or whatever but internally
02:29 < bridge> <Voxel> I added this into teams.cpp, is this better? Or should I do more?
02:29 < bridge> <Voxel> ```cpp
02:29 < bridge> <Voxel> bool CGameTeams::SquashTeammates(int Team)
02:29 < bridge> <Voxel> {
02:29 < bridge> <Voxel>     return Team != TEAM_FLOCK && Count(Team) > 1 && GetTeamState(Team) != CGameTeams::TEAMSTATE_OPEN;
02:29 < bridge> <Voxel> }```
02:35 < bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel if you use it in only one place then I'd say this one line doesn't need to be a function, otherwise nice
02:36 < bridge> <Voxel> no i mean, this used to be in characters.cpp
02:37 < bridge> <Voxel> I don't know if to also add in the actual sending of the packets or just that part of the code into teams.cpp
02:45 < bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel I'd say the message sending should be in KillTeam
02:46 < bridge> <Voxel> but KillTeam doesn't even get reached when you're in team 0
02:46 < bridge> <Voxel> and stuff
02:47 < bridge> <Ravie> I mean the team kill message
02:47 < bridge> <Voxel> ah okay
02:47 < bridge> <Voxel> i think i know what to do now
02:47 < bridge> <Ravie> so OnCharacterDeath checks if whole team should die and calls KillTeam and that sends the message automatically and then separately in CCharacter::Die you send the single tee death message if needed
02:48 < bridge> <Voxel> So I should only check `!Teams()->SquashTeammates(Team())` in CCharacter::Die?
02:48 < bridge> <Voxel> Meaning if it's false?
02:51 < bridge> <Ravie> ye I guess so
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> also is there any existing text input mask mechanism
03:01 < bridge> <Voxel> i think ones in progress
03:01 < bridge> <Voxel> ok i split it out of the function since it's only used in one place
03:24 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
03:30 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe lacks context but lmk what you think

03:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ui wise
03:33 < bridge> <Voxel> woah wtf is this
03:33 < bridge> <Voxel> oh its figma
03:33 < bridge> <Voxel> what's the concept for?
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> status bar
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> for tater
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> ill link if u want
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/danielkempf/TaterClient-ddnet/pull/14>
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> when i asked here devs did not show interest so i just added to tater
03:39 < bridge> <Ewan> and he wants settings menu before merge
06:55 < bridge> <Ewan> okay so I have a component that is being changed by these settings, but the automatic update functionality is implemented with a conchain & as such editing the value directly does not cause it to update (which is what i have to do in the settings, i think)
06:55 < bridge> <Ewan> how can i find this component and call the same thing the conchain calls
06:56 < bridge> <Ewan> (which just happens to be `OnWindowResize()`)
06:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i've always seen stuff like `parent->findObject<ObjectType>("name");` or something
06:56 < bridge> <Ewan> does teeworlds have something similar
06:57 < bridge> <Ewan> alternatively how can i change a console value without the user using the console
06:58 < bridge> <Ewan> is `ExecuteLine()` my only option? seems kinda bad to have to re-format the string over and over
07:06 < bridge> <Ewan> oh right i can get it through the client
07:07 < bridge> <Ewan> silly me
07:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> RequestInterface<>()?
07:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> g_Config.m_SvXXXXX
07:20 < bridge> <Ewan> right
07:20 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesn't trigger conchains from what i can tell
07:20 < bridge> <Ewan> which was the whole reason for me asking
07:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just call it yourself
07:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't have to be dynamic so thankfully i don't have to
07:21 < bridge> <Ewan> please read
07:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> put the stuff in a function and call it yourself
07:21 < bridge> <Ewan> I did it already
07:22 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1092318109802692648/image.png
07:22 < bridge> <Ewan> this works for me and i don't need to call it
07:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i just call OnWindowResize to force reflow it
07:22 < bridge> <Ewan> which is how i designed it from the start i just forgot how to get the component instance
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a way to get a max console configurable value for a particular console setting
08:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Check the code where it is clamped maybe you see it there

14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do i put external
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess yes
14:54 < bridge> <Avolicious> If the network is external, yes
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is about volumes the warning
14:54 < bridge> <Avolicious> The network is not external accessible
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
14:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> docker bridge networks
14:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> rip
14:54 < bridge> <Avolicious> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Docker/Hub
14:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats outdated
14:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://hub.docker.com/_/mediawiki
14:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i used this
14:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and cuz it said stack too
14:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i got confused xd
14:55 < bridge> <Avolicious> AH I see
14:55 < bridge> <Avolicious> They are not using stack specific stuff
14:56 < bridge> <Avolicious> Okay, sure... then you can go with `docker compose -f stack.yml up -d`
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Main_Page
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok i got it working xd

15:16 < bridge> <Ravie> @Ewan Green maybe you found out already but there is an icon font in the client that you can use, it has a lot of stuff
17:33 < bridge> <AssassinTee> no, because you can do it all with slicing, add the tileset as a quad, slice each tile out of it, make each quad smaller, puzzle your way to smaller tiles
17:33 < bridge> <AssassinTee> i don't see the fps issue there (because I have none)
20:52 < bridge> <Ravie> @Ewan Green https://onlineunicodetools.com/convert-unicode-to-string-literal
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah you're right
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> oh lmfao i'm drawing the button after
20:57 < bridge> <Ravie> lol
20:57 < bridge> <Voxel> lol
20:57 < bridge> <Voxel> anyways im gonna make an enum for fonticons
20:58 < bridge> <Voxel> so that it's much easier to read
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i have code to draw 4 buttons and a clearable edit box in a line
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> buttons get drawn fine & i'm recycling and moving the rect left to draw
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> so why is it that after i draw the buttons & go to draw the edit box at the same rect just moved left a little bit, it's somewhere else on the screen entirely
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> buttons are here and that space on the right is meant to be taken by the box

22:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> don't say like this
22:05 < bridge> <gerdoe> robyt3 tries his best to clean up tw/ddnet codebase and he did plenty
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> his cleanup is diferent
22:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it makes sense xD
22:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im just an observant
22:09 < bridge> <gerdoe> ryozüîç zki
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it does look good
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> about as clean as most code from the era gets
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it has a concrete system for almost everything
22:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its c its bound to look bad
22:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont at me learath
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs cpp
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> even tho it‚Äôs not devout stl everything imo it still looks more cppish than c-ish
22:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> attractive language
22:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wot
22:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> c-driven teeworlds > cpp-driven teeworlds
22:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> cmm
22:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> hard-coding just the icons that we use is good enough for me. adding a script to generate all icons is overkill in my opinion
22:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> okey actually not xd
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the man has spoken
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> you shall obey
22:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> waitin for ryo-driven ddnet

23:07 < bridge> <Ewan> omg
