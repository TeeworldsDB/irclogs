00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Simon'> pls add to database
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you should also provide a png version in standard size in #showroom
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> oh god :justatest:
02:37  * bridge [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> uploaded an image: (17KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UMJkSFRJDfqzDmnkPRvWLsfF/Download.png >
02:37 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Does that work? sending pictures over a bridge?
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If you send it via a link
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> was smth changed with dummy reset recently?
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if i have reset on switch on, and spec on dummy, switch to main while still spec, and switch back, unspec, it will reset the hook
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if i have reset on switch on, hook a wall and hold hook, spec, switch to main while still spec, and switch back, unspec, it will reset the hook*
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and i cant remember if it reset the hook or held it before but i swear it used to hold the hook
04:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> check it with older client
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it does the same on 10.6.2
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> the discord reach presence is really bad, why release the timer when you join a map? just enable the timer when the we start the client
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> the discord reach presence is really bad, why release the timer when you join a map? just enable the timer when we start the client
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> the discord rich presence is really bad, why release the timer when you join a map? just enable the timer when we start the client
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <szaro> is there a way to enable map release announcements on ddnet discord bot on my server?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently discord is not profitable
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why it will probs be sold to microsoft
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe not in the traditional sense but data flow is so extremely valuable at this day an age. Many startups like this operate at a loss for years, do you think our capitalist overlords are stupid enough to lose money?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exapnding the sphere of influence of a product like this is extremely valuable. A monopoly on all web messaging would be a dream scenario for these people
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they could be profitable selling data but its not as robust as ur typical way
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting podcast about this
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybCiD5Ju-xA
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it's queued up already :P
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've replaced the time I wasted on watching silly youtube videos with podcasts lately and it's been very entertaining
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want some things to listen to: Command Line Heroes by RedHat, Teamistry by Atlassian, ChangeLog and Freakonomics are great to listen to
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Will there be tournament winners by Region ?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> now that we have that contrast you could show them
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> imagine a ddnet podcast or official vids :greenthing:
16:55 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Make some
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, dune in costume sits with congratulations about new year
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> another one will be with deen announcing new ddnet feature
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> third about merging official tw with ddnet where deen gives a five to dune
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why is /save /load timeout so high now btw?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why is /save /load cooldown so high now btw?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Zodiac did you do something to the normal save/load cooldowns?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> save/load cooldowns are set via server command :p
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @Learath2 I believe it is sharing the same cooldown value as /swap. There is an active issue already asking to reduce that so might make them both 1 minute then
23:24 <@deen> Zodiac: Yeah, can you make them both 1 min?
23:24 <@deen> Ama: Huh, good idea!
23:24 <@deen> but for some regions the time is really bad for playing (Asia)
