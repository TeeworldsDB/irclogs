00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @c0d3d3v so what are the gameinfo flags controlling the hud?
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i implemented them
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the gameinfoEx can send up to 3 flags
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> one for armor/heartzs
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> one for ammo
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and one for ddrace hud
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if multiple ones get sent, they get adjusted donwwards
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u can try that on my server, i can show you
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have implemented all versions already, depending on what u do
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how do I check them out?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> come visit me, i will show you
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm on your server
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just debugged KOG, they do not even send a single flag O.o
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah xDD I guess I know what goes wrong
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yep @fokkonaut  removed the check that the server is sending extended character data. So the client does not fall back to the vanilla hud
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will add it back in
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will do that tomorrow... I'm tired...
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5427
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 check the screens
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that check... As I copied it I forgot why I added it... but now it makes sense xD
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992197491833454712/unknown.png
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that check... As I copied your delete it I forgot why I added it... but now it makes sense xD
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992197491833454712/unknown.png
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Actually we could also just only display the weapon display and the jumps...
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So if the server isn't sending extended character data we shouldn't render the new hud, that makes sense to me given we don't try to predict it by default
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's not change it for servers that don't want to change it, @Avolicious can start sending `HUD_DDRACE` if he wants the new hud on kog
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Some data would be predicted... but not perfectly
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i'll print that
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992198910703571004/unknown.png
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> at least as I debuged it, ... at least the servers I tested do not send any gameinfo... we use the pFallbackServerInfo infos...
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats why it is categorised as a DDRace server, but it is not sending DDNetCharacters
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 ahhh i know why jumps didnt work. because i havent merged displayinfo into ddnetchar
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wait, so KoG doesn't send gameinfo at all?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992199834385789080/unknown.png
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> theyre old af
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> at least 3 updates are made... But when I debug it the version is always -1
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess then the fallback info should be upgraded to include HUD_HEALTH_ARMOR and HUD_AMMO
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but it does not send any extended net objects
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is the old gameinfo, not extended ddnet gameinfo
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i see why it didnt work
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> true
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2cba4dd768a6523a6cba76fe17019e6e4315c301/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1065-L1068
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `Info.m_HudHealthArmor = !DDNet;` this doesn't look very correct, right? I guess this is it?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> this is ddnet server:
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992200290486984724/unknown.png
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, this is it @Learath2
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, so just a small fix to the fallback info is needed and we are fine
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> no it is ok
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah, and which?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not easy to predict everythign correctly xd
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like, for all types
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it should just fallback to Info.m_HudHealthArmor if we do not get extended game info
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> + ammo
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the default way
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should already
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, bcs kog is ddnet
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so it falls back to nothing
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but the ddrace hud
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which is not shown
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> due to the other case
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they just gotta update. its unbelievable :D
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It falls back correctly, the values you chose are wrong afaics
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be `true, true, false`. That was the old behaviour we want to preserve
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i did it the other way around
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even if a server is deemed to be `IsDDNet` unless it's sending the new gameinfo and the character with the new values, we should just render the old hud. Atleast that's how I have it in my head
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ta-da KOG server ... just by adding this:
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992201285019369534/unknown.png
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992201285245866004/unknown.png
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pls no
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that looks very wrong
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> need to check if this is fine... tomorrow... I will make a fix
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do what learath and me just said
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But yes, true true fals ðŸ˜„
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just at the top xd
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in the initial place
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I need to sleep too. Good thing we caught it before release, I guess kog people just don't play with rcs ever
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tye
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you mean like this
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992201785722802257/unknown.png
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that check... As I copied your delete I forgot why I added it... but now it makes sense xD
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992197491833454712/unknown.png
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should stay like this no matter teh gametype.
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because this is the main teeworlds setting
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> defualt
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and once the server sends the right flags and version > x + the extended info = show ddrace hud
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, like that
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can only move stuff in rust when you have the sole reference to it
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in that case, you can obviously move the futex-based mutex because no one can have it locked at the time (because no one else has a reference to it)
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but apparently you're not allowed to move pthread mutexes in that case
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that's very clever
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why that's not the case with pthread mutexes, the same idea should apply, no
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it looks like they might have an internally linked list
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in /usr/include/bits/struct_mutex.h, I find a `__pthread_list_t __list` member of `__pthread_mutex_s`
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or alternatively, the pthread mutex implementation keeps references to initialized mutexes somewhere
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ohh, I remember reading something like that in glibc actually, it's some weird cleanup promise I think
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there is that for threads that get killed
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's also only relevant while the mutex is held, so shouldn't interfere with what rust wants
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks can we replace these with `vec2` ?
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2cba4dd768a6523a6cba76fe17019e6e4315c301/src/engine/graphics.h#L106-L113>

02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Discord Mod
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ip logger
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do you know?
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does that mean that discord preview already leaked my ip ?
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might even work out of the box fi you just make them inherit from vec2
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or `using GL_SPoint = vec2`
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's what i did `typedef vec2 GL_SPoint`
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> It can make sense to split gpu types from cpu types. For future hardware or when switching to higher precision on cpu side
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> So yeah, keep struct as is
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i used typedef, works fine ðŸ™‚
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But that is interchangeable with vec2 in assignments
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> indeed, is that a problem?
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Depends. Do you want to add an assignment operator overload instead of a direct cast in future? Mixing data types is always a topic for discussion probs
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Damn wtf so cool
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> why can i not create issues on ddnet fork on github android
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992324802574549053/Screenshot_20220701-090332_GitHub.jpg

09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have to enable issues in the repository settings
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if that is your repository
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nice, thanks. didnt know what you have to enable them.
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> seems that i cannot access repo settings through the app.
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> or im just dumb
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> maybe there aren't any issues hence why you cannot create any :thonk:
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> it's already perfect
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the github app is trash... you can not do a lot of things. FastHub is better. But I recommend just to use the website.
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> why would you use github on your phone? addicted to code review xd
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I guess reading comments is fine but doing work from phone seems painful
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Why would you not... In the meantime phone screens are bigger then my TV in the nineties, especially on tablets. Also you can connect external monitor and keyboard... 
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But I personally just like to be able to search in code and be able to open specific file fast... but github app can nothing code related.
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I guess thats fair, if you connect a keyboard and monitor it basically becomes a pc
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> dude im not sitting in sbahn with laptop creating issues
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but with phone, that i have always with me. i have a lot of ideas that could be implemented and for me its perfect to just create an issue in my fork repo on the phone in between.
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> xd im not sitting in sbahn with laptop creating issues
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets use main brainch, all projects use main now, easier to type same git commands for all projects xd
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No way to alias them so both are the same I guess? I keep mixing them up for different repos
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs not ^^
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still use master everywhere :/
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If a majority wants to switch I guess I don't mind. It'd be really nice to have an alias indeed
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is symbolic-ref but those are local iirc
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For me nearly everything is master too, really depends on what projects you use commonly
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mesa and sdl, and new projects default to main too ðŸ˜„
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> None of my work and private projects do, except the ones I created since the default changed
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it's about 20:1 for me now ðŸ˜„
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how tf do u handle 20 projects
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 21
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not my fault people put their code into 10 different repos ðŸ˜„
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't change, sounds annoying
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps Jupstar could do the trick Learath2 mentioned?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> apparently not annoying enough for SDL and mesa to change it
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the current name is backward compatible, we don't have to fix anything
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we change it, we'll have to deal with the fallout
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might not be large, but why bother changing it? it doesn't seem useful to contribute to the churn of changing it
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. rust-lang/rust also has master as the default name
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. mesa has not
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> master for me too
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what kind of argument is that xD
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the argument u made
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but against
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my argument was that its easier bcs more and more projects will adapt it
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just a matter of time
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> new project get it anyway
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and even bigger ones change it
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sdl is not as big as rustlang iirc
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mesa is around as big probably
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sdl 600 forks, rust 9.4k
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> atleast code wise
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does mesa have lot of CI?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust has shitload of stuff around
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with crater and CIs everywhere
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its probs way harder
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to change
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why should u explicitly name master in a CI?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and rust community is rly woke they probs wanted the main thing
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant rename ur branch localy and target master?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would git not allow that
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ive no idea what works, i think i made a point. if you dont want it ok. but pls no pseudo arguments, we speak again in 5 years, lets see how much it changed until then
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why you wanna change *master* to *main* in the first place ?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ðŸ¤¦
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's no tldr, sorry ðŸ˜„
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does that mean we can finally drop bors?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992504212879585431/unknown.png
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or do i miss interpret
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. merge conflicts sounds like a status change
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but the PR could also just fail to compile without a merge conflict
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> doesn't sound like this would try the PR in staging again
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> possible, dunno what this can do, but i always wondered why github should not be aware of what happens in github actions
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> remote: error: Required status check "ci-build" is failing"
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds like exactly that
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i think merge conflicts are always detect already, tho dunno if u can "force" merge
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> accidentially
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> But what if all the CI checks pass in PR 1, then someone merges PR 2 which causes errors with PR 1. As PR 1 already has all CI checks passing it's still good to merge?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can that happen?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> isnt that a merge conflict
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cannot imagine such a case but maybe, dunno xd
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> missing symbols maybe?, dunno if that creates no conflict
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess testing out is easiest ^^
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that can happen, and that's precisely the reason for bors
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://bors.tech/
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe they thought about it
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from the docs it sounds like it can enforce it the same way as bors does, but you have to actually handle the rebasing yourself
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it'd result in less automation
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds annoying
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they should just allow a pre merge stage or smth to their actions
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would fix their problems and they can advertise it as replacement for stuff like bors, since i assume maybe projects have to deal with such problems
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> woudl be nice if github tracks against what commit the CI ran, and then allows fast merges for stuff where CI is fine, e.g. faster merges for simple stuff like translations
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that usually get merged relativly fast after pr is created ^
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but tbh i'd like to have on CI runners xd, faster knowing if pr is broken
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our current CI is dead as slow, 20min or smth
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but tbh i'd like to have own CI runners xd, faster knowing if pr is broken
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could potentially rearrange the build steps so you can know about failures earlier
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and skip likely-redundant ones
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> we could probably use something like https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files to run less CI on PRs that only change resources
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound useful
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we know no tests will fail, we might as well run them, the humans don't have to wait for them
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it prevents usuless CI runs when you only change language files or readme
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what benefit does that have?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can think of a single one, but I'm not sure if it's worth
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> energy saving?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it's worth it
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you think that? ðŸ™‚
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont driver ur car for 1 day and u save more energy than the CI produces in 1 year probs xd
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at 100 W, a CI run produces 0.13 kWh
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> an electric car uses 0.2 kWh per kilometer
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> boiling 1 liter of water costs 0.7 kWh if the water cooker has an energy efficiency of 1
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do you assume it runs at 100W? ðŸ˜„
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd assume like 4-5watts max for our action
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a full used core doesnt require too much energy
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mother etc. ofc cost stuff but gets split around all actions that are running
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> motherboard etc. ofc cost stuff but gets split around all actions that are running
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I googled how much a CPU uses, it was mostly a little below 100 W
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont understrand
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why, but the game looses fps in each version it seems
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i used to have ~1k fps on my server, now its around 400
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its insane
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but a desktop CPU would compile the full CI in less than a minute
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and other servers usually 1k+, now arond 800
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not 20 minutes ðŸ˜„
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pls do a git bisect
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would really help
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im nob
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be the new UI
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can help you git bisect
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you build the ddnet client?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> more likely to be the thing by @nuborn which scans those entitiyEx objects and searches for a matching other entity
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aswell as for the switch state thing he did
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> great
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then check out the good version, and verify that it has your desired FPS
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it has, do `git bisect start`, `git bisect good`
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then check out the latest version, verify that it has the bad FPS, and do `git bisect bad`
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then follow the instructions
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems ez
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but busy rn. will try at another point
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <charlieasy> Hi, im tryin to change map randomly with votes on my own server, can someone help me pls?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think ddnet uses SQL commands for that
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <charlieasy> Oh so i cant put it the consol ?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno if such command exists, but probably not since it requires to know all maps
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <charlieasy> Oh ye like there is all maps and server take once
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <charlieasy> Where can in find names of my downloaded maps
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <charlieasy> Where can in find names of my downloaded maps?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> %appdata%/Teeworlds/downloadedmaps
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> %appdata%/DDNet/downloadedmaps
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <charlieasy> Ty
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's no little economy
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you start saying that it doesn't matter, then not reducing your own carbon footprint doesn't matter because 99.9999999% of mankind's carbon footprint is not your fault (you don't have any leverage on it), then nobody would change
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> btw, CI doesn't produces energy, it uses it
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> btw, CI doesn't produces energy, it uses it (turn electrical into mostly heat)
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think you know what he meant
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no i dont?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im no magician guessing people's mind
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah it uses the energy
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh that part
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not the most important one though
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway, you are right.
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But i doubt computers are as bad as they often potraied, start with bitcoin before removing smth useful.
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But definitely start to remove coal industry
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7J4qo3XEAk76xz?format=jpg&name=large
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its german, but i guess its clear
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> translation of left text?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tho tbf airplaines are higher in the air, so CO2 there is worse for environment
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Million tons per year is x axis ?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not really, that has no impact at all
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it does
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> quite a lot actually
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even hydrogen airplaines are considered harmful
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> for water it does, for CO2 it's negligeable
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> co2 weights more than "air"
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but higher in the air it stays longer
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> btw, the graph omits lot of industries. clothing, techs, etc.
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but most industry uses electricity and not all produce co2
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> often other chemicals
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not alawys co2
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah industry is a huge player
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> steal industry and cement
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> steel industry and cement
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> You know, I kind of question why the entities thumbnail hasn't been updated in... like, 2 years or more. 
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I propose an update, where the thumbnail will have its own svg counterpart for future updates.
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Left is old, right is new.

22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs nobody has done it xd
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the simple but real answer
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also soreu left ddnet
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> :tear:
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Sad... I'll try to find the second font used for this to make it more consistent.
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks can i revert order between for loop and `QuadsDrawTLImpl` call? <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/e7c3f108ef51fe4484a75301ced2678c8f6159cf/src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp#L1102-L1113>
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> entities need full rework but ppl are already used to them
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont think so
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3 vertices  = 1 triangle
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I was thinking about making an SVG version of them, but that is honestly a lot of work.
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u change that u'll get different triangles xD
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> function doesn't call anything except AddVertices
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have a remake of them but i didnt svgize the whole thing only some tiles
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u mean putting it before
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but would that not include these vertices
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in the call
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but wouldn't that not include these vertices
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Chairn can we agree on that reducing energy usage in sectors that have no impact globally isn't worth chasing?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh that's nice. also when i eventually do remake the entities i'd revamp this, mainly the snow
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992531047902363688/unknown.png
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's not worth for global policy, it's worth it at our scale as it doesn't cost anything to do so
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well mapping entities need a full rework
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> honestly dont understand the code rn xD
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so much more cluttered for no reason
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why reduce energy where it doesn't matter?
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if it's just the tilemap that it probs doesnt matter
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since there is no collision between 2 tiles in same layer
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> any reason to change the order?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i haven't seen any difference so i don't know what it does
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it does matter
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Essigautomat do u know when the material layer will be finished?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's an assignment from vec2 to vec3 if i replace your struct
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the premise was that it doesn't. hm. we seem to be talking past each other @Chairn
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be nice to have a few maps in queue to release once if it gets added
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it doesn't on global scale, it does on local one
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. are you talking about the CI or my statement about sectors?
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> remember that global energy consumption is just the sum of all small consumers
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im still on CI
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, I'm not
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that explains why we're talking past each other
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> " @Chairn can we agree on that reducing energy usage in sectors that have no impact globally isn't worth chasing? "
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe an issue on github to gather some other opinion?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm thinking of sectors such as idk, transport, internet, etc.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if one such sector doesn't have a global impact, it doesn't seem like it's worth trying to optimize it
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but we don't have hands on those, i mean at the individual level, so why bother here ?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> bother your local politician for those
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, we do: we can choose our transport, e.g.
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or we can choose whether to worry more about heating our houses, or about CI
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so we can choose to remove CI
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> for useless runs
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, we can. the question I wanted to ask is whether it's worth it
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seemed to me that you shut this question down, so I went back a level and asked whether you can imagine whether something is not worth doing
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in that general area
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ci runned when.i fixed typo
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it is, we save energy
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when was CI introduced on ddnet github?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i wanna compute the overall energy spent when modifying data files
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can also save energy by, say, optimizing the ddnet client
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> way harder to do
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and to measure as well
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> or save energy struggling with ci setup
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you don't agree that there might be some energy that is not worth optimizing?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in general, not limited to CI
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in general, there might be, but we're not talking about general case here
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I am, to understand whether we can agree on the basics
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm trying to find our disagreement
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why do you want to generalise about our special case?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> imo, that looks like you're running away from the problem
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I am trying to understand why two people come to different conclusions about the same problem
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Chairn says: there is no question to be asked about whether running less CI is worth it
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> heinrich5991 says: I want to investigate that question
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD lets make a case study in the next 5 years
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not what I'm proposing
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then the case study wasted more energy than the CI does in the next 20 years xD
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I actually can't find anything about CI and energy consumption on the web
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, there are 1852 commits referencing data folder. So 1852 CI runs at 100W for 10 minutes. This sums up to 1852x100x1/6 = 30.89kwh
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is a bit weird, because it seems like an obvious question to ask
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so it's about one month oh my own energy consumption
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so it's about one month of my own energy consumption
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no way its 100watt
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just no way xD
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's run with 100 W, it shouldn't change the result
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah 30kwh for 2-3 is not insane
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it does fetch packages wth apt which call other servers as well
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> driving to north sea and back with a car
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 100 watts is desktop CPU with ALL cores at 100%
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's within the right order of magnitude, probably
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's not much point worrying about the exact energy consumption
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but i highely doubt 100watts still xD
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay ^^
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (also 100watts per hour)
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm? that doesn't make sense
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 100 watt hours per hour? ^^
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well the CI doesnt run for 1h
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the 1/6
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh ok
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then makes sense ðŸ˜„
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> macos is the longest one, but ubuntu and windows are around 8 minutes, so that evens out to roughly 10 minutes
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + the other small jobs like formatting and style
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but dude, ddnet compiles in 8 seconds for me
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it compiles multiple times, and also (probably slow) stuff like clang-tidy
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> taking just CPU in mind and saying my CPU uses around 100watt/h
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its 0.222â€‰watt/h for a single ddnet compile for me locally
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you got your units wrong, but the end result is still okay, I guess
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> watt is 'instantaneous power consumption'
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> watt = power, wh = energy
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> times
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> watt hours (watt times hour) is energy
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway. if you want to optimize the energy usage of the CI, I think it'd be best to allow bors to delay merging a PR until an important one comes around
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then we still don't break master, but everything is still tested
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> taking just CPU in mind and saying my CPU uses around 100watt*h
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its 0.222â€‰watt*h for a single ddnet compile for me locally
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> taking just CPU in mind and saying my CPU uses around 100watt * h
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its 0.222â€‰watt * h for a single ddnet compile for me locally
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao writing * in discord harder than u thinkx D
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> *ez*

23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd imagine the deep freeze "darker" similar on how minecraft is making blue ice "more blue" ðŸ˜„
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i guess its just for editor? so doesnt really matter xDD
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> mappers spend loong hours in editor so less details on entities the better, they only should have a special color or marking so that on first spot you will know what tile it is
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but voxel is insane artist
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he needs to showoff
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the sun must melt the ice
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> you could just say the snowflakes wouldnt be readable for small sizes :|
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> they would be readable
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> even toooo much readable
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> tsoooo readable that your eyes would bleed =]
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> one second i'll replace the snowflakes
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> really? was it really intended for them to be blurred almost?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> yes because freeze is the most used tile
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> so to use it with comfort in editor it was blured
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992543317676003480/unknown.png
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> because most of the time you have your map zooomed out
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks really clean
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> with it blured you focus on color thats why it was done that way
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also with these additions, I'm going to make the live/deep unfreezes more readable. At its current state the eyes are almost impossible to see
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> but ofcourse you can try to do it 4k rez =]
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> i wonder what will mappers say after some time in using them xD
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, I somehow doubt the legitimacy of this story but I wasn't paying any attention to stuff like that back in the day so I don't even remember what sort of discussion was ever had
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tee outline is a bit funny but looks neat
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but editor entities need full revamp
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blurring it is such an absurd way to fix the details being too much, you usually simplify the design if it's too detailed
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not a remake
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> things are too cluttered in editor entities
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> in fact would be much better to just make it similar to ingame entities
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> i dont think that making it high rez will be a problem just try not to add tooo many tiny details to them xD
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im not trying to go for high res, i just think it would be a better workflow if there was an svg of the entities
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it would be easier to update and edit, and since there would be reusable assets in the file there would be less guessing
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it'll get blurry again when exporting to png
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> read msg above u
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> btw just to make it clear i was mentioning the entites that were made for ddrace client not for ddnet xD they were diffrent and also some of main tiles were blured out
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> like freeze
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> they *look* fine. im testing it in the wrong medium but they look alright
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992546292121227356/unknown.png
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> and this "ice" is it rly that much needed =]
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but the current one looks So Bad
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> ddnet mappers should be asked what they think about it (I don't use ddnet client to map so I don't want to mess in development). 
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> I just think that less details the better, specialy on big zoom out and bigger maps (my opinion) =]
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> imo the default entities with some edits would be good for editor
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> default entities themselves need clearer doors, turrents, etc tho
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't map but i tend to agree with Tsin, not too much detail to save our mapper's eyesight
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992547659380424815/unknown.png
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe if i remove the shine mark?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/992548150814461962/unknown.png
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Voxel yes it does look good but what ur showing is just freeze open a big map with all the entities and check the "color candy" there and how do you feel watching that "color candy" for hours =]
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup better imo
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this isnt made for gameplay tsin
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> im talking about editor only
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> playing with entites (not on test server) should be banned xD
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also im literally using the same colors as the current entities set?
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> half the server: am i a joke to you?
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> half the server would like to disagree
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Over half
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> they are a joke to me, everyone who plays on entites can go "f...." emmmm  "hide" him self also playing with entities should be banned =]
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this isn't relevant to how i should improve my set. should i make the colors less saturated?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> 90% of maps hurt my eyes, I wouldn't play this game if I couldn't use entities :kek:
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> "90%" hmmmmmm
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> maybe there is something wrong with your sight and ddnet/tw just needs a special correction filter for your illness ? =]
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> They do, it's called entities :feelsamazingman:
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> hehehe no no ðŸ˜›
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> xD
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tsin try not to make any passive aggresive remark and end it with =] challenge minute 3
