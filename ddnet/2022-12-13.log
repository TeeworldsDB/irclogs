02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> after the tutorial players need to be guided through the GUI - this can be done by making the GUI more intuitive (more elegant solution, but less likely to happen any time soon), or some kind of animated tutorial that highlights a button with a small explanation popping up. there are a lot of things to be explained, so i dont know how to make it not too boring yet.

02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> in particular the things you wrote in your reply to the review should be explained:
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to join a server
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to filter by difficulty and region
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to filter by empty
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to call a vote to change the map
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to call a vote to change the map to some 1-2 star novice map
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to join a team (also how to join it without it dissolving after you die)
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to call a vote to kick a blocker
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to use practice mode
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> how to connect a dummy
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> 
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> also, it would be good it we could somehow set the expectation, that it is hard to complete a map and it takes time and failing a lot. also it is not lethal to be left behind by one group - the next group that is more your speed might save you and take you with them.

02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CachorroCaramelo> Can you help me? I wanted to change my nick but I didn't want to lose my points. Is there a way to transfer the points from my account to my nick?
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So basically like now. It's good that u finally understand the problem
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And if they wouldn't even be there i still could filter them, even without doing something for it
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> That's not the reason
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Pretty good reason for me
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> What is the even better reason
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> :justatest:
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> That it is worse than OpenGl?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> Tutorials should be designed with enough hints so that almost anyone can do it. By explaining very basic things like "how to drag another tee through freeze, so that it can help you in turn" we are not allowing the newbie to start feeling like they "solved the riddle on their own" and feel excited. The more tutorials we have, the more things that could have been cool little riddles for new players we make into skills they are required to lear
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> 
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alisa> however, there are quite some things that are very unintuitive about the game, but are commonly used in novice maps, so not understanding those aspects would make people frustrated (i am talking about hammerfly, the fact that you can press buttons while frozen but being hammered, the fact that it makes a difference to align at tiles, in particular sometimes you have to hook someone to be able to hammer them through the wall even though it doe
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It will fall back to OpenGL if Vulkan is not supported. So no, this is not the reason
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> THE NAME IT! :harold:
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> THEN NAME THE REASON! :harold:
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The reason is simply that we haven't tried it yet
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Also please don't default it for the sake of NVIDIA users
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> With the new error messages work fine, we can try it maybe
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ?
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Isn't Vulkan only a good alternative for amd?
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> No
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> You keep hearing that tho
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> No
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> :tee_thinking:
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Any source for your claim?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Interesting.
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ```NVIDIA designs hardware to provide the fastest Vulkan performance for your games and applications. For example, NVIDIA GPUs perform up over 30 percent faster than the nearest competition on games such as Doom Eternal with advanced rendering techniques such as ray tracing.```
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Interesting. No. I only was told that.

09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan is better for every modern hardware
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Interesting. No. I only was told that. Or maybe it was only good for Linux users and performed worse on Windows. Dunno.

09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Even for your Android phone

10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupir windows marketint
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Marketing
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Such a bad conpany with their stupid directx fud
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> :kek:
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Mh yeah. I think many ppl have many good ideas. One big problem is that we currently solve a lot of problems with the editor we already have, which comes with lot of limitations. Explaining smth like a freeze hammer would be easier if you build up the situation that leads to this. Sadly i doubt any dev is interested into developing a more complex tutorial. Which is more interactive rather than only text based
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We don't fall back on crash though
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Currently we have more problems with opengl tho.
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Tab out crash is the only one that currently directly affects a user. Or do you know any other. Too many skins are hacked l handled with the error update

13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Am I the only one getting crashes with the new ddnet rls ?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Send dumps
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or assert logs
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> how to get assert logs?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Appdata dumps
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So you think it makes sense to default to Vulkan for next release? Would probably also be a good time to add the vulkan error messages and then I can remove the "default to Vulkan" option in Steam which is annoying some people
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'd say it's worth a try and if it totally falls apart revert
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Will be released in 4-6 weeks then
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ok will need to change some hard coded defaults in the source anyway ^^
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it also performs well for me too now xD i get more fps over time with every new mesa update
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Jupeyy_Keks actually it is possible to provide directx backend too now right (with dxvk-native)?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <thekid36> Maybe this is not the right channel to do it, but I want to support this message with a personal experience, and maybe bring this to the attention of many others.
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <thekid36>  It took me a whole day to figure out how to edge hook (which doesn't sound much, compared to how long I've been playing..but the point still stands). If someone could have told me I'd learn that in like 2 minutes (aim issues aside). I always thought they had some kind of magical powers to hook through that small gap. It's not a "novice skill" but I think it's present in maybe 2-3 novice maps (kobra 3, seasons).  But I understand that is n
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes. But i won't touch direct 3d. Indeed the first graphics api i learned was dx9. And the interface was really weird since then i never touched it again xd. I guess direct3d 12 is probably relatively close to vulkan. But then again its also useless, as the support between both is probably similar driver wise
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yea i was thinking about providing dx9 or 11 for older gpus make sense more instead opengl since it is rly bad on windows xd
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I thought I have seen it in Aoe's noob school series, but I haven't found him covering it.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> there are videos like this though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae-k60iOYeM
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I doubt you can explain it well enough in-game, that the hitbox expands through the wall when the tee is hugging the wall
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Allowing to edge hook people and hammer them through walls
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Allowing to edge hook people (when they are really in the corner) and hammer them through walls (when you and your mate/dummy kiss the same wall)
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Allowing to edge hook people (when they are really in the corner - found it the easiest to let off the hook only when I am ready to rehook at the same time, so basically when I already have aimed) and hammer them through walls (when you and your mate/dummy kiss the same wall)
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I doubt you can explain it well enough in-game, that the hitbox expands through the wall when the tee is hugging the wall (people ignore the hook here drawings on novice maps for example too, making you have to explain them that they should hook the ground)

15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> But here I am questioning why the game has to offer such tutorials. It should lie in the player to figure out tricks, asking other people or googling for a YouTube video.

15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Someone pointed out today or yesterday that the "Novice" maps are hard. And I have to partially agree. The maps that are easy aren't actively hosted by any servers because people in general won't vote for a beginner map because they already played those through or don't want to play those.

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ddnet could provide dedicated servers for those maps. But the problem would be that those will be empty, and people rather join servers with people in them. So you possibly have to force actual noobs through a few solo/dummy maps to make their mechanics and game understanding be good enough to start with a harder map.

16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zwelf Do you think it's safe to update official ddnet servers to master branch again?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in regards to sqlite/sql problems
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I still see lots of ranks in the database twice:
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> MariaDB [teeworlds]> delete record_race from record_race inner join record_race b on record_race.Map = b.Map and record_race.Name = b.Name and record_race.Time = b.Time and record_race.Timestamp != b.Timestamp and DATE_SUB(b.Timestamp, INTERVAL 1 HOUR) = record_race.Timestamp and record_race.Timestamp >= "2022-12-10" and b.Timestamp >= "2022-12-10";
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Query OK, 6977 rows affected (16.948 sec)
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, maybe they are from servers which didn't restart yet
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> I think in general yes. One thing that might be a problem is that we move rows from _backup tables after 1h, but don't consider the time zone. That alone wont explain 6977 duplicate rows (old servers might).

16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MAhdiyar>  that's?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that is msvc, you need mingw
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See the "info: default host triple is x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MAhdiyar> where is  mingw ?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MAhdiyar> i not see
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MAhdiyar> "default host triple: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think there should be a way to run rustup-init with a different compiler, maybe `rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Rust is a programming language offering high performance and memory safety, so it's interesting for games
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen do you happen to know why "Nieme" is the author of AiP-Gores in the database, but it says "zarnexxx" in the map? https://ddnet.org/maps/AiP-45-Gores/
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> zarnexxx is Nieme's old name
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, thanks :)

18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > For the first time ever, US scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a source familiar with the project confirmed to CNN.
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i've seen it, but my brother not yet, so i dont wanna judge yet.
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. is the material really good enough?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> afaik material is the biggest problem for fusion anyway, e.g. if it holds long enough
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2.05 MJ in, 3.15 MJ out.
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean defs cool yeah 😄
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be a game changer
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then my dream of 18ghz intel cpus using 2 gigawatt h finally becomes true
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the r ation went from 2.2:2.0 ratio to 3.15:2.05
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ratio went from 2.2:2.0 ratio to 3.15:2.05
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The recent NIF experiments have jumped up in power. The first shot that started this new chain of research was about 1.7 MJ of energy delivered. Now, 2.15 MJ. However, the output has jumped non-linearly, demonstrating the scaling laws at work.
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> In rust how to read a file line by line? I found this when searching https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/file/read_lines.html. (btw I am trying to do aoc day 1 part 1)
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#method.read_line
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> note
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always wrap big files in a bufreader
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust doesnt do buffered reader unless u ask for it
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Jupeyy_Keks can you check the checkmarks so we know thay you checked them and did the thing and things and everything is fine :saddo:
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i always at least minimally test my changes
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (except i am writing from mobile or smth like that xD)

20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I have no idea why this "works" but it does print all the lines :kek:
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ```rust
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> use std::io;

20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> use std::fs::File;

20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     let inpfn = "../input";
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> 
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     let f = File::open(inpfn)?;
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     let mut reader = BufReader::new(f);
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     let mut buffer = String::new();
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> 
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     while reader.read_line(&mut buffer).expect("hehe") != 0 {
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>         println!("{buffer}");
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>         buffer.clear();
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     }
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7>     Ok(())
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> }
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ```
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ok(())
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 🍻
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I have no idea what that does either
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> nice!
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> would you like some improvements right now or rather nah?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> improvements as in 'a bit cleaner code', not as in 'more correct'
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> sure :D
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you are going to read the entire file anyways, you can just read it into a string directly. 
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```rs
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> let mut input = String::new();
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> File::open(path)?.read_to_string(&mut input)?;
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> a string is usually more flexible to work with, and you read the entire file anyways
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and a string also has `.lines()`, which you can also just iterate over
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```rs
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> for line in input.lines() {
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>   println!("{line}");
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> }
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `line` is of the type `&str`, so no further allocations are made
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and this way you don't have to do all the buffer operations :)
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> nice I'm trying it out :D
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah a lot better thanks :D
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yw!

21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and now?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what do you mean now? current is now?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what does that change
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use different materials
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use the sun for raytracing
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats the problem

21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Or use BufReader
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> But ig reading all at once doesn't change anything
