00:00 <+jxsl13> hm
00:00 <+jxsl13> let's test it out :D
00:41 <+jxsl13> hm, now the bam fun starts ._.
02:00 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991 ?
02:00 <@heinrich5991> yes?
02:01 <+jxsl13> I need to get all the uuid stuff that is generated in the compile.py ._.
02:01 <+jxsl13> my last linking error is related to that pythin script
02:01 <+jxsl13> python*
02:08 <@heinrich5991> mhmh
02:08 <@heinrich5991> you don't necessarily need the uuid stuff I guess
02:09 <+jxsl13> ._.
02:09 <+jxsl13> only the stuff from the void RegisterGameUuids(CUuidManager *pManager) function 
02:17 <@heinrich5991> nah, that should be good to remove
02:35 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: I thought teehistorian did use uuids
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it doesn't need `RegisterGameUuids`
02:36 <+Learath2> oh
02:36 <+Learath2> how hard is teehistorian_index to set-up btw?
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compile it
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     if ./teehistorian_index -b index data > index.tmp; then
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         mv index.tmp index
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         wc -l index
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         echo ---
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     else
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         rm index.tmp
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     fi
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is what I have on successful teehistorian download
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it indexes the new files not found in the current index

02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 review soon plz
02:40 <+Learath2> you just had to split it out to it's own class :P
02:40 <@heinrich5991> it's not an own class
02:40 <@heinrich5991> it's a single function
02:40 <+Learath2> could you check why my tests on the vote abstraction don't work btw? I gave you like 4 highlights about that :/
02:40 <@heinrich5991> I guess
02:42 <+Learath2> https://github.com/learath2/ddnet/tree/dd_pr_voting give it a look sometime :)
02:42 <@heinrich5991> will try to
02:48 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: your trim right function looks weird
02:49 <@heinrich5991> I just moved the StrRtrim function from server.cpp
02:49 <@heinrich5991> the tests pass (?) ;)
02:50 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: i.e. is it a "it looks weird" or is it a "it might have a bug"?
02:51 <+Learath2> I thought it might've had a bug but it seems fine
02:51 <@heinrich5991> thanks for checking so thoroughly :)
02:54 <+jxsl13> ddnet client crashed on mac :D -> https://pastebin.com/buKsKMFE
02:55 <@heinrich5991> not now :(
02:55 <+jxsl13> save the link :D
02:55 <@heinrich5991> on quitting?
02:55 <+jxsl13> yep
02:56 <@heinrich5991> may I post to github?
02:56 <+jxsl13> yeah, why not
02:56 <+jxsl13> ls
02:59 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: I'd prolly put some weird utf8 characters in the tests just to be sure, but looks fine to me
02:59 <+jxsl13> :c removed UUID stuff, compiles, but not working

14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Can i somehow see who were the first finishes on any map on the website?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can't find it
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Im 'corneum maybe you can download the stats stuff.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found a nice quote on hacker news: ```He fooled Death, staved off it's dance
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it beat him yet, Longinus' Lance
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now the bet is in our hands
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> perhaps we'll get another chance:

16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991  would it be hard to implement it? i remember that deen had posted it on some maps and the dates are also there. would be nice.
16:27 <+Learath2> shouldn't be too-too difficult, it's just one mysql query to figure it out and it never changes
16:52 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991  ._., mind helping me figuring out, why the stuf doesnt work xD ?
16:53 <+jxsl13> I got it compiling and most of the PRs from ddnet are added .
16:54 <+jxsl13> First problem is, that the nor the folder not the log file are created :c
16:55 <+jxsl13> neither fodler, nor log files*
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you get any errors?
17:08 <+jxsl13> none
17:09 <+jxsl13> not even the tee historian errors ._.
17:10 <+jxsl13> if somewone wants to take a look https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch
17:11 <+jxsl13> this branch -> https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch/src/branch/teehistorian
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you most definitely are missing a part of the pr
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually no üòõ
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> jxsl13 well you are never checking `g_Config.m_SvTeeHistorian` so I guess you actually are missing some parts of the pr
17:19 <+jxsl13> it is saved in another variable if I'm not mistaken
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all the code in `gamecontext.cpp` depends on m_TeeHistorianActive but you never set it to true anywhere
17:20 <+jxsl13> lol
17:20 <+jxsl13> ._.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L2559
17:20 <+jxsl13> that's what I thought xD
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991's code is usually pretty verbose üòõ If you actually had enabled it and it failed it'd shout at you üòõ
17:21 <+jxsl13> but somehow missing in my code ._. lost it on the way
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways busy for an hour or so
17:23 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vxIf0
18:21 <+jxsl13> sadly still not working :c
18:46 <+Learath2> jxsl13: why?
18:47 <+jxsl13> I don't know why, it enters the specific if-branches (seen on server debug msgs) but does not even create the file 
18:48 <+jxsl13> also using ddnet's system.c with some functions thath were needed for zcatch, so I kind of wonder why it's not working 
18:48 <+jxsl13> system.c/system.h
19:15 <+jxsl13> (Ôæâ ¬∞Áõä¬∞)Ôæâ ÂΩ° ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
19:15 <+Learath2> no errors?
19:16 <+Learath2> find the io_open and work from there, if the file isn't even getting created the io_open isn't being hit at all
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does the `teehistorian` folder exist in your teeworlds save folder?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with `downloadedmaps`, `demos`, etc.
19:30 <+jxsl13> it should be created in the folder where the binary is?
19:30 <+jxsl13> the is by default no such folder
19:31 <+jxsl13> there*
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where you downloadedmaps and demos folder is
19:42 <+jxsl13> ._.
19:42 <+jxsl13> .___________________________________.
19:42 <+jxsl13> xD
19:42 <+jxsl13> https://i.imgur.com/SFDtpVG.png
19:44 <+jxsl13> where or how do I change this to the default folder, where the binary lies
19:44 <+jxsl13> ?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these are some weird names
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it should be called sth like `c03081aa-186b-4ca4-9b5d-72e5d51edebb.teehistorian`
19:50 <+jxsl13> do I have uuids?
19:50 <+jxsl13> :D
19:50 <+jxsl13> no
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is a part that is not hard to add
19:51 <+jxsl13> I had it yesterday not working, so I deleted the uuids and now using server start timestamps
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„É¢„Ç´„ÉÑ„Äú„Äú„Äú> if everyone had his own id, it wouldn't be possible to steal ranks and you could ban by them maybe?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem is when you start creating a subtly incompatible format üò¶
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can change the folder it writes to by using a `storage.cfg`
19:53 <+jxsl13> ... you told me yesterday to delete the uuid stuff, cuz I needed to fiddle with the python scripts ._.
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. not this particular one, the rest are fine
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry :/
19:54 <+jxsl13> which now format do you exactly mean now?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll see how to re-add it to the mod
19:54 <+jxsl13> -now 
19:55 <+jxsl13> how to extract he raw data?
19:55 <+jxsl13> and read it :O?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2 has a tool that can convert it to json
19:56 <+jxsl13> how do I compile the teehistorian rust project?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> go to the tools directory and execute `cargo build --release teehistorian_dump`
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can also give you the executable if you want
19:57 <+jxsl13> macosx
19:59 <+jxsl13> installing rust:D
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://rustup.rs/
20:00 <+jxsl13> brew :D
20:00 <+jxsl13> mega nice
20:01 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991 -> https://i.imgur.com/CCpgFVq.png
20:02 <@heinrich5991> `cargo build --release --bin teehistorian_dump`
20:04 <+jxsl13> no cargo.toml
20:04 <+jxsl13> :c
20:04 <+jxsl13> ls
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> go to the `tools` directory
20:04 <+jxsl13> hm :O
20:16 <+jxsl13> rip magic :c
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> x
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rip magic?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the executable is in `target/release/teehistorian_dump`
20:34 <+jxsl13> diesnt work, magic is wrong, I suppose I need to learn black magic
20:34 <+jxsl13> doesn't*
20:35 <+jxsl13> manipulating the header and adding a fake uuid didnt help :c
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is the current source code in the repo?
20:48 <+jxsl13> yes, teehistorian branch
20:49 <+jxsl13> @heinrich5991 
20:49 <@heinrich5991> checking it out
21:27 <+jxsl13> https://files.johnbehm.de/share/99aecd84c5eddb1a42db35e0b30e10a15180c0b35920b329b92ea372f4df37a6
21:27 <+jxsl13> test teehistorian file
21:27 <+jxsl13> that was created with my version 
21:30 <@heinrich5991> I'm currently fixing stuff :P
21:30 <+jxsl13> nice nice :D
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> compiling chromium takes so long wtf :/
22:41 <@heinrich5991> how would that sqlite format look like, jxsl13?
22:41 <+jxsl13> much like your json
22:42 <+jxsl13> maybe with nick names 
22:42 <+jxsl13> and only input 
22:43 <+jxsl13> player_change <- is that player mobement?
22:43 <@heinrich5991> yes
22:43 <@heinrich5991> basically only in there to check whether the replay is correct
22:43 <+jxsl13> ah, ok
22:43 <+jxsl13> I think that's too much info x)
22:44 <+jxsl13> the tick part is cool and input, i suppose
22:44 <+jxsl13> what's the duration of a tick at max?
22:44 <@heinrich5991> the duration of a tick is 0.02s
22:45 <@heinrich5991> 1/50 s
22:45 <+jxsl13> hm k
22:46 <+jxsl13> I wonder if an own sqlite table for every player is too much for the db to handle
22:46 <@heinrich5991> why not a column for the player? ^^
22:46 <+jxsl13> yeah, first thought
22:47 <+jxsl13> {"tick":3647,"item":{"type":"drop","cid":0,"reason":""}},
22:47 <+jxsl13> 5da229be-4df5-432c-9d9a-3ddb3cfd02ff.teehistorian: Teehistorian(UnexpectedEnd)
22:47 <@heinrich5991> server not cleanly shut down?
22:48 <+jxsl13> maybe I'm missing stuff in my ctrl-c kill function
22:48 <+jxsl13> isnt Server()->OnShutDown() not enough?
22:48 <@heinrich5991> aaahhhhhh
22:49 <@heinrich5991> don't do that :o
22:49 <+jxsl13> hm?
22:49 <@heinrich5991> I'll fix the function
22:49 <@heinrich5991> don't call Server()->OnShutdown() from a signal handler
22:49 <@heinrich5991> in a signal handler you should do little to nothing
22:49 <@heinrich5991> e.g. set a variable ShuttingDown
22:49 <+jxsl13> :( ok
22:49 <@heinrich5991> that the main loop takes as a signal to shut down
22:49 <@heinrich5991> may I do that?
22:49 <+jxsl13> I have no problem, as long as it work :O
22:52 <+jxsl13> I think it would be wise to put the teehistorian initialization stuff in a function like mentioned in one of the comments to have it in one location(the appropriate class)
22:52 <@heinrich5991> to which branch shall I push?
22:52 <+jxsl13> teehistorian?
22:52 <@heinrich5991> ok
22:55 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: pushed
22:56 <+jxsl13> nice 
22:57 <+jxsl13> and something new learned :)
22:57 <@heinrich5991> :)
23:03 <+jxsl13> hm
23:44 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: ? :)
23:44 <@heinrich5991> hm?
23:44 <+jxsl13> nothing :D
