01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> A lot of servers seems to be down
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @snail ?
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ok, all servers appear to off when nobody is playing on them and didn't turn on back
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen uhm, did you do sth?
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> except for `Persian`, it's alive
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that fixes all of them
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> yeah, nicely done
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I got in top 10 today. after discussing it with others, it became clear why 😛 I misread the problem statement
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 congrats 😄
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I updated the server, nothing else
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks for the workaround @Learath2
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh yea, thanks for being around to fix the servers @Learath2
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe the middle of the night is not the ideal time for our scheduled server restarts
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think when I set that I used to be online around that time and could react, but not anymore
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what happened?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is it secret info 👀
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wanna know too o_0
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/786027814608568321
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why did that only recently cause an issue
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oof
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe a change in compiler
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sry? 😅
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ./DDRace64-Server_sql: symbol lookup error: /home/teeworlds/servers/libantibot.so: undefined symbol: mem_comp
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> error message was here
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> afaik i mostly used memcmp not mem_comp anyway
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *this, you can also see it in the pull request
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's my fault anyway, if you want to blame someone 😉
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's only an issue because I added the glue code
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh what was it?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont want to blame someone i was just hoping i didnt fuck something up again lol
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just woke up :P
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently the compiler stopped exporting `mem_comp` from the binary for the shared libraries
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> gm
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but `libantibot-noby.so` used it and couldn't find it
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `1-rdynamic` exports all the public symbols again
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-rdynamic` exports all the public symbols again
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> usually it uses a heuristic at build time which symbols to export
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, how can the compiler not export that? It's a symbol with external linkage no?
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it only exports those used by the shared libraries it can see at build time apparently
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that doesn't work for our setup where we only give the actual binary to the program at runtime
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, is that even a legal aasumption to make?
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why cant we use memcmp instead
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't feel like tracking down every function we use from the main binary ^^
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i meant bcs its string.h standard fn
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, did you find a way to fix it?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or is it a compatibility thing
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3391
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> huh smart
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `libantibot-noby.so` -> `libantibot-nobo.so`
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not my fault :pepeH:
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah github dark
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so many years
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used it for 1 minute and went back to white 😄
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen took me a couple minutes to figure out what was even happening. We should prolly add something to run64 to stop trying to restart and warn us
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is there a way to save backtrace and restart the executable
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I like the new dark modd
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby search for "coredump". they're usually saved when a program crashes
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try it with a simple C program that crashes
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I wouldn't necessarily stop, but at least warn sounds good. But an email per failed run would quickly explode 😄
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already have coredumps but I don't think this caused a coredump
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or I couldn't find one anyway
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, it's not a crash when it doesn't even start
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it starts
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it only detects at runtime that symbols are missing
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure how it quits
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need to be smarter than 1 mail per fail :D
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use https://healthchecks.io/ for this kind of monitoring (e.g. for certificates, or teehistorian downloads)
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I get a single telegram message when a job has not completed on time
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and no more until I fix it again
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I self-host it)
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we  could monitor the servers with twping
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ping everything in serverlist once a minute or two
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This would have taken down all the servers and we wouldn't get a single warning about it :P
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean with our current system no warning?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you have experience with prometheus/grafana or similar monitoring btw?
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to set something up for my servers, but it all looks so complicated 😄
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, I never did much with larger scale system administration
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We use grafana at work, works ok
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I think grafana usually uses a backend, what do you use? prometheus? influxdb?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just use grafana, I didn't it up actually 😄
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *set it up?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My keyboard is breaking, hopefully it's just the cable
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i used graphana once too
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 it supports various "data sources"
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> am i reading this wrong? it sums 15 to 40 to find the invalid number, but then it says the range is from 15 to 47
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786167645506502656/unknown.png
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this a error on their part?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or what im understanding wrong
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AH
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok i see
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm i should read better
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not first and last its lowest and highest
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my assumption xd
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I aspire to one day wake up and actually be fully rested... I'll leave aoc to the night
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u go to sleep rly late
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doing aoc in night might even worsen that
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991  <https://github.com/edg-l/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day9.rs>
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what u think
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any improvements today
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `&Vec<i64>`
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first thing I see in the code 😄
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have tried sleeping at every possible hour past 2200 until 0500. I don't even set an alarm anymore, still doesn't work
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ahhh
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really wish humans had jtag
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im so used to not using bare arrays
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i went tosleep at 23:30 and woke up at 9:30
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sleep like a baby
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @heinrich5991 CentOS is dead now so you can finally drop CMake 2.8 😄
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=CentOS-8-Ending-For-Stream
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea I saw that @Comrade 😄
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wow
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what did you do?
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the lengths people go to convince ddnet to change their cmakelists.txt
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> killing of distributions…
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i just happened 😄
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> outdated distros*
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it just happened 😄
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I have bad news ^^
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is only for centos 8
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the outdated distros were centos 6&7 IIRC
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CentOS 7 will stick around in a supported maintenance state until 2024.
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> RPM distros are bad anyway (no offense)
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> centos 6 maintenance ends this year
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho ppl like fedora
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my first vpn i had was centos 6 i think
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt know much about linux
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I heard good things about fedora, some friends of mine use it
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but centos lacking lot ofp ackages
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made the experience worse
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i never went back to using such distro
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Centos is the oddest distro I've ever used
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is a distro being that stable ever wanted? Systems stuck in the past have aaaalways caused issues
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe banks use it
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> they use RHEL/SUSE i think
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess if all the software you run is in-house/private you could afford to stick to a decade old version of your distro
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki rest looks good to me. some nits: instead of returning the wrong result 0, I'd use `unreachable!()` or `panic!()`
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do some companies make their own distro?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unreachable macro
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never heard of that
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like that your code is not using a quadratic algorithm for the first part, like mine
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doubt anyone would bother with rolling their own distro
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always knew the trick with the hashset
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki That doesn't sound reasonable. I know SAP works together closely with SUSE for their SLES distro for example
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the city of munich rolled their own distro
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but went back to microsoft after some microsoft promised to put some HQs near munich
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but went back to microsoft after microsoft promised to put some HQs near munich
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love corporatism
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Windows will become a Linux distribution in a few years anyway 😄
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The illusion of meritocracy is so annoying
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meritocracy?
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> forking whole distro to change a few things... no wonder we have this mess 😄
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > a political system in which economic goods and/or political power are vested in individual people on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than wealth or social class.
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> microsoft doing that by using its wealth is meritocracy
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or did i understand wrong
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn debian is used by a lot in that graph
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah if one would consider just the merits, they would use linux for things like this. Then microsoft comes in with their fat stacks of cash, and breaks the illusion that there is any meritocracy
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Comrade yeah, I think it's better to look at the package manager. Ubuntu & Debian I mostly consider as the same for example
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ok
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ubuntu is a better integrated debian :P
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it might actually be easier to use windows for the city
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What were they using it for?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since every office worker is trained in microsoft office and not in libreoffice
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> updated my solution
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then it might also make sense to break that cycle if you think longer-term
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but as of today, you learn microsoft office in school (at least in berlin)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (this is for the Windows as a Linux distro argument: http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know openoffice is outdated, but their creators refuse to recommend the usage of the updated libreoffice
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah for user facing stuff idk. I was thinking about dumb displays, where windows is just a silly silly choice
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki yes, see me not using openoffice in my sentence 😄
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you know the drama behind that? I never looked into it
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw it once on reddit
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Ryozuki Oracle... 😄
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sun donated it to the apache foundation
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a dying project there, too few contributors
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they refuse to let it die there though, and refuse to recommend libreoffice instead
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ja0q8v/open_letter_from_libreoffice_to_apache_openoffice/
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2020/10/12/open-letter-to-apache-openoffice/
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found it
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At least there the situation is rather clear. For mysql/mariadb it's more chaotic, where MySQL has some features & bug fixes, MariaDB another set, but none is clearly better
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but openoffice still has brand value
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i use postgresql these days
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw libreoffice works about as good as visual studio. It had been a while since I've seen software that slow
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> libreoffice handles pasting images rly bad for me
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always end up using g oogle docs on the web
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you're running it in the wrong environment
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it runs fine on my parent's debian and on a windows 10
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but for anything serious i use LaTeX
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but on my arch linux it's reaaly slow
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> latex best
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Possible, it runs awfully on my mac, a little better on linux
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> disabling spellcheck and changing some weird config options related to rendering alleviated the issue a little
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u know what runs horrible too? eclipse
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's not become "usable"
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's actually slower than running older microsoft office in a vm in either case :P
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> isn't some part of LibreOffice written in Java?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not a relevant part AFAIK
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't use excel, people ^^
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shame a fork or an alternative hasn't emerged
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is libreoffice calc as good?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never used excel tbh
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for my purposes it works
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess an office suite is an undertaking too large
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use it for editing csvs e.g.
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yea, think so, too
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some ppl solved AoC in excel
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use the cloud version of office for the rare occasion that I need office
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh, cloud < proprietrary software < open-source software
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uni has a subscription
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's gone, it's gone
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :justatest:
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On mac I have the mac version of office
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen running a rebuild of the servers already? or can I do it
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 one benefit of cloud is that you get performance. The cloud version of matlab works better for me e.g.
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> matlab is such a bad programming language IMO. are you forced to use it?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep forced. Awful language
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has inconsistent behavior in a lot of places that lead to wrong results instead of exceptions
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats a matlab alt
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> python&numpy
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they even feature the same function names
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about gnu octave
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> French unis switched their linalg courses to numpy a while ago
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only that their functions behave sanely in edge cases
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki octave is bug-for-bug compatible
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so not sane
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does that mean
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italy is always a bit behind the curve :P
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> berlin also uses numpy
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. the primitive type
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> numpy is mostly made with C right?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then exposed to python
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way to get good performance in pure python sadly
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the primitive type is an "at least two dimensional array of numbers" in matlab
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's "an n-dimensional array of numbers" in numpy
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not until they finally find a way to remove the GIL
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is trying to have its own stuff https://nalgebra.org/ :pepe_straight:
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho idk if numpy parallelizes. But the problems of linear algebra parallelize reeeaaally well
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the max function in matlab: it returns the max of each row in a vector. except if you only have one column. then it returns the max of that column
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like tf. it broke my code when I only had one datapoint
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the max function in matlab: it returns the max of each row resulting in a vector. except if you only have one column. then it returns the max of that column
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Matlab is really a goof when it comes to this stuff. It tries to behave how a "scientist" that doesn't know programming would expect it to behave
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 run already
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `23/23 servers updated successfully`
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kk
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you switch the symlink back?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should Iß
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe try to run one server see if that fixed it? :P
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it works on ddnet.tw
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or if you are feeling brave yeah, you can switch it all
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I tested it a couple of secs ago)
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tried one on GER2, works
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> switched all now
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice. ty 🙂
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still can't get my hands on one of the new ryzens :( I hate scalpers
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> let's wait for next generation - it will be even better 😄
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> there are still no good mainboards for Ryzens anyway i think
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill probs disappear from here soon :monkalaugh:
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786182353822810152/unknown.png
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 which one did you want to buy?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The 5800x is sometimes available in Germany (but it has the worst perf/cost ratio)
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 5950x
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd even set aside the money, never thought stock would be the issue :P
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> AMD is using 80% of their TSMC wafers to produce PlayStation & Xbox chips, so not much left over for their other business at the moment
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was also thinking of getting a ps5, those are also all gone
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only there was a way to enforce "one per person" on these times of demand
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Scalpers are making soooo much money
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are all buying with scripts too, so it's not even fair competition
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The usualy solution is a 24 hour entry which is restricted to once per person and then you do a lottery and the winners can buy it. But honestly I'd just wait it out until stock improves
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that does sound better
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also wanted to get a ps5
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but couldnt
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Boring C++ today: https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day09.cpp
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```cpp
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         std::cout << *std::min_element(&v[j], &v[k+1]) + *std::max_element(&v[j], &v[k+1]) << std::endl; // Part 2
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 👀
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have cyberpunk preloaded, hopefully my 1080 isn’t too out of date to run atleast at high. The game looks so nice, wouldn’t want a compromise
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 1080 runs it on high for sure
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it recommends a 1060 for high
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ rly looks ugly
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well beauty is both subjective and relative
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is beutiful
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_WotAlt:
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it looks relatively prettier than rust
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always found c++ and specially modern c++ to look rly ugly
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Modern c++ is pretty ugly. @deen’s solution doesn’t have much of it though
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, I tried to convert it to modern C++ and noticed that was making it even worse
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I just left it as I wrote it initially
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> is it rly ugly tho? Or just intimidating if your not used to it?
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> I always thought im just too nub for this crazy new c++
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides, modern c++ does get prettier when you omit the namespaces, it just looks cluttered mostly
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea cluttered
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> there has to be some advantage right?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++20 brings with it concepts that cleans up the ugliest part of the modern c++ syntax, the templates
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> is it harder to mess up or something?
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> deen dont u write modern c++ fulltime? tell me something nice about it
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really, it’s mostly a result of years of backwards compatibilty
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> hm
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The way it’s set up is really extremely flexible btw
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Coding for a toaster with only 1k of memory? You can replace the allocator e.g.
12:46 <+ChillerDragon> oh so the modern c++ still trys to run well on limited hardware?
12:46 <+ChillerDragon> i did not expect that
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the atomics that allow you to micro optimize
12:46 <+ChillerDragon> so the new c++ is not a tons of abstractions where you lose control?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s tons of abstractions where you can manipulate every part of it
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> i see
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It tries to cater to like everyone
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> but i rly never had the urge to learn it
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are some parts of the it just fly right over my head
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> i think @jxsl13 has the most c++ tw project as far as i know :D
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like execution policies
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/commit/c2693d52369dc36dd489010389de7e56993d96c4
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> std::string IP = {aBuf}; in tw code looks weird
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, or memory resources, who uses those and for what even
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can never learn 100% c++
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there will be always u dont know
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and thats not true for other languages
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast thats how i feel
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there will be always something u dont know
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ has too wide a usecase for someone to understand everything, such a complex beast
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786199617284079666/personal_learning_curve.jpg
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C I even know which parts of the standard relate to what behaviour. Even the standardese in The C standard is easier to understand
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Generally I have trouble reading the C++ standard
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 we use them at work. It's nice to have different allocators for different stuff, with different properties. And you can get statistics of what is using how much memory exactly
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And I think some people do have a full understanding of C++, but very few in the world probably
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what are they? I have a vague idea of what problem they are trying to solve, is it containers with different allocators containing the same type being different types?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I assumed you meant memory_resource s)
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, for me it's just an interface for an allocator
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to learn more C++17 and 20 this year. If I ever have free time and am not sleepy
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 if cyberpunk 2077 is in stadia does it mean they have a linux build?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stadia only good thing may be that games will be made on linux too
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me xd
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786210253061881876/19908860961553016899gol1.png
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it’s not known what stadia runs on, but I’d guess so, windows doesn’t have good support for the dozen gpus they run per server
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/ct67ur/vulkan_and_linux_support_in_cyberpunk_2077/
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, hadn’t seen we know what stadia uses now
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean if ur game uses vulkan linux support shouldnt be that hard
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does make sense tho, as said windows doesn’t like these applications
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as the post says they probs should only need to change the input and windowing to get it working on linux
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well thats making lot of assumptions
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would think they first made a linux build, then ported to stadia
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why wouldnt they announce the game on linux then
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because nearly no linux players, so who cares?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk , not cool enough news?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this circle of death
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no players -> no game -> no growth of players
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will never go out of this
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even the nicest developers don’t care about us 😦
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look ddnet
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddnet is linux first :P
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there isnt much cross incompatible code
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just abstract it first
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Porting is actually not hard at all, they just don't care as there is no money
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if u start the development thinking in crossplatform terms
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See how good it got when suddenly there was profit in sight with steamOS?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think it costs that much money
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> obviously remaking a non crossplatform would cost more money
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly steamos was a failure
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone and their mothers rushed to get linux ports, the drivers leaped an entire light year ahead
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope valve still works on this
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then yeah steamos failed and everything stopped
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well they work a lot of proton
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but proton is not native no matter what
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Borderlands 2 linux version is still like 5 patches behind
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i wish also valve made steam for linux better
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> currently u gotta install 32 bit librarys
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just for steam
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> libs*
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish steam in general got better. It's way too unnecessarily complex
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better than epic store
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why steam on linux needs 32bit libraries
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its cuz some old games
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u can rely on steam sdl
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not sure
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt know there was a forum
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> They do shit about some games:justatest:
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiWjanAdD3s&t=13m22s
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this was the darkmode announcement
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaツ> nice
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> lol
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> so cinnematic rofl
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> its ugly darkmode tho sadly i still use lightmode
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> compared to vscode for example its rly hard on the eyes somehow
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> i think its too dark bg
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaツ> u can only truly enjoy dark mode if it had an epic anime backstory with sacrifices of the evil and birth of the good
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I find it difficult to read too, it's really dark
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Compared to e.g. youtube, discord, firefox which all have a very similar tone of gray for the background
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think they plan to add more themes
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cute keynote and all but people have been requesting darkmode for what since github first launched? 😛 Funny how low the return on investment on that feature was that it was only done 6 months ago
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw, should we try github discussions for things that we keep discussing here that get lost or get “archived” in a meh manner in issues?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye lets try it
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> im not too sure if its cool but try for sure
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Chiller u cool
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> we could also use ddnet.tw forum :D
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ☕
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats ded
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> revive it
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, now that I think about it, it doesn’t really help people that don’t have gh accounts contribute to the discussion
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really shouldn’t have killed the forum on ddnet.tw ;P
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> it just makes us more dependend on microsoft
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> ye rip forum
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> last time we discussed this my proposal was a daily log of all discord channels
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> rip all the people who dont have discord
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We embrace monopolies here at ddnet inc. Windows server next
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> ye
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> when drop linux support?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I wouldnt log generao
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> General
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> add more irc bridges
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I often search for something and Discord search is horrible for me, I just want text
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> ye grep is bae
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen log of discord is nice to have but it’s not browsable like a forum. No topics no categorization
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ripgrep*
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And doesn’t let us continue long winded discussions like accounts
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> ye livechat is good for quick questions and memes
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s unreasonable for me to ask people to search the logs for our discussions on accounts each time it comes up but it’s also unreasonable for them to expect me to repeat everything every time it’s asked
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I doubt any kind of forum will work as long as ppl use discord
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> we should delete the ddnet discord server then :p
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can work, many communities have both forums and discord
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But a chat will always be the prefered way for ppl
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And its also our fault too
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We make dev discussions here
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And get lost
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> i search the logs of this channel here quite often tho
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> not all information is lost here
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discussions among us we can do in issues, prs and if we want longer winded ones gh discussions. I’m more concerned with decisions/discussions with community implications
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> among us
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> imo community should participate in pr and issue discussions
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> if the issue or pr has affect that users can notice
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> it should be announced on discord
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel like the polls we do in announcements are a good step, but we only give options there, so it’s not really a discussion
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> encuraging ppl to write and read comments on github is nice imo
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> no need for a seperate discussions github thingy
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> separate
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> aaa
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One thing with issues is that they get buried and discussion ‘“issues” are not really issues
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> could u provide an example?
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> never seen that being a problem
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lot of prs lately are things a user wouldnt even know notice
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> yea and in this case they should not be announced on discord
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> to not annoy users
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don’t know one in ddnet of the top of my head but oy and Dune had trouble with gameplay “issues” over in teeworlds/teeworlds
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Off*
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> hm
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway as I said, it doesn’t help much with the issue I’m concerned about
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like taste
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Community involvement
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The issue is community involvement?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It would be cool if github had oauth with discord
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> That way it would be ez
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> we can make a bot that replys to github issues :D
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> from ddnet forum and or discord
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The bot would get banned in a hot chat
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_WTFEyes:642733839973613598>
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is ravie not in here?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ravie ah, no I could tag you
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is it okay if I add your 0.7 skins to my client?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #off-topic
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :weird:
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 maybe make an accounts issue if we don't have one yet 🙂
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:

16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Drama inc
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xdd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People won’t create a github account to say anything, we would agree on a solution, implement it, then get flamed
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is no "solution"
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U cant cater to everyone
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 sure, but it would at least help us
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that we don't repeat our arguments to each other endlessly ^^
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @fokkonaut sure
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks alot!
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> why am i not able to start steam ddnet?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is anyone here using githubs cli? I'm interested in not needing a browser

18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @cagent hm, can you translate the german?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> sec
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> An error occurred while updating
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Read the docs :4Head:
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> (application configuration not available)
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For what?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't have access to the steam admin thing, @deen did we recently do an update or sth?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Github cli
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> i somehow fixxed the problem, thx
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Somehow? Mind sharing your steps for future reference?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> i mean
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> i just minimized steam
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> went in discord
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> and tried again after reading learaths message
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> then i worked
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Huh, perhaps you didn't finish downloading the game? Well, glad to see it's working again 😄
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 nope, should still work
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I don't see any errors logged anyway
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @cagent did you try uninstalling it and installing it again? I assume this is a Steam problem
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, it worked again, ok
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggestion:ddnet: 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> reduce crowding the  skins 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> by create  skins group by  color/design
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> result this=
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 1-more  tidy place  and easier for see
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 2-makers the skins can make more than one for same  a skin 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> with other color or design without been haveing problem

20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found another impossible to diagnose bug 😄
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Launching ddnet creates two windows, one stuck on my left screen, one on my right screen
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And this happens when I switch to borderless, the screens are not mirrored btw
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786320637354311710/20201209_205527_1.mp4
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the best part, it only happens if I launch the game at my full screen resolution
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works perfectly on smaller resolutions if I do borderless
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nice 5x5
