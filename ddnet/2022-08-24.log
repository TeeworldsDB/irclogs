00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he cant ruin it
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz this wont work
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With no official support from ddnet, kog or teeworlds, I really don't see it succeeding. The game is niche enough that most of the players that would be interested in it are already playing in one of those 3
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is always a possibility that he builds a completely new community around it though
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> Oh yeah, that's why we can't attract that many new players, we need NFTs! :greenthing:
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> nftCatch, capture as many players as you can but every time you get captured your stock goes down by 4%
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Souly
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> troll devs still gonna reject tho
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Possible
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> are there any automapper specifications out there?
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if I understand correctly, Teeworlds 0.7 has json file for automappers and DDNet has its own format?
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I found like three tutorials, but I thought you can add randomness into automappers and I didn't see that in those tutorials
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> maybe look into existing automapper rules for like generic tiles, there must be randomness involved somewhere
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> true, but some sort of specification would be great
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8886
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but i wouldnt say its explained well
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, it says 'outdated' just coz they went to the new format, not because things in the old format changed?
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> as far as i know the random feature should work the same
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> or at least be written the same way
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks!
03:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm thinking, how the editor uses Tool Tips is that it's embedded inside the button code. I don't know if I should do the same to the FontIcons section since there's also an instance of it in menus.cpp within a `CONF_VIDEORECORDER` section
03:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011804677526007818/unknown.png
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> We are not directly working on chain
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That's what the future if there will be security issues we're just going to use the payment structure at the moment only on bsv and later on on usdc when that is integrated into the system that will be using
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> It's like having a pizzeria pizzeria is like open source right
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Anyone can jump in and do the same thing but slightly different
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Correct.it Is building completely New Community around it.
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> As long as we play and wager money on usdc all should be good
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I did
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> New discord update on Android sux af
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> No native app anymore üò¶
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Electron
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they gave up
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> finally
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uh
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> "finally"
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this is the worst shit ever
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the native app worked perfectly
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> It's so laggy
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Omfg
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> For me it works lol
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I can't wait to have cfg files as customization for unique game entities
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> or for normal ones, so we can translate the tooltips
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i knew that they will kill their native
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> discord sucks
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Buy a better phone or something, idk
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Just because in theory it's less optimised doesn't mean it's worse
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's good enough
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Electron is garbage, and everyone knows it
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Just mention electron anywhere and people should vomit by default
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Buy a better phone, have a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G, it's way powerful enough, but discord still lag shit
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Weird
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Vscode is bad too? Lol
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Electron is the issue
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So what did the old app use?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Native android
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And it worked well
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> For me it works just as good as the old one
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Btw doesn't the new app use react native??
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://piunikaweb.com/2022/08/23/discord-app-new-ui-or-compact-design-criticized-by-many/
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> They probably didn't know about these issues lol
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It seems like like they're only present on some devices
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Also the new app probably only seems slower because of the new animations lol
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I haven't noticed any change
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok, vc buttons are laggy
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And images are bugged a little
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> These are the only issues i noticed
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So from my perspective it looks like people just dislike the new ui
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How on earth is this not an oxymoron? Less optimized = less performant = worse. It's like saying "Less good doesn't mean worse"
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I installed the old native one to make sure I wasn't imagining things and even just changing between servers is slower. It's a lazy port made as a cost cutting measure to unify their ios and android codebase so they can pay less engineers and outsource more
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Omg, you are right lol
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It is slower
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it's not unfixable thankfully. React-Native can compile most the js into bytecode through some project I don't remember the name of. If they spend some time properly optimizing this it can be salvageable
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They also need to make some native components, my older phone is suffering with the member list
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù üòÇ
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Use iOS noobs
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I won't pay apple
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Then enjoy laggy android
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> :brownbear:
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> iOS sux
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> android doesn't lag
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> only Electron
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> For coding yes
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I won't buy thier 20$ polishing cloth
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And i wont buy thier cloud storage
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Android isn't laggy, it's just modern app developers
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And i want to be able to install any app i want on my device
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Nobody said u should, but devices are worth of money. Anyone who says it‚Äôs not, just capping af.
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Hardware itself is *mostly* om
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But you can't even repair it
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thankfully soon you will be able to. New EU antitrust law coming up
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Your device isn't even your
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I had few dumb lags on brand new flagship Samsung phone, it‚Äôs obviously android. 
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Never had some issues on iPhone
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> ü•∏
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean obv when you have a constructor that has to manage only few devices while there's Google having to play with tons of different devices
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Apple also artificially kills alder phones
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Android is well optimized for all of that
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Are u sure? XD
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes it is
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh we are doing anectodal evidence day. I had a dumb issue with my ipad that bricked itself brand new when I turned it on, needed a PC to reset it
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Android isn't perfect but it's better than not owning your own phone
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Wtf
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Okay I give up
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> + apple giving new features
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that android has since 10 years lmao
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Classic android arguments
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not my fault your n=1 study of samsung phones (which is some of the worst bloated android experiences ever) didn't impress me
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <f.> welcome to PWA cancer
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <f.> xd
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Also iphones are expensive
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> They don't sell cheaper phones
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Only reason why people hate it. üòù
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> No
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Compare flagship iPhone from 2020 and Samsung flagship.
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah generalize so you can discard everyones arguments at once. Thanks boss
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Samsung is dying
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Doesn‚Äôt have a chance
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Some people just don't need such an expensive phone
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> samsung is dying
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I can‚Äôt argue with u, ur high level iq, it‚Äôs better to give up
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> who told you that lmao
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> samsung is top1 leader way in front of others
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> even apple is not the 1st company when it's about smartphones
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> @Learath2 that wasn‚Äôt sarcasm
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Apple is for rich people who will pay apple for literally everything
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple people have been saying android is dying for the last 15 years. It's just a common argument, never with a source
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I do agree that android has freedom for doing anything u want to ur phone. But my experience with it was bad
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See this is a sane argument. Why not just say this instead of sarcasm and generalizations?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> + on android & many constructors you're free to do whatever you want. If tomorrow u wanna flash a custom image, you can. if you want to root your phone, you can. etc... Only limitations of Android is when it comes about supporting different types of components. Like applications such as Snapchat that takes a screenshot of the preview of the camera.
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> apple always tell shit
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the last chip, when they said they're far more powerful than the best graphics card in the market
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they are like not even reaching 50-60% of it
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Only good argument can be privacy, but you can't trust anybody. So you can't trust apple too
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They do have a really cool chip though ngl. I wish Intel had just stuck with Arm instead of rolling the garbage that is Atom
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Apple literary kills older phones. That should be enough to completely cancel them.
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And I'd like to see how many people really takes care about their privacy without having instagram, facebook, tiktok etc..
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ios maybe block 3rd party apps from spying on you
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But apple still can spy on you
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And they definitely do that
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> They use your phone for tracking thier air tags
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the big idea. By preventing 3rd parties from tracking on their platform, they are effectively creating a monopoly on the metadata generated on their platform
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011943179286757386/unknown.png
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Tiktok logs ü§£
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's not like they care about your privacy at all
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Each 10 secs
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Android is only good for finding exploits
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> They just don't want others to have data from thier devices
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you can't do anything u want with ur phone
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> here I can
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> However, google does a similar thing too with Android. In this aspect there is no solution. Under a capitalist structure of the economy profits are much more important to a company then your privacy
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Iphones are more secure but it's more because you literally can do only stuff apple wants you to do
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Wdym
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> You can't install all apps
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Only the apps apple approved
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> That won‚Äôt be case anymore
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Cuz of EU
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And that's a good thing
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm so proud of EU. Taming the beast that is apple
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But they literally wouldn't do anything by themselves
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You still wont be able to tinker with the OS though. So that's the next step. Hopefully some EU politicians will get onboard with right to repair stuff which will help
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ofc it's not like thier hardware is bad
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I just want to own my devices
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> But why EU isn‚Äôt doing anything about TikTok logging data each 10 seconds for info about device location and other things?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone does it. That's the business model of the interweb
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Apple does that too btw
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple does it way less than android, atleast 3 years ago that was the case
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Well, you can't really know
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Google really agressively polls your device for location and stuff
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Thier os is closed source
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They monitor the amount of data going to google and apple on idle devices
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's how they tested it atleast in that one paper I read
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Blackbox testing"
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Android is open source lol
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Sure, google collects data
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But it's not on the system level
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I mean, I don know
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The kernel and the core is. The tracking stuff are built into google services stuff all android phones come with, those are closed source sadly
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yes, you don't have to use thier services
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Point is on Android. You can actually remove this stuff. Sure it'll be annoying, but you can, which is great
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Having the possibility is important imo
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yup
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And with apple you have no way of knowing what your phone is doing at all
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On iOS you can't downgrade at all. On Android when Samsung pushes a patch killing my phone, I can just roll it back
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> OS is something you should trust
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And you can't really trust anything that isn't open source
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, most people don't give a shit as evidenced by macOS + Windows market share
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I use windows too tbh
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But i know that's not good
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Windows collects data too
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only boot to windows to play some games that refuse to port or allow VMs and Wine.
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I wanted to install linux
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But i was scared i would delete something
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And brick my pc
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Lol
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It wanted some boot partition or something???
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bricking your pc is very very very unlikely, especially with a user friendly linux distro with an installer
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I know
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could accidentally lose data though if you are not careful
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Right
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Also i wasn't sure which partitions it was going to use
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you have a windows and linux boot media on hand you can pretty much be certain that there will be a way to fix your pc even if you mess it up
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Maybe someday i will install linux
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don't have much space for it
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is much more userfriendly nowadays, so you could give it a try sometime
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And idk if it's possible to install programs on other drives
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> problem with linux is when u have to mess with it after having corrupted files/data
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> eg when u have a kernel panic & have to diag why
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I would need someone to help me lol
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don't want to delete something accidentally
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just install it in a VM & google
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> google you have absolutely everything u need
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Vm isn't the same
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it is , if yuo wanna learn it
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> There isn't any data to loose
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes then destroy it, see what happens
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> xD
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly if you want to install it alongside windows, its not a bad idea to test in a VM
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Maybe if there was a way to simulate my real setup in a vm
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @pilonpl wait
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @pilonpl https://distrotest.net/
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> try that, it's funny
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ho wait
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wrong websit
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually never use installers, I just dont trust that they wont nuke my other partitions on mistake üòÑ
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably just paranoia on my part
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bruh they removed it üò¶
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it was the right link, not the same website anymore
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> That's exactly what im afraid of
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can create disks and partitions and install windows before you try linux
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ill try that
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Virtual box is slow
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly my paranoia is based on installers of 10 years ago. I'm sure they are much better now
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Probably
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I have backups
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But restoring backups is annoying too lol
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @pilonpl u can try vmware workstation tho
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Is vmware better?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I think it's not open source
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> both works fine for small testing
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Virtual box is
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes it's not
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On consumer hardware they will perform about the same if I recall correctly
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They both use hardware virtualization nowadays
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Qemu is the best
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> who needs virtualbox when you have 2 SDDs which you have Windows on one, Linux on another installed
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :greenthing:
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I have one ssd
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Windows is so big lol
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is my setup too
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :greenthing: pog
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With that setup though the only hard part is getting the boot things right
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So ill try to simulate my setup lol
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Cellegen | RiH who needs SSD when u can load linux into ram & hf with it
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Cellegen | RiH who needs SSD & virtualization when u can load linux into ram & hf with it
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I think i still have windows image
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I needed a bios extention which made booting decent, not the typical F9 into choosing which ssd to run
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> diskless instances :gigachad:
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Btw there is a very cool android app, termux
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually bootstrapped a netbsd installation remotely this way. Couldn't mount isos and they didnt have a netbsd image, so I wrote the netbsd install media onto the start of the harddisk and booted that into ram üòÑ
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Its a terminal emulator
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I have my disk be separated into two images, one of them have my windows installer :kek:
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I have my ssd be separated into two images, one of them have my windows installer :kek:
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bsd for chads
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :uhoh: bruh
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I actually really love FreeBSD
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My very first OS other than Windows was FreeBSD
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's so powerful
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly no gfx card support is a no go for me
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm far too addicted to games
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I understand why it's so used when it comes to networking or nas etc..
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well linux improves everytime, so ig it's better now
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but still bsd was a good winner
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I am addicted to ddnet lol
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I only play addictive games
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddnet is like crack for some people. A subset of people just cant seem to ever quit
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Even tho it's not as exciting as the first hours
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I still like it lol
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Im addicted to Godot :gigachad:
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Open source ‚úÖ
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> + super flexible
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> you can write your own setup, option, classes, anything with plugins for each project. Just nice
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ddnet is my most played game on steam lol
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And probably will become the most played game ever
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Minecraft is probably first
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Quite possible
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> no minecraft on Steam :cammo:
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk why this game is so good
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's literally a bunch of random bugs and features meant to be used in a completely different gameplay
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> they could implement a steam account merge and make their client more flexible towards accounts that way
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> java sux
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yup
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> sort of, they change performance most of the time duo to java being java
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bedrock
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> edition
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :uhoh:
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Chat reporting
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well it's better, performance-wise
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Free capes
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> no, that version don't exists anymore, since the merge happened
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Cellegen | RiH wut
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> u mean bedrock edition?
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> also bs cuy bedrock had their own mechanics
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yeah they merged bedrock accounts
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes but it's still 2 different versions
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> sort of
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bedrock is written in C++ and works on many platforms
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> while you have the shitty java version in which you have to keep 15  different versions of java
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> while you have the shitty java version in which you have to keep 15  different versions of jre
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Oh, also spigot is cpp aint it?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> spigot is a fork of java
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> nvm then, looked much better, than the vanilla shit
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well all variants attempts to optimize it
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> paperspigot is better tho
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you won't run a good minecraft server without tuning your jre (passing arguments)
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> made a formal grammar of the automap file format bcs I intend to have syntactic coloration and errors checking, I haven't tested it tough I just made it from the source code
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I can send it if ur interested
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that would be really helpful!
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> there you go (may not be 100% perfect, as I said üôÇ
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011971626105061466/automap.md
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> lets do a ieee standardization for it, when rfc? ^^
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> aaah suuuuure üòÖ
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> comments are a bit useless lol bcs it ignores every unrecognized lines / end of lines anyway
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm fine with being stricter than the client
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> nice to hear that :yes:
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that would be a great addition to libtw/docs :)
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't think there is even a proper documentation for what the different thigns mena
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> for example, what is `NoLayerCopy`?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> not exactly sure yet, it makes a copy of the tiles layer but what does that imply concretely no idea
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm I have never touched automappers before üòÖ
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> wait wth is the `NOTINDEX -1` used in `basic_freeze.rules`
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah it is EMPTY || FULL basically, just always
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I would guess
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> whack
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> also whatalso what is the `NONE` in the indexlist, I can't find in any automapper files
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe I should start looking into the source ^^
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> No flags, which is different than any flags
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> the code is not too complicated for the parsing at least
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so NONE and Œµ have the same effect there?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> no, Œµ is any, I think
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aah, right
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> A thing that is a bit annoying I think (and confusion was discussed in #mapping ) is that XFLIP, YFLIP and ROTATE works like the map file format, but not like how the editor behave (e.g. ROTATE is clockwise, but rotating in editor is anticlockwise, and you can't use 2 ROTATE, there is no ROTATECCW etc.)
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I think also it would maintain backwards compatibility with the current automap files if we added support for that
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ... and xflip / yflip / vflip / hflip is a bit ambiguous
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in the MapDir format I represented the orientation with mirror: boolean, rotate: u32 (angle)
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> mirror then rotate ?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yup I think
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> that's great
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> but ur rotate is not enum?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well it gets parsed and only allows 0, 90, 180 and 270
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> hmm ok, I would still have parsed to an enum bcs only 4 acceptable values
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well it has the same effect, no?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its json there
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "x": 0,
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "y": 0,
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "id": 1,
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "mirrored": false,
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "rotation": 128
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thats a tile in the mapdir format
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *the fields of a tile
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> 128?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oop, I randomly wrote that number
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> not sure what my brain did there
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> haha see
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> NO, cuz you can make brain farts lol
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> heh in text format you can make errors with enums and number either way :p
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> only the conversion matters
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (I'd say at least)
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> yes actually I meant how you represent it in code, not json
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> you can have it represented as enum and parse from/to json as number
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> or whatever
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well its temporarely represented as `DirTileFlags`, but that struct isn't public. the MapDir format is just directly parsed into a `TwMap`
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> pub(crate) struct DirTileFlags {
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     mirrored: bool,
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     rotation: i32,
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> }
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ok then its fine
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> whatever criticism I do about twmap, you always have reasons behind it
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I hope the reason also satisfies the criticism ^^
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> it does

14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> who cares about social features? I just wanna have fun with my VR headset
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> being social is overrated, all you need is a dummy
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> -1 is outside the map
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> used for example for placing stuff along the map's edge
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Btw, there was an interview with John Carmack recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4 Haven't watched all of it yet, but the beginning had some fun parts from Masters of Doom book
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> that makes little sense to me and should def be documented somewhere
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @k2d222 that's how it works
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> jsp c'est o√π ?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are no tiles outside the map boundary but it's still useful to know if something is outside so they used -1 for it I guess
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> but the number refers to a tile index not a position
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's sometimes useful to check if a coord lies outside the map
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> could add a special keyword for that. I think I'll do a few backwards compatible PRs to enhance the syntax when I have time.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's fine tbh, but yeah automapper in general should be better documented
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I don't think FLIPX FLIPH ROTATE is a good way to rotate ccw from a user perspective
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I don't think FLIPX FLIPY ROTATE is a good way to rotate ccw from a user perspective
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe not but you can rotate a tile how you want in the editor and copy the flags into automapper so it's not that bad
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and after a while you remember it
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> meh, not that bad doesn't mean it shouldn't be improved upon. I don't think that's a good way to reason upon. It's a strong barrier to entry when things don't work the way you expect them to, especially when there is no technical reason for them no to
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> meh, not that bad doesn't mean it shouldn't be improved upon. I don't think that's a good way to reason upon. It's a strong barrier to entry when things don't work the way you expect them to, especially when there is no technical reason for them not to
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> meh, not that bad doesn't mean it shouldn't be improved upon. I don't think that's a good way to reason. It's a strong barrier to entry when things don't work the way you expect them to, especially when there is no technical reason for them not to
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> The way (at least for me) I learn a new tool is by trying what is intuitive and how things work in similar tools. When I tried the ddnet editor I was very displeased and frustrated. Nothing there is intuitive, even though now that I now where things are it's easy to navigate.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean, if the flags you write in the automapper don't match what you see in the editor it's still confusing
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> You could have both the flags syntax (FLIPX, FLIPY, ROTATE) and additional keywords for convenience, like ROTATE_CW, ROTATE_CCW
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> would also make sense to apply the flags in the order they are typed, e.g. if I write ROTATE FLIPX naturally I intend to rotate then flip
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> a problem with ROTATE_CCW is when you wanna rotate multiple times
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `Pos 0 0 INDEX 69 ROTATE_CCW ROTATE_CCW ROTATE_CCW`
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I don't think that stands. The editor mostly abstracts away how it is represented in the map files, e.g. you can rotate multiple times, which will change the flip flags accordingly. If you say that does not match the editor, that means the editor does not a good job of abstracting that concept.
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> people should not *have* to now how flags are internally used
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> how is that a problem?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> besides being redundant with just ROTATE
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well one thing is it's ugly but also I guess you have to change how automappers are parsed
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> not that much
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think before extending the current format, we could think about switching to json like vanilla first
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> simply because costum file formats are usually not preferable
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *custom
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> if we change the format i.e. introduce breaking changes then PLEASE review the syntax
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> instead of just translating it
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, at least for the ddnet extensions
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think it would be a good choice to be compatible with the teeworlds format, which has a subset of features
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and, like you say, think about the syntax before extending it
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> hmm in fact I would not be in favor for json, at least not in the current state. Sure, json is a *readable* file format but not really *writable*. Non-programmers cant write json, it's too restrictive (even programmers in fact). Before json, we would need at least an in-game automapper editor.
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> like did you know you can't have a comma after the last item in the list?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> and it's very verbose
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's not a good idea to change the format and make everyone's existing automappers obsolete
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> agreed. It works well and it is far from a priority imo
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> correct, changing would usually include having backwards-compatibility
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> however, because another format exists which *could* be more preferable, we should consider if switching would benefit us, before adding more features to the own format
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Patiga btw do you remember the tool that Pulsar showed you? it already kind of accomplishes everything while keeping compatibility
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://github.com/Aerll/rpp
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, but it is a different kind of tool
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it introduces yet another format for the automapper, which can be translated to the ddnet automapper format
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> wow this is over-engineering at its best üòÆ (looks seriously cool though)
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah I agree that the current format is easier to write by hand
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> imo it should've used a proper format from the start
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but its too late for that now I guess
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> Never too late‚Ñ¢
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe something writeable shouldve been used, not sure what formats are there for that kind of thing
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe toml

19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> two different prs that solve same exact problem huh
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> quite funny xd
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fokkonauts fixes generally the order of execution for non character entities
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i fixed unfair ::Move calls additionally, as they also make trouble
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but both fixes are needed
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we will never have this for ddnet maps, I wonder if this whole change would be better in a branch instead of making the code harder to make sense of
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well gamecore will never be changed anyway
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so why would it matter xd
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i say secretly apply weak hook fix to actual servers and see how many people complain
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyone with any sense of the game at a high level would complain about a proper entity physics order fix
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah notice but more about how many complaints there are
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> noticing and complaining go hand in hand for some
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> true
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i honestly don't know why people are reluctant to fix it though
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> most annoying 'bug' out of all current ones
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> because it would invalidate all ranks
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not true
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why not?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it doesn't really give a speed boost in any techniques other than flies and some overhead drags
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so it doesn't give a speed boost except for the most used fly technique, and that would not invalidate ranks?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i have troubles following your logic
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Everyone knows that teeworlds is a HUGE international game where every rank is pixel perfect and whwre everyone competes for a top spot

19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for most speedruns you don't need 2 speedflies in a row alternating tees
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> otherwise you can just plan beforehand to get the guy with strong on top
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so weak doesnt have an effect in the fly
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and yeah
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it does, you need a weak and a strong to fly correctly. Two strongs or two weaks won't work the same way
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Just this year every rank got ACTUALLY invalidated compared to ALL previous ranks thanks to the discovery of pseudofly
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> speedfly worked the same for me with the fix
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Deleting weak has virtually 0 effect on ranks compared to that
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, as jupstar said, my fix is for the issue i made and also linked in that commit
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5769
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> physics change in combination with other entities
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> exactly, thats what i was saying aswell in one issue
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cuz the fix didnt involve two actual strongs
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the tee bouncing is not fixed yet, only the hook strength
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i just don't understand why people want to get rid of a game mechanic instead of mastering it
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its definitely nice for other gametypes
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> such as block, gores..
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> counter-intuitive, unsatisfying
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wym master weak
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its just not fun
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it makes no difference imo, you just need to think about who's driving
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah so removing it shouldn't make a difference either
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> other than just making a lot of things easier
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if both players hook each others at the same time the order also matters again
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs both characters apply force to the other character
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want to make it 100% fair u have to break physics for weak and strong
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why dont u listen to chairn or me
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4575#issuecomment-1226009249
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This alone invalidates your argument of "just remove it it wont make a difference"
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @louis
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> there aren't that many maps that depend on it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xddddddddddd
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why not just fix weak properly for new maps going forward but enable it as a legacy feature in currently released maps
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean i see the first point
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but can u be more specific by what u mean by that
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats. Not. Possible.
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think there are many maps that depend on it
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think there are many maps that will be broken with any fix
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is the least issue, it could always be enabled for new maps only
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the issue is that its simply not possible to actually fix it
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why not lol
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Look
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nothing that a big ole if statement can't fix :troll:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> Ain't no bug yo can't squash
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its possible as long as its a 1 tee hooks another situation
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not if multiple hooks are in
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so for gores the fix is good enough
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ddrace with many players maybe not already
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It's not possible because hammerfly also relies on the weak collision of the hammerer
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so it would change the whole thing
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if everyone collides strongly now
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah and for bounce its bit harder true
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the problem are the bounces @Ravie
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not the hook strength
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> fix them too ü§∑
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats not possible, as i said
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just learn to read properly
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not impossible, we write the code. If you are willing to break old ranks or only fix it for new maps
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes but its defs new physics then
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, but still, it would be a different feeling if both tees collide strongly while hf
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> = physics change
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> = not wanted
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, if we are willing to do that we can definitely do it
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we willing we can also drop macos and windows support xdddd
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> people can get used to new physics as long as it's not radically different, a good example is new hammer
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we only do it for new maps then we won't break ranks either, but I doubt many people will enjoy the new physics
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But thats not a real physics change
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats just a gameplay change
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might feel way too different after we are done fixing all the physics asymmetries
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does kog use your fix @fokkonaut ?
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or 0.7 style
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I use 0.7 style? :D
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> KoG uses some other fix
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I actually did a both strong collision fix locally, it wasnt working perfectly, but hammerfly was way different, every few hits you would get a higher hit cuz of the bouncing
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I really wouldnt mess with that, I would rather go for "player who hooks first has strong"
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I can see that happening
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> strong bounce*
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> With the config being enabled I would make strong hook for everyone and strong bounce for the first hooking player of two each
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That would do least trouble and fix 99%
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> & would change behaviour when it comes to flying
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <feltis> Why you guys want change this if people dont want it? https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/420565311863914496/800298947939401748
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It would just need to be implemented properly, throughout the whole code that does colliding & hooking
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either way. Eventhough I don't like the asymmetry, I wouldn't touch it with a 6 foot pole. It changes a lot of the feel of the game and the current physics just feels great
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> F3
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> except weak hook
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and some occasional ID bugs
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and probably a few other things
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well asymmetries bug developers, it's a bug we want to get rid of bugs. However, as you can see people didn't want it so it wasn't touched
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> that suggestion wasn't the same as removing weak
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it was just a rly jank way of avoiding weak
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's also extremely unintuitive to new players. E.g. when falling sometimes hooking the tee below you will stop you both, sometimes it won't. No explanation of it visually whatsoever
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bounces and stuff are even more unintuitive than the hook, some hidden variable changes how high you bounce when you fall onto a tee üòÑ
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> plus this discord is filled with oldies so obviously the vote will be biased quite a lot
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3517
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This does the bouncing based on who hooks first
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It's probably not implemented correctly throughout the whole code, but it's some sort of PoC
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc should be implemented with config option
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it atleast change the order permanetially once u hooked first?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else its even more mess xD
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i hope
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it looks like
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to do a poll about people using old versions and see why they are sticking to them
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ppl believe in ghosts
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nothing more to say
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sp someone told me he sticks to ddnet 14 cuz he doesnt want all the bloat like steam video recorder and discord xsdxdd
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to see if there are some blocking issues with our client that we can fix
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u and me are 100% honest, if we just abandoned old verisions.. shutdown all services they might update
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u either force it, or there will be ppl who dont care
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a friend used an old version for 3 years bcs he was too lazy to press update
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> On my server I only allow version starting from... let me lie... i believe ddnet 14. And I dont do all of the backwards compatibility that ddnet does, I support latest release 100%, everything below I wont promise works without problems (there shouldnt be big issues, but smaller inconveniences might happen)
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would also bloat our code less
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we do so many branches for old versions only
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, other admins believe in backwards compatibility for eternity. I wanted to do the poll to see if I could get them to accept a cut-off maybe
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like we only support the last 3-4 majors
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I do a little compatibility code, for example for the switchstate stuff
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think deen is 50:50, heinrich is 100% backward
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cuz people with older clients would just dont see the doors otherwise xd
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am for 1 major change every 2 years xd
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats more than enough support
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We really need a client capabilities message, so the client can tell the server which features it supports. Doing it based on clientversion is so bad
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uhm i think this will end up with new pseudofly
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> new physics can change flying part at all
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also predictions
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> don't forget about them
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Aren't predictions based on *physics* ???
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> LOL
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> try to hammerfly on kog servers
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u will see that tees are teleporting after every hammer
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Predictions have nothing to do with that
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Probably
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why would they
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if there was no prediction at all they would teleport every n ms
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> after every packet reach
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> predictions depends on game physics
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yes, that's the point
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u cant predict falling from top without knowledge about vertical speed
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Server side physics should be the same as client side physics
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there is no physics in client
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the gamecore is shared, so there is physics in the client
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> there has to be
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah sure
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> The game wouldn't work without a physics engine
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it can
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and u would have pure client
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you do cl_predict 0 you can see what it'd look like if the client doesn't know anything about the physics
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> localhost + cl_predict 0 <3
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Predictions only predict inputs, right?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they predict every entity in world
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> that u see of course
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Antiping predicts even more than vanilla
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Physic engine should always be active lol
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Some sort of predictions always have to be active
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i reread ur sarcastic question
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and only now realized what did you mean
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> The game always has to predict the physics
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And you can't disable that
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Right?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u can
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cl_predict 0
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> You can only disable predicting inputs
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its ALL entities predictions off
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> try it urself
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's not possible to disable from the settings
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> f1 -> cl_predict 0
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But it's not in the settings
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> There is no point in disabling it
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u asked "can i" i said "yes u can"
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> whats the point of ur question then
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Physics are 100% deterministic
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> quantize after and before every packet reach
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok, you can but that's not meant to be disabled
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its meant to
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there is if branch with g_Congig.ClPredict or somewhat
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Isn't the game extremely laggy with that off?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> g_Config*
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yep
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Anyways, if you change the physics you aromatically updates the predictions too
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> afair client does some extra calculations and prediction code needs to be touched after major physics change
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but i don't know is it right
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if Learath is still here he will answer xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Probably not, that doesn't make any sense
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why use extra stuff if you already have the thing?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I think we should delete weak hook
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's not fun at all
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lets delete wallhammer also
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And it doesn't change all that much
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and edge hooks
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Wallhammer is fun
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bunch of bugs
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Edge hooks are fun
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cuz client stuff and server stuff are not identical
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Physics have to be the same
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they're same
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but client reacts this way
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and server reacts either way
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then i don't know why ddnet needs prediction folder in src/game/client
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lightweight version of ph. engine
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Maybe for predicting inputs
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> inputs are in gameclient.cpp
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yay trml will tell us the truth <3
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk, source code is complicated
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And i don't speak c++
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> physics are not separated from the rest of the code, thats why there are currently two copies of much of same code
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Interesting
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Isn't that a bad *code* design?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> but largest problem is perhaps not changing the code but backwards compatibility with older clients who run old physics (if you change anything)
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So physics should be as much isolated as possible
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So it's easy to change it
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, but teeworlds was designed not to have prediction (for anything outside the gamecore)
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So we need a rewrite, nice
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> ideally it would have been written with separate physics code originally, but perhaps it was not considered important then
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yup
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> only after abandoning old client support i think
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> (also vanilla tw still doesn't predict most of what ddnet does)
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> If we want to have multiple physics instances we probably need to isolate that
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> standard ddnet prediction is vanilla stuff + ddnet stuff (freeze draggers and so on) isnt it
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or you mean antiping this way
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Antiping predicts inputs
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, movement/jump/collision/hook/etc = vanilla, grenades/pickups/other entities=ddnet
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And granade paths for some reason
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk actually
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It predictis something ok? Lol
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> pilonpl try to surf code once
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or try to make your own mod
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ill try
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u will understand every part of tw after that
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> on the physics side, vanilla has everything ddnet does except grenade/laser/pickups/freeze and ddnet entities/tiles
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (beside render backends)
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Where should i start lol
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> src/game/server/*
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I want to contribute at some point i think
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> try to remake /r
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its still buggy
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok, so which file is the most important lol
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> character.cpp afair
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Would be great if there were comments
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Or something
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Completely depends on what you're trying to do
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Well
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Understand the code
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don't even know c++ but ill figure it out hopefully lol
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats tough then xD
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yup
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I know
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> gamecontroller.h/cpp and gamecontext.h/cpp
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do you code in general?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So maybe ill find chat commands
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> most important for server i think
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And find /r
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I dont think there is anyone who understands 100% of the code, so better to focus at one part at a time
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> src/gae/server/ddracechat
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> \r ?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk even
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> gae
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'd say I understand and have worked with most parts of the code already, but antiping is definitely up to you my friend :)
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> logic of /r should be inside character.cpp
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Great
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Also why is the GitHub app so bad
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> They had only one job
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> don't use mobile apps
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Make it easy to browse the code
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ddnet code specifically
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> firefox + github.com is nicer
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Also there is no search feature
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Wtf
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I found SetRescue
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I sometimes think I understand most of the code until I look up the snapshot packing system, graphics pipelines, etc
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xDDDD
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok true
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but those are more special parts haha
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> of course^^
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> snapshot packing was explained by heinrich in libtw2
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or not
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i remember libtw2 helped a lot in try of understanding snaphots
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> nice
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Wtf does this code even mean, what are these variables and what is "this"
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012077009750466560/image0.jpg
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I found rescue
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> what languages do you know? C++ is object oriented (CCharacter is a class, "this" is the object), it also has pointers like in C ("this" is a pointer here)
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Well
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I know what oop is
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don't know how pointers work tho lOl
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "this" means the instance of the class
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> pointers are sort of like references. like "do something with x" instead of "make a copy of x and then do something with that copy" (x could be a value, an object, etc)
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @pilonpl CCharacter is a class, imagine a Class being a factory, and it produces robots, "this" literally means the active robot
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is explained  for dummies
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok, i know now, i didn't know it was a class
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> There is also this -> notation
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> What the m_ means?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read a bit
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012079248007254017/unknown.png
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Oh nice
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> its shorthand for "member", to indicate that its a (member) variable stored in an object. but it's just a convention to call the variables "m_"
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> oh, we have documentation
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda yeah
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you want to add feel free!
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> nice, will take a look some time
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Smart naming
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ok, so CCharacter represents every tee
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> the "->" (defererence operator) gets the value pointed to by that pointer (rather than the memory address the value is stored at). but the C/C++ pointer syntax was unintuitive for me for a quite a long time when learning C...
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> This is so complicated lol
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Would be easier if i knew more about c++
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, and most of the tee physics happens inside "CCharacter::Tick()", which is called by the server every time the physics is stepped forward one step
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> same, but i decide to code here anyways
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And wtf is a friend class
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I can use google ofc
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it represents the body
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka it only exists when the tee is alive
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Sure
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Makes sense
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then there is CPlayer
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it stores data that lives through the tee death
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Interesting
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/player.h
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> CCharacterCore*
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, but CCharacterCore::Tick() is technically called from inside CCharacter::Tick(), so I just skipped the details:P
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah xd
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im sorry then
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> nono np^^, u are technically correct too
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also is it possible now (after adding weakhook patch) parallelize physics?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> is it possible to do something like this in vote-menu?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012084832303591474/8ec929ba00bcc440.png
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and after some kind of experiment i can say that server can handle 256 players/characters but client not
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I think some steps like ::Move() cant be parallelized, but perhaps the rest can (havent looked at the patch yet)
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah im also
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but if its "right" patch (making copy of current world state and move charavter in it, but maybe its not right at all xd) i think it can be parallelized
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> possibe: yes
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> someone doing it: not high chance xd
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> development is rather slow currently ^^
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean yea but that would involve downloading the map image
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can make it optional if you will implement it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so no problems :p
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> the real thing is to do in game map filter
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> median time top time stars and so on
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we just need electron
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to make something like this, but other people weren't into the idea I had
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to fetch the listing and the images from an external api, other people wanted it to happen in the game protocl
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> protocol
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> poll?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Api would be better
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I made this long ago
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012091049323266048/rect834.png
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> That's very nice looking!
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Omg
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> No one needs that
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But would be cool
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I am talking about kobra maps ofc, the new ui is totally useless
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Lol
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Btw i kinda understand how /r works
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tbh i really wanna help with UI overhaul. it feels like we're at a point where ppl want one
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I think we need accounts more
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> You don't use the ui all that often
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> There was a HUD update lately
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the map browser thing is aesthetically nice
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> That's what you see all the time
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but yeah accounts + profile ui would be cool
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think demo ui could be improved
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and editor ui
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk if corners should be rounded
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Rounded corners look childish i guess
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Lol
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if i had a paid figma account i would want  to get a bunch of ppl together and actually start brainstorming UI ideas
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends on the amount of roundings
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> figma nuts
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Windows 11 broke everything
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw anyone wanna make tee character mod in rivals of aether
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Before win 11 i would consider rounded corners bad
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i agree. a little rounding isnt bad, but if it gets too rounded then it becomes problematic
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Discord does it well
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yup
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> api better
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> We need windows
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm also not a fan of too much rounding but had to match tw style
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Like in openttd
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also I think I'm done replacing all the demo_button type images with font icons. Chairn said for me to add in a tooltips bar at the bottom of demo player but that's irrelevant for the PR
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It looks like a roblox game
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and ddnet roundings are the worst
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012094480272334949/unknown.png
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> at least teeworlds/ddnet has its own ui style which makes the roundings tolerable, but all apps with rounded corners nowadays look like some electron trash
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think it's because of the transparent backgrounds
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well css allows anything u want
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont know how that is considered trash
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> electron is trash bcs its like 900mb and uses 2000 tb RAM
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I just noticed that visually many apps and websites nowadays overdo rounded corners to a disgusting degree, especially electron apps
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Give an example
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> discord
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> circles everywhere, disgusting
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> discord desktop is fine but mobile version is definitely a lot more rounded
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Circles are ok
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this looks clean IMO
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012095425060294806/scoreboard.jpg
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> oh wow I jsut realised discord had circles
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Maybe something beside discord
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've no idea what game that is xd
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> overwatch
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> blur ugh so 2009
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> a little bland
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not useful for ddnet
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but that's mostly about colors, I would make it pop more
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I like the ui in openttd ngl
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012096567823564840/image0.png
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Gmod
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Too white
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bit more padding between the elements
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also color choice is rather bad imo
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Fellow openttd enjoyer
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah thats also an issue with ddnet, everything is too big
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wastes too much space
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Too big?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Interesting
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I always thought everything was too small
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Especially text
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tw vs my ide
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012097176912003182/unknown.png

22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can read both fine enough
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not an issue if more space isn't needed
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> your ide is TINY imo
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have to use full resolution ofc
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd defs merge filter into server details, the user stuff is way too big
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Another game
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012097549533974559/image0.jpg
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Not Keks is your screen big? cause I guess desktop programs are dpi aware and tw isn't
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the search exclude etc wastes too much space too
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ide is way too small for me
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes thats true, and yes it is big, but tw is even big on my phone xD
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its simply oversized
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> for example on my laptop screen stuff isn't that big at all
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Another not very popular game
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012097941336498206/image0.jpg
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Wtf even is that lol
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It looks like it was made for mobile
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess tw ui was developed for 800x600 displays so naturally it works better on smaller screens
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> tw was developed when HD screen were not a thing yet
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was developed on c64 with 120x60 pixels i cannot explain otherwise
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was indeed 2 years before the smart phone revolution came üòÑ
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Imo the ui is good enough
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it looks good, bcs of the background map xD
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But maybe i am too *new* to this game
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> turn it off and it sucks xD
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I mean yeah, its not very good but you look at it only for a minute or something like that
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Haha I actually did something at some point that made me not have the bg map on and i was like "wtf is this shit"  :kek:
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nice idea
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> turn tw into visual studio
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> new tab
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Has anyone made black apple in tw?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I made a concept UI a bit ago about a revamped demo player. I do agree, it looks better within the context of DDNet. On its own, it's way too.. rounded at the sides.
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012099784229781504/unknown.png

22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yesss, windows
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Let's use imgui
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd already be happy if our ui components would have better logic, its always annoying to code with them
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also we have no real dropdown etc. that sucks xD and making one is actually hard bcs immediate mode sucks for stuff like that XD
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont have what DOM has with bubbling mouse events etc
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Imgui
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it wouldnt be so ugly xD
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Let's make teegui then
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok nice
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah keeping state is annoying in immediate mode
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but presentation state never disagreeing with logic state is so pleasant
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well then use react ^^ thats the whole sense of that framework
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but sadly javascript
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so 900MB extra xddd
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd love to make some generic wrappers for some of the stuff one day
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Every single thing on the UI has it's own way of doing state
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah i'm noticing how inconsistent the UI rendering process is
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i don't think i'm helping with my newest PR xd
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ill try to compile my own ddnet client
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Or server
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Whatever
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Another ddnet client wouldn't hurt i guess
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I will add a new command
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> That prints a message
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> :0
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why not
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rounding is fine to me ngl
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> too many squares is kinda sharp and boring
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> why is this treated as an error in clang format
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012110526328872981/unknown.png
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> -warnings-as-errors
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea but.. whats the issue? isnt this how that function supposed to work?
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looks like he wants u to write != 0
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah I see
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you're doing a ternary operation when this is useless af
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> instead of doing the ternary operation, he asks you to put directly var != 0)
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ohhh okay. weird

23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well the 1st explains it well
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> why use ternary when != 0 returns a boolean
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think i understand now
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> adding this to my list of c++ knowledge
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> before i submit this fix tho i want to find a way where i can change an icon depending on if it's a parent folder
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> like this. currently the symbols are determined by a ternary function. i just need to find a way to detect a parent folder

23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this is what i have in mind. currently the symbols are determined by a ternary function. i just need to find a way to detect a parent folder
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012115303393669170/unknown.png
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Is that even necessary
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Ah ingame
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Thought the icon on the system xd
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> at first when I saw this i thought this was another folder until i clicked it
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012115665550848020/unknown.png
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so i want a way to indicate this is a previous folder
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ../ indicates it
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i didnt know what ../ meant
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Only if ur a linux user
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> xD
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> unix based
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> shrugs
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> most people who play this aren't linux devs
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Maybe check whenever that line is generated
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the only way that's detected is by literally reading the filename LOL\
