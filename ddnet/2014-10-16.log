10:12 < laxadedi> Howdi everyone
10:13 < laxadedi> pause: received the mail about the coding tournament ?
10:17 < pause> laxadedi: Yup, it's going to be tough
10:17 < pause> Hello all
10:17 < pause> laxadedi: I have music theory lessons every wednesday
10:17 < pause> Oh, maybe it's holidays though
10:17 < pause> laxadedi: Is that the case ?
10:31 < laxadedi> pause: how could I know ?
10:32 < laxadedi> http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid25058/le-calendrier-scolaire.html
10:32 < pause> laxadedi: You have holidays no ?
10:32 < laxadedi> LOOOL
10:32 < laxadedi> nice joke xD
10:32 < pause> Well shit =/
10:32 < laxadedi> I am working
10:32 < pause> Holidays end the 3, tournament the 5th
10:33 < laxadedi> I just got the regular holiday
10:33 < laxadedi> from the work
10:33 < laxadedi> so it's 25 open day/year + 8 RTT
10:33 < laxadedi> and I'll take 2 weeks at chritmas
10:33 < laxadedi> I am suppose to take my holiday when my school is closed
10:34 < pause> My lesson ends at 21:45 =/
10:35 < laxadedi> Well then you don't it, or you skip your music class
10:35 < laxadedi> Is that such a hard choice for you ? :D
10:35 < pause> Well that's not a good choice to make
10:35 < pause> Here's better: there's also lessons on monday, i'll contact my prof
10:36 < pause> Problem zolved
10:36 < laxadedi> zolved !
10:48 < pause> laxadedi: i need to learn german 
10:48 < EastByte> das ist eine gute idee
10:48 < laxadedi> pause: why lul ?
10:48 < laxadedi> EastByte: das ist aber falsch.
10:48 < pause> laxadedi: I'm pissed not understanding the stuff i'm playing
10:48 < laxadedi> xD
10:48 < laxadedi> Good luck with german
10:49 < hannibal> learning german is not easy.
10:49 < laxadedi> useless language
10:49 < laxadedi> and it's really hard
10:49 < pause> Der Schauspieldirektor !
10:49 < hannibal> oh not useless
10:49 < laxadedi> just a simple example
10:49 < laxadedi> every item has 3 type : female/male/neutral
10:50 < laxadedi> you have to learn the type of EVERY item/name
10:50 < hannibal> you can read hermann hesse untranslated. that alone is worth learning german.
10:50 < laxadedi> cause you can't guess it cause there is no logic
10:50 < pause> Ich bin die erste sangerin xD
10:50 < laxadedi> !de-en sangerin
10:50 < Nimda> Translation: singer
10:51 < laxadedi> and it's not like english where you can guess a word you don't know with the french word
10:51 < pause> hannibal: I'll be able to understand Mozart opera =D
10:51 < pause> laxadedi: Well, sangerin wasn't hard to guess
10:51 < pause> Looks a lot like singer...
10:53 < hannibal> if you need help, the german language is my area of expertise :)
10:53 < pause> hannibal: Thanks =D
10:53 < laxadedi> or nimda can do it
10:53 < laxadedi> laxa: test
10:53 <@EastByte> and we also have native germans here btw :P
10:53 < laxadedi> laxa: test
10:53 < laxadedi> laxadedi: test
10:54 < laxadedi> HL me pleaqse
10:54 < pause> laxadedi: HL
10:54 < laxadedi> ok working
10:54 < pause> EastByte: Yup, that could help too =D
10:54 < laxadedi> Nimda is offering her help too xD
10:55 < pause> I've been on laxa's teamspeak there's a lot of german people there
10:55 < laxadedi> yup
10:55 < laxadedi> just come on teamspeak the evening
10:55 < laxadedi> they keep speaking german even if I don't like it :p
10:55 < laxadedi> smoke afk
10:57 < pause> Problem is, i found listening to german made me sleep, don't know why. There was some guy whispering and a girl, had a strong lullaby effect on me. I must concentrate =P
10:57 < pause> But now i know how to say weapon !
11:12 < laxadedi> is there any logic between der/die/das ?
11:12 < laxadedi> if you don't know the genre of a name, can you guess it if you are german ?
11:13 < hannibal> not really. easiest way is to learn every noun directly with the correct article.
11:14 < hannibal> with some nouns, you can look at the ending of the word. because some endings can only be one article.
11:15 < pause> laxadedi: Actually it's the same in french, except there is no neutral
11:16 < hannibal> same system, but you can't take the french gender and think it'll be the same in german
11:16 < hannibal> la lune --> der mond
11:16 < pause> hannibal: It would be too simple =P
11:16 < hannibal> not the same.
11:16 < laxadedi> pause: and that's why german is difficult, you have to embrace the fact that german noun have 3 different genre instead of 2
11:16 < pause> hannibal: der is male ?
11:16 < hannibal> yes
11:16 < pause> die is neutral or female ?
11:16 < laxadedi> der is male das is neutral die is famale
11:16 < hannibal> die is female
11:17 < laxadedi> another shit thing in german
11:17 < laxadedi> wo != who
11:17 < laxadedi> wo = where
11:17 < hannibal> who = wer
11:17 < pause> Can it change depending on context ?
11:17 < pause> Like in french
11:17 < laxadedi> what do you mean pause ?
11:18 < pause> like, le premier / la premiere
11:18 < laxadedi> that's 2 different nouns
11:18 < pause> Well only the genre is changing
11:19 < pause> Conceptually it's the same xD
11:19 < hannibal> but why does it change?
11:19 < pause> male/female
11:19 < pause> le premier = male, la premiere = female
11:19 < laxadedi> take a simpler example
11:19 < laxadedi> die katze is female
11:19 < laxadedi> how is der katze ?
11:19 < pause> Is that a male cat ? xD
11:20 < laxadedi> die katze is correct for female cat
11:20 < hannibal> no :D der kater would be a male cat
11:20 < hannibal> and der katze
11:20 < hannibal> is only possible
11:20 < laxadedi> so it's like french 
11:20 < hannibal> if you talk about something male about this cat
11:20 < laxadedi> you have 2 nouns for every type
11:20 < pause> oh my god xD
11:20 < hannibal> for example "the stomach of the cat"
11:20 < hannibal> der magen der katze
11:20 < laxadedi> pause: forget about german
11:21 < pause> laxadedi: Fuck you, i want to understand Mozart opera without subtitles =P
11:21 < pause> How do you say fuck you in german ?
11:21 < hannibal> fick dich
11:21 < pause> Nice =D
11:21 < hannibal> :D
11:22 < pause> Isnt that a rammstein song ? XD
11:23 < laxadedi> I doubt you need to know "ficken" for german opera
11:23 < laxadedi> xD
11:23 < hannibal> oh you would be surprised xD
11:23 < hannibal> maybe not ficken as a word, but sex is THE subject ;D
11:24 < pause> laxadedi: also laxa, german girls =P
11:24 < laxadedi> german are way better than french at english
11:24 < laxadedi> no need to know german for that
11:24 < laxadedi> only if you want to impress them I guess xD
11:24 < laxadedi> Willst du mit mir schlaffen = Voulez vous couchez avec moi
11:25 < pause> laxadedi: With french accent !
11:25 < hannibal> yes, there's something about french people and english, right?
11:25 < pause> laxadedi: _coucher_
11:25 < laxadedi> ...
11:25 < pause> hannibal: Yes, we suck at it =D
11:25 < laxadedi> yeah
11:25 < hannibal> in switzerland, everyone keeps saying that french people do not want to learn it :o
11:25 < laxadedi> most french people are retards
11:25 < laxadedi> and in our area of expertise
11:25 < laxadedi> you need to at least understand written english
11:26 < pause> We're suck in the "our language is the best, we don't need anything else blah blah blah" mindset
11:26 < pause> stuck*
11:26 < hannibal> jesus
11:26 < laxadedi> hannibal: to give you an example
11:26 < hannibal> i think it makes sense if everyone keeps his native language (also to save it)
11:26 < laxadedi> !fr-en promotion
11:26 < Nimda> Translation: promotion
11:26 < hannibal> and learns english as 2nd
11:27 < laxadedi> In my school, the average score at toeic for first year is like 500
11:27 < laxadedi> which is terrible
11:27 < hannibal> hm
11:27 < hannibal> toeic is?
11:28 < laxadedi> english test
11:28 < laxadedi> it's suppose to be known
11:28 < laxadedi> https://www.ets.org/toeic
11:29 < hannibal> ah, like an international standard?
11:29 < hannibal> i know TELC & the cambridge system
11:30 < laxadedi> Yes it is
11:31 < hannibal> well, i'm sure that the younger generation with the internet and all
11:31 < hannibal> in france as well
11:31 < hannibal> will learn english juts like everyone else :p
11:31 < laxadedi> Yes they do
11:31 < laxadedi> but they suck at it
11:32 < laxadedi> not later than yesterday, I saw someone searching for shell scripting, but in french xD
11:32 < pause> I even know people that are like "fuck english, we need to make everything in french". And they're supposed to be developers
11:33 < pause> Makes me sad
11:51 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
11:55 < laxadedi> hannibal: What's the german website to take train ?
11:56 < hannibal> a website to take a train? you mean where you can check time tables and buy tickets?
11:56 < hannibal> laxadedi: 
11:56 < laxadedi> yeah
11:56 < hannibal> oh, idk. i know it for switzerland
11:56 < hannibal> try www.db.de
11:57 < hannibal> i think that's it.
11:57 < hannibal> yes, the search form to the right
11:57 < pause> laxadedi: You're going to germany ? oO
11:57 < laxadedi> maybe
11:57 < laxadedi> who knows
11:58 < laxadedi> with train is really fast and not that expensive
11:58 < laxadedi> 70 euros first class ticket from Paris to Essen
11:58 < hannibal> these days, train is more expensive than flight :D
11:59 < laxadedi> not so sure for when you go to little cities
11:59 < hannibal> zurich - berlin, good example. cheaper to fly
11:59 < pause> Oh my god laxa, did you find a german girl ?
11:59 < pause> XD
11:59 < pause> I need to buy champagne now
11:59 < laxadedi> A friend maybe ?
11:59 < pause> laxadedi: I know you, you won't move like 10 kilometers for a friend
11:59 < laxadedi> I don't wanna have a gf living that far from me xD
12:00 < pause> So it must be something else =P
12:00 < laxadedi> I am just curious !
12:00 < pause> laxadedi: Of course.
12:01 < pause> I'm going to check wood prices in mozambique, just curious !
12:03 < laxadedi> I am curious about the girl
12:03 < laxadedi> I mean that
12:03 < pause> Now we're talking
12:03 < pause> Which girl ? =P
12:03 < laxadedi> You are too curious !
12:04 < pause> You can't escape my all seeing eyes
12:04 < pause> Better say the truth !
12:04 < pause> Save your soul !
12:04 < laxadedi> You can guess, it's pretty easy
12:04 < pause> Of course i know, just wanted to hear it from you
12:04 < laxadedi> xD
12:05 < laxadedi> She won't come to France, then I'll come to germany
12:05 < pause> I'm no expert in that field, but if she does not want to give you a picture, i fear she wont sleep with you laxa XD
12:05 < laxadedi> God
12:05 < laxadedi> I said friend
12:06 < pause> Let's say it again: I KNOW YOU LAXA
12:06 < pause> =D
12:07 < laxadedi> What do you mean wtf ?
12:07 < laxadedi> I couldn't hurt a fly
12:07 < laxadedi> and you think I am going to jump on her
12:07 < pause> what ? no lol
12:08 < pause> I'm just saying you'll try to find more than a friend, not that you're going to rape her. That would be physically impossible anyway
12:09 < laxadedi> Maybe, who knows !
12:09 <@EastByte> rape is impossible?
12:09 < laxadedi> he means that I am too lightweigh to rape someone
12:09 < laxadedi> I am not strong at all
12:09 < pause> Exactly
12:09 <@EastByte> ah right
12:10 < pause> The girl would probably lift him and throw him out of the window
12:10 < hannibal> lol
12:10 < laxadedi> Well
12:10 < laxadedi> I am going to eat
12:10 < laxadedi> fuck you all
12:10 < pause> laxadedi: Lol =F Eat well =)
12:18 <@EastByte> a4tech g100 is awesome
12:18 <@EastByte> I'm a pro game now
12:18 <@EastByte> gamer*
13:09 < laxadedi> a4tech g100 ?
13:10 <@EastByte> gameboard
13:10 < laxadedi> Boah
13:10 < laxadedi> I feel like those things are useless
13:11 <@EastByte> not if your main keyboard is unusable for gaming
13:11 <@EastByte> also those keys are awesome
13:14 < laxadedi> how can a keyboard be unusable for gaming ?
13:15 <@EastByte> on my mechanical keyboard I need to press the keys deeper
13:15 <@EastByte> and they get back up too slow
13:15 < laxadedi> Hu
13:15 < laxadedi> Well your need are special then
13:15 <@EastByte> so in tw for example I can't walk small relay distances
13:15 < laxadedi> I can on my mechanical keyboard
13:20 <@EastByte> hmm I need a flat heatsink for my mini itx board
13:26 < hannibal> good to know that at least some people in here actually play tw :D
13:26 <@EastByte> yea, everyone else, GO OUT!
13:27 < hannibal> nono, pause, stay.
13:27 < hannibal> who are you ingame EastByte ?
13:27 <@EastByte> east
13:27 < hannibal> oh, makes sense now that you say it.
13:27 < hannibal> we haven't met very often :p
13:28 < hannibal> i guess i play 7-8 star levels beneath you :D
13:28 <@EastByte> hows your ingame name?
13:29 < hannibal> same as here. just "hannibal"
13:29 < hannibal> but i'm noob. play for approx. 4 months now.
13:29 <@EastByte> ah
13:29 <@EastByte> hm can't remember that name
13:30 < hannibal> yea i saw you once or twice. sometimes i go on brutal servers and just spec some people play
13:31 < hannibal> but i get better pretty fast. soon i'll be able to play a brutal map. then we'll meet :D
13:32 <@EastByte> I usually am too bad for brutal maps^^
13:32 <@EastByte> and it's always hard to find patners between moderate and brutal
13:33 < hannibal> i love the oldschool server :p i'm there most of the time.
13:33 <@EastByte> but since I have my gameboard know, I even can match laxa :D
13:33 < hannibal> :D that's good
13:34 < hannibal> but do you play a lot? like every day
13:35 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
13:36 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
13:36 <@EastByte> the time I spend if tw usually is 50% coding and 50% gaming
13:37 <@EastByte> I guess atleast 3 hours a day
13:37 <@EastByte> with tw*
13:37 < hannibal> :D
13:37 < hannibal> ok
13:38 < hannibal> i map sometimes..
13:38 < hannibal> so you're doing some of the client optimizations?
13:39 <@EastByte> mostly modifications with bad impact on optimization^^
13:40 <@EastByte> currently trying to help deen improving ddnet
13:45 < hannibal> ;D
13:52 < laxadedi> hannibal: have you ever seen me on teeworlds ?
13:52 < hannibal> yea
13:53 < laxadedi> I don't remember seeing you lol
13:53 < hannibal> ;D that's cause i'm a shy noob
13:53 < hannibal> i know that you run a teamspeak server
13:53 < hannibal> but that's about it-
13:55 < hannibal> you could know my map though. deen used it in a tournament a few weeks ago :)
13:55 < laxadedi> oh really ? Which map ?
13:56 < hannibal> it was called rivendell
13:56 < hannibal> the follow up on "the shire"
13:56 < hannibal> yea i like lord of the rings ;D
14:36 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!

15:14 < laxadedi> dvorak symph xD
15:23 < pause> laxadedi: -_-'
15:23 < laxadedi> What ? :(
15:23 < pause> laxadedi: I bet you know it, but you don't know you do.
15:24 < laxadedi> I am listening to it right now, but I didn't knew it I think
15:24 < pause> laxadedi: Don't your parents made you listen to this stuff ? They look like the kind of person that would =P
15:25 < laxadedi> Dvorak = keyboard for nerd, so it's nerd symphony
15:25 < laxadedi> nothing to argue about there :p
15:25 < pause> I understood, but that's a crappy joke =D
15:25 < laxadedi> It's not !
15:26 < pause> It seems both Dvoraks are related =)

15:48 < laxadedi> I know this one
15:49 < laxadedi> Or... It just makes me think of starwars, no idea
15:58 < hannibal> his 9th is his most famous.
16:01 < hannibal> in my experience at least.
16:46 < hannibal> i'm off for today. cu all :)
17:22 <@deen> hi. so much chat. did i miss anything?
17:27 <@deen> Hm, I told the new Iranian guy to wait 2 weeks and see how the new server by KinG and bor is
17:27 <@EastByte> I don't think so
17:27 <@EastByte> hi
17:27 <@deen> but he just bought a Linux server and gave me root =/
17:28 <@deen> I guess I should set it up since the current DDNet Persian is totally unplayable
17:28 <@deen> ping 420 to current server, his new one has 118
17:28 <@EastByte> I just bought it and gave you root access?
17:28 <@EastByte> I feel bad for you^^
17:29 <@deen> It's no problem for me, but I think bor and KinG really wanted to run ddnet persian on their own server
17:29 <@deen> maybe this new guy runs away in a few weeks and then they are pissed and we have no server at all
17:29 <@EastByte> as I said earlier, just run both :)
17:30 <@deen> hm, no ports open on the server. weird
17:40 <@deen> I even wrote something on the train!
17:41 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/suPavQ
17:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 1144ba7 def: Split up demo recording into 3 separate recorders
17:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 082ecfe def: Merge branch 'DDRace64' of github.com:def-/ddnet into DDRace64
17:41 <@deen> I hope it works now
17:42 <@deen> both kinds of autorecord and manual record should now work at the same time
17:44 <@EastByte> yay
17:45 <@EastByte> so clicking record/stop record is independent from both kinds of autorecord?
17:45 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
17:45 <@deen> i hope so!
17:45 <@deen> needs proper testing
17:46 <@deen> I've just done a quick one
17:46 <@EastByte> coding on train might be error prone :P
17:52 <@EastByte> hm seems to work
17:53 <@EastByte> well didn't test race record yet
17:53 < _KinG> hi all
17:53 <@EastByte> i
17:53 <@deen> hi
17:53 <@EastByte> hi
18:00 < borartr> hi i use your mod currently, some questions: 
18:00 < borartr> how can i set up a server featuring mapvote, didnt found anything in google quickly
18:01 < borartr> and i feel the perfomance of this mod is quite bad here, dunno how much capacity i have on these servers, but vanilla and race run perfectly, this mod gives me laggs (LAN)
18:02 < borartr> any chance to reduce it?
18:02 < laxa> reduce what ?
18:02 < laxa> The server runs perfectly without any lag
18:03 <@deen> borartr: hi
18:03 < borartr> online yes, im talking about LAN on this server here where i currently am
18:03 <@deen> i've actually made changes to make ddnet server lag less. that's weirdc
18:03 <@deen> weird*
18:03 < laxa> either your computer is total crap, either I don't know :)
18:03 <@deen> how do you notice the lag?
18:04 < borartr> ok i dont mean lag really, look it up wait a sec
18:04 <@deen> You can use this for the votes: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-maps/blob/master/novice/votes.cfg
18:04 <@deen> with many players (close to 64) load is of course higher than vanilla or race
18:05 <@deen> afk
18:05 < borartr> i mean stutters, if that a correct usage of the word, you know what i mean?
18:05 < borartr> mostly it runs well, then sometimes it stutters badly for a second, then ok again
18:05 < laxa> !en-fr stutter
18:05 < Nimda> Translation: bégaiement
18:06 < borartr> what?^^ im ger
18:07 < laxa> I am not and I try to understand what you mean :)
18:08 < borartr> hm its like a bunch of very short time freezes
18:08 < laxa> And you don't have any problem online with same computer ?
18:09 < laxa> and for votes
18:09 < borartr> cant play online from here, but i guess its the server, probably ddrace needs much more ressources than vanilla/Race
18:09 < laxa> add_vote "ctf4" "sv_gametype fastcap; sv_teleport_grenade 0; sv_map ctf4"
18:09 < laxa> no, server needs way less ressources than the client itself
18:09 < laxa> so I guess it's the client
18:10 < laxa> what config do you have ?
18:10 < borartr> hm interesting, will try ddraceserver with normal client out then, just wait a bit
18:12 < laxa> just try ddnet client on any other server
18:21 < borartr> tried some stuff its annoying you cant force it, sometimes it just works for several min
18:24 < laxa> My best guess would be that your graphic card is shit or bad drivers
18:24 < laxa> I hardly think it would be the server itself
18:24 < laxa> !de-en anzeige
18:24 < Nimda> Translation: display
18:29 <@deen> back. hm, that's the first i hear about bad performance of the server =/
18:30 < borartr> back too, i now guess its not the server^^ but probably these computers here
18:30 <@deen> have you tried playing around with the graphics settingS?
18:30 <@deen> ddrace maps are usually more graphics intensive than other TW maps
18:32 < borartr> i had one of these stutters with client on other map too, but only 1 in 5 min.
18:34 < borartr> it probably really are these computers, and this one was loaded with some other stuff so it got slow, if i notice anything that says otherwise i let you know
18:35 < borartr> thanks by the way for your suggestions and help (also with vote feature)

18:36 < laxa> ...
18:36 <@deen> you're welcome, borartr 
18:38 < borartr> deen i have thought of a new feature you could add if you like it: a lock vote for current map so players can play without getting outvoted, its sometimes quite annoying.
18:39 < borartr> eg lock map for 1 hour. lock should be automatically removed if last player leaves server
18:40 <@deen> hmmm, not really needed i think
18:41 <@deen> i rarely see another map being voted when people are playing
18:41 <@deen> and who would decide when the lock is active and when not?
18:41 < laxa> by a vote I guess
18:41 < laxa> but I don't think too that's needed
18:41 <@deen> someone could just lock all servers and join with a bot, so nobody can change map anywhere
18:41 < laxa> vote lock on
18:41 < laxa> vote lock off
18:42 <@deen> then it's just like a regular map vote
18:42 <@deen> if you can remove the lock
18:46 < borartr> i see your point, since i have no solution myself better not do it
18:47 <@deen> still thanks for the suggestion
18:48 < laxa> EastByte: deen: you live near Ahaus ?
18:48 <@deen> Ahaus?
18:48 <@EastByte> I live near Ahausen :)

18:53 <@deen> You're visiting someone in Germany?

18:56 < laxa> hum
18:56 < laxa> maybe
18:56 < laxa> if people can travel
18:56 < laxa> But apparently in germany, you don't like big cities

22:09 < pause> laxa: GO LAXA !
22:09 < pause> wooooot
23:15 < laxa> deen: I just had a great new feature idea
23:15 <@deen> ok?
23:16 < Mikeli> accounts? i agree laxa
23:16 < laxa> make special sign for when people spectate
23:16 < laxa> do avoid stupid fails
23:16 < laxa> special eyes, emoticon...
23:16 < laxa> anything
23:17 <@deen> the afk eyes?
23:17 < laxa> mb
23:17 < laxa> or chat emoticon
23:17 <@deen> no, i would wonder who everyone is whispering with all the time
23:19 < laxa> Well
23:19 < laxa> There must be a way
23:19 <@deen> i think the sleeps eyes would be fine
23:19 <@deen> sleepy*
23:19 < laxa> yeah
23:20 <@deen> when someone is afk or spectating you shouldn't expect them to react
23:23 <@deen> well, that was easy
23:23 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/WLQ7tQ
23:23 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 084b59d def: Show sleepy eyes when a player is paused
23:26 < laxa> Great, nice deen :)
23:26 <@deen> i always shoot at my partner and see if they react
