19:23 < kamillentee> I wonder why "SELECT Rank, Name, Time FROM (SELECT Name, (@pos := @pos+1) pos, (@rank := IF(@prev = Time,@rank, @pos)) rank, (@prev := Time) Time FROM (SELECT Name, min(Time) as Time FROM %s_race WHERE Map = '%s' GROUP BY Name ORDER BY `Time` ASC) as a) as b WHERE Name = '%s';" Returns zero in rank column if executed in bash
19:23 < kamillentee> but is working ingame when calling /rank
19:25 < paperman> Hi. I had those problems in Awesome desktop. I switched to Gnome-shell and the problems are gone!
19:27 < kamillentee> is there anything I could do about it. I need the rank to update special values but its hard to see if its working without testing in bash
19:48 <@deen> kamillentee: it's sql, not bash :P
19:48 <@deen> kamillentee: look at the three lines above
19:48 <@deen> SET @prev := NULL; SET @rank := 1; SET @pos := 0;
19:48 <@deen> need to initialize the variables first
19:49 <@deen> paperman: hi. what problems?
19:49 <@deen> paperman: was it frame drops on old amd gpu?
19:50 <@deen> paperman: if so, that's strange. it could be compiz related or with the resizing stuff i added recently
19:52 < paperman> deen, the rendering problem is fixed and my fps is better (same as previous version) :)
19:55 < paperman> I noticed that there was rendering problem in Awesome when moving things. Probably caused by a new version.
19:55 <@deen> paperman: you could try f1, gfx_resizable 0 and restart
19:56 <@deen> paperman: maybe it helps with awesome
19:57 < kamillentee> deen I know its sql but I am currently executing it using mysql -e "". But thanks anyway
19:58 <@deen> kamillentee: i know, i was joking :P
19:58 < kamillentee> ok :P
19:59 <@deen> what are you working on?
20:04 < kamillentee> a complicated rank system
20:05 < paperman> deen, Tried it, didn't work.
20:07 <@deen> paperman: ok, then I don't understand what the difference is.
20:12 < kamillentee> Isnt it better to have ddnet as default in line 97 src/game/client/components/mapimages.cpp. Since ddrace is more popular than vanilla. Would fix the delay some player had with the new client
20:15 <@deen> kamillentee: aaah, that's where the delay comes from
20:16 <@deen> would make most sense to have ddnet as default, thanks

20:17 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 072eadb def: Use DDNet entities by default, fixes seeing unhookable from start (thanks to kamillentee)
20:18 < kamillentee> but then you need to change IsDDNet to IsVanilla
20:18 <@deen> hm
20:18 <@deen> I'm not even sure i like this whole different entities thing
20:19 <@deen> only fng is actually different and the rest are subsets of ddnet
20:19 < kamillentee> fng is only gametype that is really annoying to play with ddnet entities
20:21 <@deen> I don't play other mods than DDNet so it's hard to judge for me
