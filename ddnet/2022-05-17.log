08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this IPO linking is rly noticeable even with my cpu lol
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> CHN5 is missing some entities on some of the servers
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> any idea why?
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> guns and shields don't spawn
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> looks like it started today
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also why does it have to use the gnu gold linker?
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Use GNU gold linker if available (to speedup the build)
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fake

09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> disabling ipo is so much faster its insane
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```json
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "cmake.configureArgs": [
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         "-DDEV=ON",
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         "-DMYSQL=ON",
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         "-DUPNP=ON",
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         "-DVIDEORECORDER=ON",
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         "-DUSE_GOLD=OFF",
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         "-DIPO=OFF"
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ],
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sane dev options as of today
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki when leak how :fuckyousnail: emote looks like o.O
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> and who devs with mysql bra
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have a change that auto-disabled IPO in DEV=ON
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like having most options enabled so my editor properly shows stuff
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Who made the map_diff tool in the install dir?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so servers can have multiple addresses now
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm thinking about how to handle favorites
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ipv4 and 6?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, or in the future also different protocols
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it support domain names?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> think tw-0.6, tw-0.7, etc.
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not at the moment, no
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought that maybe we could still just store favorites by IP address
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> adding a server adds all the addresses to favorites, removing a server removes all the addresses
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if only some addresses of a server are favorited, then clicking the favorite button adds the rest
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> problems I see: a server has some IP addresses I favorite it. but it removes some of them later, I unfavorite it. then there's still some favorite addresses lingering around
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps one could group the favorites based on how you favorited them first
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then when you remove a favorite, you actually remove the whole group
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or actually remove all the groups of all the addresses of the current server
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> how about only favorite the server ip that you are currently on? Or we could generally group servers with multiple ips together.
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what would we do if the user favorites the server in the serverbrowser?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> add a random IP address from the list?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if we do not group a server with multiple ips, you would add the ip that is selected in the list.
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but I'm grouping them
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the masterserver already groups them
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> how do you even know if it is the same server?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it would look confusing in the server list
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `{"addresses":["tw-0.7+udp://1.15.247.109:8303"],"location":"as:cn","info":{‚Ä¶}}`
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does it send some unique ID
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does it register all ips at once?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, individually
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it registers them with a secret to identify the server
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> is this secret a secret or could it be made public xD?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a secret
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it were made public, anyone could register as being part of that server
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also kinda short lived and tied to the specific execution of the server
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see. How about you store server side a unique ID for each server secret and send this so clients can know what ips are from what server, even if the ip is no longer connected to the server
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah ok
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> then nevermind
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, in the future‚Ñ¢ we could make it work with asymmetric cryptography, once we have secured our game server connection
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> probably acceptable xD I do not even think favourites are used that often
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Would be nice if someone looks at #5063 and tell me what he thinks about the physics changes.
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5063
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think deen made it
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes, thanks üòÑ
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> seems like masterserver is down again
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> was*
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> am i supposed to drop my contributions to the translation of some strings in here?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you want to, post the whole `yourlanguage.txt` here
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/976214340904554596/dutch.txt
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Was looking for a troll message. Couldn't find 1:feelsbadman:
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> üëç :feelsamazingman:
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> :feelsamazingman: üëç
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i din troll üôè
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you speak dutch, @n000b?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I am dutch:feelsamazingman:
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you check whether all these changes look sane? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5141/files
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i was gon say
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> how do you rate the changed ive made
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Looks goodüëç
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I already checked the file up here. But like this it is easier to check
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> :feelsamazingman:
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Didn't read if everything is correctly translated. But there is no wrong stuff written
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Maybe i would translate hookline to hooklijn, but that is because hook is such a basic term and in dutch it sounds weird
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i did consider that too
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> but the fellas who have come before me
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> have translated hook as haak
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> hence why i opted for haaklijn
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> and a hook is a haak after all so i figured thatd work
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> and a hook is a haak after all so i figured that itd work
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm i guess you are right
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :feelsamazingman:
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> have you spotted some other debatable translations
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> we might just be bang on if we work together
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm didn't read the English stuff most of the time. So actually not
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i suppose ya can deem 'm sane then
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> :feelsamazingman:
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I was only checking for bad language or memes or something like that
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> oi i spotted a mistake.
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> Server executable not found, can't run server
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> == 
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> == Server executable niet gevo**N**den, de server kan niet gestart worden
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i forgot an n lmao
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> lil slip up yo
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Chairn ^

23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> fixed it
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah lol
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> done
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Entiteiten is ook zo een vaag woord xD
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> ja ik heb er heel lang over nagedacht om het entities te laten
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> wat zeg jij
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> terug veranderen?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> please only english here
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> #off-topic for other languages
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Oopz
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> sorry mens
