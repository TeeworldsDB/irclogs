18:48 < relas> good evening
18:59 <@deen> hi relas
19:01 < relas> is it possible to change the freeze-delay with tune-layers? I'm not sure:D
19:32 <@deen> freeze-delay?
19:32 <@deen> you don't needc tune-layers for that, works directly with switch layer freeze tiles
19:49 < relas> i mean like: in one zone (the upper half of my map) you get freezed for 3 seconds and the other half you get freezed for 5 seconds
20:01 <@deen> yeah, you can do that with switch layer
20:01 <@deen> not tune zones
20:02 <@deen> just use the freeze tiles in switch layer and set a number
20:02 <@deen> a few maps use that
20:02 < relas> could you name examples or send me to a tutorial please?
20:11 <@deen> switch layer -> select freeze tile -> set Number or Delay higher -> place tile
20:11 <@deen> that's all
20:18 < relas> thanks!:)
