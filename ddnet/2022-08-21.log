11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omagawd the time it took me to fix roby conflicts dis boi used to commit more! xd cant keep up
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> RAII is kinda cool it feels like GC \:D
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> robyt is a ddnet backend chad
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I think the demo renderer in the game can be improved.
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> For example, this is a 3rd party demo renderer developed for the source games I left below.
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> <https://github.com/crashfort/SourceDemoRender>
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> and while it covers a lot of things found on ddnet, it also contains many features.
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> 
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> For example, motion blur can be added by slowing down the video compared to the video fps.

11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why would you not do it in a editing software?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u care about such stuff u probs dont upload the plain video anyway
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> It's never been as good as I expected.
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> And with the SourceDemoRenderer I mentioned above, video can be recorded at 7200 fps and more.
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can record ddnet with infinite fps
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> 1000 is the limit
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> until ur pc explodes
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its just a config isnt it?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just change it
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Didn't I need to compile the game from scratch for this?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I thought the value 1000 was hard coded.
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its ez to change
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> But why would players make such an effort?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> And there must be a reason why it's limited at 1000.
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs smone thought 1000 is fine
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and its fine until its not anymore
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u need more we can change it
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the setting really doesnt matter
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, ez for you and me, not ez for the user. Maybe we can just max out the cpu and gpu instead of capping it?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why do you need 7200 fps?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> super slow mo xD
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why faster?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would be insanly slow
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ohh he means the recording fps
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> just reprogram your eyes to captute 7200 fps, then its useful
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we already use 100% cpu if possible
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can just set 120 fps video, and f1 `cl_demo_speed 0.001`
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm what would one even do with a 1000 fps video? üòÑ
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> usually slow it down to watch
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i also find it overkill, but its probs easier to edit^^
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> flex with it
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so cl_demo_speed can be used for the same
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> A better quality motion blur will be.
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> This actually makes sense
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I didn't think I could use cl_demo_speed like this.
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im just curious though, will there be any othet method to render videos that doesnt involve screen capture? it seems like the way its set up if you do anything outside the client it messes up
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u mean for non demos?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah u mean if u tab out?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yes
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> and why does the demo renderer include my nvidia overlay in the video.
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can just render to a background framebuffer
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with opengl 3.0+ & vulkan at least
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> overlay on the bottom right indicating that the shadowplay is on
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs bcs nvidia injects it into your framebuffer
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would probs also be fixed with a background framebuffer
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Source Demo Renderer seems to have fixed this somehow.
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Another method or something?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I guess
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i did think about how speed/zoom changing mid render could work if its now rendered in the background, which i posted in showroom a bit ago
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh all these stuff can be implemented in the frontend/simulation/demo code
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont see why the video renderer should care about it
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> No such command: cl_demo_speed.
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> üòê
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Baited
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it just takes the current picture and puts it into the video xd
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe its simply overkill to do all this in ddnet generally
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> editing softwares are much better
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea but a bit of pre-edit software automation wouldnt hurt. i get your point on it being overkill though
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean if u add demo markers that automatically change zoom or smth i guess thats fine
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that already helps quite a lot and doesnt bloat too much
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But when you get to editing software some information will be lost, so some tools in the game might be good
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but smth like post processing effects like motion blur.. all these effects loose details anyway
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. motion blurring just tees in post would be pain. You'd need to manually roto the tee
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe render the same demo with no quads and key out the background that way
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess editing softwares can keep track of tees
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only way to automate it I can think of is the second thing I mentioned, but then you need to render twice
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that would be SO helpful
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh i'd have thought video editing softwares can already do it build in
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like focus on a few user defined points and track motion in deltas
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can track points yeah, but it can't know the bounds of the tee
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you can hack around it by using just a circular mask and pretending the tee is a perfect circle
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> or switching to entities with a blank images as the blocks
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But yes, most stuff should be done in post
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean i agree it would be cool
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its defs lot of effort xD
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> doubt anybody will do it here
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just drop all renderers except vulkan and drop all os except linux, then we have the whole open source community behind us xd
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean, people like beautemps would utilize these features a whole lot
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does anyone know why my computer has slow internet speed? Its between < 1mbit/s up to like a few mbit/s.
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I checked:
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - its not my main adapter only
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - its not the network, other devices work
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - its not some setting/things from online instructions
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - same behaviour in safe mode with network drivers enabled
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> NetworkManager?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'm guessing its a windows bug, I know I had updated my PC like 2 weeks ago, but havent noticed it until a few days ago I think.
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It could also be that a few days ago I accidentally turned of the power before the pc shut down completely, I used sfc /scannow and it also found damaged files, but it didnt solve the issue
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> off*
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> look if it is capped at a rounded value like exactily 1mib or something. It could be the negociation with the network adapter
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not, as i said sometimes its < 1mbit, sometimes it goes up to like 8mbit
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> & it's for all adapaters as i said
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> then idk ^^ cant help more
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ashesrogue> Why ddrace is hard to me but blocker no
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ashesrogue> I finish multieasymap for 16 minutes and kobra for 30 min
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> two very different mechanics also #off-topic
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I am sure that the methods used in the source demo renderer will help you.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> or whoever wants to deal with it
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> i am a javascript nerd
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> so i can't
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its probs easier to read it somewhere else than in random source code
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Its not random at all
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Its used by all the movie makers for csgo
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and how does csgo relate to ddnet?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Its the methods im talking about
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah me too
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> like motion blur isn't related to csgo it self
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i probs get better results by googling "opengl blur effect" than reading this code
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> as you wish
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> but it wouldn't hurt to have a look
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not going to do it anyway
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe background rendering some day, as i find it useful
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but motionblur is smth i do in editing software

16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, there's nothing to worry about, bottom guy probably doesn't much free time
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, there's nothing to worry about, bottom guy probably doesn't have much free time
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> His remote server that, at random time intervals, makes a single change in a file and commits & pushes into his repo has a lot of free time
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> the "news" tab haven't changed with the 16.3 update?
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> rfc: real-time demo marker
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what about adding marker bind that allows to set marker in auto-demo?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i'm pretty sure you can already do that
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> really?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it would be good to know how to do it xd
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> `bind x add_demomarker`
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> huh
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks a lot @archimede67 <3
18:32 <+Konsti> the fuck happened in that update
18:32 <+Konsti> i cant connect to localhost anymore
18:33 <+Konsti> only via IP which doesnt allow automatically reload server when i save map
18:34 <+Konsti> before update i could let IP field empty which connected to LAN-Server and only then auto reload would work
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> seems like someone destroyed the port
18:50 <+Konsti> how fix
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> create issue and type this:
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 8996d152abe1eef489e6457617ef7df5f64e0765 is the first bad commit

18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     Allow multiple connect addresses
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> say its broken for localhost
18:57 <+Konsti> im allowed to criticize heinreich :feelsamazingman:
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> hrhr
19:56 <+ChillerDragon> wat are these multiple connection addresses about anyways? saw it in the code did not make sense to me
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Robyt3 my pacman cmake can't find the library, even if i use PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did you install them on your own?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I also have `PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON` and I don't compile ddnet-libs myself
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> can you show the exact commands and error messages you used?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I think there are weird issues if you try to build inside Git Bash while using MSYS2, in case you use Git Bash, switch to cmd when running cmake and make
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> No idea how it works for me, but I'm doing the exact opposite of what's recommended here https://www.msys2.org/docs/cmake/, I installed native cmake and not MSYS2 cmake
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i tried with both and it output that it cannot find library because it looks for some files extension i.e. libsth.a and not libsth.lib
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> native cmake (not pacman) can not compile a simple program, while pacman cmake does not find any lib
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like it's a backslash problem:
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>  `/bin/sh: line 1: C:msys64mingw64bincc.exe: command not found`
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think these issues can be closed;
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4406
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3363
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> github down?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> #3363
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3363
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh mvm
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh nvm
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Great idea
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why not just remove weak hook?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Its a bug
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hammering through walls is also a bug
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Hammering through walls is consistent
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And weak hook is determent by spawn order which is arbitrary
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no its more that hammering through walls is fun but weak hook isnt
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Yup
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Is it just a coincidence that all these mechanics and "bugs"  actually create a good gameplay?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this game is literally the definition of "its not a bug its a feature"
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Weak hook is an unintended feature i guess
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> weak hook is neither a bug nor an unintended feature
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> So what is it? And most importantly does it have impact on my life?? To answer that question we need to know what's the meaning of life.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is unintended though, but not a feature, yes
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and also not a bug
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Maybe everything is a feature?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Or is everything a bucket?
