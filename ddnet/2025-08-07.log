14:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bro my smoke test also timed out
14:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so annoying
14:06 < bridge> <Assa> When I have a class, where every function is const, what does it tell me? ü§î
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon what was the repo with custom net msgs
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be nice ot add one for client iden so every client doesnt have to do something different
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and it can be something other than string blob
14:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet-community/community-protocol
14:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its uber draft state tho
14:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** check the open issues
14:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that object orientation makes no sense?
14:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> read only object maybe?
14:08 < bridge> <Assa> it's basically just a wrapper around Graphics() Sprites() and TextRender() ü§î
14:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> graphics and textrender are in component interfaces class
14:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if sprites is
14:09 < bridge> <Assa> sprites is new and also is
14:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay then use that then
14:10 < bridge> <Assa> but the class is not only used by the client, but the editor as well
14:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) are you motivated to plan out how community protocol even works with me? oO
14:10 < bridge> <Assa> so the components don't matter
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon 
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> plan? im not sure whats there to plan, most of these will be extremley niche
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> figuring out the layout is important
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just code (the netmsg.h and struct) is fine as well as a description and a table of contents is fine
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> making a repo with all the custom netmsgs seems excessive since it would be the same as copy and pasting everything and its not like you will interpret them in the repo
14:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the 2 custom netmsgs and mine proposed are for communication between client and server
14:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well we need to come up with some way to define the protocol
14:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess you can implement the server sdie aswell
14:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like how to write it down
14:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how to vote on it
14:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if voting is requires, clients/servers will implement what they want/need
14:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if voting is required, clients/servers will implement what they want/need
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** version support?
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how to name things?
14:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah
14:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> using the singular domain seems a bit limiting but i doubt there will be namespace conflicts
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** basically issue 1,2 and 3 in the repo are my open questions before we can get started
14:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> versions can just be _2 _3 _4
14:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> netmsgs can also be extended without problems
14:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> depends on the use case if it needs a second version
14:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bringing infclass into this is a bit eh because the way infclass repo is structured makes it extremley easy to take parts
14:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (minus pulling it all at once as ive discovered)
14:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (would be nice if there was an infclass client easy to merge version)
14:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea sadly kaffeine rqed on #7777 
14:17 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> GRRR
14:24 < ws-client> **<ryo>** hi
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ryowo
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon some netmsgs dont have structs what do?
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well you came up with the struct idea :D 
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not sure if thats the way to go. 
14:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well its easy to make everything use structs
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** unless its a flex message
14:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its just not required for like 1 attribute netmsgs
14:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh right
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that sends n strings based on the previous int
14:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hrmmm
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can also use markdown like i did here https://github.com/ddnet-community/community-protocol/issues/4
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> infclass server supports language it does it by geolocation
14:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think maybe a network spec is better written in english markdown than in code. The code can be used as examples in addition to that
14:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea geolocation is one way of doing it but it does not give the user the choice
14:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well from the message object to a parsed struct is also possible
14:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh i was more saying that it shoul dbe easy enough for infclass server to use a language netmsg
14:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah ye
14:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also F-DDrace can get rid of the language popup every join when the client sends it
14:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or ddnet++
14:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but we have to think a bit about some kind of process
14:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** otherwise it will be a full mess of incompatibilities
14:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the cool thing about some open spec like that is that even closed source projects can use it
14:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon its probably an idea for that to have alot more code in the how to use
14:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess you could store implementations like that as a commit over ddnet/master
14:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is a diff
14:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but diffs dont get cool ui like github commits
14:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** diffs get conflicts :c 
14:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they do...
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe you could point to someones implementation
14:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also solving git conflicts in diffs isnt the smoothest
14:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye i like that better
14:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but just as an example
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it means that you would have to squash alot
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for it to be useful
14:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there still should be some format that is standalone in the spec repo
14:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just plain english would be fine
14:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for what its supposed to work
14:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye plain english
14:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but ideally in some standardized format right?
14:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im not sure how
14:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** have some kind of template with msg uuid and fields as a table 
14:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> code is the best way to describe how to get from unpacker to data
14:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> since theres an endless number of things you could do
14:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> most things work as a table tho
14:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** only flex messages are weird in a table 
14:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but they also kind work
14:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this is how i used a table for 0.7 flex message https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/game_messages.html#NETMSGTYPE_SV_VOTEOPTIONLISTADD
14:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ppl keep saying the community made minecraft protocol wiki is good maybe i should look at it closer 
14:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i woulda used []
14:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz cpp
15:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg i have a pr pipleine consistently passing but merging the pr in a different repo times out the smoke test, also consistently
15:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fml
15:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe we can do something about the smoke test just saying timeout but i guess its tricky
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> is it the render cleanup PR?
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> it says where it's timeouting
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> like you get the logmessage which it's waiting for
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> guys remember whn u didnt have to wait 40m for ci
15:09 < bridge> <Assa> you can always run some of the scripts in a git hook pre upload
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> unless you're on windows and half of the things aren't working for some reason (:
15:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> You might enjoy my upcoming blog post

15:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon why cant ur bot dm people?
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> I was thinking about adding priority labels to issues. I guess accounts would get label infinity
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well we are label waiting on heinrich
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because no one else wants to touch quic or rust
15:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa not in ddnet repo oO
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently hyperactive, how can I help maintainers?
15:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa my github pw is ilovelaracroft69 you can merge some prs with my acc
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon no it isnt

15:26 < bridge> <Assa> I want to work on deeper issues where all clients would benefit from

15:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 128p pr issues then @AssaWS 
15:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ih yeah
15:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do that
15:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
15:26 < bridge> <Assa> I already wrote a lot of reviews
15:26 < bridge> <Assa> oh the kebs reminder didn't work üò† fix your bot
15:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) its a irc bot not a discord bot. It could dm you on irc xd
15:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but for discord dms i need you to setup a irc bridge into your dms
15:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i rebooted bot now reminders work
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon you could make a server which makes a bot dm people
15:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes but i wont touch discord
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mm
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its a bot
15:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ü§ñ
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dont u love bots
15:29 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 1 test
15:29 < chillerbot> Helo Assa I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.
15:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa you cant specify delay
15:29 < bridge> <Assa> but i want to, makes it useless otherwise
15:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !remindme add custom delays for assa
15:30 < chillerbot> Helo ChillerDragon I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.
15:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** here u go
15:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** will do soon
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how bigs a time unit
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> as I wrote above, I'd allow the following syntax:
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> `!remind <int> <timetype> <message>`, where timetype can be minutes, hours, days and weeks
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> examples:
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:33 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 2 weeks when back of vacation release 19.4
15:33 < chillerbot> Helo Assa I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.

15:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but ye once the reminder hits me i will look into it not today tho
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.lock
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog lock files
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> in std
15:54 < bridge> <kebscs> tune lock review
16:18 < bridge> <Assa> I once wrote an extra integration test and it failed and I didn't know why. I would convert them into pytest tests to make them more human readable
16:19 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs already checked out
16:19 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs already checked out, test in progress
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Because RISC-V systems differ so much and in fundamental ways, typically operating system or firmware images intended to run on one machine will not run at all on any other. This is often surprising for new users who are used to the x86 world where every system looks like a standard PC. (Once the kernel has booted, most user space software cares much less about the detail of the hardware.)
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> just learned riscv will probs never be mainstream in desktop
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> sad day
16:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki am i drunk or is this weird english?
16:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** > If the file not open for writing, it is unspecified whether this function returns an error.
16:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** from here https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.lock
16:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont understand the feature. Does the os support it? Can two different rust programs now read and write to the same file and it is safe?
16:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how does the lock know who else is holding the lock
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is more a posix or linux problem
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz to lock a file u need to open it as write i guess
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> so if u open a file as read and call lock its whathever linux does
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> unspecified
16:50 < bridge> <learath2> I guess rust just picked the common set of allowed file open modes between windows and linux, it's always valid to do if you opened it for write, but also valid on windows if you open for write
16:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I opened a typescript file first time in 1 year, wanted to write a quick script and "typescript-language-server" lsp doesn't work, it doesn't show variables' types -.-
16:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon is it okay if I add the netmsg I plan before it's documented
16:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @sollybunny: I guess -.- but then we can‚Äôt even talk about naming
16:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Let‚Äôs maybe at least informally talk about it first
17:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i agree with-client version @chillerdragon
17:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i agree withclient-version @chillerdragon
17:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i agree with client-version @chillerdragon
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> already looked into it. It's either a mingw bug or smth changed in mingw that now requires a new define
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i touch windows again i could debug it
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know what you were doing, I was just reminding xD
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, dunno either
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wanted to buy smth at rossmann but forgot. so maybe next time i should ping you to remind me

17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yo chillerbot, wazzup.
