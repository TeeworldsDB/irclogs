11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I fixed all places I could where visual studio showed me a high CPU use, even the 128p translation does not loop through every client anymore on CServer::Translate(). That helped a lot already, I can join 128 clients without extreme laggs, but on the production server there are sometimes random laggs, even with fewer people (60-70). The laggs are probably caused by DoSnapshot, because it's usage goes up to 70% on my local server
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So i am asking again: Would it be possible to do so?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wow, it seems like the 0.7 snapshots are way less efficient...
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am looking into that now
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe that was also false, i dont know
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't thread snapshots, the main loop cant just go on without snapping. You'd have to lock the main thread
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to figure out what part of snapping is slow and fix that
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could maybe have some benefit from snapping clients in parallel but it's way more work than you'd think to get it all working correctly
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All that work just to check whether it helps or not
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet there is more low hanging fruit before that
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> GetItem() is slow
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But it cant be optimized ig

16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually a cool project
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reminds me of openpgp
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but for projects
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Systemd update broke my laptop, sendhelp
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fucking systemd-coredumpd eating 99% my cpu. Such a great service very needed
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tbf my own stupidity. I just was too lazy to use gentoo on a laptop with weaker cpu
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Never again I will be lazy about installing a distro without this mess
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean u were lazy and didnt use gentoo
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u used it?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't on the laptop bc it was a little weak
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u install a systemd distro if u hate it so much
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux gives u the freedom to choose
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If any of you havent enabled magic sysrq, you really should btw
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Got me out of this pickle
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not anymore with a majority of us deciding it's okay to let systemd be a monopoly
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u still have the freedom
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just choose not to use it because u are lazy
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows users are lazy
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> become one with stallman
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Barely have a choice. The only options with any sanity at all are devuan and gentoo
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any other I tried say they support sysv. But if you install discord or spotify it pulls in systemd lol
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 lets create our own distro
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and make a init system in rust
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would love to
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust is an excellent choice for PID1
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Teenux
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the name
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For PID1 you want minimal and very safe
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pid1 goes wrong you get a broken system or a kernel panic
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> teenux > systemd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> learath2 > lennart poettinger
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hype
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> learath2 > lennart poettering
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> my keyboard doesn't have a sysrq key
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it's the print key, right?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alt-print, yes
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not nearly cunning enough or have marketing skills like the guy to build a cult around my product
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My new btrfs based automatical backup script does the unthinkable: I just pull the usb disk, no unmounting, call me insane
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and honestly I think what he does is immoral so I wouldn't really be able to do it even if I had the skills
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't this how you get broken backups? 😄
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does the script pull the plug?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh and that
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I pull the plug :D
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I decided all those filesystem and kernel engineers are putting so much thought into making fail safe (e.g. power outage) filesystems
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why not just unmount if it's already idle?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someone got to counter that, right?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they can do their very best but anything that's being written while you pull it is at best suspect
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and discover all these juicy bugs (with their data on the line)
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly would at the very least sync before pulling it 😄
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's doing a backup every hour from different machines so I really can't be sure. I wouldn't wanna have to check or boot my pc to unmount
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you have the script running on a router or sth?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Btrfs is doing all this stuff (I assume ext4 too) to make sure everything is flushed before the final reference is moved in the b-tree or whatever
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> on a raspberry pi
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not ext4
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but how do you figure out if a backup is going on rn?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wdym? I don't, I just pull the disk when I' swapping it out
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btrfs or ext4, which one u use?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use ext4
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> btrfs, I'm slowly moving my machines to btrfs
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm confused, why would you swap the disk out?
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ext4 only has protection of metadata
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw btrfs have a regression in speed in the latests kernels
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> due to bug
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I always want to have one not at my place, I'm paranoid like that :D
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how you would not risk atleast incomplete data
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.10-Btrfs-Regression
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah saw that on HN frontpage
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Making rounds this week was word of a "500~2000% performance regression" knocking Btrfs on Linux 5.10.
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> watch nasa rover
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are plugging the disk out you HAVE to make sure it's atleast not being written to rn, btrfs' approach would only guarantee it's safe for you to unplug it while a backup isn't going on
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/812038419445579776/unknown.png
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 only if the backp isn't written with power outage in mind
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 I don't think so, yeah think of power outage like heinrich said. Nobody will every slap a "we guarantee this or that" label on it but in practice it just works
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uuuh, you'll atleast lose that backup
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah ofc
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Please don't be lazy and wire a led to the raspi 😄
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm cleaning that up the next time round
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if the led is lit backup is going on
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I thought about that, maybe with a button :D But I was lazy
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro any reason besides it being in-tree to choose btrfs over zfs?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a button to stop the backup and unmount/sync would also be very pretty
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 I haven't really looked at zfs
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> zfs is also very cute
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my old nas was running zfs
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (on freebsd ofc)
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my nas and teehistorian storage is zfs
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 on linux?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The features I want are atomic snapshots and the ability to transfer them incrementally over the network like with btrfs send/receive
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how is the support for it nowadays?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> previously on raspi 😅
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that plus content checksumming is also in ZFS
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc zfs snapshots are also atomic
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tho I don't use them so don't remember
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 not sure, it's still out-of-tree, but it's okay with archzfs
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I considered linux on that NAS, then I remembered I don't really need anything from linux so might aswell be safe with freebsd
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's awesome that my windows virtual machine is backed up automatically now, also still boots when the backup was taken when it was running. And it's actually feasible now to do this. I had a rsync based solution before and you can only backup the entire image then, not only the parts that changed
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 Why did you choose zfs over btrfs?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it looked maturer at the time, especially the raid stuff
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> more mature? idk, english adjectives are weird
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think they still say on the btrfs wiki that some raid levels are not working or "half working" ^^
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> more mature sounds correct to me
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> "more mature"
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at the very least "maturer" sounds verywrong 😛
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both are right, apparently(?)
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah dict.cc says both are right
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> never heard maturer
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btrfs also does content checksumming, right?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it sounds odd because of the ərə at the end
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> quitted exist
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> quitted? wtf
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/812040946858328084/Ljha0.png
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its use is gone
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 I don't know
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's also something I definitely want
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> There is checksumming but that might be only metadata?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 Just checked, data checksumming is on by default
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So the tricky thing about my strange backup solution was ironically to unmount the disk and also the mapper device for the luks encryption ^^
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so btrfs is zfs but made by linux aligned ppl with cool modern tech 😛
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😎
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if linus approves it then its gud
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Because even when you plugged out the disk it's still mounted, and to unmount it you still need to kill all processes which are writing to it, they are still writing even if the disk is unplugged ...
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So I've got a udev hook to do this, but udev hooks can't mount or unmount stuff because they are in their own mount namespace
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you shold be able to join different mount namespaces, I think
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And the popular solution seems to be to write a systemd service which does the mounting and call that from udev to escape the namespace
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they almost cancelled linus a year or so ago
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ohhh right, that's why i decided against zfs
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it's in linux?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> or not?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk it was weird
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's "in-tree"
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. in the linux source code
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> zfs?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> is in the kernel?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, btrfs
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if it's a licensing issue or sth with  zfs
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how it's still not in tree is insane to me
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> licensing
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a GPL-compatible GPL-like license from oracle
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a GPL-incompatible GPL-like license from oracle
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah oracle with their nasty influence over the open source world
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should move to btrfs to not support oracle stealing from the open source community
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Also, you know when you are trying to unmount a disk and it doesn't work. You probably still have a shell open or smth which has it's cwd in there. There's really no way to reliably find out what's stopping the unmounting. There is like a huge list of things which can be the cause and nobody really has a comprehensive list of everything
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah actually it's the poisonous license of linux that's creating the issue here
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, not sure which party I hate more
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you mean GPL is poisonous?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think either license is at fault, they're really similar
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> 7
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> A few days ago I switched all my stuff from gpl to mit
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just that they both require freedoms to be retained in derivatives, so they're incompatible
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GPL probably has some clause that doesn't even allow linking to non GPL code
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because they require slightly different stuff
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess infectious is a better word
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If any part of your code is GPL all your code needs to be GPL in most cases
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think LGPL is the less anal version
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You might need LGPL or something. I had GPLv3 on everything until someone who wanted to integrated my project into his complained and I realized I don't understand GPL good enough to use it
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still maintain BSD, MIT, zlib and the likes are the best choice for people that actually want their project to be used by the most amount of developers
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I believe there is a point for GPL for huge projects like the kernel. With MIT, in theory someone could fork it, add a super duper feature everyone wants and distribute it without source
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder if GPL proponents disagree on this @Learath2
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ofc they do, most people love to shove their ideologies down everyones throats
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh come on, this isn't an objective discussion
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh come on, this isn't an objective argument
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well don't they? Wouldn't you want everyone to agree with you on everything if possible?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If a person didn't think they were right they wouldn't argue their position in the first place
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe their objective isn't "wanting the biggest amount of developers to use their project"
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but instead exclude those who they think are working against their objectives
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AGPL-3 best
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poisen the world with freedom
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poison the world with freedom
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Such is the nature of open source, it is well within your right to want more than credit for your project. I just believe it's a tad against the principle of open source as I define it
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure it guarantees a different set of freedoms, a set that I think restricts the spread of open source code
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it guarantees user freedoms
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i personally think all knowledge should be free and open
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these science paper websites behind paywall are cancerous
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it's not clear-cut without data. I'd be fine with being served some data about that
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, but (very subjective opinion here) I think it's mostly a secondary effect. It actually guarantees that people get to exclude people that don't think like themselves
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they dont even give a living to scientists
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (due to possible second-level effects)
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it guarantees to exclude the ability to remove those freedoms
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's how I believe the world works, I think people are actually extremely selfish
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why capitalism had a very easy time permeating society
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we had this convo before
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have differing welfare systems across the world
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> fuck the ddnet dev channel should move from discord to something proper
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's currently on IRC and discord
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your suggestion?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and by extension kinda also matrix)
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't really have a suggestion
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But as long as there is a bridge chances is I'm too lazy and using discord
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Not only me
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same xd
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But as long as there is a bridge chances are I'm too lazy and using discord
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, but even in the most socialist societies among us people participate in the society if it benefits them if it makes them happy
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see this working without a bridge without excluding lots of people (that would currently be here)
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at all the people moving from france to monaco to save their precious tax bux
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I could actually join via the matrix bridge
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Didn't know we have that
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I use element anyways
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't, but matrix has a freenode bridge
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and #ddnet also exists on freenode
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would love to avoid discord aswell, but it's too late. Discord took over the world
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will be gone in ten years, don't worry
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another monopoly we all allowed
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its sad ppl should use decentralized social media more
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 long-term bet? ^^
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mastodon etc
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The NSA would personally fund discord to keep it alive, it's a massive data farm
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, 50e?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bet a crypto
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.0001 btc?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 50e in the future will be worthless
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😛
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> if something is more volatile than euro its bitcoin
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when corona ends
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Centralized systems are here to stay, if anything there will be more of them in the future
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> massivle inflation
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everywhere
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's extremely threatening to countries all around the world that people get to freely talk about what they want
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 we had lots of centralized systems that failed
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so ten years from now, discord is smaller than it is today @Learath2? that fine?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure but what replaced them? More centralized systems
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't doubt that
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually about capitalism, it may look like it havent "failed" but its cuz u are kinda in the middle to good side of it
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you are not getting the consequences of it
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm just saying that discord isn't here in ten years
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as much
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well sure, I think I'll take that bet. Even with it's dozens of missing features people use it, as they improve the product more would use it imo
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> By June 2020, the company reported it had 100 million active users each month.[26]
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The middle actually got the shaft with capitalism btw. Especially in societies that produce a lot
20:49 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> The freenode bridge is only for the dev channel?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb eat
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's correct timakro
20:49 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Haha, I like that. ddnet is the dev channel
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the only people likely to use irc are the devs, so it makes sense 😛
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 so in january 2031 less than 100 million monthly active users
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh february
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure. What is your hypothesis anyway?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my hypothesis is: centralized services come and go
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're not here forever
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But why would it go away without reason? It's users adore discord
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same was true for skype
20:51 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> do you have past examples for that heinrich5991 ?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> myspace
20:52 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Actually tab completing mentions works
20:52 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> awesome
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I don't really see how one would improve upon discord. I always saw how one would improve upon skype
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we are at a point in technology that the improvements are no longer obvious and large
20:52 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Right, myspace. I also wouldn't be surprised if facebook was loosing users
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Same as with other fields of science. Try finding sth new in math or quantum physics
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> losing*
20:53 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> I can't see youtube going away ever
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> youtube will live as long as google supports it
20:53 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> If you wanna heinrich xDD
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially with the barrier of entry being INCREDIBLY large
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you host 100 million users? I can't imagine anyone except the tech giants could take a task like that on
20:54 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Well, you can grow
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe another corporation that promises to be more closely aligned to governments could be funded by them
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly don't see how google even let discord happen tbf
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would have been sooooooo easy for them to snatch this position from them
20:55 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Do they have competition?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> google failed like 5 social networks and fails providing a messenger
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem with communication applications is that you need people to communicate with
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's easy to start your own communication application to "compete" with discord sure
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 legislation could break that btw, e.g. eu legislation
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the point if my friends aren't on that platform? Same with whatsapp absolute monopoly in turkey
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (e.g. by requiring interoperability)
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They tried to kill it with both a govt funded app and Telegram lately with the privacy policy changes
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Neither could succeed because if you can't send a message to your mother, no one wants Telegram
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't agree that telegram is better than whatsapp
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> telegram does (for all intents and purposes) not have e2e encryption
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The privacy policy change on whatsapp was bad enough that proper news channels suggested Telegram in turkey btw
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, really? I thought they relied on the exact same tech as whatsapp. Is it opt-in or sth?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch, telegram's marketing is really nasty
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that people keep believing this
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> telegram does not have end-to-end encryption outside of never-enabled badly working single-device smartphone-only "secret chats"
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, and they're one-to-one only
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, wow that's scummy marketing
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (also they roll their own crypto for client-server encryption)
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They could try, but I feel it'd be very hard to get there. A lot of people oppose the government regulating markets. Most these companies get away with blatant monopolies for years with slaps on their wrists
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at Facebook, it is no doubt a monopoly that keeps buying and buying other companies to grow their monopoly. Yet still no monopoly busting in the US or in the EU
21:02 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> I wonder if you could get funding which such an unoriginal idea as a centralized youtube clone
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> timakro: well there is dailymotion out there used by 3 people
21:02 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Ofc, what we really want is a decentralized youtube clone but then the question is if the people funding you even know the difference
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you would definitely get more funding for a centralized one than a decentralized one
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im back
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the old money people and big tech both hate the idea of decentralized systems as decentralization itself is against the idea of a corporation
21:03 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> i just looked it up and it seems like youtube and dailymotion started around the same time
21:04 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> so it's no surprise they both got funded (idk if they got funded)
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I actually tried to pitch a decentralized cloud photo storage application to some richppl before)
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> crypto is decentralized
21:04 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> did you have the word "blockchain" in your pitch?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> timakro: DAMN that's what I was missing
21:04 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> then there's your mistake 😁
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually the blockchain itself is a rly simple term
21:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> yeah it's two words
21:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> block
21:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> and chain
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a chain of blocks
21:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> super simple
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They suggested I ditch the E2E encryption and the decentralized aspect btw 😄
21:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> highly effective in business meetings
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that contains the top hash of the merkle tree of the previous block
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
21:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> how did it work Learath?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know rich ppl
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 timakro[m] have u heard of web3?
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> i'm genuinely interested in decentralized designs. it seems like 100x more difficult to do so 100x longer until you get profitable
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://web3.foundation/
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Still better chances of being successful than a youtube clone which doesn't have anything to offer over youtube
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> imho
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Nope, I havne't
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well my friend who pitched it with me pivoted into a centralized non encrypted version of the idea and got his funding. I bowed out because I didn't find it interesting
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ew
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and I suffer from impostor syndrome so I get really insecure when things like this happen)
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 just think that most programmers just know html js and css and think js is the best lang in the world
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after thatu will feel better
21:09 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> solid advice :D
21:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> So it built onto something from this web3 organisation?
21:10 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Or was it a pitch to web3?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well a foundation is born form something that exists i think
21:12 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> I was asking learath about his project
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:13 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Ryozuki-: I don't think the unique stuff is licensed, is it?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ocykBzWDiM&feature=emb_title
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they remastered
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rick roll
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to 4k 60 fps
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> humanity at its best
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Remastered music video with Topaz Video Enhance AI and RIFE (Flowframes).
21:13 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> yeah by remastered they mean slap a ugly upscale filter on
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks good
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't logic away irrational feelings. I do know this
21:14 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> No?
21:14 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> It looks like the latest cell shading game from nintendo
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's also the reason I get very angry with people suffering from dunning kruger syndrome
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta search taht term
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People feeling so confident with their knowledge with their portfolio consisting of a single hello world program
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The Dunning–Kruger effect is a hypothetical cognitive bias stating that people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah like the russian guy
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye its very annoying
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the russian guy was doing interesting things. please keep the personal stuff down
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel like I'm inadequate for everything with my 11-12 years and here is this goof with his 1 week of experience thinking he is Knuth himself
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this chat is all personal stuff since ever
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, let me rephrase, don't put other people down in this chat
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur just biased heavily towards me
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the guy doing interesting things "aka some hover effect" gives him freedom to talk shit about others?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it indeed does
21:17 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> What russian guy?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> timakro Bananasth on github
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someone with a cyrillic nick on discord
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is obsessed in telling me i dont know how to code
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> several times
21:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Oh I remember some fighting a while ago -.-
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> point me to it when it happens (if I indeed miss it), I'll try to moderate that too
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well both you and him have personalities ranging from condescending and mean to verycondescending and verymean. So I would have probably muted you both if I cared about such behaviour 😛
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> timakro[m] why the m?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> matrix
21:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Why does everybody under that youtube video say it looks good
21:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> I something wrong with me?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> begging for approval
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I also think e.g. the hair looked weird
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is reddit down
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe depends on the resolution you look at
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at low resolutions it seemed clearer than the original to me
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> 1440p
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can't read the rust subreddit
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> The original looks low res, this looks just weirdly stylized
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-mark-and-sweep
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Tri-Color Mark and Sweep
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they always come with these names
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ruby syntax looks so weird
21:23 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Maybe if they throw machine learning at it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OMG I found the next big thing
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Neural Network GC
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/812056859162837042/unknown.png
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://skyline.github.com
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
21:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> I mean the upscale xD
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found the newest github fancy site
21:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> But neural network GC sounds nice
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with synthwave music
21:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Maybe if we add blockchain
21:27 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Ryozuki-: Nooo your's bigger than mine :)
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u have a 3d printer
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can print it
21:28 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> That's so dumb
21:30 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki> timakro[m] r u watching nasa
21:31 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> no
21:31 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki> :(
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> But seriously, why don't we move the ddnet discord to matrix?
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> It seems you can make "communities" there, it's like a discord server, you tried it.
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> just tried it
21:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <timakro[m]> We can just go to matrix.org, no need to host anything
21:35 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki> matrix communitiesi s just 1 channel iirc
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the players are on discord
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds awful, imagine your gc making a mistake and removing a used object 😄
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> hey dev i need help :3
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Queen Julia 5th what's wrong?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> i compile server but i got that:
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> https://prnt.sc/1006xn3
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> @deen  what i make wrong with that/
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That doesn't look like official DDNet server. What is it?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> vanilla
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it looks like a mistake in the source code, not from your side
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> vanilla has city mod?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> yep
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and is called Server-Open? I don't think so 😄
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Where did you get it?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> i changed it in bam
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> from friends
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> but wht is wrong deen?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That doesn't work as easily as you think
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or you copied the wrong file. Maybe you mixed up character.cpp and chatcmds.cpp
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> huh
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think you can just copy some files into vanilla to make it into a city mod
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> ye
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> @deen  idk what i make with it xd
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sorry, can't really help with that.
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> done i fixed
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> xd
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> problem was on gamecontext.h i add file
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> problem was on gamecontext.h i add wrong file
