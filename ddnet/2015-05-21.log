00:24 < savander> goodnight
09:20 <@EastByte> looking at G@mer's company site about 6 months after he wanted to release teeserver.de
09:20 <@EastByte> http://moon-soft.de/
09:21 <@EastByte> "Due to a Hardware issue all the data got lost and we have to rebuild the web-pages."
09:23 <@EastByte> maybe he used a cheap kimsufi where this actually could happen
12:55 <@deen> ouch
12:55 < Nimda> Allround by [A] Awesome just released on Solo at 2015-05-21 12:53
13:04 <@deen> that reminds me that I only back up the ddnet.tw server and not the others. the great idea is that all the other servers are the backup for that. the main thing i have to do is change RUS -> GER to restore a backup from another server
13:05 <@EastByte> sounds great
13:06 <@deen> works fine so far
13:07 <@deen> but only happened 2-3 times that a server disappeared unexpectly
13:07 <@deen> unexpectedly*
13:08 <@deen> oh, another thunny thing: I recorded a ddos on chile and wanted to look at it in wireshark
13:08 <@deen> but scp to chile is terribly slow
13:08 <@deen> Always have to send data through ddnet USA to get it fast from chile
13:10 <@EastByte> have you also tried to scp directly through ddnet USA (proxying) ?
13:10 <@deen> nah, I don't copy stuff often
13:11 <@EastByte> btw. what's the ping between child and usa?
13:11 <@EastByte> chile*
13:11 <@deen> 140
13:11 <@EastByte> ah
15:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] nzyuzin opened pull request #209: Detailed statboard (DDRace64...detailed_statboard) http://git.io/vTVKD
15:32 < Learath2> Shiki: I'd just disable statboard for all race mods
15:32 < Shiki> that's arguable
15:32 < Shiki> how can it be implemented? if (!notRace) showStatboard; ?
15:33 < Shiki> if user doesn't need statboard he won't see it, that's all
15:35 < Shiki> at the moment it's shown only on button press or at the end of game if you have auto_statboard_screenshot on
15:35 < Shiki> and game over doesn't happen if you're on race mod, am I right?
15:36 < Learath2> surely but if you are going to let it be used in race too you need to polish it up to allow 64 players
15:36 < Learath2> so that means implementing some kind of scrolling 
15:36 < Learath2> which isnt quite worth the hasle
15:36 < Learath2> hassle
15:36 < Shiki> yep, not at all
15:37 < Shiki> maybe just disable it if amount of players goes over 16?
15:37 < Learath2> that should be fine
15:37 < Shiki> still, I can hardly see why guys on race mod would turn it on
15:37 < Learath2> say guy in race mod also plays vanilla
15:37 < Learath2> has the statboard enabled
15:38 < Learath2> presses the button and sees an ugly mess 
15:38 < Shiki> and then wonders which kills he wanted to see on a race mod :)
15:39 < Learath2> and then notices the board overflowing and says what an unpolished piece of shit this client is
15:39 < Learath2> well he probably doesnt give a .... but still 
15:39 < Shiki> ok, I got what you mean, I will add a commit disabling it for more than 16 players
15:39 < Shiki> thanks for feedback!
15:39 < Learath2> like my autoupdate commit :D
15:40 < Shiki> what about it?
15:40 < Learath2> shouldnt have been merged in the first place created so many problems
15:40 < Learath2> winxp couldnt update trying to fix it we broke it all and now some people are just stuck in a version
15:41 < Shiki> :)
15:41 < Learath2> 7.6 i think thats where it gets stuck
15:41 < Shiki> is that why I see 'manual update required' in news section? :)
15:41 < Learath2> yeah :D
15:41 < Shiki> he-he
15:42 < Learath2> windows xp apparently doesnt enjoy replacing running executables
15:42 < Learath2> well it does it fine for any other executable but it just doesnt want to do it with ddnet.exe
15:43 < Shiki> :O
15:43 < Learath2> yeah windows is weird
15:44 < Learath2> Shiki: you might want to move the Suicides column a tad bit to the right 
16:32 < Savander> irc was down?
16:34 <@EastByte> I guess ddnet.tw was shortly down
16:46 < laxadedi> irc can't be dead, it's a cluster.
16:46 < laxadedi> quakenet network is pretty big
17:28 < fstd> http://royal.pingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/irc.002.jpg
17:28 < fstd> would love to see an up to date version of this
17:30 < fstd> ah here we go: http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/history/top10_2015u.png
17:33 <@deen> https://web.archive.org/web/20130816180616/http://ddnet.tw/
17:33 <@deen> back when ddnet had 10 mappers total =)
17:34 <@deen> looks like irc's dying
17:35 < fstd> well freenode is on a constant rise
17:35 <@deen> what did open source developers use before freenode? just mailing lists?
17:36 < fstd> i guess that was the primary medium then, yeah (still is for a lot of projects, anyway)
17:37 < fstd> or perhaps IRCnet and EFnet; they seem to also have a lot of technical people around
17:37 <@deen> or did the number of open source developers just increase?
17:38 <@deen> while the gamers and normal people moved to other chat platforms than irc
17:38 < fstd> that sounds plausible too
17:42 < laxadedi> today
17:42 < laxadedi> people use slack
17:42 <@deen> never heard of that
17:42 < laxadedi> apparently
17:42 < laxadedi> well, I am using it since yesterday
17:42 < laxadedi> it's a modern way to communicate in a group/organisation
17:43 <@deen> it's funny how all the new hip product websites look exactly the same
17:43 < fstd> ^
17:43 < laxadedi> it's called bootstrap xD
17:43 < laxadedi> https://slack.com/
17:43 < Savander> http://trac.ddnet.tw/ ?
17:43 < Savander> what was that :D
17:44 <@deen> Savander: i don't like web forums, so I thought a bug tracker would work for testing maps :P
17:44 < fstd> what garbage
17:44 <@deen> but everyone was afraid of the bug tracker
17:44 <@deen> i also liked that you didn't have to make an account
17:44 < Savander> oh.
17:44 <@deen> felt more TW-like
17:44 <@deen> testers said they would test more if I made a forum instead, so we have a forum now
17:46 <@deen> I never liked the trac software anyway, no big loss
17:50 <@deen> I don't even understand what slack does
17:51 <@deen> paid-for irc+email in one?
17:51 < Savander> https://www.hipchat.com/
17:51 < Savander> we used it with Tsin and Taurus 
17:52 < Savander> with connection to bitbucket.
19:25 < Nimda> 2 easy for u by Ray just released on Moderate at 2015-05-21 19:22
19:28 < Shiki> Learath2: thanks for your suggestions, they're implemented now
19:29 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:29 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 597
19:29 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:31 < Edible> is nimda an irc bot written in nim?
20:32 <@deen> i wish!
20:32 <@deen> but actually it's an irc bot written by noother
20:33 <@deen> in a much less pleasurable language: https://github.com/noother/Nimda3
20:50 < Edible> oh gawd
20:50 < Edible> php
20:50  * Edible *facepalms*
21:12 <@EastByte> Edible: read nimda backwards :)
21:13 <@EastByte> makes a lot of sense, I know
21:13 <@EastByte> we should steal the name and use it for a nim irc bot
21:13 <@deen> nimda4*
21:13 <@EastByte> heh
21:17 < Shiki> guys could you remove powerups from the ctf server?
21:17 < Shiki> deen: 
21:17 <@deen> ?
21:17 <@deen> i don't understand
21:18 < Shiki> on ctf2 there's a sword
21:18 < Shiki> it shouldn't be here
21:18 <@deen> i guess there's a server setting for that? no idea
21:18 <@deen> you mean on the ddnet vanilla servers?
21:18 <@deen> they should be default settings
21:19 < Shiki> yep, vanilla server
21:19 < Shiki> could you please set powerups 0?
21:20 < Shiki> thanks!
21:38 < Shiki> deen: could you tell me vanilla DDNet servers rcon by a chance?
21:38 < Shiki> we would like to have a game there but server is missing on some votes
21:39 <@deen> what votes are missing?
21:39 < Shiki> reload
21:39 <@deen> send me a list of the votes
21:39 <@deen> and I'll add them
21:39 < Shiki> ok, by email?
21:39 <@deen> there's restart 5
21:39 <@deen> why do you need reload?
21:40 < Shiki> dude could you come now to vanilla server?
21:40 < Shiki> it would explain few things
21:43 <@deen> I don't think i've seen our vanilla servers full before^^
21:52 < Shiki> I just showed the guys your wonderful servers ^^
21:54 <@deen> if anything else is missing, tell me
21:54 <@deen> or send me
21:54 <@deen> maps, settings in votes etc
22:47 < TRy> hey guys!
22:47 < TRy> i have question about protocol
22:48 < TRy> is there any rule for numbers that assigned to enum's elements in protocol.h file?
22:49 < TRy> i added new enum for generate new packet type but is doesnt work!
22:49 < fstd> are you talking about engine/shared/protocol.h or game/generated/protocol.h?
22:50 < TRy> engine/shared/protocol.h
22:51 < Savander> rules? i though enum works like: something = 0, next(1),next(2), next(3), something2 = 10, next(11), next(12)
22:51 < fstd> so a new NETMSG_?
22:51 < Savander> incrementation
22:52 <@deen> i think there is no space for more netmsgs :P
22:52 < TRy> really? :D coz i wanna add new netmsg
22:54 < TRy> i know about incrementation but when i add number to new elements it doesnt work 
22:55 < TRy> 0 works just for first element but not for the other!
23:10 < TRy> so no way to add new netmsg?
23:12 <@deen> i think you'd need a hack to extend the protocol
23:16 < TRy> how can i do it?? do you know?
23:17 <@deen> no, sorry
23:17 <@deen> we had some plans in here, but i didn'T read closely
23:20 < TRy> ok tnx
