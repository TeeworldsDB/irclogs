12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> didnt know that that was for that
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> There seems to be a glitch/bug or something that lets tees go through laser walls
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> on kobra 2
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> when you pass the freeze wall and activate the laser for other tees
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> sometimes you can fall through it
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not a bug
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its activating deactivating fast i think
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember it
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>

13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can troll with it xd
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> yeah
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> but it didnt happen before
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> u just can go through with speed no ? xd
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> just staying still
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> btw the issue where windows "beeps" when map changes also appears when people join a server, it depends on the player nickname
21:02 <+Learath2> I think it's the MOTD
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @Learath2 that dude "Lak | Duck" with special characters, it triggers the sound when he enters, when he joins a team and so on https://i.imgur.com/jI2p8qm.png
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> quick question, what is the command to change gamemode in autoexec_server.cfg?
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like i want dm in my ddnet server host
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @Learath2 it also triggers it when i write his nickname in chat
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you copy his name to here?
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> nope i died & left ðŸ˜…  i'll remember to do that when someone else will beep
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @Learath2 found it with google https://ddnet.tw/players/-315--229--1173--32--124--32-Duck/
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> him* Ä»Ã¥Ò• | Duck
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yeah that's it
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i rename my dummy like him to see
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> 
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/513831862326657024/2018-11-18_22-42-20.flv
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> from what i've gathered utf8 seems impossible just like that on the old windows console
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> Does the auto-updater work if DDNet is installed to Steam, but it's running without Steam?
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> is it possible to edit a demo, like not showing a specific tee?
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> everything is possible @sorgaxD but i guess finding someone who is willing to spend some time on it is harder
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> :'v
