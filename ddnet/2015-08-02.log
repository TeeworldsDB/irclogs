01:43 < uchar> hi
01:44 < uchar> how "X-Ray" know where is the background to hide it?
01:44 < uchar> by group position?
02:10 < uchar> /usr/bin/ld: other/curl/linux/lib64/libcrypto.a(dso_dlfcn.o): referencia sin definir al símbolo 'dlclose@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
02:43 < uchar> i can't compile client :\  -> /usr/bin/ld: other/curl/linux/lib64/libcrypto.a(dso_dlfcn.o): referencia sin definir al símbolo 'dlclose@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
02:43 < uchar> i try recompile libcurl and openssl but happens the same
02:54 < fstd> uchar: export LANG=C
02:55 < fstd> it won't fix the problem, but it will at least make the error message understandable to non-italian (?) people
02:55 < fstd> then, try to give some information about your environment
02:58 < uchar> /usr/bin/ld: other/curl/linux/lib64/libcrypto.a(dso_dlfcn.o): undefined reference to symbol 'dlclose@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
03:02 < fstd> uchar: that glibc is 13 years old
03:02 < fstd> i suspect dlclose simply doesn't exist in such an old version
03:02 < fstd> a glibc upgrade should fix it
03:06 < uchar> i'm on ubuntu 15.04 xD
03:17 < fstd> uchar: what does "dpkg -l | grep glibc" say? (pastebin if multiple lines)
03:18 < fstd> also, do you have /lib/libdl.* or /usr/lib/libdl.*
03:18 < uchar> umm return just nothing
03:19 < uchar> yesterday i can compile :S
03:21 < uchar> but perhaps use a not up-to-date repo... because today i restarted all my fork
03:22 < fstd> not sure what that means, but maybe "bam config" can fix it
03:22 < fstd> not enough information to be sure
03:24 < uchar> :\
03:24 < uchar> 0_0
03:24 < uchar> yes, works... but...
03:24 < uchar> ok
03:24 < uchar> :\
03:24 < uchar> thx fstd 
03:25 < uchar> ook... the fisrt time that i run bam i started it with a bad params
03:25 < uchar> and for this not generate good the config.lua uh?
03:25 < uchar> i'm using eclipse
03:26 < fstd> bam config forces bam to recreate config.lua.  i don't know if that step is implicit to other bam targets, but probably not
03:27 < fstd> eclipse?  sorry to hear it :)
03:27 < uchar> hahaha
03:27 < uchar> netbeans?
03:27 < fstd> a decent text editor made for programmers?
03:27 < uchar> emacs?
03:27 < fstd> that's an OS, not a text editor
03:28 < fstd> (but yes, certainly better than eclipse or netbeans)
03:28 < uchar> Not to be confused with eMac.
03:29 < uchar> i like for debugger with it.. simple click and go to line :P
03:30 < fstd> how can you know emacs but not that old joke about it being a great OS that lacks a good text editor?
03:30 < fstd> well, I like a debugger, too
03:30 < fstd> but i also like my toolchain being independent pieces rather than one big integrated pile of stuff
03:31 < uchar> you are in other level xDD
03:32 < fstd> i like flexibility, rather
03:32 < fstd> IDEs take a large part of that away in order to streamline the most common use cases
03:39 < uchar> if like you can do your own toolchains :P for me eclipse is nice because you for example can rename a one varible with simple shortcut... or see where are implementated one method/function with a simple click... and other cool stuff
03:40 < uchar> and i use it on the work... xDD
10:50 <@deen> uchar: That error you encountered happens because I compiled the static libs on Debian and some systems seem to have some problem with the glibc version. I'm not sure how to solve it, so the workaround is to install the libraries through apt-get and let bam make a new config
14:25 < Chairn> meh, i forgot how to make pull request :(
14:25 < Chairn> i added support for custom background in entities mode
14:28 < Chairn> is there a way to make a PR on only one commit, and not all?
14:33 < Learath2> Chairn: create a new branch from DDRace64 and cherry pick the single commit to that branch
14:33 < Learath2> push it pr it
14:47 < Chairn> i made a new branch, and pushed but not appearing on github,
14:51 < Chairn> i definetely dont understand this github thing...
15:15 < Learath2> Chairn: how did you push it ?
15:16 < Learath2> what I said should look somethjing like "git checkout DDRace64 , git checkout -b newbranch , git cherry-pick SHA , git push origin newbranch"
15:27 <@deen> The Tournament this evening should be pretty great
15:28 <@deen> in 4.5 hours
15:28 <@deen> new great map of our most popular map series, great loading screen, maybe english livestream
15:31 < uchar> deen this is caotic.. have two ppl working in the same thing?
15:32 <@deen> uchar: what?
15:32 < uchar> yesterday Aoe tell me to do background for entities (X-Ray) mode
15:32 < uchar> and today read
15:32 < uchar> Chairn> i added support for custom background in entities mode
15:33 <@deen> hm, yeah
15:33 <@deen> should check before so that there is no duplicate work =/
15:34 < uchar> where?
15:34 < uchar> how?
15:35 < uchar> i like waste may time in not duplicate the work XD
15:35 <@deen> i don't know, if you're working on a bigger project say so in the irc channel or make a github issue
15:35 <@deen> if Aoe told you and Chairn to work on the same thing, then tell Aoe he's an idiot
15:35 < Chairn> laxa already told me he is :P
15:36 < Chairn> but didnt know he asked uchar
15:36 < uchar> [01:46:30] unsigned char* (Alex): but, you need ask in ddnet forum, i can't made if not "aproval" :)
15:36 < uchar> [01:46:41] unsigned char* (Alex): for me ok...
15:36 < uchar> [01:46:41] unsigned char* (Alex): xD
15:36 < uchar> [01:47:10] The Infamous Aoe: deen said its nice
15:36 < Chairn> okay, im back, let's see if i can guess out how github works ^^
15:36 < Chairn> ehm
15:36 < Chairn> i did a simple thing, i can show you
15:37 < Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/commit/b3cd51187e8d067804636a010de4df0e225de49e
15:37 < uchar> np, don't like problems... all works fine at now..
15:37 < uchar> me go out xD and all solved
15:37 < uchar> ;)
15:37 < Chairn> well but i'd like to see what you've done too ;)
15:37 < Chairn> maybe you did it better ^^
15:38 < Chairn> cuz for instance, in my code, you have to reload game to change bg
15:40 < uchar> thx Chairn, np ;) continue your great work.
15:41 < uchar> i don't touch anything... if touch perhaps its ugly and hacky.... and don't like fuck the DDNet sourec
15:41 < uchar> xD
15:41 < Chairn> well, i dont change ddnet sources yet ^^, its my own repo
15:42 < Chairn> that's why im trying to figure out the branch thing, i think im almost done
15:43 < uchar> i see that here working in vertical... and i like work best in horizontal..
15:43 < uchar> P2P work
15:43 < uchar> ;)
15:51 < Chairn> well, no i dont understand
15:51 < Chairn> i made a new branch, but the previous commit are still here, i dont know how to make a new branch "in the past"
15:54 <@deen> you could remove the commits from the branch with a "git reset --hard REF"
16:19 <@deen> so some people report lags since updating to win10, but only when playing on the internet. I guess that's the p2p windows updates that are enabled by default
16:20 <@deen> should warn people that they probably can't play when their computer is seeding windows updates at full speed
16:28 < laxa> Chairn: git checkout commit
16:28 < laxa> then branch
16:28 < Chairn> doesnt work
16:28 < laxa> it works
16:28 < Chairn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5256021/send-a-pull-request-on-github-for-only-latest-commit
16:28 < Chairn> im trying this but it doesnt work for me
16:28 < laxa> first answer should work
16:29 < laxa> but you need to set upstream as def-/ddnet
16:29 < laxa> not your upstream
16:29 < laxa> otherwise that won't work
16:29 <@deen> ok, it was win10 p2p updates, meh
16:30 <@deen> I'll write a warning before i get more complaints about that
16:30 < Chairn> how i do this?
16:30 < laxa> configure an upstream remote
16:30 < Chairn> ...
16:30 < laxa> https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/
16:30 < laxa> then, checkout a branch from the upstream remote
16:30 < laxa> then cherrypick
16:30 < laxa> then push branch to your repo, then PR
16:31 < laxa> for cleaner development when making features
16:31 < laxa> make a branch for that feature and let master in peace on your repo
16:31 < laxa> that's a best practise when developping new features
16:31 < Chairn> fatal: remote already exist
16:32 < laxa> git remove -v ?
16:32 < Chairn> nah configuring remote
16:32 < laxa> Yes, but give output of that command
16:32 < Chairn> origin  https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet.git (fetch) origin  https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet.git (push) upstream        https://github.com/def-/ddnet.git (fetch) upstream        https://github.com/def-/ddnet.git (push)
16:33 < laxa> when then
16:33 < laxa> should work
16:33 < laxa> git checkout -b upstream upstream/DDRace64
16:33 < laxa> git checkout -b upstreammaster upstream/DDRace64
16:33 < laxa> *well then
16:34 < Chairn> fatal: Cannot update paths and switch to branch 'upstreammaster' at the same tim e.
16:34 < laxa> git remote update
16:34 < Chairn> fatal: Cannot update paths and switch to branch 'upstreammaster' at the same tim e.
16:34 < Chairn> again
16:35 < Chairn> Did you intend to checkout 'upstream/DDRace64' which can not be resolved as comm it?
16:36 < laxa> git status
16:37 < Chairn> nothing to commit
16:37 < Chairn> On branch Custombg You are currently cherry-picking commit b56b99b.   (all conflicts fixed: run "git cherry-pick --continue")   (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)  nothing to commit, working directory clean
16:37 < laxa> well, seems good
16:38 < Chairn> but on github, pr'ing is pr'ing all commits i've made, not the last one
16:38 < laxa> git push origin branchname
16:38 < Chairn> up-to-date
16:38 < laxa> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/tree/Custombg
16:38 < laxa> ?
16:39 < Chairn> 12 commits...
16:39 < laxa> ok
16:39 < laxa> so
16:39 < laxa> what commit you need into ddnet ?
16:40 < Chairn> the last one
16:40 < Chairn> http://i18.servimg.com/u/f18/11/55/83/62/pr_12_10.png
16:40 < laxa> give push power to your repo to laxa
16:41 < Chairn> done
16:43 < laxa> Ah
16:43 < laxa> I think I know why :D
16:43 < laxa> deen renamed DDRace64 to master ^^
16:45 < Chairn> any idea how to fix?
16:45 < laxa> changing the remote track to master instead of DDRace64
16:53 < Chairn> Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'DDRace64' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
16:54 < Chairn> help of git is so empty, not all the commands are showed...
16:59 < laxa> Chairn: I pushed to your repo the commit in feature-custom-background
17:00 < Chairn> but my git is not working anymire
17:00 < Chairn> cant change this Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'DDRace64' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
17:00 < laxa> git remote update
17:00 < laxa> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/tree/feature-custom-background
17:00 < Chairn> still the message when i pull
17:01 < Chairn> & your branch doesnt appear
17:01 < Chairn> when i do git branch
17:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Chairn opened pull request #268: Added support for custom background in entities. (master...feature-custom-background) http://git.io/vOcUC
17:57  * uchar is away: afk
18:06 < fstd> uchar: keep us updated
19:34 <@deen> 25 minutes until tournament
19:46 < WolfAlex> deen: is there a stream today?
19:47 <@deen> maybe
19:55 <@deen> probably not^^
20:18 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
20:18 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 705
20:18 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:18 < Learath2> nice numbers :)
20:48 < Nimda> Kobra 4 by Zerodin just released on Novice at 2015-08-02 19:59
20:58 < Chairn> !ddnetpeak
20:58 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 595
20:58 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:58 < Chairn> not even more for this tournament
21:07 <@deen> Chairn: hm?
21:08 <@deen> the 810 was at a dummy tournament, it doesn't really count^^
21:08 <@deen> our old record was 730 without dummeis
21:08 < Chairn> why not reset it every week/month?
21:09 <@deen> reset the !ddnetpeak?
21:09 <@deen> ask laxa, he made it :P
21:09 <@deen> I just look at http://ddnet.tw/stats/
21:09 < laxa> bot does the same, looks at ddnet.tw/stats
21:09 <@deen> no, ddnet.tw/status :P
21:10 <@deen> with an U
21:10 < laxa> oh right
21:11 <@deen> of course the winning team had to go to the emptiest server
21:11 <@deen> which i didn't watch^^
21:12 <@deen> This list is growing rather fast: http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/45/
21:13 <@deen> For comparison, Kobra 3 had far fewer finishes: http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/26/
21:13 <@deen> that was 1 year ago
21:13 < Learath2> deen: after you finish you can get back in the map with the stuff you got at the ending
21:13 <@deen> same average time, half the number of finishes
21:13 < Learath2> not sure if its a problem tho
21:13 <@deen> Learath2: i know, feature
21:14 <@deen> Learath2: same in all kobra maps
21:15 < Chairn> deen: so what do you think about custom bg?
21:15 <@deen> Chairn: not sure, i don't like it, but i know people want it
21:15 < Chairn> im not sure i rendered it in the good place, maybe better in render_map.cpp ^^
21:16 <@deen> No chance to make it selectable like the editor preview window?
21:16 <@deen> where you select images
21:16  * uchar is back (gone 03:19:22)
21:16 <@deen> right now you can just set it in f1, right?
21:16 < Chairn> indeed, i can work on it if needed
21:16 < Chairn> i can add it in ddnet menus
21:17 <@deen> and switching it without restart might not be too hard
21:17 < Chairn> yeah, i think that i should look into render_map.cpp
21:17 <@deen> but i don't know, i guess uchar can take a look if the implementation is fine, since he was working on that as well
21:17 < Chairn> i guess this is the file that renders all quads so
21:25 < uchar> or in CMapLayers::OnRender
21:26 < uchar> yes fstd next time, before start, i say it here :)
21:27 < uchar> but when i can start? when deen say yes? when you? why not use tags in github for determinate what issue its accepted, etc.. ?¿??
21:28 < uchar> s: accepted | s: undecided | s: deny | s: idk
21:28 < uchar> xD
21:29 < fstd> uchar: here's a useful read http://sackheads.org/~bnaylor/spew/away_msgs.html
21:29 < uchar> like: https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues
21:30 < uchar> ahhh
21:30 < uchar> xDD
21:30 < uchar> omg
21:31 < uchar> Tell it to X-Chat team
21:31 < uchar> or the ircd for delete AWAY command
21:31 < fstd> 21:31:49 [QuakeNet] -!- You have been marked as being away
21:32 < fstd> the ircd supports AWAY alright
21:32 < fstd> and xchat is certainly configurable in this regard
21:32 < uchar> really is a big problem?
21:32 < uchar> :\
21:32 < fstd> not yet
21:32 < fstd> i'm trying to avoid it becoming one
21:32 < laxa> imagine a chan of 500 people going away and spamming every 30 minutes
21:32 < fstd> have you even read the first paragraph (at least) of my link? :/
21:34 < uchar> isn't a script... its X-Chat but yeah.. i go to disable it.. first i need found where is it...
21:34 < uchar> O_o
21:34 < fstd> thanks
21:37 < uchar> in my times the ppl hate colours in that messages... its fine see that now hate all the msg xDD
21:41 < Chairn> cuz today, people are overwhelmed by too much information
21:41 < fstd> Chairn: it's more a SNR problem
21:41 < fstd> the away messages don't convey useful information, and hence add to the noise
21:41 < Chairn> i dont hear any sounds, except when you use my name in your msg ^^
21:42 < Chairn> im sure you can disable sound also
21:42 < fstd> what does sound have to do with this?
21:43 < fstd> ah, because noise? that doesn't imply sound
21:43 < uchar> the problem is that the ppl dont are interested if you are or not in the channel
21:43 < Chairn> oh i thought snr was a mistake and was snd(r and d are close)
21:43 < Chairn> but you meant sound noise ration...
21:43 < fstd> nah, SNR is signal-to-noise ratio
21:43 < fstd> i didn't meant sound anything :)
21:44 < Chairn> i dont think we can talk about snr for chat ^^
21:45 < uchar> because in one channel in that 200 ppl ares writting its imposible read with or without away notice messages
21:45 < uchar> xDD
21:45 < fstd> yes you can.  the signal is the messages you want to see, the noise is the, well, noise, you didn't want to see.
21:45 < uchar> for this invented Voice mode
21:45 < fstd> you might want to find out what "Noise" means in all sorts of technical contexts
21:45 < Chairn> i know what noise is, this is part of my studies
21:46 < fstd> if your studies are dealing with something accoustics, then we're talking about different meanings of the word noise
21:46 < Chairn> but you cant know what people want to see, or what they dont want
21:46 < Chairn> nah, im talking about signal processing
21:47 < fstd> Chairn: yes, you can.  we're in #ddnet, so people (by joining) express their intent to see ddnet-related conversations, at least
21:47 < fstd> on-topic messages would generally be 'signal'
21:47 < Chairn> in this case we're out of topic ^^
21:48 < fstd> yes, indeed
21:48 < fstd> but so are the away messages
21:48 < fstd> without that, this meta-noise would never have happened :)
21:49 < fstd> and unfortunately there is no on-topic way to address them, but i could have PM'ed uchar instead, admittedly.
21:49 < uchar> 1 line generates 20..
21:49 < fstd> noise amplifier!
21:50 < uchar> but np, i disable it :)
22:15 < Donate4DDNet> hi
22:16 < Donate4DDNet> hi
22:16 <@deen> hi Donate4DDNet 
22:16 < Donate4DDNet> deen?
22:16 <@deen> You stole .me's name
22:16 <@deen> :P
22:16 <@deen> Who are you?
22:16 < Donate4DDNet> wat? xd
22:16 <@deen> .me' used to have the name "#Donate4DDNet"
22:16 <@deen> at least in tournaments
22:16 < Donate4DDNet> ich bin win schlechter ddrace spieler ._.
22:17 < Donate4DDNet> ich war heute beim tournament mit dem namen
22:18 < Donate4DDNet> deen?
22:19 < Donate4DDNet> ich kenn mich hier nich aus
22:24 <@deen> Donate4DDNet: ja, der channel ist eigentlich englischsprachig
22:24 <@deen> und grÃ¶Ãtenteils fÃ¼r leute die an der ddnet-entwicklung interessiert sind
22:27 < Donate4DDNet> deen hast du skype ich habe fragen, map ideen und client idee
23:14 < Donate4DDNet> scheisse
23:14 < Donate4DDNet> internet abgestÃ¼rzt
23:38 <@deen> laxa: can you rename the DDNet YT channel to "DDNet - Old Hall of Fame" and write somewhere that it's not maintained anymore?
23:38 <@deen> people are confused and sometimes ask me if they can send me demos for that channel
23:42 < laxa> There will be a new one ?
23:42 <@deen> no
23:42 <@deen> but i want people to know it's not updated anymore
23:43 < laxa> https://www.youtube.com/user/DDraceNetwork/about
23:43 < laxa> Tell me if that's good enough for you
23:43 < laxa> anyway, if any day someone wanna work on that channel, I can give the logs.
23:44 < laxa> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=432624042
23:44 < laxa> Anw, teeworlds will be on steam :)
23:45 < laxa> heinrich5991: could you tell us how things are going forward with steam !
23:45 <@deen> laxa: ok, thanks
23:45 < laxa> Well, I could give you the logs so you can do whatever you want ^^
23:45 < laxa> only me and artkis have the access I think
23:46 <@deen> no thanks, don't need it
23:46 < laxa> maybe ama had it to change the background
23:46 < laxa> Just something that could be real good for ddnet
23:47 < laxa> since apparently it's just now a matter of time before teeworlds is on steam
23:47 < laxa> maybe you could find what we call nowadays a "community manager"
23:47 < laxa> that would tweet, take care of ddnet chan on youtube etc to promote teeworlds
23:47 < laxa> -that+who
23:47 <@deen> laxa: yeah, would love to have someone do that kind of stuff
23:48 <@deen> but no one offered their service so far
23:48 < laxa> Just in case someone offer you that service someday
23:48 < laxa> I think it would be pretty good
