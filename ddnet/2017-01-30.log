12:11 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: do you know what the NewClientNoAuthCallback is supposed to do differently from NewClientCallback?
12:14 <@EastByte> when a vanilla client connects via antispoof handshake, NewClientNoAuthCallback is called to bypass the auth state
12:14 <@EastByte> because the client already thinks that it is connected to the server
12:26 <@heinrich5991> ah
17:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #615: Add protocol extension with UUIDs (master...pr_ddnet_extendprotocol2) https://git.io/vDkRY
17:31 < necropotame> heinrich5991, what is the purpose of this PR?
17:31 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: I'm intending to add a couple of protocol messages
17:32 <@heinrich5991> and having a proper system in place helps
17:32 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: what do you think about this?
17:33 < necropotame> Could be nice, but i don't get it completly right now ^^
17:34 < necropotame> You want to no more rely on NETMSG for future messages. But this still suppose that everything is hard-coded in the client, no?
17:39 <@heinrich5991> hm?
17:39 <@heinrich5991> this is just for adding new messages client-server in a backward-compatible way
17:39 <@heinrich5991> even if multiple people decide to do that at once
19:32 < necropotame> OK. The idea is nice :) I will maybe take this for TeeUniverse in order to make things more flexible
19:33 < necropotame> For DDNet, you now better than me if it's needed :) 
21:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 closed pull request #326: Proposition: Extend the protocol using NETMSG_NULL (master...pr_extendprotocol) https://git.io/vZfLX
23:29 < o_be_one> hello
23:30 < o_be_one> EastByte: to inform you, DDNet CAN will expires on 2017-02-10.
23:30 <@EastByte> okay, ack
23:59 < o_be_one> thanks :)
