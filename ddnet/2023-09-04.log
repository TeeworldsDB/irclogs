09:17 < ChillerDragon> oh no... now thats embarassing
09:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> awesome
09:23 < bridge_> <murpi> There's a space between the @mention and the discriminator, so no not confused üëÄ
09:34 < ChillerDragon> wots a discrimnator
09:34 < ChillerDragon> i dont see any space
09:35 < ChillerDragon> omg jospti @Jupstar ‚ú™ your typo commit broke my physics :D 
09:35 < ChillerDragon> good that im debugging god
09:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh wow
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon what typo commit?
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I haven't done anything since few thousand years

11:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice logo chiller
11:28 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> chiller best logger
12:11 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i need help converting this to JS
12:20 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> I got it, ChatGPT helped me on that one :o
12:22 < ChillerDragon> thanks ryowo
12:26 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 why can the value of closeness be > 1 tho?
12:27 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> with high distances
12:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> oh nvm
12:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> it was cut off i didnt see the e
14:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://corrode.dev/blog/illegal-state/
14:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> cool üôÇ what's the result?
15:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://goto.ucsd.edu/~ucsdpl-blog/liquidtypes/2015/09/19/liquid-types/
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pleasantly surprised, decided to try my ps5 controller i bought to play games with bluetooth on gentoo
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 0 issues
15:32 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm so glad they stopped making the controllers as incompatible as possible
15:32 < bridge_> <learath2> DS3 was such a pita to connect to a computer
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 also USB-C is the best invention of human kind
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i bought the controller but it came with no charger
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my mobile uses usb-c charger
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so i just use it
15:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Thank god we also got over the early adoption hiccups of usbc, some devices used to do PD negotiation wrong so would get fried if you didn‚Äôt use the correct charger
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as long as its a high quality charger i think it does auto adapting based on power needs
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on some levels or smth
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh so its that
15:36 < bridge_> <learath2> The device and the charger negotiate the highest voltage-current combination they both support
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye thats epic
15:37 < bridge_> <learath2> There are some remaining issues like some vendors using weird non-standard levels so only their own charger can fast charge‚Ä¶
15:38 < bridge_> <learath2> My samsung s21 can do 25W ‚Äúsuper fast charging‚Äù but not with any of my chargers that can do up to 90W, only with their own charger
15:40 < bridge_> <learath2> I think it requires a silly 10V that no charger except theirs support üòõ
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i use my chinese mobile phone 33w charger
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:41 < bridge_> <learath2> What is your phone?
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i lost my redmi note 11 pro which had a 67w charger
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now i have the redmi note 12
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it came with a 33w
15:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, it‚Äôs own charger. Yeah that is usually fine
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> honestly
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wanted to get a pixel but i couldnt get it the same day
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nor i found it at the store i went
15:43 < bridge_> <learath2> Just need one more EU directive to regulate voltage levels and we‚Äôll be in a utopia
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i needed a phone hastly
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sad
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> next time xd
15:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Get a Fairphone
15:49 < bridge_> <learath2> You can even have linux on it üòÑ
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> looks good tbh
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just was in a rly hurry and didnt think much
15:51 < bridge_> <teero777> yea imagine a tiling wm on a phone. Everytime u wanna do smth you have to plug a keyboard in :monkaStop:
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but next would be a fairphone 5
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or 6 if it exists then
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur memeing too much
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> linux is used on every phone
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also steamdeck runs linux
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u dont need a keyboard
15:52 < bridge_> <teero777> kk I'll slow down
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nah u can keep at it xd
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but ill meme as much about winshit
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
15:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Well android is linux at it‚Äôs core but you can literally have ubuntu on a fairphone üòÑ
15:53 < bridge_> <teero777> I don't use Windows :gigachad:
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
15:53 < bridge_> <teero777> anti Microsoft :f3:
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think im fine with android xd
15:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just wish android wasnt so anti-user with things like apps not coming from play store
15:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fdroid is awesome
15:54 < bridge_> <teero777> I feel like sometimes default android really limits you. for
15:54 < bridge_> <teero777> I feel like sometimes default android really limits you.
15:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont rly use my phone in exotic ways
15:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for that i have my nasa pc
15:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wish i wasnt lazy and made my own useful apps for myself somewhen tho
15:55 < bridge_> <teero777> me neither but I want to see the clock seconds on my home screen and I can't
15:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Does anyone here electronics?
15:59 < bridge_> <reitw> Android stock is prob the best
16:16 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> I have made a handwired keyboard and wire stuff up to each other from time to time. I am noob though in circuits if you mean that.
16:19 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm intersted in them though and would learn more though ;)

18:13 < bridge_> <Voxel> :justatest:
18:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> wanted to make a voronoi diagram generator from scratch
18:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> found someone whos making `everything` from scratch
18:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://youtu.be/kT-Mz87-HcQ
18:16 < bridge_> <learath2> 61 is still red/pinkish. I'll allow it
18:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> 80% done by ChatGPT btw

18:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> (it's HTML)
18:17 < bridge_> <Voxel> For the image?
18:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> yes
18:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> ok yeah im not doing in image like that manually, especially if the colors are generated LOL
18:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> i guess this usecase makes sense
18:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's using JavaScript, I wouldn't have told ChatGPT to generate a static HTML :justatest:
18:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> xd
18:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> i cant argue with that

18:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> @ryozuki i think youd be interested
18:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this feature makes lot of sense
18:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its easier to distinguish now
18:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk how color blindness comes into this, since similar colors are confusing for everyone iimho
18:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill be honest, i rarely watch videos about programming
18:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but fan fuct
18:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fact
18:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i used to watch that streamer sometimes
18:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he also made 1 pr to teeworlds

18:37 < bridge_> <Voxel> u were afk
18:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> Give ChatGPT the file and tell it to adapt üòÑ
18:38 < bridge_> <teero777> hes streaming rn
18:38 < bridge_> <teero777> fun stream.

18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon bold of u to assume i have a backyard lol
18:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> whats the point
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> that its funny
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> original
18:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> is it just a joke
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no?
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to post in forums
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u need to solve this
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> everytime u post
18:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> captcha
18:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's cool but technically it should be very easy to solve for bots?
18:43 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wonder if it detects a move a bot would typically make
18:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> But this puzzle says "Black to checkmate in one move", so you only need to move one piece
18:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> I suppose is could detect unnatural mouse movement like the google captcha where you just click the checkbox
18:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nevermind this was yesterday i think
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ty
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i meant old color new color
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u know
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like sorted by the actual color
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but with new team name
18:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> I see
18:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Not sure if ChatGPT can understand that xD
18:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it suprisingly often understands questions from me, that even i don't understand
18:47 < bridge_> <Voxel> I mean if you word it right It could understand
18:47 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any idea why 149.202.127.134:8707 does not show up in the master? I tried this ``curl -s https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json | jq . | grep 8707``
18:47 < bridge_> <Voxel> something like "sort the new team array in chromatical order"
18:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its cuz master doesnt like u
18:48 < ChillerDragon> :c
18:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u been a bad tee
18:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> too many bots
18:48 < ChillerDragon> no proof
18:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :monkaStop:
18:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> > no proof
18:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> xd sure
18:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Sorted by color

18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic
18:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> Still a full rainbow
18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did gpt create this?
18:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> ChatGPT produced mostly garbage but it gave me the correct idea
18:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> `newDivs.sort((a, b) => a.hue - b.hue);`
18:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Just sort the divs, doh
18:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well that's something
18:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it understood it must use hue
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pin that already in questions/bugs xDD
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some ppl will be mad
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my new team is 50 now
18:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> my new team is 16 methinks
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we were close in the past
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now we different

21:12 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Sure
21:37 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> I asked ChatGPT:

21:47 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> > Scalability: Right now, the CCharacter class assumes there will always be 5 weapons. Depending on your game's design, you might want to consider a more flexible design, like using a std::vector instead of an array for weapons.
21:47 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> You should've given us custom weapons!!11!1
22:25 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> There is nothing in the server logs
22:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if there's literally nothing in the server logs, then you should turn server logs on. if there's nothing about registering in the server logs, maybe you have `sv_register 0`?
22:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs default 1
22:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> You mean a higher log level than default?
22:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Shouldn‚Äôt Master errors and warnings be logged with the default output level?
22:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm saying if you don't have any log messages at all, then you're not logging
22:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you have log messages, but no messages about initial register, then it seems you're not even trying to register?
22:31 < ChillerDragon> i mean yea logs are printing sure
22:31 < ChillerDragon> but i dont see anything master related what am i looking for?
22:32 < ChillerDragon> ah yea indeed there is not registering being printed hmm
22:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> anything with `register` anywhere
22:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> when I start a server, I see a couple of lines mentioning `register` somewhere
22:34 < ChillerDragon> yea those are missing
22:34 < ChillerDragon> weird i probably messed something up in my fork then
22:36 < ChillerDragon> maybe a curl version thing?
22:37 < ChillerDragon> the same codebase prints register stuff on my local machine hmm
22:43 < ChillerDragon> hmmm sv_register 1 does the job
22:43 < ChillerDragon> oh
22:44 < ChillerDragon> is sv_register ipv4 no longer working?
22:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> should work
22:46 < ChillerDragon> ok somehow on my vps sv_register is set to 0
22:46 < ChillerDragon> not sure how that happend
22:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it'd be nice if you actually verified what I'm asking of you
22:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> would have cut this a little shorter
22:47 < ChillerDragon> dood who would have thought
22:47 < ChillerDragon> im hosting servers since a decade and ppl keep mentioning sv_register 1
22:47 < ChillerDragon> it was never 0
22:47 < ChillerDragon> ever
22:47 < ChillerDragon> im super confused how that happend and currently investigating
22:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, that's why we're debugging together
22:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and verifying things together
22:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> while debugging it's good to put away "things I know"
22:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because apparently something isn't like I know it
22:48 < ChillerDragon> also i did check it eventually didnt i
22:49 < ChillerDragon> i was mobile when you mentioned it
22:49 < ChillerDragon> i never set sv_register to 0 in my life
22:49 < ChillerDragon> it was always the default
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> when im trying build my own client(not cheat)
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> im taking this error
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> CMake Error at cmake/FindSSP.cmake:12 (message):
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s>   could not find ssp paths
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> Call Stack (most recent call first):
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s>   CMakeLists.txt:580 (find_package)
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> i researched it
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> but i dont found anything
23:02 < bridge_> <mei.s> but i didnt found anything
23:04 < ChillerDragon> ah got it apt installed a system wide /usr/share/ddnet/data/autoexec_server.cfg which sets sv_register 0 @heinrich5991 
23:04 < bridge_> <learath2> This is what I've been concerned about with the storage system :/
23:04 < ChillerDragon> when?
23:05 < ChillerDragon> the storage system is older than ryozuki isnt it?
23:05 < bridge_> <learath2> The data directory integrity PR I did a while back, I never rebased and got it merged because I feel it'll decimate some package manager managed files somehow
23:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> won't have rights to do that, right?
23:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> btw, maybe we should quit when running as root üòÑ
23:07 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes but each installation should ideally only ever touch it's own data folder
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> git submodule update
23:08 < bridge_> <learath2> It even trying that is scary to me
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also try clean build dir, just to be sure
23:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we could only do it in a build with an autoupdater or steam
23:09 < bridge_> <learath2> steam has it's own integrity check
23:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then only autoupdater
23:10 < bridge_> <learath2> Ideally storage system should only ever use a data directory directly next to the binary, or a compiled in directory for distro packaging
23:11 < bridge_> <mei.s> wdym
23:11 < bridge_> <mei.s> how can i do this
23:12 < bridge_> <Iza> (amnogus sus music plays)
23:16 < bridge_> <mei.s> NO
23:16 < bridge_> <mei.s> I NEVER USED
23:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Git bash
23:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how did you get your version of ddnet?
23:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> using msvs?
23:26 < bridge_> <mei.s> guys im so idiot for answer this questions
23:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> git gud
23:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just blame Windows
23:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But somehow u managed to get to the build process
23:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe just explain that
23:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how did you download the ddnet source code?
23:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> What‚Äôs this for
23:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> team colors
23:45 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> is gud a real command
23:45 < ChillerDragon> no
23:45 < ChillerDragon> its slang for "git is good"
23:46 < ChillerDragon> or "get good" :D
23:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> now adjacent teams have more distinct colors
23:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> cool
23:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> Sad though
23:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why sad?
23:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> Can no longer choose team colors by number without looking it up
23:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> Like I join 25 because it‚Äôs a nice green. Now instead of joining 26 when 25 is taken, I have to look up the table and find a similar green
23:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ¬±13 seems to work
23:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> Good to know
