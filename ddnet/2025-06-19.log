03:10 < bridge> <totar> I was thinking about this. Does the client correctly handle player ID mapping as it is currently? There's some amount of state that gets saved to each client, but if you're mixing the client IDs then the client will mix the state from other clients.
03:12 < bridge> <totar> I guess this doesn't have any major effects right now but it's a new constraint that the client didn't have before
03:19 < bridge> <totar> unless I'm blind and I'm missing somewhere that the ``CClientData`` for each client gets reset ID mapping is a rather terrifying prospect because the client seems to just assume that the ``CClientData m_aClients[MAX_CLIENTS];`` array is always stable.

08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> real gamers would join me on nujabes rn
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i sent a vital message from antibot and got no response from the client? Happend like 2 out of 80 times. Is that technically possible or am i stupid?
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the net message sending goes through the main server and should be stored in the resend backup buffer. If the client does not ack the vital message the server should automatically resend right?
09:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> udp is udp
09:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> packet loss go brr
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but resend
09:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or do vitals get resend
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oke
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sometimes during stronger lags i feel like even chat messages get lost somtimes
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure if my assumptions about resend reliability were correct
09:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just merged 2 commits into chillerbot and get cp on join gg
10:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont get it @robyt3 sos
10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet master works fine for me but in my fork i get instant connection problems when joing a server
10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reverting https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10383 fixes it
10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it merged without conflicts skimming the pr i dont see what i missed. Do i need to apply some changes somewhere?
10:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "cp"?
10:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> connection problems
10:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ChillerDragon: what server did you join
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my fng
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try other
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i basically cant stay online on any server for longer than 1 tick
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how does that make any sense?
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont recall editing any interesting in my client that should be related to such low level networking
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is my entire diff to ddnet how can the networking break in my client? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/xd @robyt3 
10:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the most crazy thing i pull in is curses but even unlinking that does not help
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Are you sure you merged it completely? The only files you changed that seems relevant are probably `client.h/cpp` and `system.h/cpp`. Did you change anything network related there?
10:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you change `NETTYPE` constants maybe and now a value is duplicated?
10:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Being able to connect but not stay is weird though, no idea how this low-level change cause such a high level problem.
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the network traffic also looks healthy at first glance
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my diff in system.h/cpp is as simple as it gets its only 2 lines for logger
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wdym merged completley? ``git merge`` just ran through
10:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean without conflicts and potentially losing changes during conflict resolution
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no there was no conflict
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because all the network stuff is untouched
10:50 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, you might have to add some more detailed log messages to figure out what breaks. I don't see how this PR would effect it at such a high level, as it doesn't change anything about the protocol. It only removed a branch for websockets from the network server, but websockets should be irrelevant for you.
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my client.h diff is also tiny af
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea it makes no sense to me either @robyt3 
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure what to log
10:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Try to figure out which is the first message that is broken or the last message that works
10:51 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess wireshark would be useful
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wireshark looks good
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do you define broken in that context?
10:51 < bridge> <robyt3> When you get connection problems
10:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Is there no noticable change in wireshark?
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at first glance it looks good
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i send inputs and get snaps
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1750323159.png
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tested ipv6 and ipv4 no diff
10:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Have you tried ASAN/UBSAN/Valgrind already? Maybe some undefined behavior surfacing now for some reason.
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wish i could revert the pr line by line and test but its such a big refactor
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought somehow removing the ``struct`` unlocked some wonkeyness cuz i linked curses or something like that
10:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I tried to split non-websocket changes, but in the end it wasn't really worth it
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm ...
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> asan works
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as in no cp
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxD?
10:56 < bridge> <robyt3> :justatest:
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme delete build dir
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm now other works too
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i messed something up
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> It's not very new tbh. Large servers have been mapping ids forever now
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait was this really a cmake/make error?
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had it going back and forth with reverting and resetting the commit
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in a fork and a fork of a fork
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ???
10:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe it was an entirely unrelated network problem that has also been fixed
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay so in my fork of the fork i reverted the revert and i can still reproduce xd
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try make clean
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt help
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm maybe its release vs debug
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes it is
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not cmake cache issue
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a release only issue
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok asan with relwithdebinfo it is then
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> issue does not exist in relwithdebinfo either?
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?????????????????
11:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Does relwithdebinfo use full optimizations?
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i always thought its the ultimate hack for release only bugs
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok i have some interesting NEWS
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good for 
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bad for u
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can reproduce on ddnet master
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the only difference was my ddnet build was debug and my chillerbot gaming build was release
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i blamed my fork
11:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I had a weird issue that I needed to debug in the Ubuntu CI where the compiler in release mode with stack protector found an out-of-bounds memcpy that did not make sense in `sockaddr_to_netaddr`. I fixed it by using `sockaddr_storage` for the addresses, which was apparently previously overshadowed by much larger char buffer.
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lets increase our CI times from 200 minues to 400 minutes to also cover release only bugs xd
11:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> LOL no way its actually bound to release
11:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385185742090797106/image.png?ex=68552640&is=6853d4c0&hm=8402c61d973921f0dc5edb190244e0b5b3cfff5759d919f97ebb168141b778d3&
11:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> can reproduce kekekekekek
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we burned down half the amazonas with the bloat ass CI that has full on integration end to end big ass tests and somehow a bug that makes connecting impossible slipped through?
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such a waste
11:14 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> xd
11:14 < bridge> <totar> Yeah but that's not the same as supporting it as an official feature.  It happens to work fine right now without and visible issues because none of the features are too sensitive too it
11:14 < bridge> <totar> Yeah but that's not the same as supporting it as an official feature.  It happens to work fine right now without any visible issues because none of the features are too sensitive too it
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blaiszephyr i used to do gaming in debug mode when my client had crashes. But now i use release mode to increase my tw skill by 20%
11:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> (i always build in debug because i want to know when stuff goes boom)
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Real pros play with valgrind
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar 2fps enjoyer confirmed
11:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Is it really the clients that are broken? I think its the server
11:22 < bridge> <learath2> Well it's not but if we break anything about it fokkonaut will show up and complain
11:22 < bridge> <robyt3> It works with server in relwithdebug and client in release
11:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> can reproduce with release && releasewithdebinfo
11:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> cant reproduce in debug
11:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> can reproduce with release && releasewithdebinfo
11:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> cant reproduce in debug (client only)
11:23 < bridge> <robyt3> Also somewhat broken for me on Windows with MSYS2 in release mode, but works in relwithdebug. When I keep connecting and disconnecting it sometimes gets stuck on the connecting screen and sometimes I get ingame and there is still an old player of me online.
11:23 < bridge> <totar> But Chiller says it breaks on any server, how can it be the servers fault?
11:24 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> isnt, it crashes on Teeworlds source based servers aswell
11:24 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> (blockworlds for example)
11:24 < bridge> <totar> yes exactly, you can't blame a server that hasn't been rebuilt in the last 5 years
11:24 < bridge> <robyt3> It crashes even?
11:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> "timeouts*"
11:25 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385188617512681531/image.png?ex=685528ed&is=6853d76d&hm=4baba7db616f6618c602b5ae05b67554a39d1df535cf911839cf8500defb6f04&
11:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> wording paired with quick typing is hard - sorry
11:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like the client works on Windows with MSYS2 but there are weird issues with the server
11:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> consequences are very much faced, as long as ther eis an attempt to keep visible players the same id its fine
11:29 < bridge> <totar> I think it probably only works reasonably well because there's never a huge pile of 128 tees, if you were swapping clients close to every snapshot I think it would be visibily horrible
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385189895974158426/image.png?ex=68552a1e&is=6853d89e&hm=90af0d23204f0de92f2aa1470916e99f3e3f62ac0cc02784f702d6b53d145a38&
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the client supports 128 tees anyway now
11:30 < bridge> <totar> well yeah
11:30 < bridge> <totar> but 256?
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think the server would die
11:30 < bridge> <totar> it could handle it
11:30 < bridge> <totar> if it was good enough
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> O(n^2) collisions go brrr
11:30 < bridge> <totar> those are not that hard to fix
11:31 < bridge> <totar> if you don't need flawless accuracy on your 256 player server you can have it fixed in a few minutes
11:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> surely grid just works
11:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> of width hook length  / 2 or something
11:31 < bridge> <totar> yeah it does except for those rotating laser beam things
11:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> the new ones?
11:32 < bridge> <totar> no
11:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can check multiple points along the lazer
11:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :Sure:
11:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for potential tees
11:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you should check every half grid width just to be sure even though that will probably have duplicates
11:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (well if your lazer is near a 90 degree interval you can do every grid width)
11:33 < bridge> <totar> I mean it's either going to be O(n(tees) * n(lasers)) or it's going to be O(n(number of tiles the laser occupies)*n(tees))
11:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (i doubt its much of a save)
11:34 < bridge> <totar> but most maps don't have a huge number of those so you can just leave it on the old physics
11:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the collision is done by a min distance to lazer < tee width
11:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is O(1) per tee no matter the length
11:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (i hope)
11:34 < bridge> <totar> O(1) per tee, per laser = O(n*m)
11:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> laser = n, tees = m?
11:35 < bridge> <totar> sure
11:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the thing we are trying to reduce is m by using a grid
11:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you only check tees on the grid spaces along points of the lazer
11:35 < bridge> <Assa> looks to me like a range based kd tree
11:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think it makes much of a difference
11:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the current collision?
11:36 < bridge> <totar> it's not that important, you can solve it in various ways
11:36 < bridge> <totar> idk why I brought it up
11:36 < bridge> <totar> it's just the most annoying part of O(n) physics
11:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a partitioning thing is harder and probably wont offer much benefit
11:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maps are quite small
11:37 < bridge> <totar> quad tree is overkill yeah
11:37 < bridge> <totar> just do what ddnet-rs does, direct array or hashmap if the map is really big
11:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yep
11:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh no virtual call!!!
11:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> grp not really
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont have to do it with oop xd
11:38 < bridge> <totar> virtual call?
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(m_usinghaashmap)...else...
11:38 < bridge> <totar> mmm
11:38 < bridge> <totar> I think the hashing part is the slow part
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im oop pilled
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for just 2 small ints you can probably get a pretty good fast hash
11:38 < bridge> <totar> true ig
11:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not using standard containers would make a huge difference, but that difference is probably from the order of nanoseconds to less nanoseconds
11:39 < bridge> <totar> idk I'm endlessly annoyed that the std hash containers are 10-30x slower than every other implementation for seemingly no good reason
11:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why... are they like that
11:39 < bridge> <totar> I don't know
11:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unordered_map seems really minimal
11:40 < bridge> <totar> they are the worst containers the stl provides
11:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bye bye
11:41 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: Do you also get large FPS drops when pressing the Disconnect button with the PR reverted? I confirmed that reverting it would fix it, but I noticed when I press the Disconnect button it hangs for a while. It doesn't hang in debug and relwithdebug modes.

11:51 < bridge> <robyt3> The delay was probably from websockets
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 im in a gores run now cant rly check :/
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do you confirm can u reproduce on windows?
12:07 < bridge> <robyt3> It's fine, I think it was just from additionally adding websockets, which are TCP
12:07 < bridge> <robyt3> When connecting repeatedly to a server it doesn't work or I connect but my previous player is still connected

12:29 < bridge> <vahemaaa> yes
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not connecting idk y
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant play with hoomans if i wanted to cuz ping
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what happened to my spectate button?
12:29 < bridge> <totar> I ate it
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wanted that
12:29 < bridge> <totar> Yummy
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> noo
12:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can you eat the dummy connection not working
12:30 < bridge> <totar> Not yummy
12:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ill give u spectate buttons if u do
12:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> balanced diet
12:31 < bridge> <totar> Is it the ger10 or whatever number with the extra ddos protection
12:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ger1
12:31 < bridge> <totar> Idk
12:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i can connect fine
12:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> connecting 2 clients is fine
12:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just no dummy
12:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> connecting dummy on second client worked
12:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I need some compiler experts. How does this patch fix the complex issue of not being able to connect? (#10384)
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> 
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> ```patch
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> static void sockaddr_to_netaddr(const sockaddr *src, socklen_t src_len, NETADDR *dst)
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3>  {
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> -       *dst = NETADDR_ZEROED;
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> +       mem_zero(dst, sizeof(NETADDR));
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3>         if(src->sa_family == AF_INET && src_len >= (socklen_t)sizeof(sockaddr_in))
12:44 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
12:44 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10384
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean there is potentially a 2-byte padding in NETADDR which is not zero with the NETADDR_ZEROED
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I dunno, makes no sense to me
12:59 < bridge> <robyt3> I checked with mem_comp and they should both be identical
12:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Might be strict aliasing because using sockaddr is always undefined behavior apparently
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do asan&ubsan not find the issue here or what?
13:03 < bridge> <robyt3> It doesn't happen without optimization I think
13:03 < bridge> <robyt3> If it did, it should have caught it in the CI

13:26 < bridge> <pioooooo> it seems to fit in 2 bytes
13:27 < bridge> <pioooooo> idk
13:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't seem related to that enum to me
13:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Something is weird about the `NETADDR_ZEROED` though. It also works if I do `*dst = NETADDR_ZEROED2;` and initialize the variable with `mem_zero(&NETADDR_ZEROED2, sizeof(NETADDR_ZEROED2));` in `net_init`.
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> How is NETADDR_ZEROED initialized?
13:36 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/tree/Testing-Netaddr
13:37 < bridge> <robyt3> It doesn't work if `NETADDR_ZEROED` is static const or extern const
13:37 < bridge> <learath2> You can also attempt to observe the result. Observe the memory at dst. See what happens to it after assignment
13:38 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, something about the way static initialization is done? It is a rather quirky thing
13:39 < bridge> <robyt3> But also related to optimization of the const value I guess
13:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Good idea, looks like there are garbage bytes at the end of the address sometimes
13:45 < bridge> <robyt3> So I guess @jupeyy_keks was right and it's padding
13:45 < bridge> <learath2> So why is what is meant to be padding changing observable behaviour? üòÑ
13:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Because net address comparison considers the entire size of the NETADDR
13:46 < bridge> <learath2> Ah
13:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Should we change the comparison or ensure the padding is zeroed?
13:47 < bridge> <robyt3> I wanted to replace all `mem_zero(addr, sizeof(NETADDR));` with `*addr = NETADDR_ZEROED;` separately
13:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Guess I should have done that first, which would have been easier to pinpoint
13:48 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I'd fix the comparison honestly, it is IMO fundamentally flawed
13:49 < bridge> <learath2> But it might come at a performance penalty if the padding isn't one continuous block. Is it?
13:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Might impact performance if we reimplement the address comparison without mem_comp
13:51 < bridge> <learath2> If the padding is one continuous block, the compiler should be smart enough to optimize it back up for us
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> ```diff
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> typedef struct NETADDR
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> {
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3>     unsigned int type;
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3>     unsigned char ip[16];
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3>     unsigned short port;
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> +    unsigned char _padding[2];

13:55 < bridge> <robyt3>     bool operator!=(const NETADDR &other) const;
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3>     bool operator<(const NETADDR &other) const;
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> } NETADDR;
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> 
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> ```diff
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> - const NETADDR NETADDR_ZEROED = {NETTYPE_INVALID, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, 0};

13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
13:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Works for me.
14:04 < bridge> <learath2> I guess that also works, but it's not exactly completely portable
14:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, adjusting the comparison functions is a lot cleaner
14:05 < bridge> <learath2> Not like any of the implementations it wouldn't work on still exist, nor the rest of our code can cope with them
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if theres no padding between the elements
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a.type == b.type &&
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mem_cmp(a.ip, b.ip, sizeof(a.ip)) == 0 &&
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a.port == b.port
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> should optimize down to a memcmp anyway
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or whatever a memcmp optimizes down to

15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> is that cpu special or smth
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> yooo wtf happened to the dev role
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> nice colors
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> yoo
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> im special lol
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
15:11 < bridge> <teero777> i wish i had one
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also want a epyc
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> just looked, the intel cpu is from 2021
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> not special
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> 5ghz in 2021 is dope tho
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> Intel¬Æ SSE4.1, Intel¬Æ SSE4.2, Intel¬Æ AVX2, Intel¬Æ AVX-512
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> it actually has avx 512 lol
15:14 < bridge> <teero777> using avx512 can actually make my physics lib even faster but like only 0.5% of cpus support it so it doesn't make much sens

15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ffmpeg does it
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have avx512 at home
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> all new lines of amd do have it
15:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> why is only devrole special
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> the main reason is that my cpu doesnt support avx512 so i can't test it xD
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> make it
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i test it
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> yes im donwloading avx512 to my cpu
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> yes im downloading avx512 to my cpu
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can code without having the cpu xd
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> download more ram
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> well ofc i can but who knows if it works
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> then i have to ask jupstar again
15:18 < bridge> <anthonyyx> wtf u got cool color on ur roles
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats where i come
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have avx512 i just said i can test for u
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> kk
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> when i do make i'll let you test

15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
15:19 < bridge> <zhn> ripbozo
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> first i need to fix horrible physics issues that have never happened in any of my tests but happen only when im not looking
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> when i independently test the issue it doesn't happen in the physics. So there must be something else to trigger it from the algorithm layer. And it's not memory corruption or anything that is easily detected
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> i have no idea why
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> but the character and projectiles just phase through walls if projectiles are fired and it isn't even consistent. and if i try the physics in my tas tool they work just fine

15:45 < bridge> <_qey> Also my automated bans for hack clients average 50-60 a day, which in turn tanks the online. Should I disable the automation for the sake of keeping servers alive?

15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say seasons
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think peaked at winter
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think summer usually has less players
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah its also trend

15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> and go*
15:48 < bridge> <_qey> I get that, but 50%?
15:50 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôm not allowing hackers per se, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ Weakening the moderation efforts? AFAIK, it‚Äôs not allowed by the DDNet-wide rules to allow hack clients, BUT there are servers that outright allow it and not being master-banned.
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think ur confusing stuff, u as a server owner, can allow hackers in ur own server, ddnet rules are only for ddnet official servers, what apply to all servers are master server rules, which for example dont allow faking players

15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> this are the rules for all servers
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> > After some issues with mods, this ruleset has been established for servers in the server list:
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     A modified Teeworlds server must not use a standard gametype (dm, tdm, ctf, lms, lts)
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     0.6.x and previous: The player count shown must resemble the amount of human players. The maximum player count must be the maximum number of human players.
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     0.7.x and later: You can also include non-human players using a special bot flag. This allows client-side filtering.
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Do not host an excessive amount of servers. There is no fixed limit but try to not overdo it. (i.e. there should be people playing on them eventually)
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Do not host servers purely for advertising purposes (e.g. passworded & having only an advertisement as name; having sponsoring info or the likes in the server name is perfectly fine).
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is from teeworlds
15:57 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> we cant control your server, but we control our own and the masterserver
15:57 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> we forbid advertisement of cheats, and took down servers that faked a high playcount or other people to prevent IP grabbers
15:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> we cant control your server, but we control our own and the masterserver
15:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> we forbid advertisement of cheats, and took down servers that faked a high playcount or other people to prevent IP grabbers, aswell as the HvH network (i wont go into detail what that network is)
15:58 < bridge> <_qey> So I‚Äôm free to create a HvH server?
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr what is a HvH im ootl
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:58 < bridge> <_qey> And it won‚Äôt be master-banned?
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> u opened this can

15:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> HvH will be removed on sight
15:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> HvH will be removed on sight if its hosted over our masterserver
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess its some kind of malicious server
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought u were a dev not a script kiddy
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> once again im  disapointed
15:59 < bridge> <_qey> Now, see, I‚Äôm confused. Allowing is allowed, but HvH (if visible) is not?
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if your server is called
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> BEST BLOCKER SERVER EUW COME JOIN FREE COOKIES
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> and you dont moderate it against cheaters, why should we take it down
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if your server however is called "HvH TOURNAMENTS DAILY CHECK OUR WEBSITE" - we'll remove it.
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> hacker vs hacker
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 7timeout ryozuki 9999999999
16:01 < bridge> <_qey> Who? Why? What?
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> nothing xd
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> just self rumblings
16:02 < bridge> <_qey> So‚Ä¶ I see it as: I can ALLOW in the rules of my OWN server to use hack clients. And it WONT be master-banned?
16:02 < bridge> <_qey> No advertisement.
16:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> do whatever you want ON your server if it has no malicious intend
16:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> dont advertise things in your servername
16:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
16:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> and we dont care about its existence
16:02 < bridge> <_qey> Just that the player won‚Äôt be banned.
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> more so, i would bet the website has clients for download, now i see why
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @_qey btw just letting u know if u run cheat clients ur probs having spyware and other stuff
16:03 < bridge> <_qey> Neat.
16:03 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôve been around that stuff for the last 20 years, so, yeah, thanks anyways.
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> the best ones are undetected just saying
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless u have reverse engineered them
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> to find out
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> u probs wont know
16:04 < bridge> <_qey> I‚Äôm not using hack clients, I barely even play, lol. I just come up with game modes.
16:05 < bridge> <_qey> It all was a huge coincidence, and now some of my servers top the browser.
16:07 < bridge> <_qey> I want to somehow monetize it, but I‚Äôm too lazy.

17:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You don‚Äôt need to
17:06 < bridge> <kebscs> when we support 128 players
17:06 < bridge> <kebscs> patchwork server full and half the server stuck on spawn
17:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought you could add map data jankily, but now i was told you cant
17:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If the map can change how do you get the correct map state on skip in demo
17:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> demo correctness isnt that important
17:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well it‚Äôs a blocker for Heinrich
17:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> *if* you can add map data mid game
17:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then surely its on the client to figure out the reverse
17:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wdym
17:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> storing the map every time it changes is silly
17:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Have one copy of the map for every tick is too much data yes
17:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so you need to be able to reverse a map data change
17:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it means having to sweep the demo to get all the changes to be able to reverse them
17:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so maybe once every blue moon the demo can make a copy of changes from the original
17:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if there are any
17:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So if you click it has to travel the entire demo?
17:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I suggested that as well
17:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Might slow down demo navigation
17:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But could work
17:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well that is a dumb but working way
17:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but im also saying we could add special behvaiour to the demo that isnt just write what the server sends
17:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which colates all the changes up to that point
17:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And what would it write?
17:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> To what point?
17:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so every 30s it writes the changes from 0 to that point
17:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want to write the entire map to the demo file every time it changes?
17:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Mine 10 blocks on stronghold and you have a 2GB demo
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so every 30s it writes the **changes** from 0 to that point
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it feels like only part of my msg is being read üò≠
17:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
17:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its big still
17:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But if you mine one billion blocks in 2 hours
17:14 < bridge> <kebscs> isnt this going to be used by 2 players max
17:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You have one billion changes every tick?
17:14 < bridge> <kebscs> compared to 128!!! in 128 players support
17:14 < bridge> <kebscs> :D
17:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Mintee?
17:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Minetee could be huge for mods
17:15 < bridge> <kebscs> never heard of it
17:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And for ddnet collab mapping
17:15 < bridge> <kebscs> collab mapping servers should be handled differently imo
17:15 < bridge> <kebscs> similar to ddnet rs
17:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Being able to build your house on city server or farm materials on mmo server would be epic
17:16 < bridge> <kebscs> you might wanna hop on terraria
17:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And yes of course 128 is epic too
17:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would love to see both features
17:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then i expect the demo to be huge
17:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> storing 2 billion anything takes atleast 200MiB
17:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having the changes stack for each 30s period is a bit annoying
17:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a tradeof of speed for size
17:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe only changes can be stored and the index is generated at playback
17:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so you have to traverse the demo up to the point you wan tto go to the first time
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How huge are the timelaps plugin "demos" for minecraft?
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I assume they are simply big
17:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Even if they are naive network recordings like Teeworlds demos they shouldn't contain *that* many duplicates of the world.... unless you're unloading and reloading chunks, which is very likely
17:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: do the Minecraft Timelapse demos support instant seeking tho?
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that an argument for smaller files? xD
17:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs the main issue here I guess
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why
17:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If seeking wasn‚Äôt a thing demos would already work
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well even if your demo is hours long, as long as it's small and simple enough it'll be practically instant to seek anyways
17:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It just writes all changes to the demo the same way they are sent by the server
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd claim you can code minetee in ddnet-rs today with seeking
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you can parse the entire file in the blink of an eye
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well ofc you have to parse the file expensively, but dunno
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok I cannot tell how fast the seeking is, but yeah
17:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So every seek travels the demo file?
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 200MB is not that much to process for
17:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I assumed that‚Äôs slow
17:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If it has to parse all map change messages
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But how slow is slow?
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Invent a system that works threaded
17:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Slow enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel instant anymore
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But tell me, why do you even want demos?
17:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich needs them
17:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs his main blocker
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok you're right, you said instant seeking
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Missed that
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What does heinrich have to do with that
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just code whatever you want
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I already did
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But he said he won‚Äôt merge without demos
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can ensure you minetee will not be merged to ddnet
17:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just because of demos tho
17:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So far
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No?
17:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What else?
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The whole rendering code would need a major refactor
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Events would need to be sent reliable
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Independent of snapshots
17:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I had a prototype in a few line diff
17:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs not in the snap
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What you want is a new game
17:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs a vital net message
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Code it in your client first
17:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If it works 100%, we can see what it needs
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah yeah yeah
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Here is a clip
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well first it needs demos according to Heinrich
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then heinrich said that to prevent the feature
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Demos has nothing to do with this
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Show me that your clip works across 16 clients with different graphics backends without lags
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On a normal not, rtx 4090 pc
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I accused Heinrich once already of refusing to decline PRs and making up excuses and requesting other changes. But I thought this time he was seriously concerned about demos
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As you already said, instant seeking is not possible
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And will never be
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs not flawless for sure @jupeyy_keks just a prototype
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I tell you what
17:39 < bridge> <louis> how is ur name gradient
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You need OpenGL 4.3
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And nothing less
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yours is too
17:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Gradient?
17:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> new Discord feature apparently
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon, we have a new discord feature
17:39 < bridge> <louis> when did they change it tf
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently murpi had to manually change it for our roles
17:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What‚Äôs the new discord feature
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385283194512871584/image.png?ex=68558102&is=68542f82&hm=38567e3646a1a5b1d51170ba45aaca16512ed8e9eefec32ee5e99740e4af8eb0&
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We now have rainbow names
17:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Poggers
17:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lgbtq+64
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway chiller
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally you could add demo support, but honestly instant is like super hard
17:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I read this as a register name and an offset
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I doubt you want a 128x128 map or smth to play on
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You probs want 4000x4000
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now even with key frames where the whole map is inside, uploading and preparing this shit is like updating ~8 4k images
17:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> There's perceptually instant, and there's O(1), and those are not the same thing
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Play 16x 4k videos at the same time
17:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We do not need to support hundred hour demos
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And I am convinced
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now if you want to change the rendering stuff to be chunked or similar.. you create a new game
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> besides that is what you do anyway
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you really want minetee, use a own client first
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> code your shit, if ppl like it they will play anyway
17:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont see any performance worries about this
17:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> *me who doesnt know how rendering tilemaps works in ddnet*
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Generally there isn't, but I am 100% sure chiller didn't just redesign the whole rendering pipe for his test xDD
18:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the way i did performant tilemaps is with a shader, single pass it just picks from the texture, zoom level has no effect, editing is free except reupload
18:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doesn work on ogl1
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On a map like arctic festival with ddnet-rs editor which is designed to be updated fast. applying a brush every frame reduces fps to ~12fps on my PC
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385288448092405922/image.png?ex=685585e7&is=68543467&hm=28a93f4559f4e804d5554651a4ace97ee7aa8f610236f67e1c0ace898edbd6b1&
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And that is a single layer updated
18:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that looks like a big brush though
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That means instant demos are dead
18:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now for updating, 16 clients.. no problem
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Uploading the whole map takes more time
18:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can edit a buffer without full reupload
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How can you know which tiles updated in a keyframe?
18:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because you store it?
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Store what?
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Store all possiblities that exist?
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You have to assume your map looks completely random
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And you skip somewhere inside the demo
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thus you need to reupload the whole map
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the way i would implement it is 
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the demo stores the all changes like any other message
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as the demo is being played a "keyframe" is generated every 30 ingame seconds, this means sweeping the demo atleast once, its not instant the first time
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> storing the index is too big
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont really get this
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you are told by the netmsg where and what is changed
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then?
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Let's assume you watch the whole demo
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> of chillerdragon destroying the whole map
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the end the map is destroyed
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now you skip to start
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What now?
18:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you load the initial map
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What do you update other than the whole map?
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok now you skip to 50%
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What do you upload now?
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (You skip to 50% from finish)
18:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the whole map...
18:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> editing large chunks of the map is going to be expensive
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> See
18:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do note you only have to update tile layers
18:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not mapres
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But that is what I do in my screenshot
18:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is worst case though, if the changes are localized you can do a single edit of that size
18:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or multiple chunks
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Instant is impossible with our current hardware
18:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay well not instant
18:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i think its fast enough
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can make it fast, but probs not under ~1s per skip
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For teeros PC not under 5s
18:09 < bridge> <learath2> What are these new cool name colors?
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why do you not have one
18:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I uploaded 400x400 8 bit numbers per frame and it runs fine on me ThinkPad
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
18:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> The physics (falling sand) is the slow thing
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sadly 2D is squared
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Doubling the numbers will x4 the work
18:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Well updating a 400x400 area rarely gonna happen in minetee
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That was never the point
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Since data is probably just top to bottom left to right then writing blocks isn't happening
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I already told ya you need to upload the whole map
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> everytime you skip
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whole map
18:14 < bridge> <louis> oh r we talking abt live tiles
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not 400x400
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whole map
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Not if not much happens
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you skip back.. always
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You cannot know how the map looks like if you skip back
18:15 < bridge> <louis> just disable demos for live maps ü§∑
18:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You know the previous state
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No
18:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It's in the demo
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> NOOO
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> learath
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what u done
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You always have to start from a key frame
18:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Oh nice colors
18:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You can only upload the difference, and key frames let you work that out faster
18:16 < bridge> <louis> can't you undo the changes if each change is coded w the previous state of the block
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> nooo
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> moderator cant be cooler
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> than dev
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No xD
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> *angry noises*
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't understand why you thinkso
18:16 < bridge> <louis> or demo can keep a history of the previous state whenever u skip ahead
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You cannot magically know which parts to udate
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You cannot magically know which parts to update
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> woah everyone is animated now
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> learath that is sick color
18:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You know the previous state if you keep it
18:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I like this colour too
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wow.. 1 snapshot or what xd
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Even then
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You cannot just revert it
18:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You know what you previously uploaded
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @murpi can u animate wiki role
18:19 < bridge> <louis> can u get a gradient of all your separate role colors
18:19 < bridge> <louis> ü•∫
18:19 < bridge> <murpi> It'll be gone tomorrow
18:20 < bridge> <murpi> I think yes
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that an event or what
18:20 < bridge> <murpi> No idea. It says it'll expire tomorrow. I guess we don't have enough boosts
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks throw away some money for the good looking roles
18:21 < bridge> <murpi> I had the option to enable either the server tag or gradient role colors
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sadly I am not as rich as you
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And you choose both
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice
18:22 < bridge> <murpi> Ones enabled as long we stay at level 3, the other expires tomorrow üòÑ
18:23 < bridge> <melon> you got it
18:23 < bridge> <melon> boost up!
18:23 < bridge> <murpi> Yeah now it just says enabled for both, guess we keep both then

18:24 < bridge> <louis> how do u get GER
18:24 < bridge> <louis> make sure i never get that
18:24 < bridge> <melon> dont worry, moderator only role, tho GER is probably the most unused one
18:24 < bridge> <melon> dont worry, moderator only role iirc, tho GER is probably the most unused one
18:24 < bridge> <teero777> can i get GER
18:25 < bridge> <melon> i use @ rus and @ tur decently often for moderators to help me translate stuff
18:25 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when I type `@GER` i get zhn
18:26 < bridge> <louis> @blaiszephyr when tourney winner role tho
18:26 < bridge> <louis> noob alert
18:26 < bridge> <melon> i almost did win one on Stepfunns tournament
18:26 < bridge> <melon> i blame iTom
18:27 < bridge> <melon> we were ahead of Cendren because we practiced the map before going into a run and they failed, sadly fucked up at like 75%
18:27 < bridge> <melon> we were ahead of Cendren because we practiced the map before going into a run and they failed, sadly fucked up at like 50%
18:27 < bridge> <melon> and then we couldnt catch up
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah yeah always blame the others
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> All Intels fault

19:54 < bridge> <Assa> anyone an idea why I can't simply reuse a text container? it seems to get deleted anyways oO
19:55 < bridge> <Assa> oh default constructur just deletes it üò¶
19:56 < bridge> <kebscs> both of these can work independently
20:00 < bridge> <kebscs> i think cheaters can send wrong input even now, dont need the preinput thing
20:00 < bridge> <kebscs> saw some video few days ago a cheater spamming jump in clb
20:27 < bridge> <Assa> it appears, that you can't reuse text containers, it shows as valid, I deactivated the TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_ONE_TIME_USE flag, but it keeps beeing empty
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> watcha mean with reuse?
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Render the same next frame?
20:30 < bridge> <Assa> i am currently testing a unordered map to store them and delete them later/on demand
20:30 < bridge> <Assa> but reusing them seems to be not working
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then it's a bug in your code.
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We use text containers in a lot of places
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You say reuse again
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What do you mean
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Render them again?
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Recreate them?
20:31 < bridge> <Assa> TextEx is creating a text container and deleting it immediately after first usage
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
20:33 < bridge> <Assa> it appears, the `TextContainer.m_StringInfo.m_vCharacterQuads` get's cleared somewhere outside my code
20:44 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
20:55 < bridge> <ihatecow> ```vb
