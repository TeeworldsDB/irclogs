01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> anyone know how to build maven java software on linux from terminal 😅
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, not regularly
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mazty> :kek:
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao, who made our CI japanese xD

08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yikes
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How would you name asan and ubsan in a consise kebab case?
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I too haven't upgraded a system in a while 😄
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990520570858836018/screenshot-20220626093301.png
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> I just noticed there is a Refresh Rate option under General > Client whats the difference to the one in Graphics?
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> client refresh rate also affects input
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> graphics tells how often render calls are actually send to the GPU
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> however, client refresh rates also caps FPS, since the client also tells the renderer when to work(if client is active, renderer cannot start either)
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it can e.g. happen that the GPU isnt ready, so client refresh rate can cause less FPS then what your set the clients refresh rate to
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> any graphics refresh rate with client refresh rate of 0, should result in pretty accurate the FPS u want
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the opposite is not the case
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> wow, thanks for explanation, maybe that's something for the wiki?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> however, client refresh rates also caps FPS, since the client also tells the renderer when to work(if client is not active, renderer cannot start either)
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> what is the use case for it? why do we have 2 option :d
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah its more technical aspect tho 😄
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> depending on your computer, using 100% on a single CPU core can cause fans to spin
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so some ppl dislike it
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> on a different note: in rc4 i cant see dummy actions, jump indicator and the weapon/state indicators in the hud except the old ones. I'm pretty sure it worked in rc3
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990557699538305034/unknown.png
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @c0d3d3v
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can't add strong or weak hook too here?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990558497685000192/unknown.png
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> for  who hold hooking you right now
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can use cl_nameplates_strong 1
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> i think that would add even more confusion
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it shows strong/weak in nameplates
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> in language files, do the words in [] brackets need to be translated as well?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > [Ingame controller mode]
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > Absolute
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> looks nice but feel  annoying  bcs it's already arrows moving there
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this looks so much things above every tee
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think they are context
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. if u in control settings sometimes some languages have same word with different meanings
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> absolute controler
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vs
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> absolute it a global sense... stuff like that
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> Yeah makes sense, thanks
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maks.> @c0d3d3v cannot see ninja weapon skin on 16.2 client version it worked yesterday and today its just gone

13:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656243649.png
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> ddnet UUID are compatible with rfc4122?
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> it almost looks better without the texture https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656244446.png
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> might have get used to it but the flakes seem a bit unteeish or not simple enough 
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> fixed by updating (appears to be a problem with rc2 only)
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> im on rc5 and i cant see katana in freeze as well, is this intended? I see when i have the actual katana tho
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> uhm, theres no rc5 👀
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/releases/tag/16.2-rc5
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> seems to be just a translation update
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> do you have this problem on all servers? What is `cl_show_ninja` set to? Try removing your old version and download the latest version in #announcements [https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/420565311863914496/986416911195729931]
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Either rc4 or rc5 broke the HUD for me with Vulkan renderer
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990591146394779728/vulkan_hud.mp4
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (those gray tiles on the lower left quarter)
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> on kog everthing seems to be the old way (no freezebar etc, i see katana), on all ddnet servers i dont see katana. cl_show_ninja is 1, i use steam for the release canditate, but i have a "normal" copy for the stable game. i use vulkan too btw
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I got nothing better to do, so I am going to bisect my issue above
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i just tried, it is working for me :\
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> hmm weird
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> can you try the build in #announcements anyway? maybe the build on steam is corrupt or something weird happened whilst updating
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> isn't it intended?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> when using openGL instead of vulkan i dont have this issue
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> this is how it is now
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i have this issue too
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i also told him here to ask codedev
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> same behavior: with vulkan the hud is broken with openGL it seems to work, if the missing katana in freeze is intended
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> weird, @Maks. are you on opengl or vulkan?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> weird, @Maks. are you using opengl or vulkan?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the ninja thing is completly gone for me
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for opengl and vulkan
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> well openGL 3.3.0 doesnt work either for me, only 1.4 and 3.0
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @c0d3d3v ^
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> now I am getting

14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> :(
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> oh
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Scrumplex are you using old rc version?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> okay
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> no the issue was that I didn't run DDNet from the build directory
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> weird?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> So the Vulkan shaders are loaded relative to CWD?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> do you need to? i don't run it from build dir :d
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> but all the other assets are fine?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> lemme try
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they are part of data dir
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but build data dir
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to be precise
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> But every asset loads fine, so I would assume that the path resolving for the shaders doesn't work the same?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> show what paths are getting chosen for the data dir
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> maybe the other assets are loaded based on the location of the binary`?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> maybe the other assets are loaded based on the location of the binary?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe it uses a different path than u expect
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> oh it uses "data"
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Oh makes sense
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> nah i don't have it, hud renders well
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maks.> im using opengl 3.30
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> The repo itself also has most of the data at that location
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maks.> @murpi
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> try 3.0
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maks.> its was on rc2 and it works again on rc4
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> okay now my bisect works :D
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> okay now my git bisection works :D

14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> when i use vulkan if i switch workspace it automatically resize to the lower resolution, it only happens in vulkan @Not Keks
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then make a bug report on sway
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vk only resizes, when it receives events to resize
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> never on its own
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5416#issuecomment-1166495301
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yet another bug
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> btw the bug vulkan on wayland thing magically fixed itself without update
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> im a bit suprised that wayland is still so unstable
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it is
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean its still kinda new, but also not really new
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> maybe sdl related
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don't have issues on other apps and games
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> tbh, Wayland has been working flawlessly for me. Only thing that's still a bit wonky is SteamVR, but that's probably SteamVR's fault
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, i had good performance, but generally the experience wasnt that good yet
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Scrumplex but do you use wayland backend?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> crashes, weird resizes, wrong resolutions, etc.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> or xwayland
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> for SteamVR?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> or DDnet?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> no ddnet
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I think xwayland
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> if you don't launch with SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland then it is xwayland
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I have SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland globally, but set it to x11 for Steam games I think
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw SDL tried to default to wayland but reverted it, bcs too many issues for users
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> afaik mainly bcs of nvidia
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway, i kinda dont see whats going wrong with resizes, especially since switching workspaces sounds like some special case xd
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> but it fixes itself if i double press win + f which is switches to windowed and back to fullscreen
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Just tried the wayland video driver and switching workspaces works for me
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> what are you using as dm/wm?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u also on sway?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> yes
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> hmm
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> built from master though
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u also on RDNA2 right=
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u also on RDNA2 right?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> nope
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> same
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Vega 56
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wonder if it could be a driver bug
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so confusing
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> when in doubt -> mesa
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> probably iy is
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it is*
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it is always mesa :D
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd expect a surface change is only triggered by the WM
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> what Mesa version are you on @nori
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @nori with dbg_gfx 4 u can see what vk is doing
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> 21.1.1
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. "VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR" should print  "dbg_msg("vulkan", "recreating swap chain requested by acquire next image (prepare frame).");"
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I am on 22.1.2
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> no log output for me when switching workspaces with dbg_gdx 4
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> no additional log output for me when switching workspaces with dbg_gdx 4
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i tested with 22.2 with RDNA but on KDE, had no real issues there as far as i remember
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dbg_gfx
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it can't even resize itself bcs it is 1 fps xD
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> no additional log output for me when switching workspaces with dbg_gfx 4
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (yes, typo in Discord, I did have other vulkan debug in log :D)
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> try dbg_gfx 3
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats only verbose information no validation layers
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> maybe bcs there is not much ppl using my graphic card :d
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> renoir
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> always having weirdest bugs
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Well discrete Vega GPUs are also kinda rare
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Though there are many Vega iGPUs I would assume
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i had vega past 5 years
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so the vk stuff was deved on it hehe
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u are premium member
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1656247942.png
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it is integrated
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Vulkan reports my card as "AMD RADV VEGA10"
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> iGPUs are always trouble makers
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> can't find that on Steam hwsurvey :D
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah 😄
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> but not nvidia optimum :d i thought it is better on full amd pc
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah nvidia optimus is bs
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw maybe no significant, but i also tested VK on 2 android phones
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and android drivers are the only thing worse than OpenGL drivers on macos xd
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Looks like "Vega 8" is the only mention of Vega in hwsurvey :(

14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> ```
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> this leak is not ddnet related right?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> are you looking at all stats or just Linux stats?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok it says "VULKAN SYSTEMS (LINUX OR POST-XP WINDOWS WITH VULKAN GPU)" in the headline xD
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the URL says directx xD
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> VULKAN!
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Wait, it's all NVIDIA?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Always has been
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah nvidias marketshare is insane
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics/#GPUVendor-top
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> It isn't so insane for Linux
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (though these numbers could be biased)
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah bcs nvidia on linux sucks hard xD
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Radeon RX Vega 56: 43 (2.1%) Difference: (-4.44% overall, -2 people)
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nvidia was the reason i switched back from linux to windows for a while
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I am one of those 43 ppl!
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when i had my gtx 760
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not unless the sdl call is something that requires cleanup we missed
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i actually had less problem with nvidia on linux before :d
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but tbf that was like ~8 years ago
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> but it is nice to have fhd terminal at boot
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and it was on gnome, gnome itself is a reason to not use linux xD
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> whats actually interesting is that there are around as much 60hz users as there are non 60hz users
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> in this biased data set yes
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> only people who are really into Linux and tech will probably have an account at GOL *and* provide their system info there
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> So these numbers are probably mostly from the Linux enthusiast segment
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> like, 8% of Linux gamers have a VR headset? highly doubt that :D
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont have one xD
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now i have to buy one to be cool
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> like, 8% of Linux gamers have a Valve Index specifically? highly doubt that :D
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And who even uses linux. It's like selection bias squared
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> true, I run TempleOS's kernel
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> way better
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you proficient in HolyC?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Of course. I already ported DDnet to HolyC
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> why there is xfce under wayland desktops? :d
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics/#WaylandDesktops-top
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> lol
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> or cinnamon
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990605950660513842/unknown.png
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> just kexec your brain
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> easy
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i solved most of my puzzles during sleep xd
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why is the freeze so weird?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> in new nightly
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> please revert the changes, the freeze looks too weird xD
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So weird is 10/10 feedback. We'll try to unweird it
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets wait for codedev anyway
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe its a bug if it worked yesterday
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No it's not a bug, it's weird
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <itsqed> new freeze is indeed weird + lettins us choose between the freeze bar or stars would be nice
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> freeze bar is way better than stars but my main problem is now that the freeze bar constantly moves while in freeze and that my tee looks crippled without his ninja sword
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and the snowflake particles are maybe too much
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yeah freezebar is weird, maybe snowflake particles could vanish over time act like a freeze timer
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <itsqed> ye i was trying to remove them but couldnt
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> weird thing is having ninja skin without sword :D maybe skin should change too or smth else
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah thats indeed the weird part
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest is just displaying information differently 😄
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <itsqed> the stars were much better 🙁
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk tbh just completely revert the changes, how it was the day before xD
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i mean if you wanna stay with old interface totally, you can use older client :d
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> jjust make it an option
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it has nothing to do with old interface
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, don‘t use old client. we won‘t keep supporting old versions
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i play with nightly and i loved all the changes until this newest update today
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> but i agree some  changes are weird
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> freezebar etc
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> havent played with it yet, so dont want to judge, but sometimes it also just getting used to it
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i agree but i prefer teeish way to do that
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, maybe we should have called a visual freeze on the hud when we did the rc, only bug fixes after that and new visuals we could get in a minor bump
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i dont get why the freeze bar appears now in freeze
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its a little irritating
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i mean old way is weird too, showing ninja for freeze xd
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People were missing the stars showing you are still frozen I guess
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes a well designed skin can make it cooler imo
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ninja skin without ninja weapon looks weird i agree with that 😄
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it was all perfect for me before todays update
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not yet released, so can still change
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for now lets wait until codedev comes online, who knows what he planned, he read lot of discussion probably already
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> alright
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> where is hud?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990617217806794782/unknown.png
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that is a good bugreport :D
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> broken with Vulkan
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (if you are on rc4 or later)
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> rc4
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> let me sec
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> it worked in rc3 :D
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5416#issuecomment-1166521291
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> opengl 3.3.0 no hud
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990617641204981780/unknown.png
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> oh hmm
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> on 3 0 0 fine
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990617826014396426/unknown.png
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> rofl, just tested rc5, it erased my config when i copied files over...
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> also broken with GLES
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> create issue?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I already commented in the pull request for 16.2
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> ^
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> ok
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can just comment on the rc PR but I think it's known
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is one thing I want to make major improvements on. CStorage and CConfig are very suboptimal
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3012 👀
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> How do you think about on/off stars. That is, make a choice of on/off stars and on/off frz bar
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are trying to have less options if at all possible
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> IMO the freeze-bar isn't really telling you anything important when you are in freeze
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> without stars kolobok(tee) seems so lonely
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> 😄
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The more options we have the harder it is to maintain. The nameplate above tees covered the directional buttons for years at some scales and it was just never really fixed
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990619130841407589/unknown.png
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> Yeah it is not wise to add legacy option for every new feature
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sort of agree, I've however been a little hands off on this feature so idk what decisions they went through
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> True
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Freeze particles probably tell enough that we should be able to disable the bar if the timer isn't decreasing
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, i got weird patch on ym screen
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990620278944067584/unknown.png
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like its the HUD trying to show jumps tatus
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it changes when i jump and dj
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990620692326281276/unknown.png
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems the HUD pr also ended up with a fairly complex snapshot change in it :/
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> this happens right during the game
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990621422919508058/unknown.png
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yea scurmplex also had it
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> oh ok sry
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Scrumplex did you open a pr about it? or comment?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Scrumplex did you open a issue about it? or comment?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i did
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> would be nice to have a beta channel for update
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk what a beta channel would entail
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the config in appdata?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> RCs are supposed to be safe(tm)
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can u reproduce that?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i copied files manually
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but appdata should have nothing to do with rest of the client
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i forgot about this, but usually i only copy .exe, .dll
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i use $datadir rather than $userdir
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also the client never writes to settings directly
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so only case i can see is that it didnt load the old config
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> demos were taking too much place on my C: disk
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how should that ever fail 😮
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i copied files manually
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it uses %appdata%/ddnet now
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ctrl c/ctrl v
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if thats the problem
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's how i erased settings.cfg
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i had a copy somewhere
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thanks
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is the most wanted person
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> pff. I guess it is fokkonauts commit
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or is master also broken?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can try to force push to https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5416 ^^ but I guess deen has to make the release candidate
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is it related to the renderer tho XD
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> UB time?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> he die overwrite quads
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> he does overwrite quads
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess that can lead to UB
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do not know
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> have not looked into the stuff that happens when you create a quad
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I test the branch localy, and then remove his commit to see if it works 😄
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well if the commit also was client side its ok to fail i guess
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> without the commit it works for me
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 👌
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Not Keks btw if you have free time 😄 you could review <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5210> that should also be part of 16.2 ... at least heinrich want it
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh have to rebase anyway
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cant read python
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> freeze bars look so unteeish
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont play much anymore so i wont say much
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ☕
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> >  he read lot of discussion probably already
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD I basically have skipped all conversation ^^ I had no time. Anything important ?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean many ppl suggested having option for freeze stars etc.
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But I guess the idea with removing the freeze bar and waiting for some better idea is not to bad
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not today
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but before
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Ravie  how strong are you for freezebar. I do not even know if it was your idea entirely or we somehow come up with this together when we talked first time about the new HUD
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> we could use snow particles like stars :d
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the stars are actually obnoxious, it's just that we're all used to them
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> why not use ninja sword particles as stars?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I got some requests for changes to the settings page... I guess I will make the opacity for freezebar to 0 default. 
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If I'm fast enough this can also get into 16.2 🙂 because we still need to add <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5210>
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I got some requests for changes to the settings page... I guess I will make the opacity for freezebar inside freeze to 0 default. 
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If I'm fast enough this can also get into 16.2 🙂 because we still need to add <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5210>
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The stars are hit indicators, they actually look wrong af. We have stockholm syndrome from seeing them for a decade
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I just prefer how they work, they don't follow the tee, and they're not visible 100% of the time
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe the new snow particles could act like the old stars and we add an option to turn off the bar for people who hate the bar and the hardcore traditionalist people can just replace the freeze particle with a star
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I replaced the free particle with a leaf :feelsamazingman:
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm just forcing myself to get used to the freezebar atm, I think the tee not having a weapon out is more jarring
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I must've missed that change happening, can you show what it looks like?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Don't mind my custom stuff, but ya, no katana
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990689869602885712/unknown.png
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, that does look a little jarring
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i use cl showninja 0 so i wonder if it will just look like a normal tee lol
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> it does
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990690815078719508/unknown.png
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tbh the ninja and sword feel like one entity. having no sword makes it feel like its kind of armless?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> change the starts to weed
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 420 ddnet
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stars
22:36 <+ChillerDragon> am i stupid or is there no way to tell when a tee unfreezes without freezebar now?
22:36 <+ChillerDragon> the star timer could be reproduced with the snowflakes that would be nice :)
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> there is no way w/out freezebar
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> vruh
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> this feels so wrong
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> finally, people see my thoughts too
