13:34 < LsD_> Hi
13:35 < LsD_> What does the switcher number 3,6,9 mean ?!?!?!!?
13:38 < LsD_> Hello?
13:56 < Chairn> Hello
15:55 < Chairn> have you ever had some screen tearing with dummy?
16:15 < NoName_> Staff!!
16:20 < fstd> in TW, screen tearing is called screen teering
16:21 < fstd> lern2terminology
16:21 < Henningstone> xD
16:22 < Henningstone> just turn on vsync and it is gone :o
16:24 < Learath2> fstd: lern2teerminology*
16:26 < fstd> oh sh--, of course
16:29 < Lady> heinrich5991
16:30 < Chairn> nah, i mean it was after 60 minutes of game with dummy, main didnt have this
16:31 < Henningstone> did you experience fps drops too?
16:32 < Chairn> nah
16:32 < Chairn> using vsync btw
16:33 < Chairn> i tried timeout, quitting rejoining, didnt solve the problem
16:33 < Henningstone> hm and you really think that is was because of the dummy?? Sounds strange
16:34 < Chairn> because only dummy was experienting this, not the main, or when i was in spec
16:34 < Chairn> everything was fluid, except when i played with the dummy
16:34 < Henningstone> oh that is strange indeed
16:59 <@heinrich5991> Lady
16:59 <@heinrich5991> I'm here..

21:22 < fstd> that guy still exists?
21:22  * fstd completely forgot
21:22 <@heinrich5991> see #teeworlds
21:23 < fstd> he used to nag me in ICQ with beginner-level programming issues
21:23 < fstd> ah
21:23 < fstd> (yes, ICQ still exists :P)
21:30 <@EastByte> I skyped with him a long time ago
21:31 <@EastByte> looks like he has his own datacenter at home
21:40 < tyurd> guuuys?
21:40 < Savander> EastByte, what teeworlds uses to compress map?
21:41 < Savander> zlib, glib?
21:43 <@EastByte> zlib
21:43 <@EastByte> tyurd: hello
21:44 < tyurd> hi east
21:44 < tyurd> do you have experience with javascript/jQuery?
21:48 <@heinrich5991> Savander: teeworlds uses zlib to compress the tile data and image data in the maps
21:48 <@heinrich5991> the map as a whole isn't compressed thogh
21:48 <@heinrich5991> +u
21:50 < Savander> hm
21:51 <@heinrich5991> (also for image names, etc., which is rather useless)
21:54 <@EastByte> tyurd: I'm not a webdev sry
21:54 < Savander> im just thinking, how to getdata from .map
21:54 < Savander> in python ;p
21:55 <@heinrich5991> there's tml
21:55 <@heinrich5991> "teeworlds map library"
21:56 < Savander> em
21:56 < tyurd> k thank you anyway east
21:56 < Savander> generally im thinking how to do it without external libraries like this
21:56 < Savander> xd
21:57 <@heinrich5991> Savander: what's wrong with external libraries? are you just trying to do this yourself or are you doing this as part of something bigger?
21:57 < Savander> just trying to do it myself
21:57 < Savander> ^^>
21:57 <@heinrich5991> (in the latter case I'd strongly suggest you to just build upon existing libraries)
21:57 <@heinrich5991> ok
21:57 <@heinrich5991> well then
21:57 <@heinrich5991> you need to parse the datafile format
21:58 <@heinrich5991> coincidantly, I've written a documentation for that
22:00 < Savander> really?
22:01 <@heinrich5991> Savander: https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/d7de53d6721070f44e77 
22:01 <@heinrich5991> if you have questions, please please ask them
22:01 <@heinrich5991> so I can update this documentation
22:01 < Savander> okay, thank you :)
23:06 < Chairn> heinrich5991: nice doc ;)
23:07 < Chairn> btw, thx for merging my pr about dragger ^^
23:08 <@heinrich5991> you're welcome. I'm sorry it took so long
23:08 < Chairn> im not hurried about those things ^^
