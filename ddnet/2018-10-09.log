01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> hm does anyone know if something got changed in the protocol or sth on 7th. october?
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> since I can't seem to retrieve the stats from most servers suddenly
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://i.imgur.com/M9rXcF8.png
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> just started debugging but it ran completely fine for multiple months and now test and local environment showed this behaviour so thought I'd ask if there was something recently
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> master servers ddosed
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> oh would explain a lot
06:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> My game freezing when refreshing server browser help
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> Hmm, why we don't save last server list for master ddos cause?
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> you can really only save the server name which is not that useful
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> and ip:port?
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ya
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @DaRealFreak you can see the incoming traffic on ddnet.tw (one of the TW master servers starting October 7): https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to do a ISUPPORT message for teeworlds. If anyone can think of capabilities a server/client have let me know
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what would that message be used for?
11:43 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/fxnZ2
11:43 <+Learath2> It would be used to announce the servers capabilities to the client and the clients capabilities to the server
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/gparker/status/1047246359261106176?s=09
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Instead of making the languagw worl around the cpu they optimize the cpu for the language
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk if this is good xD
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Instead of making the language work around the cpu they optimize the cpu for the language
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReT> #report
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> Fixed my autoautomapper PR, I think it is good to go now
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> .. time to work on an autoautoautomapper? 😉
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReT> server no list!! 😦
12:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1341: Mark unused envelopes (master...dd_pr_unusedenv) https://git.io/fxnlx
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 maybe take a look at how stuff like xmpp does it
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they have massive feature detection IIRC
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure whether that's good, btw ^^
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not the how. It's that I couldnt decide what to put as features
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen might be a ignorant question, but does teeworlds server send packets using little or big endian
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen might be a ignorant question, but does teeworlds servers send packets using little or big endian
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> i saw that xD
17:16 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: it encodes integers in a way different from big- and little-endian
17:16 <@heinrich5991> check out src/engine/shared/compression.cpp
17:16 <@heinrich5991> CVariableInt::Pack and CVariableInt::Unpack
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> anyone know which encoding is used for mapre names in the map format?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> doesn't seem to be utf8/ascii
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> seems to be codepage 1252, funny
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't follow any particular encoding
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just uses what it gets from the file system
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in case of windows, it uses the legacy file API not capable of unicode stuff
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should some day just specify utf8 there
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hm, i don't think the python3 file api can really handle this, they want filenames as python strings with encoding information
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess cp1252 works for now
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is there a way to serverside send a broadcast that doesnt get printed in the console from the client? (like broadcast for money tiles that get updated every second and spams f1)
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (without clientside deactivate the broadcast printing!!)
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't think so
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually you can, I just rememberd
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> broadcast "                                                                                                                                                             -\nHi"
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> broadcast "                                                                                                                                                             \nHi"
