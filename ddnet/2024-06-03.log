00:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 does this look similar to what we need for bans? https://debezium.io/
00:45 < bridge> <learath2> looks very new age, sounds like it is atleast similar to what we want, but one thing is it won't solve any other problem we might want to solve with a message queue, like shipping chat messages to one place, or shipping logs
02:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xxxxD
02:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk what en and pl stands for but I don’t think it’s languages. Both sounds are used to differentiate which flag was captured
02:18 < bridge> <zhn> not which but which time
02:18 < bridge> <zhn> sounds differ if you grab flag from stand and from died player
02:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The sounds he sent is capture not grab
02:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh wait no grab
02:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
02:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But the same exists for capture too
02:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can’t even guess what en and pl stand for
02:49 < bridge> <0xdeen> I didn't have that great experience trying to use Debezium to mirror our ranks from MySQL (but could have been a mistake from my side), the setup seemed complex and finicky too
03:56 < bridge> <louis> true, but it can be used as a compromise for a smoother client experience
03:58 < bridge> <peter0x44> doesn't sound worth the limited developer and reviewer bandwidth the project has
04:02 < bridge> <totar> anticheat is not always a losing game, it depends on the game type
04:03 < bridge> <totar> if you never trust the client then the cheats are limited by their ability to play the game legitimately better than a human, which is sometimes not possible depending on your game.
05:38 < bridge> <totar> ^ the end of lag :)

08:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/64f4ea1512b5abcc1ef27b90ede05cb9934df69b/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp#L57 this overflows on init
08:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure if that is intended i really don't understand the huffman code but even if it is intended it is a bit weird
08:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/64f4ea1512b5abcc1ef27b90ede05cb9934df69b/src/engine/shared/huffman.h#L30 symbol is a `unsigned char` and `i` reaches `256`
08:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it flips to zero in the last iteration
08:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats the eofSymbol so maybe its intended but still :D 
08:39 < bridge> <totar> Where does the init table come from?
08:45 < bridge> <totar> I thought huffman was supposed calculate the optimal frequency table for any given data then store that frequency table with the data so it can be decompressed with the optimal table, but it seems like we just use the same one for all data as far as I can tell.
08:45 < bridge> <totar> so someone must have created it from some TW packet data?
08:45 < bridge> <totar> or something
08:48 < bridge> <totar> omg of course it'
08:48 < bridge> <totar> omg of course it's 15 years old .-.
08:48 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/878ede3080ab2cfb627aca505c397d9765052996#diff-c39dd1d454f6249c201c0662b73ccf1aaee23f00bcc5ae34d034f96d325d8ec0
08:56 < bridge> <totar> someone was writing ddnet huffman file in rust? https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=8505fd268fea3cba6468da5447571347
09:02 < bridge> <totar> unless this frequency table is some sort of standard made by someone else it's possible we are leaving free bandwidth savings on the table by either regenerating it or sending the huffman tree along with the packet, but I think our packets are too small for that
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well aparently not free if u need to sync such a table with the client 😄
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw @totar ur pr sends the inputs as individual packets right?
09:06 < bridge> <totar> it only does 1 flush which means they get compressed together
09:06 < bridge> <totar> but they are processed individually yes
09:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @totar the table is pre calculated and hardcodet into the client and server
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see, maybe a new network packet would be nice where it takes the binary diff of the inputs.. since most bytes are mostly similar 😄
09:07 < bridge> <totar> ok but it's 15 years old and highly likely does not match the current distributation of data
09:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> someone probably ran the numbers of which format the tw trafic has
09:07 < bridge> <totar> also there's no source in the original commit so we have no idea the quality of it's generation even 15 years ago
09:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont think that much changed in the last 15 years
09:07 < bridge> <totar> also there's no comments in the original commit so we have no idea the quality of it's generation even 15 years ago
09:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk about 15 but the last 10 years for sure it barley changed
09:08 < bridge> <totar> simply changing which type of packet gets sent more often would significantly change the frequency table
09:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its mostly snap thats relevant i would say
09:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> always has been i guess
09:08 < bridge> <totar> true
09:08 < bridge> <totar> but still we have no idea how much data was sampled to create it in the first place
09:08 < bridge> <totar> or how
09:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea
09:09 < bridge> <totar> could you explain more?
09:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg i dont wanna debug the fakin huffman code -.- im procrastinating so hard
09:09 < bridge> <totar> I think compressing the inputs more would be good for sure
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the oldest input packet is the base and all new inputs are binary patches of that one
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so all other input packets are basically only the difference between the inputs
09:10 < bridge> <totar> the client does that already sorta
09:10 < bridge> <totar> or you mean something more special?
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the client uses a input packet that is ack'd by the server or not?
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with 300 ping that is pretty old
09:11 < bridge> <totar> I'm not sure storing binary patches for a 120byte struct is practical
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why not
09:11 < bridge> <totar> you need pointer to location of each patch?
09:11 < bridge> <totar> I guess it doesn't need to be 4 byte pointer
09:12 < bridge> <totar> actually I have no idea how binary diff algorithm works tbh
09:12 < bridge> <totar> maybe it's more clever
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let say u have two vec<u8>
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it simply puts a 0 where the binary diff is equal else it puts a diff
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very simplificated
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then compressions can normally very well compress these 0's
09:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very simplified
09:16 < bridge> <totar> the client and server will bundle I think 1400bytes of data to pass to the huffman which is about ~10 inputs. I'm not sure to what extend the huffman algorithm will naturally perform something similar to your idea by nature of how it works, it would probably be quite good without the fixed frequency table but now I'm not sure it's even doing anything anymore
09:17 < bridge> <zhn> can it :troll:
09:17 < bridge> <Bota> 🚂
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh well i can only tell you compression algorithms as good as they are, are also not perfect.. for teeworlds snapshots taking binary diffs with zstd outperformed any compression i tested easily.
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The only disadvantage of binary patching is that the base "file" can get old (e.g. by a higher ping)
09:21 < bridge> <totar> well it should always arrive in the same "pack" of inputs so you start the diff from the start with every packet
09:21 < bridge> <totar> well it should always arrive in the same "cluster" of inputs so you start the diff from the start with every packet
09:22 < bridge> <totar> yeah probably because our huffman table is trash lol
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but how do u want to create a general purpose huffman table for snapshots, inputs etc.
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or do u want to use different tables per purpose?
09:22 < bridge> <totar> I don't think there's a correct answer
09:23 < bridge> <totar> but remember that having a fixed table means it changes the network protocol
09:23 < bridge> <totar> but remember that having a fixed table means it changes the network protocol anytime we update it
09:24 < bridge> <totar> I mean a seperate table for every type of message would be very good tbh but I think the network system smushes all the messages together regardless of type
09:24 < bridge> <totar> which might be better anyway since many messages are much less than the 1400byte size
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think heinrich did tests in that direction
09:25 < bridge> <totar> also why do we use 1400bytes
09:25 < bridge> <totar> seems small
09:25 < bridge> <totar> UDP can be 64kb I think
09:26 < bridge> <zhn> cuz its data mtu
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a UDP frame usually isnt much bigger than 1400 bytes if u think cross plattform afaik
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here we have an expert
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc
09:27 < bridge> <zhn> no u
09:27 < bridge> <zhn> i can say anything about net until Devinci comes and tells what exactly is wrong kekw

10:37 < bridge> <egyt> And, btw, the progress is 95% (581 out of 607 strings translated), so the PR is not really that far away!
10:39 < bridge> <totar> actually double checking the inputs are only like 40bytes which is a lot less than I thought
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and how many packets will be deployed when having 300ms prediction margin?
10:40 < bridge> <totar> plus 3 ints
10:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> hi
10:41 < bridge> <totar> 300/20ms = 15 inputs, so ((40+4+4+4)*15)/1400 = 0.55 packets
10:44 < bridge> <totar> probably a bit more with the overhead from message struct but idk how big that is
10:52 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1247110654306025513/ca8a3758b1011aa9.png?ex=665ed5ce&is=665d844e&hm=d5bd03c0590179d6b9bb49047c093e24922be8deb7428ce788b6d66b00e27fea&
10:52 < bridge> <egyt> Hm, for some reason "Time limit" is not translated, while "Score limit" is
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> interesting
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe it’s worth doing a quick regex search to find which string literals are not translated, and then determine if they should be translated
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> not a catch-all but probably still worthwhile
11:18 < bridge> <totar> 300/20ms = 15 inputs, so ((40+4+4+4)*15)/1400 = 0.55 packets (at most, non-unique inputs are skipped)

12:08 < bridge> <patiga> not sure if someone already answered, but this is exactly what is done already in snap deltas ^^
12:25 < bridge> <learath2> There probably is no reason, just an oversight
12:34 < bridge> <egyt> Haha, by remaking the translation I found so many bugs...
12:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, thanks for actually caring about a good translation! 🙂
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like there are two time limit strings, did you also translate the other one or does it not work for some reason? For example in german.txt:
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Time limit
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> == Zeitlimit
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> 
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Time limit: %d min
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> == Zeitlimit: %d min
12:52 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
12:56 < bridge> <egyt> I translated both
12:56 < bridge> <egyt> 
12:56 < bridge> <egyt> ```
12:56 < bridge> <egyt> 
12:56 < bridge> <egyt> Time limit
12:56 < bridge> <egyt> == Обмеження по часу
12:56 < bridge> <egyt>

12:57 < bridge> <egyt> This is the list of strings I haven't translated yet, btw 😏
12:59 < bridge> <egyt> This is the list of strings I haven't translated yet, btw 😏
12:59 < bridge> <egyt> Need some help 🥺
13:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> egyt: can you mark the strings that you don't know where they appear?
13:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can figure out where they appear
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> of multiple snaps?
13:07 < bridge> <patiga> I think it rarely ever sends an actual full snap, and typically just deltas, which only include items that change, and for those items the binary diff
13:07 < bridge> <patiga> yea the server diffs multiple snaps to create efficient updates
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i see, but i think u dont even need to do the items part
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zstd + custom dict performs just as good if not even better
13:08 < bridge> <egyt> All of those mentioned in my list
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that confuses me xD
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it diffs multiple snaps for a single snap
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or it sends previous snaps to create a snapshot chain?
13:08 < bridge> <egyt> All of those mentioned in my list
13:08 < bridge> <egyt> Would be nice if you could send screenshots of GUI too
13:08 < bridge> <patiga> well the item part helps because most items don't need to be updated coz they stay the same
13:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Server sends only the changes
13:08 < bridge> <patiga> well thats why it *should* help
13:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> as snap delta
13:09 < bridge> <patiga> in reality ofc you might find that this optimization doesn't help
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes but i don't see how that makes the binary diff better
13:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> a
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well maybe it does, but i could not oberse it 😄
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well maybe it does, but i could not observe it 😄
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga what i wonder tho is if the snapshot packet is used to _unpack_ old snapshots
13:10 < bridge> <patiga> it relies on snapshots you received earlier, not ones in the future
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but in the input case of tater it's about actually sending old inputs
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with high prediction margin they still come in before the tick that handles these inputs is used
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you basically have a higher success rate when packet drop
13:11 < bridge> <patiga> I'm confused about your usage of "unpack"
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u basically have a chain of inputs until the current one
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it sounded a bit like snapshots are used similary like the input concept here 😄
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i guess it just sends the current snapshot
13:12 < bridge> <patiga> iirc, input isn't in the snapshot
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i think we just talk past each other xD
13:13 < bridge> <patiga> yea seems likely 😅
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like what i want is:
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> binary patch the input chain:
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - very old input
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - old input
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - input
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> old & current input can be binary diffs of the very old one
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are directly send in the same network packet anyway
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if the very old input is a binary diff smth like it's done with snapshots is ofc possible yeah
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically my _optimization_ is in first place unrelated to any binary diff of a previous packet
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just so u can send a  lot of inputs in a single packet
13:15 < bridge> <patiga> ah right, I jumped into the discussion at the wrong time, with a wrong thing in mind xd
13:16 < bridge> <patiga> sounds fun though :)
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like what i want is:
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> binary patch the input chain:
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - very old input
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - old input
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - input
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> old input can be binary diff of the very old one
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> current input of old input*
13:27 < bridge> <egyt> While I can guess where they appear, I can't be sure, as it happened with yesterday stuff
14:02 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I had an interesting idea to improve performance in rendering on at least some maps, which is already tested and proven to be useful, is anyone interested? maybe @jupeyy_keks

14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> So, In a map I am working on, I have a lot of quads, about 8000 distributed in 50 groups. For context, I would be currently on r4 on the list with the most quads per map on ddnet, if my map would be there, anyway. I noticed, that a snow Strom, which was over 500 fields away from the spawn region, greatly dropped fps beside not quad of this layer being visible or in render distance.
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I improved the FPS by adding clip regions on every quadlayer, meaning I had to put every quad into it's own group and add a clipping region to it, because layers don't support clip regions.
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> This causes the renderer to [skip](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/64f4ea1512b5abcc1ef27b90ede05cb9934df69b/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L1448>) the group, if it's region is out of bounds, instead of checking EVERY QUAD if it needs rendering.
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> This improved, in my special case, the rendering up to a factor of 10 (from 500 fps to 5000) (machine one), (from 200 fps to 990 (fps cap!))(machine 2)
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> My idea: Add, when loading a map, a virtual clip region to a quad layer. This improves FPS everywhere outside of the clip and if you have multiple quad layers without overlap, it'll improve overall fps.
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> How to do this? Check every corner of a quad in a layer, min-max x/y for to generate a clip region, you only need to do this once, when loading the map
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> You'll need to add possible envelope offsets, which is easy, the maximum/minimum value has to be a point in the envelope (except when rotating)
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> TODO para X, Y, can be considered and recalculated, definately possible, para 0/0 can be skipped
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
14:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Also, you could pre-calculate this region at a minimum quad count, which still needs to be found

14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i see, sounds pretty complicated to do it layer wise with all these side effects of animations. But that gave me a different idea.
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Couldn't you use the group's clip properties to completely skip that group?
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be manual work which sucks, but would be safer to not imeplement it wrong
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1247167953611522048/image.png?ex=665f0b2b&is=665db9ab&hm=81fe45741b2ed509d22ef18ff4286730e4028f9f6e139ceb1b627977f3a2df39&
14:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Here an extra cherry: If this is implemented, you could split a quadlayer into multiple with their own regions, further improving the fps
14:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> This is what I wrote above
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and that's not enough or what?
14:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @jupeyy_keks Quads don't render outside the camera's view right? So regardless of clipping being off or on, this shouldn't affect performance if outside the camera's view, right?
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u wrote 5000 fps
14:42 < bridge> <gol_135> how can I create a fake bun on the server using the code?
14:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> This is enough, yes, the idea is to generalize this in order to improve map rendering in general?
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it does, since it still has to check if the quad is inside the cameras view
14:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest: oh, then it's a miscalculation in performance
14:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you can get a performance gain, by skipping a layer redering, because of the clip region, instead of checking every item in the layer
14:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> doesn't it cache all of the quads that are inside the view and check those only?
14:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> no, because of animations
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it's not trivial.. u also need to respect the quads rotation etc.
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be the question how well the estimation works in worst case, e.g. if you actually are where most quads are rendered
14:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> doesn't it cache all of the quads that are inside the view and check those only? Or better yet, check those only which are the closest within the boundary of the camera's view?
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @essigautomat u do it for rain animations?
14:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It needs correction on what quad can and cannot be rendered
14:44 < bridge> <AssassinTee> rain, snow, waterfalls, bells, no-animations-at-all
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd rather question why u need many quads for those 😄
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u need highly accurate rain drops xDD
14:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I rather question, why do we need to check every single quad if it's outside the camera or not xd
14:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> brings me back to my initial: on ddnet are already maps, with more quads
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u name one
14:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> This is where I agree
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to look
14:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> There are many more efficient ways to look at this problem tho
14:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> mud, Victory 2, I can name more @patiga had a list
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the question is not about that there isnt smth better, more about complexity
14:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Position based detection: based off of all quads' coordinates and the camera's front end (top left position) and back end (bottom right position), which quads are inside that position
14:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if those quads' positions are inside that position, those can be rendered immediately.
14:47 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this looks way worse then what I did
14:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> With this method, only the quads' positions need to be cached and no need for direct comparision with an object colliding with the camera
14:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I agree, that having all things covered is complex, but we can still improve the easy cases: no animation, para 100/100, -> virtual clip
14:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Count in the para multipliers, and it's done
14:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Is my method any wrong by chance? 😄
14:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, you need to check the corners
14:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> and points in between
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the easiest approximation for quads is a circle around it, even if it rotates the circle stays the same
14:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> would it be more performance heavy, than checking the entire quad object directly?
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> additionally distance checks of circles + points are the cheapest operation
14:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Just caching the quads' positions will make a huge performance difference, as long as there is no other way for a quad to move.
14:50 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you'd still need to check every quad, instead of just having one check for ALL quads
14:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I see, so in that case, if the quads move by animation, then those need to update the cache
14:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
14:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Thats not how caching should work but ok
14:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if the position is stable, then it should be done like that
14:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> and then the player moves, how do you find which quads to render?
14:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But now I doubt my method due to animations changing positions of Quads
14:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Can you do signalling for objects?
14:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> stupid question, but worth to ask
14:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Damn Im so obsessed with Godot, that was the first thing in my mind lol
14:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this could solve the rotation animation case for the clip region
14:55 < bridge> <AssassinTee> so what do you say @jupeyy_keks , is the idea valid? This would be an optimization in some cases, and wouldn't change a thing in others (no quad layers)
14:56 < bridge> <gol_135> please tell me how to create a player token for my DDN server
14:56 < bridge> <gol_135> please tell me how to create a player token for my DDNEt server
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure but dont u need animation?
14:59 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Yes, you can further improve on that idea a lot (since it's an optimization problem). I think I'll start an implementation of this when I am done with the map and need to measure frame times
15:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> maybe use that kind of method on tunes as well
15:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> tunes are still actively sucking off performance inside the editor
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's an editor problem
15:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :FeelsBadMan:
15:01 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @cellegenrih this is about in-game improvements (which is much more worth)
15:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> true
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, i'd still suggest to use less quads
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it uses more VRAM too
15:02 < bridge> <AssassinTee> only if you use quads with texture, or does it?
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and rendering performance too
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Idk about 6000 quads being on a map, but my idea is around 10k
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> jupstar, you have no idea about the potential of the editor
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> independent of if texture or not
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the vertices of the quads need to be uploaded
15:03 < bridge> <AssassinTee> The fix with the clip regions is working very good, it's not one layer with 8000 quads, I have a lot more in this map, the biggest layer has 2000, the rest has ~500, I don't see how to improve the number of quads
15:03 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Issue is me abusing the pixelart tool
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u probably have a very good GPU
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try with software renderer
15:04 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how/like?
15:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> remove your driver, test it out? :troll:
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh do you use linux?
15:05 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I _can_ if I have to 😄 for teeworlds usually not
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on windows dunno xd
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe vulkan sdk ships one
15:05 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @jupeyy_keks do you have a tool to measure frametimes on different maps?
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet has a tool built in, but u'd need to manually drag it into excel to see the chart
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah actually someone wrote a python script i think
15:06 < bridge> <AssassinTee> if sb wrote a script, it has to be patiga xD
15:07 < bridge> <patiga> So if I understand correctly, you want to put layers into their own group to achieve more precise clipping?
15:07 < bridge> <patiga> Such a system would not directly help on a map such as mud though, right? (as long as we don't split up the quad layer automatically)
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was chairn
15:09 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I would implement the clip-feature virtually for quads (no editor), precalculate them. This has nothing to do with the group clips (well maybe similar code)
15:09 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Yes, this wouldn't directly improve mud, but this would allow to, in a follow up, split a layer into two only for rendering
15:09 < bridge> <egyt> So, 16 left (if not counting this one, still thinking of a good translation)... Nice!
15:09 < bridge> <patiga> the graphics card is very good at throwing away quads that are not on the screen by itself. I doubt that such checks would increase the performance in most cases
15:09 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I would implement the clip-feature virtually for quads (no editor), precalculate them. This has nothing to do with the group clips (well maybe similar code)
15:09 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Yes, this wouldn't directly improve mud, but this would allow to, **in a follow up**, split a layer into two only for rendering
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/933046871943962704
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think this was the script
15:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then  maybe its a gpu bottleneck?
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the biggest bottleneck in ddnet is that it does these calculations on the CPU
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CPU are only good if the number is not too high, then they can even outperform the GPU
15:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well, positions need to be accurate, so makes sense
15:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> the performance gain comes only from skipping checks, if something needs rendering, not the rendering itself
15:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> the performance gain comes only from skipping checks if something needs rendering, not the rendering itself
15:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well it depends on which method is faster, discarding quads on GPU, or conditionally skipping quads on the CPU
15:13 < bridge> <patiga> and to get me up to speed, you achieved that optimization manually by reordering the quads layers into different groups, yea?
15:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> so matplotlib, I need to collect the data manually right?
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet has some command
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me find
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bench_quit or smth
15:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, I needed to split a group into 3 or more, where the middle one is a single group for a quad layer
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> benchmark_quit 60
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to record 60 seconds of gameplay
15:14 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, I needed to split a group into 3 or more, where the middle one is a single group for a quad layer with clipping
15:14 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Thing is this needs to be collected over a range of maps
15:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> also, I have already done this in the map version you have. If you are interested measure fps, disable all clip regions, measure again
15:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> also, I have already done this in the map version you already have. If you are interested measure fps, disable all clip regions, measure again
15:20 < bridge> <patiga> nice
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> I'm uncertain if this optimization does much on most maps. I would expect only very few maps to profit from this. (quads afaik are typically only used only used in small amounts)
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> 
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> For the maps on which this does matter, it would be a great improvement and I like the idea!
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> A relatively simple approach would be to simply edit the maps themselves, and simply use the group clips. that is exactly what they are for and many groups are no issue for the renderer :)
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> games like minecraft might use UV coordinate animations for rain
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> something ddnet maps sadly dont support
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u could defs do smth similar with fewer quads than 6000 xd
15:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> https://imgflip.com/i/8sm1lg

15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1247180679544832061/frames_by_oreo_64a72a71.map?ex=665f1705&is=665dc585&hm=1d6c320a9d6f8c18b478651e0f7f475b2bc3bfc46e2854a2346df6755492e3a2&
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it uses fewer quads
15:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> BTW I know I could just use para 0/0, add a clip where I want rain and call it a day
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can defs improve it, bcs i am laziest mapper but looks also cleaner in the editor
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1247180911439777802/image.png?ex=665f173c&is=665dc5bc&hm=3456a611a19bf5cb79ee77ad946ebc40eb5f71a4394ce4eb60c9210f8ccfc6a2&
15:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I wonder what you'd say about my envelops if you see them, you'd probably throw a stone a t me
15:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I wonder what you'd say about my envelops if you see them, you'd probably throw a stone at me
15:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if the midground quads don't have para change at all, then you can resize the the boundary to be smaller
15:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If as you said it affects performance, then this should also increase it's performance a bit
15:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if the midground quads don't have para change at all, then you can resize the boundary to be smaller
15:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> This is probably the prefered solution in 99% of the cases, but not mine, because my snow flakes are 4x4 virtual pixels following a grid. The animation itself only uses step type 'N' and the pixels jump to their positions, this can't be done without para x/y being 100
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also create an issue on github and try to explain it in more detail, i would not prevent it if u find maintainers that like your idea
15:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I think I'll do a test implementation, measure, and add a PR if the stats provide it. Which maintainer would say no to 1% on average, and 1000% worst case improvements?
15:50 < bridge> <louis> wow jupstar pro mapper
15:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> <a:Aware:1111862631842713650>
15:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> "just use less quads"
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw i think u can generally improve the quads rendering performance.
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i quickly looked into the code, rn it calculates the envelop for every quad (even tho most quads probably have the same animation)
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> additionally env eval uses a linear search, which is probably no problem for small number of env points, but defs doesnt scale
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that alone would maybe already double the fps xd
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah but animation time offsets could potentially be problematic
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno if u use them too
15:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, and I randomized them
15:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 🙈
15:58 < bridge> <AssassinTee> a randomize pos/col offset button would be a nice feature as well, but can't have everything
15:58 < bridge> <patiga> yea in twmap I calculate the envelope values for each envelope_index, envelope_offset pair
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah nice, do you know a map that profits from it?
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let say min. 128 quads
16:01 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I am currently lookin into the OnMapLoading function, too. This virtual clip would be easy to implement, you are already iterating through all quads in a layer <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/64f4ea1512b5abcc1ef27b90ede05cb9934df69b/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L811>
16:01 < bridge> <patiga> I don't. I did it because yk I did everything differently and upload the envelope values to the gpu ^^
16:01 < bridge> <patiga> so I just did that as a why-not optimization :d
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah u still calc them on CPU? didnt even know, but probs makes sense considering it's a loop
16:04 < bridge> <patiga> yea, I don't think you can do that well on the gpu
16:05 < bridge> <patiga> I put some thought into it and it just didn't sound all that good
16:10 < bridge> <zhn> only if you know that 1 gpu thread will process contiguous-by-predicate data
16:11 < bridge> <zhn> branch prediction powers it but not just random discarding
16:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I suspect about an algorithm being ran on the GPU to select quads
16:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> does anyone know if quads are sorted inside a map? Or do I expect them randomly/the order the mapper added them?
16:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> probably the latter,
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> latter, ye
16:13 < bridge> <zhn> wdym by sorted btw
16:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ofc, because the rendering order matters
16:13 < bridge> <zhn> ah this
16:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> sorted by x/y, in order to improve rendering (like I am thinking about)
16:14 < bridge> <zhn> hm you can rearrange them on client side
16:14 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, but this would change the rendering order, so this isn't an option
16:15 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this may work in most cases, but it breaks when quads in the same layer overlay each other
16:15 < bridge> <zhn> but you can index them, no?
16:15 < bridge> <AssassinTee> oh god, @patiga our np-problem is getting worse, if we allow overlays
16:15 < bridge> <zhn> ah wait
16:16 < bridge> <AssassinTee> hmm, you can get the most common color and overlay it with the rest of the pixelart tho 😮
16:16 < bridge> <AssassinTee> oh god, @patiga our np-problem is getting worse, if we allow overlays with different colors
16:16 < bridge> <egyt> So, this is the list of strings I couldn't translate, some because I don't know where they occure, and some because I don't know technical terms behind them

19:40 < bridge> <egyt> Good thing that I have two laptops, one with Windows and one with Linux...
19:42 < bridge> <egyt> By the way, I replaced "resources" (as "assets" translation) with "textures", is that fine?
19:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you don't need windows or linux for this, or two computers
19:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you just need to press 1 button
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> stick to the common terminology, assets are assets, resources are resources, textures are textures
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> when someone plays with your translation, and we only really offer help in english, telling them to remove 4K assets, will tell them nothing if its translated to something else
19:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but what are "assets" in ukrainian?
19:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if the word that means "textures" is the best fit there, it'd make sense to translate like that
19:51 < bridge> <robyt3> What's the difference between "resource" and "asset"? They are also synonymous in English
19:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in german at least, I'd think "resources" would be a good translation for "assets"
19:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like resource is also a word in ukrainian for that: https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8_(Windows)
19:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah it seems `ассет` (asset) is translated to `ресурс` (resource) in some contexts: that right egyt?

20:53 < bridge> <egyt> but at the same time it differs from the word "ті" ("those"), so now I don't really know
20:54 < bridge> <egyt> I also saw "персонаж" ("character") being used
20:55 < bridge> <egyt> I also saw "персонаж" ("character") being used, but it is a regular noun, and won't really fit here
20:55 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1247262472008896632/aaa17df9d65fa9ce.png?ex=665f6332&is=665e11b2&hm=5f18a1f9d6ebaee890a91401906c03261fa776cb53c30cfe3c1a31ec512be40f&
20:55 < bridge> <egyt> I also saw "персонаж" ("character") being used, but it is a regular noun, and won't really fit here (see picture below)
20:57 < bridge> <egyt> so, either I stop with "Тії", or we have to change practically [all of these pages](https://wiki.ddnet.org/index.php?search=%D1%82%D1%96%D1%97)
20:57 < bridge> <egyt> (please, make "Tee" tab translatable already!)
21:02 < bridge> <egyt> (please, make "Tee" tab translatable already! https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8436)
21:02 < bridge> <egyt> Or should I open a separate issue?
21:03 < bridge> <egyt> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Common_Terminology/uk did I struck gold?
21:03 < bridge> <egyt> (please, make "Tee" tab translatable already! https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8436)
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that issue is fine
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to expedite the resolution of the issue, I suggest you create a pull request to make "Tee" translatabl
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to expedite the resolution of the issue, I suggest you create a pull request to make "Tee" translatable
21:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why translate tee
21:05 < bridge> <egyt> 😫
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. because latin characters are usually not used in the language
21:06 < bridge> <egyt> because we actually have a translation used on Wiki
21:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I find the wiki reason meh
21:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Thanks god i never open those pages
21:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can also adjust the wiki instead
21:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my lang got casts :poggers:
21:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1247265411846639737/image.png?ex=665f65ef&is=665e146f&hm=1cf8f99c2733f1bc306ea1fae9059e80819720b2c57eca8fc7e2302bca22013c&
21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the result of casting `-1` to `u8`?
21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that a good result? ^^
21:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It can parse casts but it cant print out stuff
21:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Xd
21:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ^^
21:08 < bridge> <egyt> time to modify the source code again
21:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> The time has come either to add bool or 16 bit ints
21:09 < bridge> <egyt> time to git clone again
21:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Probably bool will be a better choice
21:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no need to delete the clone btw 😉
21:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And i redid all `From` impl into `TryFrom` :justatest:
21:12 < bridge> <egyt> So, this is the list of strings I couldn't translate, some because I don't know where they occure, and some because I don't know technical terms behind them
21:12 < bridge> <egyt> 
21:12 < bridge> <egyt> ```

21:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it works even without calling C functions 😏

21:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it kinda works ™

21:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
21:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but my compiler is so high tech that it cant represent -128 as i byte :pepeW:
21:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but my compiler is so high tech that it cant represent -128 as 1 byte :pepeW:
21:31 < bridge> <egyt> Compiling time!!
22:17 < bridge> <learath2> off by one error somewhere?
22:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's because of the way i handle integer literals
22:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have int_repr struct which stores unsigned value
22:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and then it can be put in unary expr to make it negative
22:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so first it's +128 which takes 2 bytes
22:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and then it becomes negative
22:49 < bridge> <egyt> Well, it works, now it is localisable

22:54 < bridge> <egyt> Here we are, having a nice number
22:57 < bridge> <egyt> So, this is the list of strings I couldn't translate, some because I don't know where they occure, and some because I don't know technical terms behind them

22:57 < bridge> <egyt> Also, 10 strings left to translate!
23:00 < bridge> <egyt> So, I have to add
23:00 < bridge> <egyt> 
23:00 < bridge> <egyt> ```
23:00 < bridge> <egyt> Tee
23:00 < bridge> <egyt> ==

23:00 < bridge> <egyt> 
23:00 < bridge> <egyt> into my local translation, right?
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> So, do I need to add
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> 
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> ```
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> Tee
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> ==

23:01 < bridge> <egyt> 
23:01 < bridge> <egyt> into my local translation?
23:02 < bridge> <egyt> Or the next release will be without my translation for that tab?
23:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
23:03 < bridge> <egyt> Oh, and also https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8404
23:03 < bridge> <egyt> Informative

23:08 < bridge> <egyt> hehehehe
23:25 < bridge> <egyt> Huh, we actually have a word "форсувати"
23:29 < bridge> <egyt> Huh, we actually have a word "форсувати" for that
23:40 < bridge> <egyt> So, again, should I go into translation files of the repo to add

23:40 < bridge> <egyt> ```
23:40 < bridge> <egyt> Tee
23:40 < bridge> <egyt> ==
23:40 < bridge> <egyt> ```
23:40 < bridge> <egyt> 
23:40 < bridge> <egyt> so my translation for Tee tab name will be in the next release

23:44 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, I did not know we even translated that one
23:45 < bridge> <egyt> Because you never did
23:46 < bridge> <egyt> I made a PR to make the "Tee" (tab name) translatable literally less then an hour ago

23:50 < bridge> <egyt> I guess I'll have to ask "tomorrow"
23:55 < bridge> <learath2> I forgot to restart my monero node after they replaced my hdd, now I fell so far behind that it'll take me days to resync
23:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> why not PR your entire thing at once?
23:55 < bridge> <learath2> It might be time to get a server upgrade too ngl, spinning rust is getting on my nerves lately
