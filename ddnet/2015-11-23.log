01:34 <@deen> EastByte: that's not ironic, just a spiral of hatred. I'd bet that's some affected hosters who want to hit him back.
12:37 <@deen> eeh: https://twitter.com/atma_es/status/659980724150366208
12:47 <@heinrich5991> how did you find that?
13:51 <@EastByte> deen: is it fixed already?
13:57 <@deen> i searched for ddnet on twitter^^
13:57 <@deen> EastByte: i'm not sure what that was
13:57 <@deen> whether atma.es is even something serious or this is a publicity stunt
13:57 <@deen> or whether someone is just faking random IPs
13:58 <@EastByte> we have ntp runnning on all servers right?
13:58 <@EastByte> can they be used for reflection attacks?
13:58 <@deen> we have ntp clients running
13:58 <@deen> no servers i hope :P
13:59 <@EastByte> hm...
14:00 <@deen> eeeh, from how i understand the ntpd config it actually allows anyone to use the ntp server by default...
14:00 <@EastByte> well... there has to be reason why ntp so heavily used for attacks
14:05 <@deen> so, centos has a reasonable default config
14:05 <@deen> but on debian your ntp server is public by default..
14:05 <@EastByte> udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:123             0.0.0.0:*                           2076/ntpd       
14:05 <@deen> and they tell you to install and use ntp to sync your own time, not clarifying that you automatically run a public ntp server, nice
14:06 <@EastByte> awesome
14:06 <@deen> but at least it seems to be restricted to public in some way
14:06 <@deen> should be closed now
14:08 <@EastByte> udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:123             0.0.0.0:*                           31528/ntpd      
14:08 <@EastByte> hm
14:08 <@deen> or i misunderstand it, have to read more closely
14:10 <@deen> http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions
14:12 <@EastByte> maybe it keeps the ports open but doesn't respond
14:13 <@deen> ntpd sucks. should see if there is a good alternative
14:14 <@deen> probably tlsdate
14:15 <@deen> or systemd-timesyncd, but don't have systemd everywhere
14:28 <@deen> changing time on ddnet servers is dangerous btw
14:29 <@deen> makes everyone time out
14:38 <@deen> ok, the debian config for ntp is actually ok. disallows monlist, so no amplification possible
14:47 < Hamid_Jigool> hi again
14:47 <@deen> hi Hamid_Jigool 
14:48 < Hamid_Jigool> im sorry.. i have another question .. searching for help :P

15:00 <@deen> from bam.lua
15:00 < Droping_Hamid_J> ok
15:03 < Droping_Hamid_J> i remove that and its work... DDnet_sql_Server Compiled
15:03 <@deen> great
15:03 < Droping_Hamid_J> so i must test it
15:04 < Droping_Hamid_J> :P
15:04 <@deen> yeah, now you need mysql/mariadb installed, set up database, user with password and set the sql settings in your config: http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
15:07 < Droping_Hamid_J> o yeesss i copy all command in mysql.cfg in master_scipt of ddnet
15:07 < Droping_Hamid_J> its work
15:07 < Droping_Hamid_J> o god
15:07 < Droping_Hamid_J> i have DDnet with mysql now
15:07 < Droping_Hamid_J> :P
15:07 < Droping_Hamid_J> yessssss
15:08 < Droping_Hamid_J> dear deen i think you must put server_sql version inside other server type for windows in your site
15:08 < Droping_Hamid_J> all people must have this great server
15:08 <@deen> it's too big and most people would have no idea how to set up an sql server
15:09 < Droping_Hamid_J> its realy easy .. i put toturial in DDnet Forum
15:09 < Droping_Hamid_J> with Wamp software
15:09 <@deen> ok, great
15:11 < Droping_Hamid_J> i will be back.. im go to test a lot config on my server... have good time dear deen 
15:12 < Droping_Hamid_J> Bye :D
15:12 <@deen> good luck, bye
19:55 <@deen> guenstig_werben: well thanks :P
19:55 < guenstig_werben> wait wait... thanks for what exactly?
19:56 < guenstig_werben> Was hab ich denn gesagt?
19:56 <@deen> 19:55 < guenstig_werben> that's also the reason why I like teeworlds (and don't like ddnet)
19:56 < guenstig_werben> Oh :D
19:57 <@deen> i get a notification when someone mentions ddnet :P
19:57 < guenstig_werben> no i don't have a real problem with ddnet except like it says in stupidedia every normal person has no chance
19:57 <@deen> yeah, the learning curve is terrible for ddnet
19:58 <@deen> some people manage to get really good in just a few days, but they have a mentor
19:58 <@deen> and a lot of experience in gaming
22:22 < pielover> How do you set a ddnet ddrace server to Testddracenetwork gamemode? and this prevents 'finishing' a map, right?
22:53 <@heinrich5991> maybe try sv_test_cmds 1 or so
22:56 < pielover> that's what the server command page suggested.. alright I'll try that. thanks :3
22:58 < pielover> yep works dandy fine! thanks
