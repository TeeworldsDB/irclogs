01:09 < Savander> good night :)
11:27 < Savander> hi
11:45 <@EastByte> hellow
11:47 < Savander> ;3
12:00 <@deen> hi
12:01 <@EastByte> !Viva la Espa√±a!
12:02 < Savander> !
12:02 < Savander> !nimda
12:02 < Savander> hm
12:02 < Savander> xD
12:25 < Nimda> The Joke 2 by TheZyZya just released on Brutal at 2015-05-28 12:23
13:39 < Savander> can someone explain me, what it's "backspace" and how to simulate it in console? (C Langauge).
13:54 < laxadedi> backspace is delete
13:55 <@EastByte> backspace is a differen key than delete :P
13:55 < laxadedi> ctrl + d ?
13:55 < laxadedi> oh wait
13:55 < laxadedi> translation is wrong
13:55 < laxadedi> it's the key on top of enter usually
13:56 < Savander> backspace ( probably )
13:56 < Savander> moves cursor one point back.
13:56 < Savander> but it's impossible to "simulate" it in console 
13:56 < Savander> xD
13:56 < laxadedi> What do you mean by simulate ?
13:56 <@EastByte> you want to erase console text?
13:56 < Savander> "Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each
13:56 < Savander> backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an
13:56 < Savander> unambiguous way."
13:57 < laxadedi> wtf
13:57 < laxadedi> it's easy
13:57 < Savander> i know how to replace
13:57 < Savander> but i don't know how to get '\b' in console
13:57 < laxadedi> backspace isn't a printable char
13:57 < Savander> so it's impossible to print \b then
13:57 < laxadedi> well
13:57 < laxadedi> man ascii
13:57 < laxadedi> or check source code for some is_printable methods
13:58 <@EastByte> I have no idea where \b would actually be printed
13:58 < laxadedi> anyway
13:59 < laxadedi> they don't ask you to print the char '\b'
13:59 < laxadedi> bur to print \ + b
13:59 < laxadedi> that's how I understand it at least
13:59 < laxadedi> otherwise your tab stays a tab
13:59 < laxadedi> and you are doing useless things
13:59 < Savander> i'm just learning
14:00 < laxadedi> char c = str[index];
14:00 < laxadedi> if (c == '\b') printf("\b");
14:00 < Savander> i know how to do it
14:01 < laxadedi> well, you don't print backspace :)
15:57 <@EastByte> deen, heinrich5991: do you know about some nice ebooks worth reading in my 20 hours bus ride?
15:57 <@EastByte> maybe something about theoretical programming
16:01 <@EastByte> I guess I'll grab whole it-ebooks.info
17:22 <@deen> theoretical programming?
17:33 <@deen> I would recommend Dune, but it's not much about programming

18:58 < Spyker> hi all, deen? you here?
19:05 <@EastByte> deen: by theoretical programming I mean computer science in general
19:05 <@EastByte> stuff I'll need in my "Informatik Studium"
19:31 <@deen> Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS!
19:31 < o_be_one> hi :)
19:31 <@deen> hi
19:31 < Savander> hi
19:32 < o_be_one> Savander, i really like XChat ^^
19:32 < o_be_one> but for Windows, Hexchat is a free fork (instead of xChat)
19:35 < Savander> on xchat, ctrl + x works like delete
19:35 < Savander> don't know why :P :D
19:37 < o_be_one> cause it's for "cut"
19:37 < o_be_one> so you can paste by right clic or ctrl + v
19:37 < Savander> no i cant
19:38 < o_be_one> wtf
19:38 < Savander> i know what i said lol
19:38 < o_be_one> works for me x)
19:38 < Savander> ctrl + x just delete text  :PP
19:38 < Savander> so i don't know
19:38 < o_be_one> it cuts
19:38 < Savander> yes, normally it cut
19:38 < o_be_one> so it's not really deleted, its somewhere ahah
19:38 < Savander> everywhere works (ctrl + x)
19:38 < Savander> but in xchat, it's just a delete
19:38 < o_be_one> and ctrl + c you can paste ?
19:39 < Savander> yes
19:39 < Savander> ^^>
19:39 < o_be_one> ahah x)
19:39 < o_be_one> your xchat is noob :D
19:39 < Savander> probably
19:39 < Savander> xD
