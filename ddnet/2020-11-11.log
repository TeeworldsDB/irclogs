05:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @louis its only the draggers ;D
05:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen btw on the fun servers there are still maps with broken tilesets
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> gg
08:15 <@deen> only one map, forgot to fix it yesterday
08:41 <@deen> fixed
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Fix dragger logic?
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Do they react every tick now?
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, same as before
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> see discussion in #general, i broke them
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Oh. But it would be nice if they would be consistent
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no physics changes
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just implement new draggers ðŸ˜„
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, and deprecate the old ones, same as with old hooktrhough
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Same with stoppers
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> same with ...
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Same with the whole game
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeaj
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Intel was not very helpful btw
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They told me to update drivers
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and complain to Lenovo for not providing the latest drivers
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i don't know whom to blame here, windows, lenovo or who ever
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah i get their point that this is really annoying
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even if they newest driver have a different bug appearently
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the fact that like one generation is basically useless with ddnet now, if they dont get any update ever
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> makes me really angry
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Windows does automatic driver updates at its own these days, doesn't it?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well the drivers are from january
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so if it does it, then too rare
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen osxcross apparently is able to do universal binaries with arm64
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem is that you need the most recent sdk, which breaks sdl
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So until sdl does something about it we are kinda sol
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5130 7 months of no activity
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, then let's just stay where we are. emulated x86-64 is probably good enough for now
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could patch and build our own sdl for macOS, tho iirc it was a bit of a PITA to generate a framework with osxcross
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> target-2.0.16
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe they want to do it for that sdl2 version
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=SDL2-PlayStation-5-Mapping
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they care more about ps5 controller than macos
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but when do they care for your ps4 steering
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never :Sadge:
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> guys if you want put my skins in game :think_bot: :troll: 
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can do it:kek:
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> colorable among us characters :poggers:
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> PS5 development is probably done by people in the gamedev industry actually paid to do sdl work and just contribute upstream
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Itâ€™s really disheartening to see no response in 7 months though, I not only found the bug, I debugged it all the way inside the stupid AppKit and I provided a patch. I even offered to come up with another solution if they donâ€™t like mine
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I donâ€™t see how I can be more cooperative
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whatâ€™s even funnier is they merged my first patch which was going to fix it for 2.0.13. But a goof half assedly patched over it reintroducing the bug. I guess he was friends with the maintainer because no one cared that I was the last that touched it, no one even checked whether there was a regression
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> ddnet with controller when?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> when sdl becomes good xd
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ddnet on ps5
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/775777764108271666
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> It can be custom clothes also, after the creator finishes than making the skin, he starts making some clothes so that they can be put on or not, like a Santa hat
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddnet switch rls pls
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i would play
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> already tried playing on controller
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i enable saving ranks on a LAN serv
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and points system
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i know someone asked it before here but i cant find it
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ranks should work instantly
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for points system `sqlite3 ddnet-server.sqlite` and insert into record_maps table
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i use sqlite3
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like i have it in powershell
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh nvm lol
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> After the good experiences of having 1 asan and 1 ubsan server running GER2, I will now try to run half of GER2 servers on asan, half on ubsan
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> everything except arithemetic undefined behaviour was clean recently
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> good experience for you or the players?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> me
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ðŸ˜¦
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> players didn't complain, so I don't think they noticed
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it should only increase cpu usage slightly on server
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and helps us find serious bugs
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > for points system `sqlite3 ddnet-server.sqlite` and insert into record_maps table
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does ddnet-server.sqlite exist somewhere or do i create it?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it is created when you run DDNet-Server the first time
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you're going to natively support the new Apple ARM stuff? that's interesting ðŸ˜„
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just hoped it might be easy to support, if not then not
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/776148450415869983/unknown.png
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there like a specific order of values i have to insert
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Something like this: `insert into record_maps (Map, Server, Points, Stars, Mapper) values ("foo", "Novice", 1, 1, "me");`
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> well deen there was a physics change already the one with the freeze ticks
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> but yea deprecating old draggers is probably a better idea
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we also changed jetpack physics at some point to make it easier
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but still, not the best way to go
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow did not know
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> can we get faster walking speed? :troll:
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/776153532071542784/unknown.png
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i renamed a folder and this happened
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rip
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just delete the CMakeCache.txt and CMakeFiles
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and regenerate them as before
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> i woder why it generates absolute paths there
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> is there some sort advantage to it?
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> had the same with npm today

19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well ðŸ˜„
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill figure it out later
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that looks like a bug. Could you open a github issue for Zwelf to look at?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah, will do if it doesnt work around the second time
20:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Could reproduce it. It's a bug, I'll open a PR to fix this.
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> any way that the layer name size in editor can be increased?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> on some maps its useful to name things but the name size is like half a character long so i have to squeeze everything
