01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž this takes a lot of time to implement and there is nobody willing to invest his time in it. First you got to understand how it works and then you need to be highskilled and smart enough to code this within the vanilla client.
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> This is not like just cherrypicking some content from ddnet
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> So many things would be easier without vanilla compatibility and slowly becoming maybe even separate game
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž> what is difference in physics of tw06 an 07?
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž> @n000b
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon are there any?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not sure but the code base is completly different why it is hard to integrate it. You basically need to code everything again. Well that is what i understood from discussion, i don't know anything of coding.
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shoulda ask me not chiller xd
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> physics are the same.
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chad> will predefined x11 include lib be work as native good on linux with wayland?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chad> will predefined x11 include lib be work as native on linux with wayland?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @n000b as fokko said there are no physic changes
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> anybody know what "mapres" stands for?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> map resource
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> thx
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> MAP pictures RESidential area
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> jao is mistaken
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> MAPping tiles RESidential area
