01:50 <@deen> laxa: i think i just fixed the shooting when paused thing
01:50 <@deen> and a few related ones
01:51 < laxa> Nice, <3 !
01:51 <@deen> But I'm not sure if i should always enable it
01:51 <@deen> all key inputs are now ignored when you're paused
01:51 <@deen> is that good?
01:51 < laxa> Beh, can you switch in spectate mode ?
01:51 < laxa> switch the view I mean
01:51 <@deen> sure
01:51 < laxa> and can you use when in test server tele 0 0
01:52 <@deen> sure
01:52 < laxa> use tele
01:52 < laxa> well, I don't know what could be wrong
01:52 <@deen> only the normal game controls don't work
01:52 <@deen> for example if you were hooked somewhere
01:52 <@deen> and you stop hooking while paused, it would stop when you unpause
01:52 <@deen> but now it doesn't anymore
01:52 <@deen> or if you start holding D while paused, then it used to run immediately on unpause
01:52 <@deen> now not
01:53 < laxa> Well then, that's even more wonderfull :p
01:53 < laxa> Hum not sure then

01:54 <@deen> we have no players on persian server
01:54 <@deen> everyone plays on Persian Pro
01:55 <@deen> they have ddnet mod + ddnet maps + /r, /solo
01:55 < laxa> ./solo ?!
01:57 <@deen> yes
01:57 <@deen> puts you into solo part
01:57 <@deen> and out of it
01:57 <@deen> wherever you want
01:58 < laxa> You can cheat doing that !
01:58 <@deen> I told him the same, but he wouldn't believe me^^
01:58 <@deen> and more importantly, the players love it
01:58 <@deen> you can also cheat with /r!
01:58 < laxa> Well, this feature is quite useless if maps have perfect gameplay.
01:59 <@deen> and /r just makes every map easier
01:59 <@deen> or at least less faily
02:00 <@deen> Would've been nice to have a popular Iranian DDNet server again =/
02:00 <@deen> we used to get really nice player numbers there
12:52 <@deen> good morning
13:21 < kamillentee> Good morning ? Its 13:20
13:22 < kamillentee> ;D
13:27 <@deen> Exactly!

18:27 <@deen> nice
18:47 < laxa> deen: ddos ?
19:54 <@deen> back
19:56 < laxa> deen: love you <3
19:57 <@deen> ?
20:23 < kamillentee> Hehe
20:50 < laxa> deen: minor bug with /save
20:51 < laxa> or not...
20:51 <@deen> ddnet is bug-free
20:51 < kamillentee> Xd
20:51 < laxa> Yeah xD.
20:52 <@deen> every bug we have left is hereby declared a feature
20:52 < kamillentee> Its not a bug. Its a feature
20:52 <@deen> I bought a french ddos protected server btw
20:52 <@deen> now i'm waiting for it to be setup, no idea how long that takes
20:53 <@deen> apparently people wait a few days for the "120 seconds" setup
20:53 < laxa> wtf
20:53 < laxa> you bought where then ?
20:53 <@deen> kimsufi
20:53 < laxa> ah then you'll have to wait
20:53 < laxa> online.net is instant
20:53 < laxa> kimsufi is recycled old servers
20:53 <@deen> online.net is expensive though
20:53 < laxa> so you have no services at all
20:53 < laxa> kimsufi = ovh
20:54 < laxa> they just rent for cheap their retired servers
20:54 < laxa> that's why
20:56 < kamillentee> Cant beleave deen that there is no german offer for a ddos protectet server
20:56 <@deen> kamillentee: I've been searching for months and asked others to tell me if they know of any
20:56 <@deen> haven't found anything yet
21:20 <@deen> I hope the servers will be there for the Kobra 3 tournament
21:20 <@deen> server*
21:20 < kamillentee> Deen ddos protectet server is just used for tournaments?
21:21 < kamillentee> *are
21:21 <@deen> kamillentee: we don't have any yet
21:21 <@deen> but i will set it up normally as DDNet FRA i guess
21:21 <@deen> and run tournaments there instead of on GER
21:21 < kamillentee> Ok but in the rest of world
21:22 < kamillentee> Is still no ddos protection
21:22 <@deen> right
21:22 <@deen> i can't buy ddos protection for all servers
21:23 <@deen> which is why i wanted to shut down ddnet last time, but people complained
21:26 < kamillentee> I searched for ddos protection and found link11, ovh and cloudflare.
21:26 < kamillentee> All offers in germany
21:38 <@deen> ovh in germany?
21:38 <@deen> cloudfare protects websites only
21:38 <@deen> not suitable for ddnet
21:39 <@deen> link11 sounded good, but they probably cost more than 200 / month
22:36 < laxa> !pl-en toska
22:36 < Nimda> Translation: toska
22:59 < laxa> 3 hours to finish Just_Shotgun, but finally did it :p !
23:01 <@deen> ^
23:01 <@deen> nice laxa
23:10 < laxa> deen: where you bought ddnet.tw ? Can't buy .tw on online.net.
23:10 <@deen> http://uniteddomains.com
23:10 <@deen> And actually Megaman is paying it^^
23:10 < Savander> ddforce.tw$19.00available
23:10 < Savander> lol?
23:11 <@deen> but they have the chepeast .tw domains
23:11 < Savander> so cheap
23:11 <@deen> no ipv6 though from what i can see
23:11 < Savander> WOW
23:11 < Savander> ddforce.accountants
23:11 < Savander> ??
23:11 < Savander> .accountants
23:11 <@deen> there will soon be .racing :P
23:11 < Savander> 79$
23:11 <@deen> i should get hook.racing
23:12 <@deen> dd.racing
23:12 < Savander> :D:D:
23:12 < laxa> who wants to develop with me
23:12 < laxa> tbdd.tw ?
23:12 < laxa> The Big Demo Database !
23:12 < laxa> xD
23:12 < Savander> lol.
23:12 < Savander> base.tw
23:12 < Savander> database.tw
23:12 < Savander> xD
23:13 <@deen> i would give you db.ddnet.tw
23:13 <@deen> :P
23:13 < Savander> i can 
23:13 < Savander> db.teeworlds.com.pl
23:13 < Savander> db.teeworlds.org.pl
23:13 < Savander> and maybe soon
23:13 < Savander> db.teeworlds.pl
23:13 < Savander> xD
23:13 < Savander> want?! xD
23:14 <@deen> but google doesn't like .tw domains btw
23:14 <@deen> all country specific domains get worse ranking
23:14 <@deen> for english content
23:14 < Savander> for teeworlds
23:14 < laxa> Domain name isn't that important
23:14 < Savander> it's doesn't matter i gues?
23:14 < Savander> guess?
23:14 < laxa> I need someone to develop my idea xD
23:15 < Savander> in which langauge?
23:15 < laxa> whatever
23:15 < Savander> i  want to learn! 
23:15 < Savander> because im noob :(
23:15 < laxa> The developer choose it
23:15 < Savander> you're not developer?
23:15 < Savander> :D
23:15 < laxa> Yeah I am
23:15 < laxa> but I am so bad at designing
23:16 < laxa> and I can't host ASP.net on my dedi
23:16 < laxa> or maybe I can
23:16 < laxa> I don't know
23:16 < laxa> 13.39.86 (forget this I just use IRC as notepad :p)
23:17 < Savander> you can i guess
23:19 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/files/videos/niceshoot.mp4
23:19 <@deen> laxa: Your demo database would be great with ddnet client integration for uploading and downloading demos
23:19 < Savander> HEHE
23:19 <@deen> and seeing when a friend finished a map, so you can watch their demo
23:19 <@deen> (which is exactly what is planned for hookrace)
23:20 < laxa> deen: wut ? You are planning that oO ?
23:20 <@deen> yes
23:20 < laxa> Savander: not sure you can host Microsft closed source ASP.NET on linux...
23:21 < laxa> deen: you know if ASP.NET can be hosted on Linux ?
23:21 <@deen> no idea, i wouldn't use it definitely
23:22 <@deen> But if you used google you would have found out about mono
23:22 < laxa> I know the name "mono"
23:22 < laxa> but it's a compiler or IDE isn't it ?
23:22 <@deen> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1116175/running-asp-net-on-a-linux-based-server
23:23 <@deen> i only know that mono, aside of java, is the thing that always takes most memory on my homeserver
23:23 < laxa> Lol
23:23 < laxa> Ok thanks deen.
23:23 < laxa> I can't check the availability of .tw domain on the website, it's really bad website...
23:24 < laxa> ah ok
23:24 < Savander> you cant?
23:24 < Savander> i can
23:24 < Savander> xd
23:24 < laxa> I found out how
23:24 < laxa> their .net is espensive :)
23:26 < laxa> deen: there is something funny with /map
23:26 < laxa> deen: try this : /map Verification 9
23:26 < laxa> it proposes : Verification 3.9 when there is Verification 9.0 & Verification 9.1
23:28 <@deen> yeah, to be expected
23:28 <@deen> it looks for every map that contains the characters you entered in that order, starting with V
23:29 <@deen> and then sorts that list by length and then lexicographically
23:29 <@deen> and takes the first element
23:29 <@deen> iirc
23:51 < Savander> laxa:
23:51 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/projects/teezone/
23:52 < Savander> what you think?
