00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Chile has network problems and you can watch the routing switching around in an attempt to fix it live 😄

03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Today I couldn't get /points and /rank for man with nickname `"""`
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> It was just empty space in system messages
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> And displayed no points or rank, but he had completed map and had his time on tab scoreboard
03:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> /points "\\"\\"\\""
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> I tried \"\" \" but it just wrote back that user not found
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Lol
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> I wrote with backslashea
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> I wrote with backslashes
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> But discord just escaped it
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen Pretty much everything that is displayed ingame, so `blob.png` doesn't need dilate, but `game.png`, all of entities  & skins should be dilated
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Maybe Jupstar would be able to fix the rendering same way vanilla did it, so that dilate would only be needed in cases of using graphical programs like Inkscape, while the game itself wouldn't require nearly everything to be dilated?
05:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> If not, then I guess smarter & less confusing solution would be to just dilate every single png that goes into the game in both data & config_directory
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> because I don't remember a single case where using dilate caused any/more bugs
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie @mind Your thoughts?
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> #2798

15:43 <+DDNet> f
15:43 <+Learath2> How is one even supposed to draw control flow graphs where there are forks?
15:44 <+Learath2> It doesn't even make sense, if there is a fork, there is more than one control flow, how am I supposed to fit that in one graph?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you need to draw a cfg?
15:46 <+Learath2> I was taking a look at example exams for the OS course
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, maybe draw it like an if, except there's both branches taken?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```c
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   if(fork() > 0) v[i] = 0
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   else v[i] = 1;
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The mess I'm trying to draw
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I heard OS, I thought we'd finally be doing something cool. I'd much rather write a scheduler than draw graphs
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Life is pain, contant pain...
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Life is pain, constant pain...
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Learath2 what are you doing btw?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> learning the teachers definitions for an OS exam
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When they ask for a CFG, they actually mean, what they have defined as a CFG in their class
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll be damned if I found a single professor sticking to commonly accepted definitions excepts for the physics guy
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you ever heard of a Taylor polynomial with peanos form of remainder?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That definition made my entire first year pure pain. Absolutely no one has any idea how to work with it, couldnt ask for help anywhere
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> peano's form? ^^
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've heard of taylor polynomials ^^
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1809293/taylors-theorem-with-peanos-form-of-remainder
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> no, sounds scary. What I've learned at university is that many things you learned will be forgotten without a chance to use it. But eventually not that many things as I thought earlier. You never know what will be handy later
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the one single stackexchange answer I found too
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> math stackoverflow
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine being a dedicated user of that
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u must be big brain
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ##math had no idea too. I had to pretty much refer to the book that the professor wrote and work from the definitions he gave to figure out the things I wanted to know
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or a math student?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that too :justatest:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Our algorithms teacher was like this too, I immediately identified a guy in ##C trying to cheat on an exam because only our teacher would ask that stupid question
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> xd
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Found another. Have you ever heard of a "Process Generation Tree"?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only thing that comes up when you google it is my course page 😄

16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Trump Twitter Account Hacked by Dutch Hackers With The Password "Yourefired"
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lmao
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think he wants me to recurse down into sub directories or not?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/754005075793412106/Screenshot_2020-09-11_at_18.46.30.png
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all the regular files *with dimension* less than 10MB
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The dumbest question I could find. I think I'm done for tonight
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/754022915325952070/Screenshot_2020-09-11_at_19.57.18.png
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Yeah, seems so, checked the answer and seems he wanted recursive
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if globstar is okay
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ??
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "??" for which one? Both are equally baffling to me
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I should send a mail to the guy to stop teaching this god awful class and rework his mess of an "Operating Systems" curriculum
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Uff same module next semester. Cant wait
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw, since DDNet is now on steam, this server could get "verified" badge
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> like Vanilla does
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nop
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably yes
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just needs some more effort
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> discord said no
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we dont meet their criteria
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001107231
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> discord said no, but "some more effort" is talking to people to explain the situation
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     The applicant must both be the owner of the server and an official representative of a business, brand, or figure of public interest.
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     The applicant should authenticate any other relevant social accounts on their profile to help us verify the validity of the application.
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     The applicant should use a formal email address related to the brand, business or entity. This will make it easier for us to understand that they hold an official position.
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think deen should do it
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he did it and they said no
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did he do it before steam or after
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> after
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knacker> > When I heard OS, I thought we'd finally be doing something cool. I'd much rather write a scheduler than draw graphs
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knacker> @Learath2 you want material to learn it?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> after but I doubt they realized we're on steam
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you dont think they read #announcements ?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or ddnet.tw?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what they do
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do u doubt it then
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but probably putting in the least effort
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they have to check the server for sure
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's why I doubt it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean we can make it simple. I et 5€ that I can get it accepted in half a year. don't think so?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *bet
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao don't think so?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why half a year?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well you said never, so half a year should be fine
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not never
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just wanted to have some cap so you can be right after that time
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> k
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, then we agree that it's possible that ddnet can get verified. nice 🙂
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ofc
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if we get 50k users here for example
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> im sure they will reconsider
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that the reason why you don't want to agree to half a year?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i can agree to half a year
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you think that we get too many users before that?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (my discord messages seem to lag, 1min+ till they get through)
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (more like 5min+)
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k, then before 2021-03-11
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i bet u could get it easily
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess the size/popularity of the game matters though
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> because anyone can upload anything to steam tbh
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `The applicant must both be the owner of the server and an official representative of a business, brand, or figure of public interest.` :justatest: :justatest: :justatest:
