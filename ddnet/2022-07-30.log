00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I did a quick profile of the server under ddos today, didn't find anything interesting except that fillantibot takes a fair bit of time
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since that has nothing to do with ddos, I'm guessing it's always a significant chunk of the time
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we perhaps devise a better way of passing data to the antibot? Something no-copy perhaps?
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no-copy runs into abi problems
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im experiencing the same
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it only on version 16.1 to 16.2 ?
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i got so confused, i thought it was introducing web rendering into the client 😄
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> html + css would be amazing xdd
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but javascript sucks
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Should we update the steam capsules/screenshots to match the current version of ddnet?
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets wait until ninja skin is replaced with smth fitting xD
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah should probs be updated some time 😄
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also this screenshot looks ugly
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/412220/ss_bf95f71d5dcd7013af5888a61d07673068d6d557.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646225107
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should generally be deleted
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> alone the freeze that stops on the unhook tiles
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> horrible xd
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah this screenshot lacks any real dynamic feeling
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh man what if crowded Back In Time 3 screenshot was used
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks got a crash with *new* gpu driver, not old one: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/3463849349658412872/
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> looks to me like he uses "pure" wayland which only works with GLES or if you install the GLEW-egl package(only exists on some distros, e.g. arch)
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, can you respond to him or should I send him that?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can ask him
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But if he has crashdump he should be on Windows
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not wayland
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why does it load EGL, makes no sense
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Hi, is there any kind of guide on how to customize a client? (HUD and some simple stuff like that)
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it was ask quite lot in this discord, but I dunno if there is an official guide, but maybe with the discord search function u'll find smth useful
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or on the data discord
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> whats the data discord?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/930925542138609754
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5642#issuecomment-1192529045
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does your tool support this?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> disallow server commands
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if I read correctly its about adding a setting to the map info?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah so they dont add it to new maps for now
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, displaying a warning that a specific setting is set
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes that is a check that could easily be added, would add it to `twmap_check_ddnet`
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh I remember I also wanted to add something different to it, have to go back through messages to check what it was, got sidetracked a lot by twgpu and having not time available ^^
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be nice 😄
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> from tuesday on I will have a lot of time on my hands :)
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are there still plans for twgpu? D.
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😄
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, definitely!
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> am still working on it with the little time I had
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hope I can ramp up the progress again, I enjoy coding graphics quite a lot, it can be very rewarding
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah its a nice alternative to CPU programming 😄
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen what do i need to do to enable theme switching locally btw?
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1002892818764791818/unknown.png
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> poor deen struggling with some background color 😄
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i always get 404's also for the halloween css
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but kinda my fault, since i didnt test it locally 😄
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Basically this: https://hookrace.net/blog/theme-switcher-nginx/
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's working
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah ok ty
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Valve is making a big change to the way developers can market their games on Steam. Beginning September 1st, graphical assets developers use in their store listings will only be able to include game artwork, the game’s name, and any official subtitle. Images won’t be able to include review scores, award names or logos, text that markets discounts, or text promoting a different product.

16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the bot
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here is to hoping our lord and savior gaben is immortal
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If he ever dies or decides to sell valve the immense monopoly power of steam will be unleashed on us poor proles
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he said he wont give it to his son
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe he will find someone proper
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't think any modern, recent and international company can survive the death of its founder, in the spirit i mean
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apple did
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm idk what u mean by spirit
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the way the company treats its clients, the general state of mind
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> apple kinda went a little down since 2011, no?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> milking more and more everyone
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> although, im not sure if it would have been so different with Steve Jobs
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably not, Jobs liked his sweet profits just like every other capitalist, and Apple is a publicly traded company that is bound by law to maximize the profits of it's shareholders
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The key to valve not crushing us peasants is private ownership. Gabe doesn't need to pursue profits if he doesn't feel like it. He is like a benevolent dictator
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A proper profit maximizing valve would be devastating, steam is literally a monopoly
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Does Gaben just pocket all the valve money? They have so few employees idk where it all goes
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Each employee could get 25 million in equity xd
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why go public when u dont need to
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What would you like to do?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@bubliman)
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gaben only owns like half of valve. The rest is employee equity and I think some bigger private individual shares. Like his ex wife iirc
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Why are memcpy and std::copy reversed in their call order?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Couldn't they just simply keep the same order...
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> memcpy is memcpy(dest, source, size)
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> std::copy is std::copy(source_start, source_end, dest_start)...
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they arent the same i guess
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> start ptr, end ptr
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vs start ptr size
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but they could have kept the same order with dest first then source
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> copy start into dest
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess its more intuitive
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> always think like u writing english
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i prefer memcpy way, closer to assignment writing
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> dest = source (repeat size times)
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> copy is from start to end into dest
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> weirder
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> copy this ptr that ends at this location into dest
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> source[start:end] -> dest
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> doesn't feel very c
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> almost like VHDL or verilog, but still reversed 😄
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont waste ur time and just accept it xD
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i want to waste my time
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> scumbag c++ comitee
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> already done, thanks to someones help 🙂

17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> What did you do?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> clientside ability to make everyone the skin that i have
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> oh neat
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah everyone can be default no colors thats what i wanted
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmobsessiono
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if i replace a single mem_copy in graphics_threaded with std::copy, there are visual glitches everywhere 😄
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> show me the diff
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> code diff
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then don’t replace them? 😄

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah im stupid
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> -1
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> forgot dereferencing
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nvm, -1 was too much
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also do it with a plus
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not with an array access
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> a +?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> m_aVertices
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> +NumVerts
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tbh
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just use std::copy_n
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> copy is too much raw ptr stuff already xD
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> rofl, another interface order
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> input, size, dest
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least coherent with copy
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> clang-tidy finds some weird stuff: <https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/runs/7591878202?check_suite_focus=true>
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone used my teel.ink service with a malicious url redirection
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and hetznet told me to remove it and blocked my ip
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this shit is hilarious
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's to expected tho
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its user generated content
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how does any company using a hoster keep themselves alive
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, so are 99% of all youtube videos xD
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if 1 user and do this
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and 98% are still illegal xD
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and google has to delete them ^^
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u can be sure u cannot be sued
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u are still responsible for what exists
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz its a link redirection maybe
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i never know what to do when i stumble upon some non sensical code: <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/192c7b2bb0a21b9015abe936af6fc0de16dcc539/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L518-L526>
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> do you agree that it copies array `pEntry->m_Info.m_aAddresses` into `aAddresses` and then from `aAddresses` into `pEntry->m_Info.m_aAddresses` ?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> lol what
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `aAddresses` looks useless
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I agree
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Viewing git blame on ddnet code feels surreal sometimes, there's always 2 month old code next to 12 year old code
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> good old Magnus Auvinen 🙂
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oldest lines are 15 years old
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `copied refactor to trunk`
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is the commit i see most in git blaming 😄
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> svn to git i guess
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's also the really informative `more stuff :)`

18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> bring back more stuff commits :trollet:

19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like these were never merged in
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, they come from this PR: <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5438>
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyone have the old svn repo? we could convert it to git and merge it with current ddnet by replacing the oldest change in ddnet git repo. then you can go back further in history
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't think so, it's over 15 years old so probably deleted by everyone
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like you had your oops period
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the phase
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you stopped saying oops 5 years ago 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :oop:
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i found this https://downloads.teeworlds.com/teewars/
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just tarball
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there is a .svn folder, but i don't know how to get the log from it. svn log says you must upgrade, upgrade says no server...
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> @Chairn yea those commits are from the chillerbot-ux fork and there jao still exists https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/blob/chillerbot/data/playerpics/jao.png
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> I think my biggest troll commit that got merged into ddnet is this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/949aa124e9fa8c608985b29e4b9f2210d9ea32fe
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Hey, how far does a hammer reach in units?
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> if its not in the wiki its shomething that should be documented in the wiki if you find it out
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> > `The range of the hammer allows you to just barely hit tees behind a 1 tile thick wall.`
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> not necessarily precise 😄
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 42
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> okay will try that thanks 🙂
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> should i put it on the wiki?
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> are you sure he is not trolling?
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> as in 42 is the answer to everything :D i mean its probably close
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 32 is one block, so 42 makes sence?
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> The number i got from looking at the code is 14 but that makes no sense :D 
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> 42 is a bit too far
20:38 <+ChillerDragon> thats almost 2 blocks so you could have some air between the block and the tees
20:38 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/dafc3984dd0881cc67004dcfdf00e0cbe8d200ee/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L447
20:39 <+ChillerDragon> GetProximityRadius() should be 28.0f for character
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> if((pTarget == this || (pTarget->IsAlive() **&& !CanCollide(pTarget->GetPlayer()->GetCID()))))**
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> how did u get that value?
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> from the line i sent but as i said 14 makes no sense
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> The range of the hammer 28.0f) allows you to just barely hit tees behind a 1 tile thick wall.
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> the apEnts var that is used to apply the hit on is filled by FindEntities and the readius that is being passed in is `GetProximityRadius() * 0.5`
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> The range of the hammer (28.0f) allows you to just barely hit tees behind a 1 tile thick wall.
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> if tiles are 32 then 28 is a bit close isnt it
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> it might work if both tees are 2 units into the wall :) idk how the collision code works
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> why '14*0.5=28' i dont get thta
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> why '14*0.5=28' i dont get that
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, 14+28 is 42
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> by trolling, i accidentally gave the right answer 😄
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> yea 28 * 0.5 = 14
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> oh
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> GetProximityRadius() is 28
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> but since that makes no sense i clearly read the code wrong
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 28 makes more sence if the hitboxes are a in the wall?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 28 makes more sence if the hitboxes are in the wall?
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> yea that would work right
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> lets say you can walk 2 units into a wall
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> then tees would have a 28 distance when being split by a wall
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> thats probably not the case tho
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> why do you even care?
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> and what about your hud thing what is that for?
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> wait
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> we want to make a hammer range hitbox
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003012197426937996/unknown.png
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> are tiles even 32 units?
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> not 64?
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> and a tee is 28x2 big?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 64 pixels, im not sure what is used for these calculations
20:53 <+ChillerDragon> a
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> thats from the FindEntities ``distance(pEnt->m_Pos, Pos) < Radius + pEnt->m_ProximityRadius``
20:55 <+ChillerDragon> it takes the distance of the two tees
20:55 <+ChillerDragon> and makes sure its lower than the radius + the tee size
20:55 <+ChillerDragon> search radius passed in as far as im aware should be 14 and the proximityradius 28
20:56 <+ChillerDragon> so maybe it is indeed 42? xd
20:58 <+ChillerDragon> but that would mean given that a tile is 32 units wide one tee could stand 10 units away from the tile and still hit the tee on the other side and 10 units is almost 1/3 tile which should be visible with the bare eye
21:00 <+ChillerDragon> @bubliman how do you draw that hot circle btw? 
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> sadly this is just photoshoped ...
21:01 <+ChillerDragon> xd
21:01 <+ChillerDragon> so thats ur next question then?
21:01 <+ChillerDragon> my first idea for circles would probably DrawRoundRect
21:01 <+ChillerDragon> if with and height are the same and radius is 50% of the width you get a perfect circle but its filled then
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah we have a filled circle now
21:02 <+ChillerDragon> also i have no idea how rendered pixel relate to physic units
21:02 <+ChillerDragon> a
21:03 <+ChillerDragon> there might line circle code but iv never seen it 
21:03 <+ChillerDragon> wait what about the players tab in settings
21:03 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt it have circles?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> one sec im reading all of you messages 😄
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah it does
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003015231510950049/unknown.png
21:04 <+ChillerDragon> so there you go!
21:05 <+ChillerDragon> nvm seems like a sprite
21:05 <+ChillerDragon> not rendered with code
21:05 <+ChillerDragon> so maybe you gotta use photoshop after all :D 
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> i might have a solution one sec
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> why not a hook hitbox as well?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003015984048787566/unknown.png
21:08 <+ChillerDragon> tbh hammer hitbox as a pizza slice would be cooler as circle
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> cool idea
21:08 <+ChillerDragon> visualizing the aim
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> atm we have this
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003016278438588487/unknown.png
21:08 <+ChillerDragon> :robot:
21:09 <+ChillerDragon> why do ypu even what this? xd
21:09 <+ChillerDragon> is this for ddnet client?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> just for fun and for myself i guess
21:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659208368.png
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> vi elitist?
21:15 <+ChillerDragon> daaa
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i imagine if this was in the actual client it'd look something like these
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003018796417691799/unknown.png
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> atm i just made this concept
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003019129185390652/unknown.png
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> also there is code for landing prediction
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can we stop talking about cheats? xd
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> I thought cheats are only auto inputs
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait how is this a cheat :o
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well it looks like it pre-calculates stuff?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/945410675382050906
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets say it like this, how is it not a cheat if u know how a rocket will fly
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or a shotgun will bounce etc.
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ofc my computer is better than me in calculating it
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003021281110806598/prediction-test.demo.mp4
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> well if hook collision is not cheating, then I don't think this is
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but hook collision is officially added now, its too late to take that cheat back
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> from vanilla point of view even that is cheating
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> imo this isnt that useful anyways, hook collision is in the same category i guess
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this looks more useful than hook collision
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> whihc is a simple line that isnt even accurate most of the time, e.g. while moving
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, that's a full assisted client you got there
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> So hypothetical question, Would I get banned if you proved that I was using this ?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i hope so
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and u just sent the proof xd
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> thats on a private server 😉
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> I kinda agree with @heinrich5991 , not sure he would agree in this context
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003024462582648862/unknown.png
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets wait and see until he reads it 😄
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> its just visual aid for blind people, a ton of those are in t0
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thing is, you cant prove that someone uses this. There are other clients which pre calculate grenade and laser shots already.
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> I like this. Useful. Requires less brain to see where I'm landing. Good work @bubliman 👏
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah, its pretty much impossible 😄
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> the server can choose not to allow hookcoll though
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> not made by me but thanks 😉
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not really, there is even a config setting to show everyone's hookline always
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @bubliman be the advocate for change! I got your back bro.
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the server could just stop sending if other people use it or not, wouldnt change anything except people not being able to point stuff out in freeze
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah everything is calculated client side, i guess you could even do a hookcol this way
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> huh? doesnt the client use the aim flag to decide to render anything?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats what im saying
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it uses it, but that wouldnt allow an aimline entirely^^
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> all of this are bad ideas and thats purely cheating
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> isn't DDNet also made with KISS rule ? =]
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> if yes then thats 100% not KISS  rule 😛
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it uses it, but that wouldnt disallow an aimline entirely^^
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Hi @Tsin whats the KISS rule?
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Keep It Simple Stupid 😛
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> btw the land predict might be a bit far, i was also thinking there could just be a vector (arrow) pointing the direction u are headed and increasing its lenght with your speed
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Drawing a hollow circle is the real trouble here 😄
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> >visual aid for blind people
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> now we just need a hearing aid for deaf people
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah that was just a thing that could be added our main focus tho is the hammer, hook, wall hitboxes
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think hammer range circle is already cheating
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> its _not_ using it, you mean (with showhookcoll 2). I guess this was changed at some point
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> mainly useful for new players imo
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rendering uses the flag
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> except in always for everyone mode
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Those prediction lines are considerably more work than all your other creations, did you make those?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Nope a fried did
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Nope a friend did
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> This friend is krx dev hmm?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> idk what krx is
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> hmm best not to talk about that
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> well now I know 🙂
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how long did it take them?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also wait what, first frame of render demo menu seen here?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh come on, it's more than just a visual aid, it gives you more information because it's curved
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> dont know
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> thats a bug
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im going to assume this was already pre-programmed and simply copy-pasted into the files
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> so u think its fake? or what does that mean? XD
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im saying it might be taken from an already existing bot client
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Actually you can if ddnet client has verification code inside official ddnet client. Like ATH client had. When client is being compiled, just provide hidden key for ddnet client, and on other side only ddnet server can decrypt it
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I bet 90% of this “cheat coders” couldn’t bypass it 😉
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> soo romantic @Tsin kissy kissy 😘
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> who cares tho... if hammer collision is cheating then hook collision should be too,
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Nah that wasn’t my point. I’m just telling that ddnet client needs something to identify itself as official ddnet client compiled by publisher(deen)
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> then its not open source i guess? atleast practically
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Hm, but you can provide ur “key”, there isn’t any hidden code. Just private ddnet’s internal key for verifying official ddnet client
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah but practically unofficial clients are banned?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> At this point u can’t know if someone is faking ddnet’s client with modifications
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> This way there is no f way to crack private hashed key
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> By adding private key, you know 100% that it’s ddnet client without modifications
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> could be abused to ban innocent players i guess
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I’m not telling to ban all that doesn’t have latest client, just in case someone is “potential cheater”
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> the information is neat for sure, maybe for tournaments you could enfore ddnet clients or stuff like that
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> the information is neat for sure, maybe for tournaments you could enfore ddnet client or stuff like that
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Ye but in general, there has to be something to say “yeah, that’s 100% clean client”
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> And even tho to provide api from ddnet’s website to check players that join on other servers. Open rest api for check
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> So other servers that aren’t ddnet can check players too
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah I mean that's past my understanding I guess, I was just trying to figure out what's the actual line here, I consider cheating dishonest and disguisting unless its like f.e. TAS
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah I mean that's past my understanding I guess, I was just trying to figure out what's the actual line here, I consider cheating dishonest and disguisting unless its like  TAS
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah I mean that's past my understanding I guess, I was just trying to figure out what's the actual line here, I consider cheating dishonest and disguisting (unless its like  TAS)
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> but hookline being considered okey dokey, puts quite a greyzone in place, also the "aimbot" bind not really human level input i guess...
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I’d like to hear thoughts for this @deen @heinrich5991 @Learath2
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's impossible. Anyone can modify the client source code, compile it themselves and still pretend to be "100% clean client"
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Not if you provide key on compiling that only you know.
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Let’s be honest, who is going to try to reverse engineer ddnet client to crack key
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we provide a key, someone can take that key from the compiled binary
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then the DDNet version in all Linux distributions wouldn't count as 100% clean anymore
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Since they also build it from source code themselves
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And even if you had a clean client, what prevents someone from running another software that controls the mouse and keyboard inputs to play perfectly, while checking screen
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some games run some malware on your system which scans everything and bans you for running other applications, but even that can be circumvented
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ddnet devs don't have time to engage in anti cheat arms race
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We do engage in it, using teehistorian
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Which doesn't trust the client. Instead we can check what came in on the server and could analyze if it looks suspicious
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I should specify client side arms race i guess
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Which is a losing battle
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And if we were doing it, talking about it publicly would be stupid too 😄
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Yes...
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But yeah, way easier to circumvent any measure we can come up with than implement it
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we can't perma-ban people anyway since the game is free
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so if they get banned, they can just get a new ip and try again
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Btw whats the status of tee historian reconstruction? Is there a private tool that does it?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Would be nice even outside of cheat detection
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not yet: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2937
