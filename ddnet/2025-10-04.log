07:23 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> morning, there're good news and bad news. Good news is that I'm an LLVM contributor now(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/161894), bad news is that the change makes CI fail :/
07:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> growing pains
07:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> congratulations
08:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm proud of you milkey. You broke my next compiler update
09:15 < bridge_> <totar> They dont run the CI until after merging? Thats quite wild
09:15 < bridge_> <totar> do they just revert your PR and expect you to reopen if it fails
09:17 < bridge_> <totar> Thats exactly what happens wtf
09:17 < bridge_> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423931930415726632/Screenshot_20251004_021654_Chrome.jpg?ex=68e21b73&is=68e0c9f3&hm=181f190abaade8a4a5916093dfc63e4ab79316b0364c4027778dbcd369835568&
09:17 < bridge_> <totar> Are the builds seriously that enormously expensive that they sacrifice entire PR workflow to bundle multiple together?
09:25 < bridge_> <totar> Honestly even then I cant imagine why they'd do it this way, you could still bundle test multiple PRs before merging by just having an automatic cherry picking onto a new branch.
09:33 < bridge_> <totar> Stockfish runs multiple days of CI for every PR individually, this is embarrassing for llvm
09:34 < bridge_> <melon> i'm almost certain its the same reason linux kernel still uses mailing lists
09:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> True story. Boomers üò¨
09:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> is this a serious question? it takes a little while lol
09:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> solution: never use trunk
09:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> unless you know you need the exact latest commit
10:07 < bridge_> <totar> But theres no downside to having "trunk 2" that gets merged into master every time it passes CI. Then you  aren't getting an RNG build if you pull master
10:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> CI probably encapsulates a lot more than you think
10:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> the testing they have in place it probably very elaborate
10:08 < bridge_> <totar> They even claim they "pride themselves having tip of tree in good state" but have joke of a CI process
10:08 < bridge_> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423944942488784996/Screenshot_20251004_030816_Chrome.jpg?ex=68e22791&is=68e0d611&hm=c1fc93017c204d286dee88804972d24474d32df82200df969d372725ac7da6db&
10:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> trunk 2 is a good idea
10:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> but iunno
10:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> they do make pretty frequent smaller releases
10:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> while watching godbolt's talk a few weeks ago he ran into an inconsistency with clang where it didn't vectorize code he definitely expected to be, BCS he was on trunk lol
10:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> mid talk
10:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> the on the fly presentations seem really volatile to me. those mfs get too comfortable
10:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> while I was watching godbolt's talk a few weeks ago he ran into an inconsistency with clang where it didn't vectorize code he definitely expected would be, BCS he was on trunk lol
10:12 < bridge_> <totar> Next time someone tells me I need better CI I will tell them that llvm YOLOs every single patch
10:13 < bridge_> <totar> Can't be bad
10:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> the problem is that it could actually slow development if they are waiting for CI to succeed before they merge stuff in
10:14 < bridge_> <totar> They have 5000 open PRs
10:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> BCS what do you base the next on
10:14 < bridge_> <totar> They'll be fine
10:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> ya
10:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> I mean
10:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> they probably have a reason man
10:15 < bridge_> <totar> why assume, until proven otherwise I see no excuse
10:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> because it's a pretty big project and I have heavy doubts that you're the first person to point this out
10:21 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I'm good at breaking stuff
10:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> do you know why milkeey
10:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> I'm very curious now
10:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> About CI?
10:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
10:23 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> No idea, I didn't read much before sending a pr xd
10:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> :kek:
10:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> ok I will ask
10:30 < bridge_> <totar> ofc but individual contributor can do nothing about the issue, and those who can probably dont see it worth their time. So it stays bad.
10:30 < bridge_> <totar> Local optimum
10:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is the failure even related to your pr?
10:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> There's only my name in the list, so I think yes xd
10:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423953622605238283/image.png?ex=68e22fa7&is=68e0de27&hm=13681880a0315f946d42a5fd3c4ac2a0a808efc7130372d812517c6e1960f9f2&
10:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423953624756785243/IMG_9351.png?ex=68e22fa7&is=68e0de27&hm=73e47687b9fca95abbcb4228d5858602f9b369207d76f1cd6d2055edbc3103ce&
10:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> I mean
10:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> exactly what I expected
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Since when is human labor worth less than that of high perf computers tho
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Llvm isnt some hobby project
10:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> they have to stretch their funding still
10:45 < bridge_> <melon> ah yes, angular
10:45 < bridge_> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423954211103834223/image.png?ex=68e23033&is=68e0deb3&hm=7eec1be96c9e57b226c5d10e658e67930c666a4ae60a074d246c34030243c1e0&
10:46 < bridge_> <totar> Except youre not referring to the pre merge CI so his response is misplaced
10:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Blame nvidia,like every sane ddnet dev would do üòè
10:47 < bridge_> <melon> :Pepegun:
10:47 < bridge_> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423954605833982033/image.png?ex=68e23091&is=68e0df11&hm=e21d5a42903a7ea4788377f2c309d603974eb60b1e4bb8378202e42f169a5714&
10:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Discard all
10:47 < bridge_> <totar> vscode scare prompt
10:48 < bridge_> <melon> it makes no sense, it tracks target/
10:48 < bridge_> <melon> 
10:48 < bridge_> <melon> i excluded target in .gitignore
10:48 < bridge_> <melon> git doesnt care
10:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> I have never seen such an aggressive prompt wow
10:48 < bridge_> <totar> Its for good reason
10:48 < bridge_> <melon> i've seen someone going crashout because "why can vscode delete my project"
10:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> I still believe vscode was a mistake
10:49 < bridge_> <totar> You can accidently make a new git repo in vscode pretty easily and then if you "revert changes" to a project you didnt know existed it just nukes your files
10:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> the next gen code editor being a web app marked the beginning of the end IMO
10:50 < bridge_> <totar> You can accidently make a new git repo in vscode pretty easily and then if you "discard changes" to a project you didnt know existed it just nukes your files
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then make a better one pls
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Zed and co are always close but no cigar
10:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don't have that kind of funding
10:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> zed is good enough for.me so far but I'm scared of its leadership
10:52 < bridge_> <totar> hate on the web page editor all you want but it makes the extension library very rich.
10:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> rich with half baked plugins and things like pets? yes
10:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> extensions*
10:52 < bridge_> <totar> If thats what youre into
10:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe i should join the hype train xd
10:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Vulkan only high performance editor
10:53 < bridge_> <melon> :ChooChoo:
10:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> you could make a pretty good one
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno. Maybe I'll wait few years to see how ai evolves before i start yet another giga project :lol:
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On the other hand side.. Maybe last chance
10:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> y axis dyslexia
10:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> but yea
10:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Last years to be better than ai :frozen:
10:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> get it while u can
10:55 < bridge_> <totar> If ai can write gigs project for you then the value of making it approaches zero since anyone can and will do it anyway
10:55 < bridge_> <totar> If ai can write giga project for you then the value of making it approaches zero since anyone can and will do it anyway
10:55 < bridge_> <totar> So just do it now
10:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> assigning value to code is pretty shallow
10:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's a process and journey etc
10:56 < bridge_> <totar> Im assigning value to result
10:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> the editor is the friends you made along the way
10:56 < bridge_> <totar> If you can say "make me perfect code editor, dont make mistakes" and it works then the value of creating a code editor is zero
10:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> my portfolio is evidence that I don't code for the end result xD
10:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Doesn't even need to be perfect, but you'd defs switch to being an architect and no developer anymore
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> my dad is a software engineer in networking, and just 2 days ago he told me a funny story
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> 
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> the Database of a customer was non-functional and failing with a fairly weird error, his 2 co-workers tried to pinpoint it and said it has to be an issue with the hardware, so they would call a technician to replace the sensor.
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> 
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> my Dad, working in this company for almost 35 years now just shrugged and fixed it within 3 minutes. a decade ago they changed a DB field that's incompatible with the new sensors but worked fine with the old ones, he knew that because he was the one who changed it all those years ago.
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> 
10:57 < bridge_> <melon> AI could never
10:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe performance analyst
10:58 < bridge_> <totar> Its the same thing that unity did for shitty games. The value of making something that looks like the default unity engine settings is zero, before it was pretty high
10:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno.. If they use git or smth
10:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No problem is undebuggable
11:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> I think your stance is valid from an economic standpoint but it's really stupid to insinuate that is the only reason to code
11:00 < bridge_> <totar> Im fine to say its the only reason I code
11:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> profound
11:00 < bridge_> <totar> idc about the code Im here because I want things
11:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> youust be easy xd
11:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> you must be easy xd
11:01 < bridge_> <melon> i code because its fun and i get dopamine from something working ._.
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I code to solve problems i create. And additionally i like to solve it in a nice way(at least try).
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sometimes i also just want to solve at any cost
11:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> I love having ingenuity and AI is never gonna make mine better
11:01 < bridge_> <totar> I only care about the code to the extent that better code allows for more things
11:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's like with everything computers replaced. U can still do it. But just for fun. The computer is better and will only improve
11:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> well hopefully we can get to the time machine part of the future soon so we can document all this turmoil and put it  a vote in the past xd
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @mpft do you think that if we pause all development of chess ai today, that a single human without some genetic mutations or cyborg mutations could get better again?
11:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And if you do, how long would you expect nature to get there
11:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Artificial genetic changes to be precise
11:08 < bridge_> <totar> Minimum 10 million years imo
11:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> what tf
11:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> you think we are lasting 100?
11:09 < bridge_> <totar> I think its implied
11:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah
11:09 < bridge_> <melon> earth will recover
11:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Let's assume we have no other problems :brownbear:
11:09 < bridge_> <melon> üö¨
11:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> I am not gonna pretend to have a tangible answer because it kinda relies on neuroscience at that point
11:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's just for fun
11:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> which is something I can only dream of understanding well enough to make an answer
11:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> I'll say 100 anyhow
11:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> but we can't rely on breakthroughs
11:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm assuming it takes against 1 billion years even. I could assume making our brains change is pretty hard considering we are babies and gave to grow. Most animals ever lived are still kinda close to us
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm assuming it takes against 1 billion years even. I could assume making our brains change is pretty hard considering we are babies and have to grow. Most animals ever lived are still kinda close to us
11:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> well that sounds more like darwinistic evolution than anything we're doing in the world of prosthetics
11:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> we could accelerate said evolution but you guys tried that a few decades ago and people made a big fuss
11:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> no need to chase such things imo
11:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> if you have a condition future science will solve, it will not be in your time and you simply lose the lottery. chasing the solutions has not been fruitful imo
11:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> we need to chill and laze around like the primates we are
11:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In the end it's our tools that make us strong, not our general intelligence.
11:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We are currently communicating over 1000km apart :deen_star:
11:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> free will is a myth
11:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lel
11:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean i kinda like your thought, i understand where it comes from
11:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> if it's about net life enjoyment based off the delivery of neurotransmitters then we will never maximize such things. I enjoy communicating with you but I wouldn't know what I'm missing otherwise
11:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> we can get close with drugs, but then think about that future
11:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> progress is novel and fascinating but overall meaningless and other species are paying the price for our actions
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh isnt life meaningless anyway
11:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> that is the question
11:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As you said
11:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Free will is a myth
11:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And yet there are moments where we enjoy it:deen_star:
11:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
11:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> simpler species sometimes love life as well
11:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> and the goalpost for progress is unclear past the very shortest term issues
11:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> I believe it is meaningless
11:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> new issues will always appear in their place
11:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> within our lifetime there will be an epidemic of immobilization by atrophy
11:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> not just BCS we are lazy and don't move but ai will completely obsolete incredibly important parts of our brains
11:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> that is what happens to unused tissue
11:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> I'm going to various beaches in Cabo San Lucas tomorrow so I need to sleep now but for se backwards reason I thoroughly enjoy existentialist conversations like this
11:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> I'm going to various beaches in Cabo San Lucas tomorrow so I need to sleep now but for some backwards reason I thoroughly enjoy existentialist conversations like this
11:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> have a nice day
11:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Have a nice time

11:41 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Okay, maybe it wasn't me ._.
12:09 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It wasn't my fault xd
12:45 < bridge_> <melon> @zwelf2 NaN-Safty!
12:45 < bridge_> <melon> // NaN-safty in move
12:47 < bridge_> <zwelf2> üòÖ Somewhat unrelated change, but because I needed to negate the if condition I also put in the reason for the check there (from the commit message introducing if-statement)
12:48 < bridge_> <melon> i guess the performance-impact is minimal
12:48 < bridge_> <melon> 
12:48 < bridge_> <melon> cool change, i like it
12:51 < bridge_> <zwelf2> > i guess the performance-impact is minimal
12:51 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Likely yes, because the somewhat more expensive code (additional tee-collision checks) only kicks in case the tick the tee got stuck.
13:40 < bridge_> <Assa> If life is meaningless, why don't give it a meaning for yourself? Like set and reach goals
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is what you usually do, yes
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ultimately it's still meaningless tho
13:41 < bridge_> <Assa> :deen_star:
13:42 < bridge_> <Assa> Meaningless, to whom? As long as it had a meaning for yourself it wasn't meaningless
13:43 < bridge_> <Assa> Like the concept of meaning doesn't make sense if nothing has a meaning
13:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Meaningless to infinity, to whatever comes after the universe, to whatever defines our universe
13:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If life has a meaning that humans cannot comprehend, then there must be smth that can. But if there is something that can comprehend the meaning of life, can it also comprehend what was before life (its)? Wouldn't that be paradox?
13:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then who even decided what life is, and if life always was there, is it timeless? And if it's actually timeless, doesn't make that life meaningless again too?
13:49 < bridge_> <Assa> I also don't believe that life has a meaning by itself. Physically it only accelerates the entropy of the universe but increases the complexity of it, which brings us back to the _reason_ for this universe. Idk let me just increase entropy by consuming beer
13:54 < bridge_> <chairn> #developer changed to #depression
13:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I doesnt make me depressive

16:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I accidentally switched my keyboard layout to Cyrillic using some key combo. Then tried to undo it which locked my screen. I typed my password 3 times in Cyrillic and am now banned from my own system for 10 minutes. Help.
16:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Also now idea how to get latin characters back xd
16:41 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you try logging in from a TTY the keyboard change propbably won't apply there
16:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yup
16:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But im still locked .\_. But from there I can at least access tmux
16:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Still annoying because I had other stuff open
16:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Maybe I need to change my password to something Cyrillic in the tty

19:20 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> @jupeyy_keks liquid glass ui????
19:22 < bridge_> <melon> hell yeah!
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i tried that first, but somehow for ui it doesnt really look that good xd
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it only works if the area is small enough.
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. server browser is too huge, it looks bad (threw my progress on that away). on smaller areas it kinda works.. but coloring also removes a lot of the glass feeling again.
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also similar to blur, you have to play a lot with the glass parameters to make it look good.
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i had my sisters iphone this weekend, and apple added very extrem disortion to the edges so that it almost looks like a rainbow

19:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> the apple distortion goes crazy. if it's any hint, when the background is black/null, the color enhanced borders seem to be red

20:35 < bridge_> <_qey> Anyone?
20:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> more details would be nice
20:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> common traits among the players that can connect and those who can't
20:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think sometimes that error is shown to users behind CGNATs or similar but i am not certain
20:55 < bridge_> <sqwinix> bro, this is crazy. I like it
20:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> jupeyy gets up to a lot of cool stuff
20:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> what you're seeing is ddnet-rs tho not anything currently possible in the normal client
20:56 < bridge_> <sqwinix> oh, I would like to see this on regular ddnet
20:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> it would be cool to see
20:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think it would be a lot of work. i don't know what his rendering pipeline looks like
21:01 < bridge_> <sqwinix> There are a ton of ideas, but there's simply no one to implement them.
21:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> you understand the situation quite well
21:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> this number does not seem to be going down
21:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1424110881960231075/image.png?ex=68e2c21c&is=68e1709c&hm=5b8c9590de2b837fcb7a80bfc18a6af82f88740dc3193e4a94edd0ba9953a6dd&
21:22 < bridge_> <aegisub> that's strange, usually projects have a bunch of experienced developers with free time that are desperately searching for an ideas man
21:24 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, I have a ton of ideas for ddnet myself, if I knew C++ I would make them. But C++ is too difficult for me.
21:25 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I have my own project, and I can't find any coders. I've already written to almost everyone I know, but it's all in vain.
21:26 < bridge_> <sqwinix> ddnet project
21:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's a surprisingly common thing. the problem is if you have the ideas but aren't showing initiative to implement them yourself, people are skeptical of your ability to keep a project going once it's started
21:26 < bridge_> <aegisub> have you tried giving them money
21:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> and that all assumes they agree with the idea and have the time to put into it in the first place
21:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> which is very rare
21:26 < bridge_> <aegisub> money can be exchanged for goods and services
21:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> this guy is probably 14-17
21:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> and doesn't need to be condescended
21:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> C++ is hard but in the way DDNet uses it, it's actually pretty intuitive
21:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> the CI checks DDNet has will catch *most* glaring bugs that noobs are prone to make, so while your code might not be perfect, anything is much much better than nothing
21:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> i would just write what you can until you get to a point where you're happy with your ability
21:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> it doesn't have to be a whole multi-person operation if all the ideas are in your head. if you have free time then it can be a reality
21:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> people in here would be happy to answer specific code questions
21:29 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, I don't have any money myself (I simply can't pay because I don't have a card + my situation is quite complicated), but I have a lot of time. It's just that there aren't enough coders on DDNet (in terms of those who know Teeworlds/DDNet).
21:31 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, I have experience with Golang and a little C. But that's more the basics of programming. When I open someone's code or project, I understand practically nothing.

21:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @sqwinix thats not something we can really debug,what happens on earlier versions?
21:48 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> also still no debug info on libc and gallium try `sudo pacman -Sy debuginfod`
21:48 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (then restart and select y again fro debug symbols)
21:50 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I'll try to build ddnet 19.0 and check.
21:50 < bridge_> <sqwinix> or an older version?

22:09 < bridge_> <sqwinix> 19.0
22:11 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Could it be a driver issue? I recently updated my system (my system is 5 days old).
22:11 < bridge_> <sqwinix> hi Teero
22:11 < bridge_> <Teero> yea the fish needs new drivers
22:12 < bridge_> <Teero> You can see it in its eyes
22:13 < bridge_> <sqwinix> When is the new video on YouTube? I'm waiting
22:13 < bridge_> <sqwinix> make 10 tiles oled
22:14 < bridge_> <sqwinix> or something similar
22:14 < bridge_> <sqwinix> @sollybunny I'll be AFK for a while
22:15 < bridge_> <melon> try a different renderer
22:15 < bridge_> <melon> the bt shows openGL, are you bound to use it?
22:16 < bridge_> <melon> openGL and it seems like the latest mesa, prolly just a driver bug, use stable or use vulkan renderer
22:17 < bridge_> <Teero> You're right I should get to work instead of sleeping tonight
22:27 < bridge_> <sqwinix> It helped, but it's still a pretty critical error.
22:27 < bridge_> <melon> we can't fix driver issues i'm afraid
22:27 < bridge_> <sqwinix> yes, make something crazy
22:28 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, yeah, but it could also be a bug in DDNet itself. Or am I wrong?
22:30 < bridge_> <melon> are you compiling yourself?
22:31 < bridge_> <sqwinix> ddnet? yes. This error also occurs if I download the official build of DDnet.
22:32 < bridge_> <sqwinix> wait, what the fuck...
22:32 < bridge_> <sqwinix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1424132119705419826/2025-10-04_22-31-49.mkv?ex=68e2d5e4&is=68e18464&hm=63e3411f51d9e5c17518bc526f0640fb45986aecfe5fa5ea083004806f4ad2b1&

22:34 < bridge_> <sqwinix> so
22:35 < bridge_> <melon> `f1 -> cl_save_settings 1` and try again
22:36 < bridge_> <melon> looking at Cmd_RenderTileLayer the only thing that can seemingly be accessed while being null would be m_pDrawCount and/or m_pIndicesOffsets
22:36 < bridge_> <melon> early return if those are nullpointers and try again
22:36 < bridge_> <sqwinix> It didn't help. But everything works fine with other renders.
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I commented on the issue
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's long known but nobody reported it to Mesa yet
22:40 < bridge_> <sqwinix> ok, fine
22:40 < bridge_> <sqwinix> strange bug
22:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, opengl compatibility profiles are a massive mess
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd like to remove ogl 3.0 again
22:41 < bridge_> <melon> i guess it defaulting to 3.0 is also related to the driver forcing it onto you
22:41 < bridge_> <melon> 
22:41 < bridge_> <melon> i wonder if you could change it using `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3` or smth
22:41 < bridge_> <melon> i'll dip, jupsti is graphics pro
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't understand this
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Vulkan is our default
22:41 < bridge_> <melon> it fails to generate the vulkan context for him
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Next comes 3.3
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
22:42 < bridge_> <melon> "Invalid window"
22:42 < bridge_> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1424134529337266226/image.png?ex=68e2d822&is=68e186a2&hm=0376da962d4af791f2084916baa1f3de6591327792d110ec4e3adee56b32178c&
22:42 < bridge_> <melon> it not defaulting to 3.3 is bullshit tho xd
22:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I smell Wayland :lol:

22:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wtf is sdl2 compat smoking again
22:44 < bridge_> <melon> how far are we with sdl3 again?
22:44 < bridge_> <melon> 
22:44 < bridge_> <melon> cc: @sollybunny :topkekMate:
22:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Linux is such a mess since sdl3 and Wayland. It honestly makes me sad
22:46 < bridge_> <sqwinix> What will ddnet gain from sdl3?
22:46 < bridge_> <sqwinix> like
22:46 < bridge_> <sqwinix> how will it be different?
22:46 < bridge_> <melon> we gain the mighty power to drop everything not supporting sdl3
22:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno. From what i seen, i dislike sdl3
22:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Winit is so much cleaner
22:47 < bridge_> <melon> Winit made me suffer on nixOS (i was stupid)
22:47 < bridge_> <melon> but it still made me suffer
22:47 < bridge_> <melon> it took me MONTHS to find the issue and it was so trivial
22:47 < bridge_> <melon> i wanna cry
22:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xd
22:49 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Will learning C++ improve my IQ or will I remain stupid?
22:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, learning to code often let's you see the world differently
22:50 < bridge_> <melon> C++ will make you feel smarter until you have to debug segfault while questioning the life choice that led you there
22:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Increases your intelligence in some way. But not your social intelligence
22:50 < bridge_> <melon> C++ will make you feel smarter until you have to debug segfaults while questioning the life choice that led you there
22:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The thing you learn is to solve problems on your own
22:52 < bridge_> <sqwinix> It's just that as I understand it, C++, which is in DDnet, is much easier than usual, right?
22:57 < bridge_> <sqwinix> or not?
22:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> sdl2 and sdl3 have near 0 differences apart from video modes
22:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it even does some work we had to do ourselves pretty much 1for1 which is nice
22:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the video mdoes is giving me headache though
22:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i also dont know if it works on anything but linux x11
22:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> :)
22:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> see the pr, you can compile and run it
23:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> there are a lot of gotchas that just come with the territory
23:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> ddnet prioritizes simplicity over using complex STL features and whatnot tho
23:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> you can opt into way more complicated stuff that ddnet does virtually none of
23:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> most of those gotchas are shared with C though
23:20 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Okay, so it turns out that what I said is true?
23:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> within reason
23:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> depends on what you mean by "usual"
23:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> cpp code comes in many shapes and forms
23:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's been 40 years since it was originally standardized and lots of old code still hangs around
23:22 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, when I started my programming journey, I tried to make my own client, but I was only able to add my own tab in the settings and 1 function (It was copypasta)
23:32 < bridge_> <sqwinix> What would be the best place for me to start, with a regular teeworlds, for example, to write my own gDM or should I start writing a mod for my project right away? (Block mod)
23:32 < bridge_> <sqwinix> And in general, what are the main differences between the code of ddnet and teeworlds?
