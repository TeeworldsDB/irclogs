01:07 < bridge_> <patiga> I played it and it was a neat game, I really enjoyed the visuals and trust me: zooming out in that game is an awesome experience. its more like an rpg where you get better loot, defeat higher level dungeons, farm some materials, trade in the village and build a nice loadout :)

14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk i think https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/data-structures/binary-search/ is faster
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> algorithmica is such a good web
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill insta buy the book when it comes out

15:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> quake 2 code is public
15:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh god
15:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> at work i have a CI that runs for 1h
15:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> running over 300 tests with llvm-cov is too much i guess
15:46 < bridge_> <totar> 1h doesn't seem that bad, could be much worse
17:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki FFR, when rewrite vim in rust?
17:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> Rim
17:34 < bridge_> <Voxel> that sounds wrong
17:34 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wanna get vim and suffer idk why
17:36 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @robyt3 is there any reason the editor is not using `IInterface` or something similar? maybe this would allow breaking up these large files and the huge editor class
17:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> It would be a large undertaking, but I think it would be better if the editor was a gameclient component instead of an engine component. I don't think the engine should handle the editor differently than the rest of the game or even be aware of its existence.
17:52 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Which class defines gameclient components? `IEditor` uses `IInterface`
17:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> `CComponent`, so everything inside the `components` folder (but I would not move the editor files)
18:01 < bridge_> <marmare_314> They are already separated enough, so I agree. Then there should probably be a class `CEditorComponent` which inherits `CComponent` but adds a `IEditor* Editor()` member function. Maybe it would also be possible to only do this refactor to a few components at a time to make it more manageable
18:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> Seems like a good idea to make the editor code more modular and maintainable 👍
18:04 < bridge_> <learath2> If anyone wants to re-do the editor, the editor2 branch of 0.7 is a nice place to start. I liked how it was structured
18:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> 7000 reached
18:29 < bridge_> <Voxel> Wait, so XYR is still the same orientation as VHR, right?
