00:26 < bridge> <fushi_gg> there is someone next to me whenever he enables copy his dummy swaps to the same weapon as main
00:26 < bridge> <fushi_gg> is that some sus client or ddnet regular behavior?
00:29 < bridge> <fushi_gg> woops wrong channel
00:33 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I think he just called you a chad
01:55 < bridge> <teero777> i called him drug addict
03:48 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes he does miss
05:00 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm..anyone knows what is the organization "Nexus"?
05:21 < bridge> <teero777> in what context?
05:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> gimme a cute hostname for new linux install
05:32 < bridge> <Ewan> radish
05:33 < bridge> <gorp_tw> that is pretty good yeah
05:33 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i didnt know what to put so for now its "miau"
05:34 < bridge> <Ewan> too cute
05:34 < bridge> <gorp_tw> my current hostname is "maple"
05:34 < bridge> <gorp_tw> maybe I should do another tree
05:34 < bridge> <Ewan> my desktop is called machine
05:34 < bridge> <gorp_tw> thats sick actually lol
05:34 < bridge> <gorp_tw> like DUH
05:34 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i like organic names for boxes cus its ironic kinda
05:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs ironic because everything but the fans are solid state
05:35 < bridge> <gorp_tw> WTF
05:35 < bridge> <Ewan> they dont move
05:35 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i just think its crazy we both pulled ironic from our lexicon
05:35 < bridge> <Ewan> lol yeah
05:36 < bridge> <gorp_tw> arbor is kinda cute
05:36 < bridge> <Ewan> wetrag
05:36 < bridge> <gorp_tw> "pine" is sorta misnomer with pine laptops being a thing
05:36 < bridge> <teero777> flask
05:36 < bridge> <gorp_tw> flask is nice
05:37 < bridge> <Ewan> good framework
05:37 < bridge> <Ewan> best way to get a backend running with little time
05:37 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ya I like flask
05:37 < bridge> <gorp_tw> better than djshitgo
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> nah i think they just fill different shoes
05:38 < bridge> <Ewan> django is more complex
05:38 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i guess, flask can do a lot tho?
05:39 < bridge> <teero777> it can hold liquid
05:39 < bridge> <teero777> nothing more nothing less
05:39 < bridge> <teero777> it holds my blood sweat and tears while coding
05:39 < bridge> <teero777> it holds my blood, sweat and tears while coding
05:40 < bridge> <Ewan> this guy does not use flask smh
05:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> damn ya u are selling this idea
05:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i like that arbor kinda carries the weight of a name a bit
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> call it whatever
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs not a dismissal but a recommendation
05:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> larch, juniper, and cedar are also really cute
05:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think im sticking with a tree lol
05:44 < bridge> <remakepower> a teeworlds organization
05:44 < bridge> <gorp_tw> arbor 1Ô∏è‚É£ cedar 2Ô∏è‚É£ larch 3Ô∏è‚É£ juniper 4Ô∏è‚É£
05:44 < bridge> <remakepower> They host Gores servers, but I can't find more useful info.

18:11 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks tclient devs for overriding my *actually* custom font and constraining me to the top 10 google fonts results
18:11 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373694591739498506/image.png?ex=682b5848&is=682a06c8&hm=3b04ac3ae54382e1bdfda006ff48a9d84192c8af02cca95187890d6ff5dc0157&
19:57 < bridge> <faffa81> i am actually so pro i made better translation then solly bunny via google translate
19:58 < bridge> <faffa81> nvm
20:05 < bridge> <totar> The folder button is right therr
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> the point is that i have already defined font capability
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> in the normal fonts folder, which already exists
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373724996966416394/image.png?ex=682b7499&is=682a2319&hm=ba0413dd2439100556fb868dead28fd8132000b5a59c095a552f8a6758d7ef2c&
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> you really couldn't read the index json or even try to port the settings?
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> just feels sloppy
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373725120270434424/image.png?ex=682b74b7&is=682a2337&hm=59e2a8ce3c848d0db6b1eb6efc207d7fcf131874355f17bc94f343a683dfc357&
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> you could have even used the same folder to store the font files with zero repercussions
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> then at least it'd show up
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry wrong screenie
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373725382573817856/image.png?ex=682b74f5&is=682a2375&hm=dddbb988593511cdde4bc72ba907ac997b5871e9ab09456c6a35aa06c6cf6431&
20:15 < bridge> <louis> does tclient modify ddnet appdata for other things tho?
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it tries to keep itself contained
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but yes
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not like /appdata/roaming/tclient, it shares the folder
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> so if they were looking in the pre-defined fonts path my font would've shown up
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but with enough confidence you can make anyone look like an idiot lol
20:17 < bridge> <totar> I don't understand your problem, why can't you copy the font to the tclient folder
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> because... why should i have to do that
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> funny when devs want users to make accommodations for them
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> that is a fundamentally wrong assessment of this whole exchange
20:18 < bridge> <totar> I don't think the design is very reasonable still
20:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ewan so mad
20:19 < bridge> <totar> I don't think the design is very un 
20:19 < bridge> <totar> reasonable still
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> you could have just added a setting that changes the existing index.json, but if you didn't want it to conflict (understandably), you could still look at the already pre-existing pre-defined fonts folder which is already in use
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but nah
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> you could have just added a setting that changes the existing index.json, but if you didn't want it to conflict (understandably), you could still look at the already pre-existing pre-defined fonts folder which is already in use & use your own logic around it
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> such low standards
20:20 < bridge> <totar> ok you're definitely trolling me
20:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nah I'm with Ewan
20:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> integrate with the vanilla feature properly
20:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you don't you're stinky
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i guess i don't need to have this tone rn and for that i apologize
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> but this implementation is dumb af
20:24 < bridge> <totar> bro tclient is free software
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> how much did i pay for ddnet again
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry, it shouldn‚Äôt have become a personal attack on your code
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> but there should definitely still be some expectation that it works with what it‚Äôs based on
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> when you just churn out features until the boxes are checked ofc you‚Äôre gonna have discrepancies
20:26 < bridge> <totar> your name is purple, you have power to fix it
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i am contractually prohibited from contributing to any source available repositories
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> if that‚Äôs the judgement i can be white again i guess
20:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> corpo slavery
20:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> üëÄ
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> im their code monkey
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> whether i could submit a pr and get off scot-free is one thing but i'm just not into that
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there's no guarantee that won't come back to bite me or whoever's repository it is i'd contribute to
20:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> is the contract until you die?
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> until i am no longer employed there
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not like it's a one way exchange
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i get some dough
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's fine
20:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> would read the fine print
20:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably until your death üëÄ
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah so there are stipulations for sure
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> while i am employed i can't contribute, and past that (if i contribute when no longer employed), they'd need some basis that it's related to anything they've done somehow
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> like i couldn't take code from work repos and put it elsewhere
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> and before any of that i'd have to be a target, which i currently am not
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but i don't wanna mess with their legal team really, doesn't sound fun to me
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> on a phone call i had with my boss's boss before i got the job there was explicit warning "if you take this job you won't be able to do any open source, is that fine"
20:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> aw man that's a lame contract
20:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> tell the story after you have left that hamster wheel
20:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> at least they explicitly and directly communicate that
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not up to any of them either. it's a fortune 500 company, whoever wrote these policies that i had to agree to most likely doesn't know anyone on my team, and they probably would not care about the details around any of it
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a one-size-fits-all agreement
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> for contractors
20:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> do they have their own open source repos?
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> OKAY semantic loophole
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> yes they do but nothing of substance
20:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> :kek:
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/discovery-digital>
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> that's the org i work under but they have over a dozen from acquisitions and whatnot
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd bet 75% of anything open source on here is only that way because whoever made it didn't mark it as internal :)
20:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> lol
20:44 < bridge> <Ewan> enterprise software
20:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> most are forks anyways
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1373734011301789797/9ueycw.png?ex=682b7cff&is=682a2b7f&hm=551646cf1e0a0bc58c4e889928a6ae56c9a66e3e4bfc0755f07960d804d88c31&
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
20:51 < bridge> <louis> there is no vanilla feature here though
20:52 < bridge> <louis> unless im mistaken and ddnet or 0.7 support custom fonts
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i think he meant ddnet
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> the ddnet option exists but is not exposed in the settings at all
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> in DDNet, it's the data/fonts/index.json file that defines which font is loaded
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> tclient added its own menu/.cfg based option but stores its fonts in data/tclient/fonts, and completely ignores ddnet's way
20:56 < bridge> <louis> oh i guess ddnet added a font index recently ish
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> my guess is 1-2 yrs ago
20:56 < bridge> <louis> in the old day we dinnit have nunna dat üë¥
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yea how old are u talking cuz i see the maps you had in the old day too
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think i'd have wanted to be around üòÇ
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> not you personally. i like your maps. i mean the standard of older maps
20:57 < bridge> <louis> im not really too old, middle aged i guess
20:57 < bridge> <louis> used to play a loot in high school, not much anymore
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> pre covid ddnetter is already high marks on the veteran scale
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you replaced dejavu sans it should still work?
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> congrats on mod
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> keep reading
22:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it doesnt
22:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you're definatley trolling because against my better judgement both tclient and ddnet are zlib/as is
22:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you okay? crashout over tclient is a bit much
22:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thanks ><
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why you would think im trolling
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i got a little mad
22:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i saw
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't what
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> tho
22:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am agreeing with you
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
22:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we can make the dejavu sans use the default path
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you should just look in the default font folders as well tbh
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but really this should be an upstream feature imo
22:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think its probably not because that index.json is scary
22:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would get the chinese/symbol fonts aswell
22:18 < bridge> <faffa81> Longest crash out over Fonts
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ig idk why that's a problem
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> this is also not what i meant but maybe u realized that
22:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because the symbol font doesnt include latin, and im not sure really what happens if you try to use
22:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and idk about the china one
22:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theyre both meant to be used in junction with other fonts
22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its all a bit scary, i guess tater didnt want to touch it, which i think is fair
22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .. idk what you mean
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> if the source is open
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> viewable by people
22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ;---;
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i can not contribute to it without legal heat
22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wha?
22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> huh?
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i went over it
22:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Software is used on 'as-is' basis. Authors are not liable for any damages arising from its use.` doesnt that kinda...
22:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> remove all legal reprocussions
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> uhh
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean the thing i signed was a dozen pages
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> written by lawyers from the most successful cable tv company
22:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there are seperate licenses for parts (fonts/images)
22:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but the code itself is all zlib
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> they know their way around dumbass legal verbage
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't matter what the license says because the contract is atop that
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> it's breaching to contribute to smth even if it says authors aren't liable for damages arising from its use
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> they mean if you use their library and you break something in the real world it's not their fault
22:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its also not your fault
22:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean it is, but legally not
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a thing i had to literally sign
22:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not for ddnet?
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> no
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> for my work
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> any action of mine against what's stated on that paper would legally constitute breach of contract
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> because i agreed to it
22:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mmm
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean it's a pdf
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> but
22:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah but we arent whatever nonsense you had to do
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> that came up bcs tater was suggesting i fix it
22:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> contributing to tclient/ddnet is safe :D
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it's basically a noncompete
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't work like that
22:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is it a noncomplete
22:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no "contract"?
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> SOLLY
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> HELLO
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i signed a contract for work explicitly stating i cannot contribute to open source repositories
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> me personally
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i cannot contribute
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wa
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wahatia ahwe
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> eaods
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wha
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> WHAT
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you shouldve lead from that
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i did üò≠
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you shouldve lead with that
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> jessus
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wouldve crosseed that out
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
22:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can you commit to your own open source repos?
22:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that's like my human right, fuck off
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i got the explicit OK for my dotfiles
22:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats messed up
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah well
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl tend to compromise those in situations of necessity
22:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how did you sign the pdf
22:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> send back a version with ur signature?
22:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if so you coulda crossed out lines x-x
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> like i could have turned it around that way but realistically their ask is "respond with a signed version of this pdf"
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> if i don't sign it as is they have no reason to change it
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> they find another person
22:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> would they notice if you crossed out lines?
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> not sure
22:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> darn thats a shame
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how to do that on pdf in a legally binding way
22:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well you can digitally sign it
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> the crossing out
22:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> modify the pdf with your signature and crossing out, and say i signed this with some numbers that no one else knows made up of various legal info
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn't e-sign it tho i see what you mean i could have theoretically appealed the contract
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean they have a copy of the pdf too
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah but you couldve for "legally binding contract modification"
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> modifying pdfs is a bit eh for this
22:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> since they can modify the pdf back and then change modify date and go to a court look
22:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess you could convert it to a series of images
22:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to make it a pain in the arse
22:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but e-signing it is going to sound more serious to a court
22:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> print it
22:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> cross out
22:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> sign
22:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well you have to send something back
