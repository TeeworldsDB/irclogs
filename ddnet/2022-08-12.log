10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Tater a friend and I got inspired by your shadertoy to try something of our own and created this :) https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ftdczf
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> @Dzeebo
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> @Dzeebo bro play
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> great changes for tune, didn't think about that console stuff
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I forget who is Robyt
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but damn they goin ham
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Hi, are there any ways to convert 0.7 maps to 0.6?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> YOOO KUROSIO
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry i don't have an answer though

17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> heey :greenthing:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> thx
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you want you could just send me it and I can do it
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Cool! I wonder if you could put a texture or something on the "blades"
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @murpi xPanic now compiles with CMake instead of bam, not needed to update yet but in case you wanted to you can check the main branch
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thx to kurosio for doing that :D
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh my god YES
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> tune toggle or tune switch would have been a better name though
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lock implies you are preventing something to me
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4651
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just took that name
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> player tune? not sure, it doesn't really matter i guess
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I had this PR open once already btw, but it got closed when I deleted myfork
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anything to not confuse new mappers anymore xd
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just code wise anyways
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the name
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and referenced in editor
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think its quite matching tho
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it locks specific tunings to a specific player
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> when i think of locking i think of teams or preventing an item from getting removed, which i suppose is true but the "time" isn't really an object it's just space you can move into
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> when i think of locking i think of teams or preventing an item from getting removed, which i suppose is true but the "tune" isn't really an object it's just space you can move into
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> autocorrect
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> discuss with corneum xD
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesn't matter rly xd
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he chose that name
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's shorter so that's nice
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I do not care that much tbh
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Persistent tune or smth would also sound good, idk
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> tune\_toggle tune\_switch but tune\_lock sounds best even if it makes less sense to me
