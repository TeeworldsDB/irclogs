20:51 < WolfAlex> deen: is it somehow possible to set something so that the name plates are renderd on top of everything else? (always visible)
21:45 <@deen> WolfAlex: ehm, disable antiping?
22:21 < WolfAlex> deen: oh yeah, works
22:21 < WolfAlex> deen: but why? 
22:34 <@deen> because the right data isn't exported to render the name plates properly with antiping
22:34 <@deen> object orientation and stuff
