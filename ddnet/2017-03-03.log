19:15 < Matodor> hey, stable version https://github.com/Matodor/Teecsharp , working on linux with mono
19:23 <@EastByte> looks a bit like a C++ -> C# conversion :p
19:25 < Matodor> ?
19:25 <@heinrich5991> missed opportunity for a pun: call you project "TeeSharp"
19:25 <@heinrich5991> :P
19:26 < Matodor> :)
19:28 <@heinrich5991> Matodor: soo. what can it do? the readme doesn't tell me :)
19:28 < Matodor> But many things not implemented, like as admin commands
19:28 <@heinrich5991> how can I build it?
19:29 < Matodor> heinrich5991: open project with Visual Studio, press ctrl+shift+b?)
19:29 <@heinrich5991> mh. is there visual studio for linux? :o
19:29 <@heinrich5991> or how do you build it for linux?
19:29 < Matodor> hm
19:30 < Matodor> maybe can compile with mono http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/languages/csharp/
19:31 <@heinrich5991> so I should rather build it on windows?. will try later when I have a windows machine again
