06:27 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: deen: Learath2: fstd: can you think of a negative effect if we required JOIN messages to be at least, say, 512 bytes long to reduce the usefulness of teeworlds servers for reflection attacks?
06:28 <@heinrich5991> (apart from backward-compatibility)
06:28 <@heinrich5991> more from a network point of view â€” would that make a tw server more attackable in a way I didn't realize?
08:49 <@deen> heinrich5991: well, it would lead to slightly more bandwidth being consumed, which used to be a problem for us in some locations.
11:59 <@heinrich5991> deen: is incoming traffic being counted?
13:50 <@deen> on some hosters it is
14:27 <@deen> but it's not a big issue I guess
