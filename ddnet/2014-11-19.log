15:17 < o_be_one> hi
15:47 < laxadedi> !en-de work
15:47 < Nimda> Translation: Arbeit
16:04 < o_be_one> laxadedi, t'apprends l'Allemand ?
16:05 < laxadedi> Je parle deja un peu allamend
16:05 < laxadedi> faut dire que tous les soirs j'entends de l'allemand et je parle anglais :D
16:05 < laxadedi> (sur mon teamspeak il y a une majorite d'allemand)
16:28 < o_be_one> sur TW y a une majorité d'allemands :p
16:54 < meoww> sup
17:19 <@EastByte> blubb
18:04 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
18:06 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
18:16 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
18:16 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
19:42 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:42 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 442
19:42 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
19:42 <@deen> wow, 197 players on GER, 130 on EUR
19:42 <@deen> and hi
19:43 <@deen> o_be_one: Germans are not a majority, on DDNet at least, but it's the biggest minority ;)
19:43 < o_be_one> ok
19:44 < o_be_one> russian are many too :p
19:44 <@deen> and chileans
19:44 < o_be_one> yes, seen that too :o
19:44 <@deen> those 3 should be the biggest groups
19:46 < o_be_one> sure
20:56 <@deen> can't get rid of the fake clients, seems like it's integrated into z-client
20:56 <@deen> should we blacklist characters that can be used for faking or just ignore it?
20:56 <@EastByte> what do you mean by fake clients?
20:56 <@deen> ehm
20:56 <@deen> faking other players
20:57 <@EastByte> using their skin?
20:57 <@deen> same skin, name, etc
20:57 <@EastByte> "that can be used for faking"
20:57 <@EastByte> every character can be used for faking
20:57 <@deen> how?
20:58 <@EastByte> using their skin, name, etc as you said
20:58 <@deen> i mean on the same server at least
20:58 <@deen> so you have multiple players with the same name
20:59 <@deen> using һ instead of h, cyrillic e instead of e
20:59 <@EastByte> so you want to blacklist these chars?
20:59 <@deen> yes, that was the idea, but i guess people with cyrillic names wouldn't like that
21:00 <@EastByte> ah by characters you meant chars and now players chars^^
21:00 <@deen> exactly^^
21:00 <@EastByte> yea might get complicated
21:01 <@EastByte> hmmm, would it be hard to do a truetype pixel comparison?
21:02 <@EastByte> I guess^^
21:02 <@deen> ^^
21:07 <@EastByte> still we could compare names a smart way
21:07 <@deen> you really love complicated solutions
21:07 <@EastByte> it's not that complicated
21:08 <@EastByte> on name change we can compare the new name with all other clients
21:08 <@EastByte> and make exceptions at h, e and so on
21:08 <@deen> that would make the protection way too hard to reason about
21:09 <@deen> someone could just choose a name before so that the next person joining can not use his normal naem
21:10 <@EastByte> that's possible anyways
21:11 <@EastByte> hm I would like to know how many doubles the tw font has^^
21:16 <@deen> yeah, it should be possible to do what you said
21:16 <@deen> make a high resolution bitmap of each character and compare them all automatically
21:16 <@deen> or especially compare them to ASCII
21:17 <@EastByte> hmm comparing them to ascii might be a good option
21:17 <@EastByte> since there is an open lib for analysing captchas
21:17 <@deen> no, wouldn't use that
21:17 <@deen> some image/outline comparison would be better
21:18 <@deen> don't know if anything exists for that
21:21 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: what do you think?
21:21 <@EastByte> comparing tw player names by using truetype's pixel buffer/image output
21:21 <@EastByte> to prevent faking player names
21:25 < WolfAlex> is it not possible to create a table containing same looking chars?
21:25 <@deen> sure, that would be my goal
21:26 <@deen> just do the analysis once, and forbid the characters that are too similar
21:26 <@EastByte> oh well
21:27 < WolfAlex> if a player joins a comparion with the online players would be: convert all characters to lets say the first one in the list (of same looking chars) then compare to other players (also converted temp.) 
21:27 <@EastByte> so we don't even need to load truetype serverside^^ great solution
21:28 < WolfAlex> so the player would have the special characters and ("visual") comparison is done

22:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: there is a unicode "confusables.txt". that will probably help you
22:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: http://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt
22:10 <@EastByte> yay
22:11 <@heinrich5991> (I already thought about that problem :P)
22:14 <@deen> nice
22:14 <@heinrich5991> (it doesn't solve all the problems though IIRC)
