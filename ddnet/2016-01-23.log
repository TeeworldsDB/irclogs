17:24 < IcyFoxy> Are map tunings bound on zero-up, or one-up?
17:26 < IcyFoxy> Well, in either case the MAX number could be used - for the 'default' tunings.

22:01 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/400
22:01 <@deen> From what I can tell so far this is fixed, but would be nice if someone else can verifiy that it works and dummy isn't broken.
22:26 < IcyFoxy> Wow. Some people have too much time... Just saw a speedrun using many players in different sections such that the player recording is constantly moving... XD
22:27 <@deen> yes, that run is on http://ddnet.tw/ :P
22:29 < IcyFoxy> I found as recent on YT
22:29 < IcyFoxy> Insane :P
22:30 < IcyFoxy> Just checked ddnet.tw, it is indeed the same video. :P
22:32 < IcyFoxy> Anyone up for a ddrace?
22:32 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
22:32 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 406
22:32 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
22:32 < IcyFoxy> :3
22:33 < IcyFoxy> Biggest problem is my latency... To the closest ddrace. 176ms but zero people :(
22:33 <@deen> where do you live, IcyFoxy ?
22:33 < IcyFoxy> Closest with players is 239ms
22:33 < IcyFoxy> Aus
22:33 <@deen> Hm, not many players in Australia, right?
22:34 < IcyFoxy> Australia sucks for latency, and even worse when there is such low interest :(
22:34 < IcyFoxy> Yea
22:36 < IcyFoxy> 122.124.108.6, my best ddnet server for latency.
22:36 <@deen> China!
22:36 < IcyFoxy> Yea
22:36 < IcyFoxy> You joining? :)
22:37 <@deen> we can try
22:37 < IcyFoxy> Awesome
