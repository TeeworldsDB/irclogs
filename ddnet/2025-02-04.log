01:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> c
01:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> C best
01:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah... in only one way
01:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> sacrifice your soul, eyes and brain and hands... and C is good
01:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> Lol
01:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
01:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> I like zig as a language, easy to write
04:49 < bridge> <learath2> I should do something semi-serious with it to test it. It took working with Go to truly appreciate it
08:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> If their build system was a little easier to write from scratch I'd prefer it over make anytime. Good thing most people are nice enough to just add the needed syntax in their GitHub repo to copy paste :xd:
08:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> I like zigs ecosystem, and some things are just neat to have, using stuff like defer makes cleanup a breeze for example.
08:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> Tho I disagree with a few syntax choices..
08:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> `cries in const b = @Vector(4, i32){ 5, 6, 7, 8 };`
08:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> And ofc being able to use c libraries with ease
08:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> you can do it like this too:
08:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```zig
08:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> const b: @Vector(4, f32) = .{ 5, 6, 7, 8 }:
08:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```
08:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> looks more readable
08:57 < bridge> <learath2> A macro shortcut would have been nice like
09:05 < bridge> <learath2> @tsfreddie we are still having some issues with getting a nice full screenshot without hooks that are cut off, any ideas?
09:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I got the first draft to work! When I get to the next steps, it should be making automappers using a visual interface a lot easier for me!
09:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336248079799685211/image.png?ex=67a31d80&is=67a1cc00&hm=065cab8ce80e08c4d35f185041b6bf2ed054a8b607da65e43856d699a70d5a9b&

09:16 < bridge> <learath2> What are you making exactly? A visualisation for automapper rules?
09:16 < bridge> <learath2> Or like compiling scratch into automapper rules? üòÑ either very cool
09:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Both, in a way. I have a plan for how I want to make a visual automapper editor, and honestly Scratch is my most comfortable "programming language", since I've been using it for a decade now.
09:47 < bridge> <totar> I saw this video which appears to have some tuning bug in the demo, on the kog map "Fly to the mix" I don't think kog does anything special with the tunes so this might be worth investigating? https://youtu.be/JHxRvXLsclQ?si=EBgSMsTIyRjdB0z1&t=610
09:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 could you run the unit tests with a debugger on windows for me in #9643 so I know where the error is coming from

09:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3412r0.pdf
10:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> Grab sdl3 and create ddnet-zig :greenthing:
11:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> have you tried reducing sv_poses_show_dist_x/y to maybe 400?
11:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then use a very small screenshot offset in the client, then set the crop in the merge script to cut out the empty spaces before merging.
11:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ^
11:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> Seems like Louis figured it out :P
11:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki did you see my bug report? :santatrollet:
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye troll
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> we dont have a check yet
11:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I was looking how you do name resolution
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who made the photoshot pic now?
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis.place did you miss to add some skins?
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. dreamless should be a toast
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336293572529356840/image.png?ex=67a347de&is=67a1f65e&hm=b461addaf84973b30679998aa811dde9ca1c30f0ebb9bcd607892bb8d9e0079c&
12:17 < bridge> <alw5> bad day to be klouis
12:17 < bridge> <alw5> bad day to be louis
12:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> rewrite the photoshoot in rust
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how so
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's the spirit
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont blame louis. maybe old client cant load the skin or whatever xD
12:19 < bridge> <alw5> blame time

12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Finally some Linux kernel drama
13:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> I mean he has a point, having to maintain a new language which is now being sprinkled in a multiple decade old codebase is not everyone's cup of tee :baked:
13:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> I mean he has a point, having to maintain a " new " language which is now being sprinkled in a multiple decade old codebase is not everyone's cup of tee :baked:
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> True, but I sometimes wonder how Linux should survive in the long run. Do they expect new c devs to come in?
14:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr he has no point because the discussion was already had
14:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> and they decided to adopt it
14:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> cup of tee??
14:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> hehe
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I assume every component in the kernel kinda has their own maintainers and maybe they simply can't deal with it xd
14:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they can
14:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they offered to maintain it themselves
14:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and those are skilled kernel ppl
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean like skill issue xdd
14:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> the guy is just a old beared man
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah but esp old ppl are sometimes slow to adapt
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> he doesnt need to do anything at all
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno, maybe they simply need to replace him
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> definitly
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> the bus factor on DMA is 1 person
14:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats a issue
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly nowadays only webdevs are searched for üò¨
14:29 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Where is the channel for this game ‚ÄòFind the Hidden Tee‚Äô? üòÅ
14:29 < bridge> <0xfaulty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336327900089159721/image.png?ex=67a367d7&is=67a21657&hm=4d44374ebe877bcc58c421ed31e123a31db1d2a50bff8fc7035be8281cc75ff2&
14:32 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Sad that it's just screenshots, we could add a game of ~~Where's Wally?~~ find the ‚ÄòTeeName‚Äô in the picture
14:38 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Although it is probably technically possible, since we have the coordinates of all players we can match them with the coordinates of the image and cut out the mini part only where the player is
15:22 < bridge> <zerolacqua> i found me, but it's in default skin :oop:
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat fixed
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336341571037171723/image.png?ex=67a37492&is=67a22312&hm=af1929a00b29d4d37960e6f55286d425a87f5a48f11d00fe9bcce9a83a0e801b&
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> previously i only checked if it existed on lhs not rhs xd
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
15:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh, I thought it was because you processed all locals and then checked if names existed
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u tried 
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> b = 2;
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> without a let b before it didnt work
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats the thing i checked before
15:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> :baked:
15:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki is it not possible to make variables inside `if` statements yet, or I have skill issues? :justatest:
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm idk xd
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent tested that
15:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i get an error where it unwraps `None`
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i guess vars inside if are bugged xd
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill check it when i can
15:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252358080522747904/1267876556261560454/EB37683D3A4CDA1932DD5DD1561EC9AF.gif
15:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> poor louis
15:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice gif saved
15:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> i only have 4 gifs saved and 3 are stepfunn dancing
15:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> japan is cool tho
15:52 < bridge> <louis> i downloaded the entire skin db
15:52 < bridge> <louis> and loaded it in locally
15:53 < bridge> <louis> i did but didn't really seem to help
15:53 < bridge> <louis> i can try again
15:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> next year i'll just add a momentcap specific protocol to render all tees
15:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> next year i'll just add a momentcap client specific protocol to render all tees
15:56 < bridge> <louis> there mightve been errors loading in srgb or some weird thing i recall
15:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> !remindme 250 days
15:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
15:58 < bridge> <louis> i can manually edit that guy in
15:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> @louis.place can you send me the poses just in case i still want to redo a renderer when i get back
15:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> motivation might be low right after traveling but just in case
15:59 < bridge> <louis> yeah ill send it when i get out of bed üõå
15:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> thx

17:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Honestly kinda based. Let it all be pure and beautiful C! (yeah I know there's nothing pure about C)
17:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you like your Rust so much go write your own damn kernel! Oh wait, they kinda did.
17:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> linux-kernel-haskell when?
17:27 < bridge> <aegisub> wasm in the linux kernel
17:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
17:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> I actually meant this one: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript
17:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Kind of a weird comment since in a way WASM has nothing to do with JS except that they both run primarily in browsers
17:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> watch the talk
18:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> asm.js is the predescessor of wasm
