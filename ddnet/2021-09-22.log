15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lol should be default skin for dummy
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea that dummy looks dead
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lol true
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And when ur not controlling it too
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It auto gets this skin
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> dead as in inanimate or a corpse? :justatest:
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new mod: when tees die the leave a corpse
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after 10 mins the map is filled with corpses
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> can you tower on them?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tees molding skin :justatest:
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it looks a bit too dead and pale maybe gib dummy normal eyes
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's not meant to look like a normal living tee, it's a dummy
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> dummys are normal :justatest:
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> stop being dummyist

21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> heh, read that on hn today as well ðŸ™‚

21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a fellow arch citizen
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > So I bought a Thinkpad, installed Arch on it with a tiling window manager (i3wm) and I was immedietely (**after 1 month of setting everything up...**)
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye its actually a weird phrase
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he says immedietely and then 1 month
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he considered it worthy
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sway looks coold but it requires using wayland right
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and idk if wayland is ready for me yet
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if it handles well 144hz etc
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've seen people use it, can't be that bad ðŸ˜›
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also weird cuz he still relies on websites
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to do services for him
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g the email
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> migadu
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sr.ht for git
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why pay sr.ht when u can self host
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and bandcamp for music
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its way cheaper to pay 5 or 10 for a vps
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and have all that
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and more
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> control
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you pay sr.ht so you don't have to set it up yourself
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and you feel like sr.ht won't mistreat you
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> migadu is also a choice I've seen before, probably a fine one
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah but as someone who knwos how to setup git servers i feel like its not worth to pay that
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for email i use postfix and dovecot, its rly a hasle to setup but if i would setup a mailserver now i would use https://maddy.email/
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sr.ht and migadu both cost 20$/y in the cheapest plan
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i pay 6â‚¬ for my vps
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah 20â‚¬ year?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> per year?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah month
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats 1.6â‚¬ per month
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> plus you don't have to spend time on setting up, maintaining and securing these services
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can also not fix downtimes yourself
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i just like to tinker with this stuff
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why would you ever use sr.ht?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks like a worse github
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, looks like a less modern version of github
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see the appeal
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because it makes u look cool and alternative
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Uiiii!
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> upstream UI methods
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog!
