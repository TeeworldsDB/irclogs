02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> wtf is this
02:44 <+Learath2> nimda not being able to connect to ddnet.tw for a while and forgetting the released maps
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <thewauf> :wtf:
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ReiTW | Blizzard Team `src/engine/server/network_server.cpp`, probably
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @heinrich5991 sure i've checked, actually i've done a global rate limit inside the function called OnTokenCtrlMsg
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> just at the beginning
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> i'll check if it does something while being attacked
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sonix> @heinrich5991 hey, is there any chance you have this tool stored somewhere in ur backups? https://teedune.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/killvis/
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> d u d o s :thonkery:
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <N9mkOik> +
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> ok it lags
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> But less than before
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> before my srv would crash
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> but with those global rate limit it stays alive
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> would be muuch better with a multithread for networking part
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or ratelimit in iptables, or even better in the external firewall in front of your server
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> no
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> i have both

13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> actually still alive but laggy xD
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> 
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/412223320277123077/unknown.png
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> lets see if i can do better
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> XD
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> added more rate limits where it has to be
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> lets see
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> i'll pcap some packets from this shit guy
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> & filter those also
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> ik that B|Ice asks a friend for attacks
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> will be funny when i'll find who's running it
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that guy the one ddosing now the servers?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> Ice is trying as fck to ddos srvs (i mean he's asking someone for tw protocol or using a stresser)
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> qshar has been ddosed by him
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> & for my case he's doing that since i've blacklisted spain country
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> & since he's a little low
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> everywhere
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> but If i find out who's the friend of b|ice
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> it will be funny for me, to enjoy against him
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> how can i bind keys like ^ or numpad numbers?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Numpad numbers can be bind
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Was something like kp_1
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Kp is keypad I guess
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ZimE settings -> controls -> try pressing to key
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ^ is grave
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> thx
