07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> Hello,
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> Excuse me, I don't know if I am asking in the right place or not
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> My question is that when I create a new condition in "void CCharacter::HandleTiles" in the Character.cpp file and write for example
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> `if((m_TileIndex == 185) || (m_TileFIndex == 185))
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> {
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar>         // do somethings
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> }`
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> Does not work
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> Hello,

07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar>         // do somethings
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> }```
07:40 < bridge> <rezaskar> Does not work
07:48 < bridge> <rezaskar> But it works when I use numbers like 0-64 (tiles defined by ddnet)
11:02 < bridge> <cyberFighter> can i search it in windows instead
11:02 < bridge> <cyberFighter> also, could it be some driver issues or smth?
11:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> Unlikely, i dont know If any Windows Tool that does that
11:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> Unlikely, i dont know of any Windows Tool that does that
11:35 < bridge> <zhn> check mapitems.h, afair there's a function that validates indexes
12:19 < bridge> <sedonya> How can I get CRenderTools in render.cpp to pass it to my function? ``this`` doesn't work
12:19 < bridge> <sedonya> Function in the screenshot ``void CRenderTools::RenderTee``

12:39 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> then `Render`'s arguments should be wrong, or your context is messed up and `this` isn't actually `CRenderTools`
16:02 < bridge> <zhn> Tracer :greenthing:
16:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> do ddnet cfg files use some specific format?
16:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> i want to parse `settings_ddnet.cfg` so it would be useful to know if this kind of format is used anywhere else
16:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> what do you want to parse it into :o
16:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> i mean i just want to get commands from it
17:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> so like command + arguments
17:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> it seems simple
17:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> but
17:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean the format is just [command/setting] [value]
17:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> or multiple values
17:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> and those values can be in quotes
17:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> but dont have to
17:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> so spaces are kind of important
17:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> its not that simple
17:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> and escape characters can be used
17:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> `\`
17:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> there has to be a library that does precisely what i want to do lol
17:11 < bridge> <pilonpl> i just dont know how to DuckDuckGo it
17:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> multiple values for a single command are seperated by `;`
17:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> you can use \ in cfg files? TiL
17:34 < bridge> <pilonpl> no?
17:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess they can be lol
17:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> but some arent
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah gg i wrote it wrong, i meant seperate the commands itself
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah gg i read it wrong, i meant seperate the commands itself
17:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> ok
17:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> but in cfg files they can also by in seperate lines
17:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> or maybe even have to?
17:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> thats the point
17:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> idk what exactly is valid
18:11 < bridge> <pilonpl> ok i created my own implementation
18:12 < bridge> <pilonpl> its a little unreadable but who cares lol
18:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's definitely better than this :justatest:

19:13 < bridge> <learath2> Have I just grown too used to it that this doesn't look bad at all to me?
19:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it not that bad?
19:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> cool then :greenthing:
19:14 < bridge> <learath2> What part bothers you?
19:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> every line i write bothers me
19:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> working with time in c++ is... fun :pepeW:
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> If you are on C++20, `std::chrono::zoned_time` is much more fun to work with
19:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that format thing in c++ 20 as well, right?
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> yes
19:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that format thing is in c++ 20 as well, right?
19:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im switching to c++20
19:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :greenthing:
19:18 < bridge> <chairn> you cant do low level stuff even in C
19:18 < bridge> <chairn> most assembly instructions cannot be generated by compilers
19:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> true, depends on what low level people mean too xd
19:18 < bridge> <chairn> especially SIMD ones
19:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> for most peopel low level means managing memory and thats it
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> There are builtins that can help you with that, you can write SIMD code without having to go down to inline assembly
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> but yeah, standard C does have limitations on what you can express at the lowest level
19:20 < bridge> <chairn> long ago, he started playing around 2009 i guess and stopped few years later
19:20 < bridge> <chairn> he's actually my brother but he's no longer active on tw (but still alive :))
19:21 < bridge> <chairn> why you looking for him ? ts server is probably outdated but i think it's still running
19:22 < bridge> <chairn> bit flips instruction and really specific intrinsics are never generated either
19:22 < bridge> <chairn> SIMD through builtins is just writting assembly in C, the compiler just generates the loads/stores and moves for you in some cases
19:24 < bridge> <learath2> Well writing assembly in C is much more pleasant than learning how to properly inline assambly
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> again, you are right, just saying you can access some things without having to resort to assembly
19:26 < bridge> <chairn> *can't i guess
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> can
19:27 < bridge> <learath2> I guess the double negative there wasn't the best choice of wording üòõ
19:28 < bridge> <chairn> anyway, i often look at the code generated if im worried about performances
19:28 < bridge> <chairn> on microcontrollers, i like to measure time with gpios on/off on the oscilloscope üòÑ
19:28 < bridge> <learath2> only way to make sure indeed
19:35 < bridge> <patiga> teeworlds/ddnet optimizes snap updates by not sending updates for tees which can be easily predicted, called "dead reckoning". can someone tell me which things are optimized out by it? also projectile interactions, or **only** single tee movement (no collisions) with only map collision interaction?
20:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: how to play chidraqul xDDDD
20:13 < bridge> <learath2> Stuff inside character core is dead reckoned, nothing else as far as I'm aware
