00:23 <+bridge> <learath2> Oh, I thought the lack of negative feedback was enough after I offered the comment about channel limit. It most definitely is desired, atleast imho
00:29 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> definitely
01:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> cyberpotato is the better player tbh
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> can we please finally get a server without kickvotes
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> i just got voted in 19h run by a bored kid
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> on an empty server
08:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we need a "jail" team
08:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> voted ppl go into jail and cannot talk, rename etc.
08:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇ
09:03 <+ChillerDragon> nah
09:03 <+ChillerDragon> just turn off votes
09:04 <+ChillerDragon> on some servers so players can choose if they want to get kicked or not
09:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
09:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anarchy
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> yes
09:13 <+bridge> <BillionRay> How about make it take a larger ratio on some servers to kick?
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> works way better than this shit
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> how about we turn the votes off ffs
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> it cant be that one can not go to the toilet while playing t0
09:14 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Kim Jong Un has entered the chat
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> giving random users kicking powers is a broken concept
09:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
09:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> where are u from chiller
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> germany
09:42 <+bridge> <.itube> Does this look like one?
09:42 <+bridge> <.itube> 
09:42 <+bridge> <.itube> 1119627041239740506
09:42 <+bridge> <.itube> Does this look like one?
09:42 <+bridge> <.itube> 
09:42 <+bridge> <.itube> https://youtu.be/RYZ08W4-4NM
09:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the hook at 0:50 looks really botlike
09:45 <+bridge> <.itube> It is a bot ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
09:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but you are asking bcs u want to know if it looks human like or not?
09:46 <+bridge> <.itube> Well it's an old version, now you can't even see if it's a bot
09:47 <+bridge> <.itube> What I wanna say is that this sentence doesn't make any sense for me from murpi
09:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally it looks pretty human like.. a pro would set other hooks tho
09:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @.itube is the bot just "helping" or playing completely on its own?
09:48 <+bridge> <.itube> It avoids the freezes, and when you are in any 1 tiles it plays automatically, or if you going to fail
09:48 <+bridge> <.itube> Probably because I'm also good without bot
09:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i see yeah
09:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that makes it even harder
09:48 <+bridge> <murpi> JUPSTEARR
09:48 <+bridge> <.itube> Well i think it's cooler then a tas bot
09:49 <+bridge> <murpi> can u do a thing
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> back in my days ppl played 15h/day to finish a insane solo
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇ
09:49 <+bridge> <.itube> lmao
09:49 <+bridge> <murpi> I assume Ravie hasn't talked to about the skin upload form on ddnet.org yet @Jupeyy_Keks
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5kKmUOxwio
09:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here legit 1st try finish xDDD
09:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> look at server time
09:50 <+bridge> <.itube> What I also noticed is that you are literally 7/24 in this chat @Jupeyy_Keks
09:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am, bcs im tw addicted, even if i dont play
09:51 <+bridge> <.itube> https://youtu.be/7iD3M7_4E3w
09:51 <+bridge> <.itube> Legit r1
09:51 <+bridge> <.itube> Why you don't play
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i played gores, jukki was 12 xDDD
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now he mastered the game
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont know, its very stressy to play insane gores
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i sometimes still play a bit
09:52 <+bridge> <.itube> Go play some gores
09:52 <+bridge> <.itube> If my range isn't banned
09:52 <+bridge> <.itube> XD
09:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what's about it?
09:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it vulnerable?
09:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i suck at php
09:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
09:59 <+bridge> <murpi> No, it would be great if you could change it so the skin db crew doesn't have to upload skins twice/seperately for uhd skins
09:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh
10:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at that point its probably easier to automate the discord skin upload
10:00 <+bridge> <murpi> https://tenor.com/view/panda-animated-lazy-sleepy-cute-gif-17741860
10:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can tell how the http post payload must look like
10:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am just not touching python code xd
10:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets add yet another ddnet bot yet again
10:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> written in rust xd
10:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> YADDBYA
10:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds cool
10:15 <+bridge> <.itube> rust nerd?
10:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> zzzz
10:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just dislike python xd
10:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i doing smth like discord bot in c++ is way too hard xD
10:16 <+bridge> <.itube> what about js
10:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i already used the rust library
10:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its ez to use
10:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> why u think so
10:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont find js easier than rust, setting up a node server etc is annoying
10:16 <+bridge> <.itube> call me and i setup it for you
10:16 <+bridge> <.itube> XDD
10:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs adding deps in cargo takes 1 second
10:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in c++ i need to manually edit either cmake, or other stuff, even if i only target linux
10:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> interesting
10:18 <+bridge> <.itube> just use the discord creator app in steam
10:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ```assembly
10:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> xor    eax,eax
10:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> lea    rax,[rip+0xe46]
10:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> mov    rdi,rax
10:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> call   0x1040 <puts@plt>
10:18 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ```why move rax into rdi and not lea into rdi directly?
10:18 <+bridge> <.itube> kekw
10:18 <+bridge> <.itube> bro is searching for these the whole day
10:29 <+bridge> <.itube> just use the discord bot creator app in steam
10:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> what is this from
10:32 <+ChillerDragon> assuming this is a reply to my asm
10:33 <+ChillerDragon> its my selfcompiled 10liner in c
10:33 <+bridge> <reitw> Afterall nodejs sucks
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> ``puts("some srting");``
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> so it uses ``lea`` to load the address of the string
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> stores that in rax and then moves the content from rax to rdi
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt make much sense tome
10:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> *copies
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> ?
10:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `mov` copies the data
10:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not move
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> trol
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> ok
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> but why
10:35 <+ChillerDragon> why not lea into rdi?
10:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this means it's in both registers now
10:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe that has some relevance?
10:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> idk
10:36 <+ChillerDragon> why do i need two references to a string to print it? xd
10:36 <+ChillerDragon> something doesnt add up
10:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah that‚Äôs unusual
10:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, seems like rdi is the first argument and rax gets clobbered
10:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so it seems it's indeed useless
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> you think itll still work without the mov?
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> i compield with gcc no extra flags
10:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
10:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> try it
10:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no `-O2`?
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> no
10:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that explains suboptimal code
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> just gcc
10:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah no optimization is why
10:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> but why add random unoptimizations xd
10:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt think they did
10:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just not optimized
10:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> that may just be the first register it thinks to use
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> ok lemme try o2
10:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> proper register allocation is a hard problem IIRC
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> it does know where to put it in the end doesnt it? xd
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> just waits one instruction to do so
10:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> different steps
10:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> not coordinated
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> woah
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> -O2
10:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> i‚Äôd imagine those register allocation optimizations can be applied afterwards
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> did exactly that
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> who needs -O2 when you got chilerdragon fixing ur assembly manually
10:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> u mean put into rdi
10:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> or same code
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> yes
10:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> nice
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> into rdi
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> ima put O2 assembly on my CV now
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> its like english B2
10:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> why were you not using optimizations anyway
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> idk i never use compiler flags
10:41 <+ChillerDragon> if you disagree with the defaults you use the wrong software
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 when gdb map edit writeup? when #off-topic? when dissector snapshot items? when huffman py?
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> hrhrhr
10:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> huffmanpy is online
11:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think the existence of the flag is an invitation to use it
11:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> the default settings might be a good config but it depends on the use case & even then it may not be the best
11:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> just the one that‚Äôs safest without compromising on other things like performance too much
11:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: default flags for gcc are due to historical reasons
11:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if you ask the authors of gcc, they're probably going to tell you that you should always run it with flags
11:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. `-Wall -Wextra -O2`
11:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that they aren't default isn't because the authors don't like the flags
11:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's due to backcompa
11:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> t
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > but why add random unoptimizations xd
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its how compilers work
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the frontend doesnt rly do much low level opts
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> compile a rust program without any opts
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u will see how many movs it generates xd
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 in package registry? wot u didntr tell me
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> https://pypi.org/project/libtw2-huffman/
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> wot
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> june14
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> when did you plan to tell me? xd
11:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he is not ur wife lol
11:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> is libtw2-huffman stable and ready to use? i see no docs in classic libtw2 style xd
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> oh no its updating crates.io index what a bloat the pip install is running since 2minutes now :c that is a big hit since my project was zero dependency and pretty lightweight before
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> didnt you want to ship binaries heinrich?
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> omg im stoopid @ryozuki i did copy pasta error there was no error in your huffman xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
12:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> chillerwhat version is ur rust
12:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lol
12:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which huffman
12:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> python?¬ø
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> idk whih version pip uses
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> teeai
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> i use for my parser
12:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what does cargo -v say
12:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just do rustup update
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> how to cargo -v in pip install
12:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> last version uses sparse registry so its fast
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> is it using system cargo?
12:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> my sys uses 1.69
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> i would like to stay at 69
12:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
12:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> update bro
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd and i pushed heinrich into publishing py version
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> because i thought ur huffman broken
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> omawgwd
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like shit now
12:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what did u copy wrong
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> i copied the header
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> in my test
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> in the expected decompressed output
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> and compared against payload only
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> i never double checked and instantly blamed ur code because u said it might have bugs xd
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> now that libtw2 failed to i looked twice xd
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> omg
12:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> libtw failed?
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> my test was wrong
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> so libtw failed
12:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> which made me realize my test being wrong
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> fixed the test
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> and now it also passed with ur huffman
12:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> not really
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> because urs is way less bloat
12:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it should pass since the python version i made it 1on1 on the c++
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> i will use urs over libtw
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> and thus bullied heinrich all the time wout reason
12:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but if his uses rust
12:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its prob faster
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> yes
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> and better error handling
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> but it would be the first dependency
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> and its a big one
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i can make it optional or something
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> like choose a huffman backend xd
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> is that wird?
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> weird*
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> x
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> ops wrong tab
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> ye im going for optional dependency
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 wat about the ruby one? and typing for the python one? i mean i can also add my own stubs file no problem
13:31 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> Maybe, but I've never seen a pro do this lol
13:31 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxIpIgw4f68
13:33 <+bridge> <steinchen99> i mean.. if its a bot it must be the best ive seen 
13:33 <+bridge> <steinchen99> doubt its a bot
13:33 <+bridge> <steinchen99> a bot would rather hook straight up here
13:33 <+bridge> <steinchen99> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1119953058969964594/Screenshot_2023-06-18-13-32-40-418-edit_com.google.android.youtube.jpg
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> hfgl qshar detecting this axaxax
13:54 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> No way any pro is finishing this crazy 1 tile map
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1687092901.png
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how dis w dummy
14:56 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> u didnt ping me
14:56 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> u are really lucky i checked dev channel jut now
14:56 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> chillerdragon: u need dummy reset on switch command for that
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cyber dev channel enjoyer
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1687093647.png
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> figured it out thanks
15:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok @murpi i think i finished the bot
15:39 <+bridge> <murpi> :justatest: ?
15:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the skin upload discord bot
15:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wanna join my server to test funcationality? xd
15:40 <+bridge> <murpi> I thought you were joking about YADDBYA :justatest:
15:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xddd
15:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @murpi ^
15:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/discord-skin-upload-bot
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe the regex to parse the name, author and license isnt perfect yet for example
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt really respect every case xd
16:13 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oooo
16:17 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @Jupeyy_Keks is there a way to make sure the password thing still works? like how you need to upload a password to the site in order to actually be able to upload
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the password has to be set inside the bot.. everyone with skin database crew role can upload then
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the role is the security now
16:18 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> nice!
16:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never tested the basic auth tho xD
16:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was too lazy to set it up locally
16:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the bot only writes to database anyway, cant go much wrong xd
16:21 <+bridge> <murpi> the check if the dimensions of the image are either 256x128 or 512x256 using `img_rgba.dimensions()` isn't really required @Jupeyy_Keks
16:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant hurt
16:30 <+bridge> <murpi> can you restrict the slash command to a channel?
16:30 <+bridge> <murpi> else it would work everywhere
16:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if that works, is it bad?
16:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it will never post a public visible message
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1119999229394432000/image.png
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume your german is good enough :lol:
16:44 <+bridge> <chairn> StarStarNet Bot
16:52 <+bridge> <murpi> does /upload timeout after a certain amount of time?
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes after 2 minutes i think
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2 minutes of inactivity
16:52 <+bridge> <murpi> ah, then it's fine I think
16:53 <+bridge> <murpi> you specify the guild and and role id only, so the slash command would work in all channels in the entire guild
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i dont find a way to specifya channel
16:53 <+bridge> <murpi> and if the command doesn't timeout, then that would be a problem üòÑ
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
17:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> should the bot automatically list all skins upload, publicly visible to everyone? @Skin Database Crew
17:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> should the bot automatically list all skins uploaded, publicly visible to everyone? @Skin Database Crew
17:21 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> it's enough that each skin has the reaction I guess
17:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it could also reply to the user that uploaded the skin
17:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:21 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> it could get spammy
17:21 <+bridge> <Clefairy'> I agree with Ravie
17:22 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> unless you make a command to dump a list of all skins uploaded since last time
17:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it will list all skins uploaded
17:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isnt that the same as all skins uploaded since last time? üòÑ
17:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant the new uploaded skins if that was unclear
17:25 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> yeah but I mean it shouldn't write messages and ping people for every skin that is clicked, maybe only list all once you're done uploading
17:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i thought its maybe nice to know if *your* skin was uploaded
17:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats why i thought about pinging the uploader
17:26 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> yeah that's a cool idea
17:37 <+bridge> <louis.place> @Jupeyy_Keks can u make it so the filename of the skin is automatically the uploaded name
17:37 <+bridge> <louis.place> also can lisences be a drop-down?
17:38 <+bridge> <louis.place> or the best option would have everything be automated from discord xd but that's a lot to ask for
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it is all done by discord
17:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it automates the full upload
17:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> expect the /commands and the reactions over emojis
17:41 <+bridge> <louis.place> oh nice i didnt scroll up
17:41 <+bridge> <louis.place> üòπ
17:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u dont need reactions either
17:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> discord commands have personalizable buttons
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah and should i list all skins avaialble ? XD
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has to know which skins to select
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120016623865188492/image.png
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but how to know which skins to upload üòÑ
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk im OOTL anyway
17:54 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> No it's a bot 100% look at this xDD
17:54 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJF7iMXodbE
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ravie_ravie
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120018975716290701/image.png
17:56 <+bridge> <learath2> mh, it's way too inaccurate to be a bot imo, it's not aiming to the center of the blocks even
17:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
17:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say legit
17:56 <+bridge> <gerdoe> he can edit their demos
17:57 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i remember someone sent something similar
17:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its funny that we all agree to support the bot üò¨
17:57 <+bridge> <gerdoe> maybe its a bot
17:57 <+bridge> <gerdoe> maybe not
17:57 <+bridge> <gerdoe> too impressive to be a bot
17:57 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> why would he go back and forth ? If it was edited he wouldn't do that
17:57 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> maybe you should send him a map
17:58 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120019716166135890/Screenshot_2023-06-18_175821.png
17:59 <+bridge> <steinchen99> tbh.. i wouldnt be surprised if he just recorded his movement and then placed freeze
17:59 <+bridge> <steinchen99> lemme show you what my bot Looks like.. :)
17:59 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> looks lovely
17:59 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> for sure üòÑ
18:14 <+bridge> <syrinok> When he's falling at 17 seconds and his eyes twitch around, it's pretty obviously a bot
18:15 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, nicely spotted
18:16 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess it's a bizarre bot
18:18 <+bridge> <syrinok> 23 seconds as well, when he has less options to hook it's noticeable, the other videos looked legit to me though, so that's not good
18:20 <+bridge> <steinchen99> i hate rendering on older client here
18:20 <+bridge> <steinchen99> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120025208095510619/Autumn_Sunsebot.demo.mp4
18:20 <+bridge> <steinchen99> big flaw is that its super bad with precise hooks.
18:20 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah this is the level of accuracy possible with bots üòÑ
18:23 <+bridge> <broso56> yea thats for sure a really real looking bot
18:23 <+bridge> <broso56> i mean clearly its working people werent even sure if it was a bot or not
18:24 <+bridge> <broso56> does it just have some sort of smoothing between its inputs/aiming? and maybe they tried to reduce hooks as much as possible
18:24 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ChillerDragon: stop abuse
18:24 <+bridge> <steinchen99> literally cannot even pass the 2nd hookable :)
18:24 <+bridge> <steinchen99> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120026196122542222/B_O_Tg.demo.mp4
18:25 <+bridge> <steinchen99> i wanna know what a possible solution would be
18:25 <+bridge> <steinchen99> moving the tee with wasd isnt the greatest..
18:26 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> maybe the slats bot is an AI? The 2 vids look botted, but still kinda legit
18:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> you mean trained ai?
18:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i don't think he has big collection of perfect gores runs in readable format
18:28 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> I mean what else would it be
18:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @gerdoe wot
18:29 <+bridge> <gerdoe> too much of balls chiller
18:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u in the staff channel?
18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this Iza guy was making a fuzz cuz i had like 8 tees
18:30 <+bridge> <gerdoe> xd
18:30 <+bridge> <gerdoe> do you really need all of them
18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no such thing as enough tees
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this avo guy likes container orchestration
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i do tee orchestration
18:31 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 8 monitors of yours xd
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 4
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not there yet
18:31 <+bridge> <gerdoe> fair
18:33 <+bridge> <Iza> :tee_thinking:
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> og lerato pls dont kill me
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Iza go leak emoji id
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> write \:tee_thinking:
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and leak id
18:34 <+bridge> <gerdoe> \:tee_thinking:
18:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 478629518358085653
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ah sure
18:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty babe
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> no U
18:35 <+bridge> <Iza> i got an idea
18:35 <+bridge> <Iza> just use discord
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> do you
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> do you say this to person who wrote whole web app that he hosts on his homeserver
18:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> to move back to discord xd
18:37 <+bridge> <Iza> if he has to ask other people to send the emoji id in order to just see it, then i personally would just rather use discord
18:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> no he asked id to load it on his server
18:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> so soon he will see new enoji
18:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> emoji
18:37 <+bridge> <steinchen99> reject discord
18:37 <+bridge> <steinchen99> embrace anything else
18:38 <+bridge> <steinchen99> element wowoowwo
18:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> matrix is pretty good
18:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> irc is better :troll:

18:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxax
18:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: typing support comes with the next version of uniffi I think
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice
18:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> binaries are in the works, need to figure out how one does that
18:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then the installation will be quicker
18:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, update your rust
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> amazing
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> yeye
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> ikik
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> spoarse index
18:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> updating the crates.io index is a thing of the past
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> u both told me mnultiple times xd
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> but 69
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> cmn
18:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you might be able to enable it there as well
18:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> just need a config
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> yea i added now both TeeAI and libtw2 huffman 
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> idk if u get gitlab pings
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> so my lib is still 0 dep
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> but if one wants rust speed they gotta install libtw2_huffman
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> and it will use that one then
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> idk if people do stuff like that in the python world but seemed slick to me
18:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 0 dep on teeai?
18:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
18:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> solved with copy pasta xd
18:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it has no git submodules or pip requirements i mean
18:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just slapped ryos huffman.py in my external folder
18:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so if one checks out my src code it just works
19:16 <+bridge> <murpi> @learath2 Can you merge this into yaddb?
19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yet another ddnet discord bot?
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yet another ddnet discord bot yet again
19:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but 
19:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just another ddnet discord bot
19:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also nice
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can u even merge two discord bots? does discord allow to run 2 runtimes on one bot
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> its funny how all yters talk about having to be insanely brand safe and woke to not get demonitized
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01oeaBb85Xc
20:43 <+ChillerDragon> this is kinda refreshing :D its full on instructions on how to sell drugs online xd i mean they probably dont care about ad money but still suprised to see that up
20:44 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :troll:
20:44 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> troll serum (black tar heroin)
20:46 <+bridge> <bencie.> troll serum lorem ipsum
20:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120064021358444584/img_2421.jpg
20:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> who else uses vim
20:58 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> even as a cleaning product that looks hard to use
21:04 <+bridge> <gerdoe> only if you have custom toilet
21:04 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh its toilet cleaner ok
21:04 <+bridge> <gerdoe> xd
21:06 <+bridge> <learath2> not this month
21:09 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what does yaddb mean
21:09 <+bridge> <louis.place> yabba abba dabba dabba boo
21:09 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> true
21:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> literally what chiller said
21:14 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh
21:15 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why do we need 2 bots again
21:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pyson
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its just about hosting the bot, i can do that
21:21 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ohhb
21:22 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> also i just got a fun idea for a new weapon but ngl its only useful for switches or teleporting
21:23 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> a boomerang
21:24 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ill explain in a sec
21:29 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok so basically the boomerang will have a different gameplay style, but still similar
21:29 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you click to throw the boomerang, and it goes to its max distance before heading back to you. if you're running the boomerang adapts to your velocity too.
21:30 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if it hits a ground tile, reaches its lifetime limit or if its too far away from you, it will stop flying and despawn
21:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> how it can be used in dm:
21:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> basically like a far ranged hammer, you run under a platform and throw the boomerang up and that hits the enemy, then you come around the other side and shotgun them or smth. it will have the same cooldown as a laser rifle
21:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 
21:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> how its used in ddnet: long ranged hammer (just thought of this!) or a way to teleport/activate switches
21:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @louis.place youd be interested
22:03 <+bridge> <louis.place> long range hammer sounds fun
22:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @_noby\: how can I dm you?
23:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> /w noby
23:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> :troll:
