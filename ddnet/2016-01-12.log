20:16 < o_be_one> I suggest to rename TeeWorlds as TeeVali's

20:16 < o_be_one> Or ValiWorlds, not sure actually, i ask on change.org

21:43 <+Ryozuki> test
21:44 <+Ryozuki> my internet..
21:45 < Henningstone> you got down'ed?
21:45 <+o_be_one> so ? it works ?
21:45 <@deen> Like Chile and Brazil?
21:45 <+Ryozuki> na
21:46 <+Ryozuki> i just have 2 sisters
21:46 <+Ryozuki> and they like downloading :D
21:47 <+Ryozuki> like to download*
21:47 <+Ryozuki> deen what you think about the actual wiki?
21:48 <+Ryozuki> structure.. content.. etc
21:48 <@deen> Ryozuki: haven't looked at it closely, but good idea and I like that more people get involved in the DDRace/DDNet space
21:48 <+Ryozuki> :)
21:48 <+Ryozuki> English • ‎español • • ‎polski • ‎português do Brasil • ‎русский • ‎中文
21:49 <+Ryozuki> wiki is translated to that languages :D
21:49 <+Ryozuki> the weird think is that there are no trolls 
21:50 <@deen> (yet)
21:50 <+Ryozuki> and i didn't get ddos.. yet
21:50 <+Ryozuki> got*
21:51 <@deen> you're running at some cloud provider right? Do they have any ddos protection?
21:53 <+Ryozuki> they are deploying ddos protection for 10€ month but isn't yet in france/germany
21:54 <+Ryozuki> if you need help contacting chile (because language) you can ask me for translate
21:54 <+Ryozuki> soreu told me that they self ddos
21:54 <+Ryozuki> to get more money
21:55 <+Ryozuki> ...
22:00 <@deen> what?
22:00 <@deen> who self-ddoses?
22:00 <@deen> your hoster?
22:01 <+Ryozuki> mm no
22:01 <+Ryozuki> chile hoster
22:02 <+Ryozuki> thats what he told me
22:02 <+Ryozuki> dunno if its true
22:02 <@deen> no, that's wrong...
22:02 <+Ryozuki> oh ok
22:02 <@deen> 1) they don't have ddos protection
22:02 <@deen> 2) the ddos attacks take down their entire infrastructure
22:03 <+Ryozuki> there is no chile hoster with ddos protection?
22:03 <@deen> there is barely any affordable chile hoster at all
22:04 <@deen> most chilean hosters actually host in the US
22:04 <@deen> because it's much cheaper
22:04 <@deen> and for web sites it doesn't matter that much
22:04 <@deen> similar to iran, where many host in Europe
22:05 <+Ryozuki> so there is no real solution
22:05 <+Ryozuki> and ddosers wont stop
22:05 <+Ryozuki> i guess
22:05 <+Ryozuki> one thing i find weird in teeworlds
22:05 <+Ryozuki> is that is the game i played where it has more ddos attacks than others
22:05 <@deen> well, there are a few solutions:
22:06 <@deen> 1) go to the police
22:06 <+Ryozuki> but you don't know the real ip
22:06 <@deen> 2) buy much more expensive servers with proper protection
22:06 <+o_be_one> Ryozuki: it's free and opensource, 2 ways to get stupid people :(
22:06 <+Ryozuki> :(
22:06 <+Ryozuki> proper ddos protection costs 500
22:06 <+Ryozuki> or thats what i heard
22:07 <@deen> sounds about right, and that for each location
22:07 <+Ryozuki> o_be_one:  but there is no way to make it "more secure" ?
22:07 <@deen> which would not be much for a big commercial game I guess
22:08 <+Ryozuki> yes i supose
22:10 <+Ryozuki> what you think about teeworlds 0.7?
22:12 <+Ryozuki> they deleted broadcasts .-.
22:12 <@deen> haven't looked at it much
22:13 <@deen> I don't like the anti-modding sentiment
22:13 <+Ryozuki> i hate it
22:13 <+Ryozuki> it's pretty dumb
22:13 <@deen> but not sure if that's translated into anything specific yet
22:14 <+Ryozuki> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11686
22:14 <@deen> mods make up ~90% of TW players
22:15 <+Ryozuki> if they update master server the mods in 0.6.3 will be shown?
22:15 <+Ryozuki> or it works diferent?
22:15 <+Ryozuki> sry for ignorance :D
22:16 < Henningstone> 0.7 master is up yet :)
22:16 < Henningstone> and you still see 0.6 servers, so I hope it will stay like this!
22:17 <+Ryozuki> "All mods will stay on 0.6 branch and won't update to 0.7, 'boycott' will be as simple as that." 
22:17 <+Ryozuki> "A lot of 0.6 servers will stay online for a looooong time anyway after 0.7 will be released."
22:17 <+Ryozuki> - poleya
22:17 <+Ryozuki> pelya*
22:17 <+Ryozuki> xD
22:18 <+Ryozuki> but actually
22:18 <+Ryozuki> ctf is not friendly-welcome
22:18 <+Ryozuki> also dm
22:19 <+Ryozuki> noobs leave server when they see the get rekt
22:19 <+Ryozuki> idk..
22:22 <@deen> well, vanilla is more noob-friendly than ddnet
22:23 <@deen> everyone knows shooters and the controls are pretty intuitive, except for the hook
22:29 <+Ryozuki> but skill diference betwen experienced and noob is a lot
22:52 <@heinrich5991> same for ddnet
22:52 <@heinrich5991> have you ever seen a new tw player? ^^
22:52 <@heinrich5991> impossible to play ddrace
23:06 < Ameb> GER down O.o
23:06 <@deen> Chile too and Brazil half-way
23:07 < Ameb> its DDOs related?
23:07 <@deen> not sure
23:07 <@deen> pings go through to GER, with 20000 ms time :P
23:07 <@deen> highest ping i've ever seen, 30s now!
23:09 <@deen> 40s
23:09 <@deen> I wonder how high they can get^^
23:09 < Ameb> xD
23:10 <@deen> Teeworlds stops working at 1000 ms btw
23:11 <@deen> we had similar problems with GER in the last days, related to the DDoS protection doing weird stuff
