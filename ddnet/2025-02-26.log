06:21 < bridge> <zerolacqua> is it expected behavior?

07:24 < bridge> <patiga> If you got time on your hands, you could try to find maps that can crash the library twmap https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap. It's in Rust and in general tries to catch all errors and not crash :happy:

08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
09:43 < bridge> <Assa> I have seen some blog about fuzzing in teeworlds map, this could maybe be applied here
10:05 < bridge> <Assa> Does anyone know, how I can get tuning in prediction/character? This is client sided and works a bit differently
10:06 < bridge> <Assa> probably something like `GetTuning(GetOverridenTuneZone)->m_MyNewVar`
10:07 < bridge> <Assa> ah this works with CTuningParams directly, I see
11:33 < bridge> <teero777> Yo the new update doesn't just increase max_clients to 128 right,
11:33 < bridge> <teero777> Yo the new update doesn't just increase max_clients to 128 right?
11:35 < bridge> <teero777> That would be so bad
11:35 < bridge> <Assa> My guess is, that it uses sixup logic for older clients
11:35 < bridge> <Assa> My guess is, that it uses sixup logic for older clients, ofc just a guess
11:36 < bridge> <Assa> imagine being on a client which only allows 16 players when there are 128 xD what can go wrong
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What would you expect instead?
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks üòé 3 lines of code
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1344259072287047701/new_speedtile_test_2025-02-26_11-44-14.mp4?ex=67c04251&is=67bef0d1&hm=c80987aeb8de4d063e09503ef0c70542f4c66e40bc198326d3e515ae0a6cbe07&
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> neat
11:46 < bridge> <Assa> PR coming soon, need to adjust the default value, set it accidently to 128 instead of 118 xD
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> also @patiga and @kebscs
12:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> So much speed tuning in the past few days :poggers2:
12:04 < bridge> <Assa> Last thing left on my speedtile list is maybe clamping the slowdown of max_speed Force, so that max_speed isn't such an instant blocker
12:05 < bridge> <Assa> this would be changing `TempVel += Direction * (TempMaxSpeed - CurrentDirectionalSpeed);` to `TempVel += Direction * max(-Force, (TempMaxSpeed - CurrentDirectionalSpeed));`
12:05 < bridge> <Assa> This is just up for discussion ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> this would also change the behavior again of max_speed set for different forces
12:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> So it just caps and doesn't interfere with anything? +1
12:10 < bridge> <Assa> a booster with max speed can currently instantly slow you down to max_speed
12:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> So it just caps and doesn't interfere with any existing behaviour? +1 (instead of, well, going over a specific value slowing you down)
12:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> A map utilizes this, but with bluetele and grenade IIRC
12:11 < bridge> <Assa> the other proposed way can only slow you down up to `Force`
12:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ah I see
12:11 < bridge> <Assa> meaning you _can_ still be faster then max speed
12:11 < bridge> <Assa> but still experience a slow down
12:14 < bridge> <Assa> this can also prevent the reflecting up part patiga was so worried about. But you can still do it with hughe Force values
12:14 < bridge> <Assa> this can also (partially) prevent the reflecting up part patiga was so worried about. But you can still do it with hughe Force values
12:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> a good default value makes more sense than keeping it unclamped anyway - wonder why we didn't do that before
12:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> But maybe we just didn't bother because some maps utilized this so it was considered ‚≠êa feature ‚≠ê
12:16 < bridge> <Assa> I think now I can explain why you fly up like for a 5 year old:
12:16 < bridge> <Assa> @patiga when you hit a speedtile with max speed set and you are way too fast, the speedtile instead pushes you in the opposite direction in order to slow you down. The opposite direction of bottom right is top left. Right and left speed gets cancelled, but you will be pushed up
12:17 < bridge> <Assa> Nobody was italian enough to touch the old code
12:24 < bridge> <teero777> Not making the game 2x more CPU heavy? This will prob reduce my fps by a lot.
12:24 < bridge> <teero777> even with only 2 players on the server everything still loops over the 128size array
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks how is ddpg coming along
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Agreed, but would you instead expect to use Vec or smth?
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno, ddrace didn't advance ig :/
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> yes definitely. There are some problems with strong/weak no?
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> weakhook and bounce is a bug feature anyway
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you don't keep the order, then yes.
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you keep the order then mostly removing and inserting is slower ig
12:35 < bridge> <01000111g> can someone explain me how "weak bug" works, based on the code. I really struggle to make sense out of it
12:52 < ChillerDragon> ok nice the bridge works again
12:53 < ChillerDragon> is it unsafe to ``mem_zero`` a multi dimensional array?
12:53 < ChillerDragon> removing this line fixed a crash in my client hm ... ``mem_zero(m_aaDbgMsgs, sizeof(m_aaDbgMsgs));
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``mem_zero(m_aaDbgMsgs, sizeof(m_aaDbgMsgs));``
12:54 < ChillerDragon> annoying submit message on paste
12:54 < ChillerDragon> fakin weechat 
12:56 < ChillerDragon> as far as i know multi dimensional arrays are also contiguos in memory so zeroing out the full size should not corrupt anything??
12:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it shouldn't‚Ñ¢
12:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: can you send a link to the repo if it's not private?
12:59 < ChillerDragon> yea the recent merge into ddnet broke chillerbot-ux but the crash that is more complicated to debug is only in its fork that shall not be named to not violate rule 7
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> replacing the mem zero with ``	for(auto &aDbgMsg : m_aaDbgMsgs) aDbgMsg[0] = '\0';`` fixed the crash but it is still full of asan warnings of pointers with invalid type so probably the issue is elsewhere
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sad that asan does not help me find the origin ._.
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof this is frustrating @milkeeycat are you interested in debugging it? :D if you leak your gitlab name i can invite you to the repo. Its only closed source so skids dont abuse its features for illegal purposes but you could build a more harmful client your self in 10 minutes.
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i don't have a gitlab account xd
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> blaze it netherlands alternative for microsoft crap?
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just click "sign in with github" :D 
13:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> uninstalling graphics lib removed `keepassxc` -.-
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which distro u on again?
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> debian
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt you recently rage quit gentoo?
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it was a year ago xd
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as i said
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> recently
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yup
13:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: https://gitlab.com/MilkeeyCat
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat please do not leak the hidden secret projects in there not even their highly confidental code names https://gitlab.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-zx
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> build the client with asan and connect to a server you will see some odd warnings
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks for checking it out <:heartw:395753947396046850>
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh shiet u need also access to the private submodules sec
13:36 < bridge> <Assa> one question: If I add a value to config_variables.h, do I have to do it at the bottom?
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for ddnet or your client?
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your project*
13:37 < bridge> <Assa> for ddnet
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can put it whereever it fits best
13:44 < bridge> <Assa> why can you turn on/off the tune overlay with ClTextEntities?!
13:46 < bridge> <Assa> no I don't understand something
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> I have never seen a number over a tune tile, oh now I understand, the tune overlay is only rendered in editor, makes sense
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> oh god, why do we have a single setting for editor and ingame for this ...
13:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I tried using ddnet's docs https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#using-addresssanitizer--undefinedbehavioursanitizer-or-valgrinds-memcheck and I don't see warnings but when I leave the game it segfaults xd
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat have you successfuly used asan before?
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet docs work smooth for me on debian
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hah finally a good lead!
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reverting https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9712 fixes it
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so somewhere there is a MAX_CLIENTS 128 issue
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ... somewhere
14:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: what server did you connect to?
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> local host random ddnet-insta ictf server
14:03 < bridge> <Assa> is there any way to know if something gets rendered ingame or by the editor?
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im 95% sure i fixed it btw @milkeeycat 
14:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> now I want to understand why it doesn't print anything -.-
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes you should!
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> asan is op
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yup its fixed. Thanks a lot for you moral support @milkeeycat i really needed it. Your efforts to fix closed source bot clients will never be forgotten.
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what command do you use for asan?
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``asan``
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :thonk:

14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you update submodules?
14:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yep
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not good
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> segfault on quit?
14:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
14:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and when i turn of debug mode
14:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and when i turn on debug mode
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> crazy how much effort it is to maintain basically 0 features
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanted to do some server side stuff and am stuck launching my client xd
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to switch to ddnet-rs
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can not reproduce the segfault wot
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how is your setup so different?
14:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :feelsbadman:
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works on my machine
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wont fix

16:06 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> Aaaa then look for a file called SAN.pid in your current directory
16:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> in terms of comparison, they're equal
16:08 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> Nope it‚Äôs some boring movement automation and a block stats tracker I built for Multeasymap
16:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> m..m...movement.. auto...automation?
16:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: the whole time I was looking in console, i thought warnings would be printed in stdout, but they were in SAN.pid file xd. Everything works now and doesn't segfault üòÑ
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> !ban Bridge 0
16:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They are in stderr by default but it you follow the ddnet readme it uses a logfile
16:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So the segfault was some classic build cache error?

17:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :kek:
17:41 < bridge> <pluskz> @essigautomat  It seems i can go through the new speedtiles if max speed is 1 and i hook something at the other side
17:42 < bridge> <louis> wtf is a vscode license
17:42 < bridge> <Assa> do you need to be very fast for this? If you're fast enough, you can skip any speedtile in general
17:44 < bridge> <pluskz> No
17:44 < bridge> <louis> its cause of the hook
17:44 < bridge> <Assa> cannot reproduce
17:44 < bridge> <Assa> plese send setup üòÑ
17:45 < bridge> <pluskz> I cant now xd, but i just make a slide, with hookables below
17:45 < bridge> <pluskz> I hooked them while at the slide and moved left and right
17:45 < bridge> <pluskz> And i go through it
17:47 < bridge> <Assa> be reminded, that max_speed 1 is not zero speed, even if you stop in the vertical case (due to quantization)
17:48 < bridge> <kebscs> Can you ma≈Çe minimum speed 0?
17:48 < bridge> <Assa> and Now iam able to skip through them too, but veeeeeery slowly
17:48 < bridge> <kebscs> Can you ma≈Çe minimum max speed 0?
17:48 < bridge> <kebscs> Can you make minimum max speed 0?
17:48 < bridge> <Assa> No, i am currently working on slides as tiles, which are force 0 max_speed 0 tiles
17:49 < bridge> <kebscs> Ah so this is how you implement it
17:49 < bridge> <Assa> doing this with speedtiles is somewhat shady
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> here is a testbuild if you're intrested <https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/pull/6>
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> 
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> Speedlayer Index 31, but it still uses the arrow sprite. I didn't want to post it yet as I am waiting for a new graphic which makes it purpose clearer
17:51 < bridge> <kebscs> I think this is what 2d games do for slopes
17:51 < bridge> <kebscs> Additional upwards speed
17:52 < bridge> <kebscs> And slow down left/right direction speed
17:52 < bridge> <Assa> don't call them slopes, call them slides, as I already see other people throwing stones at me :justatest:
17:54 < bridge> <Assa> also the slides I implemented are still skippable, it just takes very very long and is probably due to floating point precision and quantization
17:55 < bridge> <pluskz> Why not make 0 be 0 in this tile? xd
17:56 < bridge> <Assa> because the old tiles didn't support it either, I am just following the standard. And max_speed 0 is equal to NO max_speed
17:57 < bridge> <pluskz> Hmm
17:57 < bridge> <kebscs> Add more code
17:57 < bridge> <kebscs> Smth like angled stopper
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> yes already on it!
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> I send the link

18:08 < bridge> <pluskz> Ok so... i guess ill need to use those slides for what i want then
18:15 < bridge> <pluskz> Ok so... i guess ill need to wait for those slides for what i want then
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks I have a hard question:
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> Is tile buffering only enabled in editor and the opposite case only ingame for every client and build?
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> It's like this for me
18:25 < bridge> <Assa> Ah this is completly backend dependend üíÄ
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> editor has no buffering
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ingame it depends on what the backend supports
18:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> OPTIONS???
18:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @/heinrick
18:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @/heinrich
18:55 < bridge> <Assa> üôÇ
18:55 < bridge> <Assa> off for today, enjoy the peace when I am not spamming
19:22 < bridge> <bodia22810007> Im geyüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
19:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> me too
19:48 < bridge> <kebscs> Do you have to place that many tiles for it to work?
20:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> congratulations
20:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> üöÄ
21:00 < bridge> <bodia22810007> Thanks oll
21:00 < bridge> <bodia22810007> Im lesbian
21:00 < bridge> <bodia22810007> ü¶ß
21:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i mightve destroyed the editor im sorry
21:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this is why im an artist and not a programmer :cammostripes:
21:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Don't worry, it's all fixable
21:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Next time you'll remember this crash xd
21:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Robyte probably working on a fix already :p
21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> probably
21:14 < bridge> <hectavoxel> next time ill stick to ui design and concept art, and have someone else do the hard part :troll:
21:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just keep trying :) Understand the error and move on :D
21:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> stuff like that happens everytime
21:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> to everyone
21:15 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i mean yeah but there are now two direct errors caused by my update
21:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And that's still not an issue. You could also argue, ddnet admins could have checked / tested the stuff before the release / merge.
21:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's not a problem. It'll get fixed, a new patch update releases, and that's it
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some langs also don't have seg faults
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @hectavoxel i love u pls dont hate me
21:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I might be a little hardened when it comes to that, because I personally created so many crashbugs and stuff. It will get fixed and then I move on xd
21:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Missing nullptr check etc
21:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i am too fucking stupid to learn anything else
21:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> when ddnet-rs has the ddnet gamemode complete i will at least try to make a new gamemode
21:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> For preventing crashbugs while coding, just try to imagine what stuff would be possible, and while testing try every technical possibility to interact with something.
21:19 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not related to the automapper reference though, it was introduced by undo/redo
21:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh :nouis:
21:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> See, problem solved
21:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Everybody creates bugs xd
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :deen_star:
21:22 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i mean that sincerely. i wanna add a load of useless weapons for the fun of it
21:23 < bridge> <hectavoxel> we only have like 6, and its been that way forever
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> Hey I broke everyones color settings in a patch and deployed a broken autoupdater twice forcing people to re-download the game
21:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> *still mad about that*
21:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> ^ same
21:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 what's even worse is you didn't hold your promise to make a replacement for old stars.
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> I got very busy with real life things. Someone else made it tho, so all is well that ends well
21:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> the new stars used for invincible?
21:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> or freeze stars as in freeze bar
21:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No
21:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the freeze stars that we currently have is what he meant
21:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ...
21:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> :Aware:
21:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its not a 1:1 replacement
21:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> looks cool too tho
21:38 < bridge> <learath2> It's like 99.9% there, it's even timed properly
21:38 < bridge> <learath2> The only thing that it doesn't properly account for is ping, old stars were affected by ping
21:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Almost every PR I submitted there are other peoples PRs to fix my stuff
21:38 < bridge> <learath2> The only thing that it doesn't properly account for is ping, old stars were affected by ping more accurately
21:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Pls pls pls ping me when u add new netmsg/obj stuff
21:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> network/mod related stuff
21:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i had to quickly patch in the spectator info counter + auto spec cam yesterday
21:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I didn't make spectator info and auto spec cam is not even that useful
21:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true but for completeness
21:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Add input flag then
21:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont like people missing out on features they might like
21:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It is in the pipeline
21:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye ye its added
21:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> There is also one that haven't been merged
21:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> But that was only for AB currently so you probably don't really need it
21:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> AB?
21:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> antibot
21:51 < bridge> <protocolhttps> i want to render an rectext, where round is 0 at left down and left up, but right side stay round. which corner to use(IGraphics::CORNER_)?
21:51 < bridge> <protocolhttps> i want to render an RectExt, where round is 0 at left down and left up, but right side stay round. which corner to use(IGraphics::CORNER_)?
21:52 < bridge> <kebscs> TL = top left TR = top right, BL = bottom left

21:53 < bridge> <protocolhttps> oh thanks
21:55 < bridge> <louis> funny fix lmao
21:58 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, this popup code is messy with all the global variables
22:04 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 for the ui elements change, do i add everywhere == 1, or what would be best way to do it
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> some buttons handle both left, right click but most dont
22:09 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't immediately see any alternatives than adding `== 1` everywhere :pepeW:
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> imgui has flags for buttons, where they specifiy to which button it should react to
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> imgui has flags for buttons, where they specifiy to which mouse button it should react to
22:11 < bridge> <kebscs> also the ddnet buttons still react even when == 1, they do the color change
22:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> i guess something similar would be nice indeed
22:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1344416838335070419/image.png?ex=67c0d540&is=67bf83c0&hm=b36bdb988a1bee07186cc51181469a5ddcd50efa69995520e6785f40145985d4&
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Of course, how would you hover with only the left button?
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Or the active state when they are pressed down?
22:13 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean not just hover, even when its == 1 right clicking will change button color but wont do anything
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I see, then it would have to be integrated into `DoButtonLogic`
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> like the imgui flags
22:23 < bridge> <protocolhttps> how can i remove stroke from render text?
22:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1344419885119442994/image.png?ex=67c0d816&is=67bf8696&hm=2595f3aec14b5563086df268728b6eccf53128e3c611e35c5e982e4325b79049&
22:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dont think announcing connecting players is fine
22:28 < furo> Also spamming botted rank 1s on DDNet to advertise their servers. Truly an amazing server network.
22:28 < bridge> <Assa> no, just for testing
22:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> :justatest:
22:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> gg for supporting this
22:33 < bridge> <murpi> I'll just remove them now
22:33 < bridge> <murpi> heinrich wanted to talk to them, but i guess he forgot or something, idk
22:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> TIL u can make a CStr literal in rust using c"bla"
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> running 1 test
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ; ModuleID = 'example'
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> source_filename = "example"
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> define i32 @main(i32 %0) {
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki>   %2 = add i32 %0, 4
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki>   ret i32 %2
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> test test::test_function ... ok
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog my ir builder works
22:34 < bridge> <robyt3> What do you mean with "remove stroke"?
22:38 < bridge> <protocolhttps> stroke on letters
22:38 < bridge> <protocolhttps> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1344423481567088761/image.png?ex=67c0db70&is=67bf89f0&hm=9f07dfd1978b3f542cc646d5b625e0623f9e7b3dbcbeeadcf02ebd833e784ad2&
22:39 < bridge> <protocolhttps> or is in font?
22:39 < bridge> <chairn> you mean outline ?
22:39 < bridge> <protocolhttps> yeah
22:39 < bridge> <oxyzo.> change the entire font file:jaouis:
22:39 < bridge> <oxyzo.> but im not sure
22:40 < bridge> <oxyzo.> maybe theres some fonts without the outline that you can find
22:40 < bridge> <hectavoxel> outline, stroke, same thing
22:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Not really intended, maybe set the font color alpha to 0 and outline alpha to 1
22:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> LOL?
22:42 < bridge> <protocolhttps> TextRender()->Text(...) doesnt have this setting üò¶
22:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh thats for the discord
22:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Use `TextRender()->TextColor`
22:43 < bridge> <robyt3> (before you render the text)
22:44 < bridge> <protocolhttps> i know, but he also doesnt have something about outline in args
22:44 < bridge> <protocolhttps> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1344424982599696609/image.png?ex=67c0dcd6&is=67bf8b56&hm=05c0edd409851e0565e7049781cb9d559b21e5e3afd1d6b4dd85bdbc0eeb84f1&
22:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Read `textrender.h`
22:45 < bridge> <protocolhttps> ok
22:46 < bridge> <protocolhttps> i found, thank you
