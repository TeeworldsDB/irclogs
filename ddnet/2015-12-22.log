14:14 < Ryozuki> hehe
14:14 < Ryozuki> today i will upload the vid
14:21 < WsYFU> Yeah? I'll upload mine then too
14:22 < Ryozuki> :o
14:22 < Ryozuki> go ahed!
14:22 < Ryozuki> ahead*
14:22 < WsYFU> Yeah
14:23 < WsYFU> Wasn't sure about it
14:23 < Ryozuki> what is it about?
14:23 < WsYFU> But guess, prondotcom will get another one
14:24 < WsYFU> I keed
14:25 < Ryozuki> i know
14:26 < Ryozuki> :DDDDDDDDDDD
14:26 < Ryozuki> okno
14:26 < WsYFU> ^^
15:12 < WsYFU> !twp MeZ
15:12 <+Nimda> No MeZ found online.
15:29 < o_be_one> hello
15:32 < WsYFU> Hey
15:32 < Ryozuki> i think that "TheMaster" is aoe
15:32 < Ryozuki> TheMaster: " I wouldn't ban much as it sucks to be banned"
15:33 < Ryozuki> oh
15:33 < Ryozuki> and it's new account
15:33 < WsYFU> Who knows, could be Aoe
15:33 < WsYFU> Could be FBI officer
15:34 < WsYFU> or our lord and saviour Putin
15:35 < WsYFU> But, say, it is not Aoe
15:35 < WsYFU> I am 90% sure
15:38 < WsYFU> the other guy tho. Maz or MeZ, he looks way more suspicious to me
21:08 < laxa> Anyone here
21:08 < laxa> I think I found a little exploit on teeworlds
21:09 < Henningstone> lol
21:09 < laxa> not a critical exploit
21:09 < laxa> just a little exploit
21:09 < laxa> Are you available for 30 seconds test Henningstone ?
21:09 < Henningstone> of cause
21:10 < Henningstone> just tell me what to do :)
21:10 < laxa> ddracepro.net:8304
21:10 < laxa> go there on teeworlds
21:10 < laxa> rename with only numbers
21:10 < laxa> I'll try to ban you
21:10 < laxa> if it fails, we have an exploit
21:10 < laxa> otherwise everything is working :p
21:10 < Henningstone> ok, sec
21:12 < Henningstone> laxa: lol
21:12 < laxa> x)
21:12 < Henningstone> laxa: did it work?
21:12 < laxa> I am just dumb
21:13 < laxa> you can still kick player with their ID
21:13 < laxa> but the code is little bit not clear about that
21:20 < laxa> what suffir m_ap means ?
21:20 < laxa> p is for pointer ? a for array ?
21:20 < laxa> m for member ?
21:21 < Henningstone> m_apPlayer == member array of pointers with name "Player" :D
21:21 < laxa> the guy used to code on windows
21:21 < Henningstone> like aBuf, is also an array so you can see
21:21 < laxa> that's hungarian notation...
21:48 < laxa> const char *m_apArgs[MAX_PARTS];
21:48 < laxa> Means I have an array of MAX_PART strings right ?
21:50 < Henningstone> yeah, an array of strings i'd say
21:51 < laxa> Don't understand how that can work
21:51 < laxa> where is the allocation for the array size ?
21:51 < laxa> look at src/engine/shared/console.h in class CResult
21:51 <@heinrich5991> you have an array of MAX_PARTS elements, each element is of type const char *
21:51 < laxa> Is it different from C ?
21:51 <@heinrich5991> no
21:51 < laxa> Ok then
21:52 < laxa> Thanks
21:52 < Henningstone> smth like aBuf[MAX_PARTS][str_length]
21:52 <@heinrich5991> the const char * are likely pointing into an existing allocation
21:52 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: no
21:52 < Henningstone> i meant for the allocation
21:52 <@heinrich5991> that would be putting MAX_PARTS arrays of str_length chars on the stack
21:52 < laxa> yeah indeed heinrich5991
21:53 < laxa> When you see in console : ban s?ir
21:53 < laxa> do you have any idea what that could mean ?
21:53 < laxa> r is for reason
21:53 < laxa> i is for ip/id
21:53 < Henningstone> ? means optional
21:53 < laxa> but s? is like string?
21:53 < laxa> yeah from regex
21:53 < Henningstone> no, it's rather ?i
21:53 <@heinrich5991> a string, all arguments from now on are optional, an integer, the rest of the command line as string
21:53 <@heinrich5991> the string is the ip or id
21:53 < laxa> ok
21:53 <@heinrich5991> the integer is the time
21:54 < laxa> I just looked at last issue
21:54 <@heinrich5991> and the rest is the reason
21:54 < laxa> but that's not saying anything to non-dev people then
21:54 < laxa> and looked at the code too
21:54 < Henningstone> thats true =) they need to guess what it could mean ^^
21:54 <@heinrich5991> that's true. one could add human-readable argument strings
21:55 < laxa> if(StrAllnum(pStr)) in ConBanExt
21:56 < laxa> should be smt more like if(StrIsIP)
21:56 <@heinrich5991> probably they mean StrAllnum to check whether it's a client id?
21:57 < laxa> right
21:57 < laxa> then I have an exploit
21:57 < laxa> if my name is 65
21:57 < laxa> and you try to ban me
21:57 < laxa> won't work ?
21:57 < laxa> (using name instead of ID)
21:57 <@heinrich5991> you can't ban people by their name
21:57 < laxa> yes you can ?
21:57 <@heinrich5991> you can only ban them by client id or ip address
21:57 <@heinrich5991> at least in vanilla
21:57 < laxa> hu right
21:57 <@heinrich5991> maybe ddnet added something strange
21:58 < laxa> then I am just plain stupid
21:58 <@EastByte> I don't think so :p
21:58 < laxa> sorry x)
21:59 < laxa> don't ever get a mecanical keyboard if you have a gf and lives in 20 square meters -_-
21:59 < Henningstone> she's annoyed? xD
21:59 <@EastByte> maybe throw out your gf?
21:59 < laxa> xD
22:00 < laxa> I have to type slowly cause she tries to sleep
22:00 < laxa> it's her place ^^
22:00 <@heinrich5991> is a mechanical keyboard so cool? when I saw other people using it it was mostly "oh god, this is loud"
22:00 < laxa> more comfort, I like the sound
22:00 <@EastByte> I actually don't like mechanical keyboards
22:00 <@EastByte> I can type faster with flat keys
22:01 < laxa> oO ?
22:01 < laxa> I type the same with flat or mec
22:04 < laxa> https://code.org/mc
22:04 < laxa> Dunno what to think about that
22:05 < Henningstone> lel, that is scratch in minecraft-style xD
22:06 < Henningstone> yeah, I just used "moveForward();"
22:08 < Henningstone> OH GOD DAMN I destroyed a treeâ€¦ just using CODE!! i knew being a programmer is a good idea. feels so powerful :D
22:30 < Henningstone> that reminds me a bit on ComputerCraft, programming these turtles ^^ good old times years ago... oups, I caught myself playing that for half an hour?! what happened, I should be coding on teeworlds instead :o
23:02 < Ryozuki> Hello
