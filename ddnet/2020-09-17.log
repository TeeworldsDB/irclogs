08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I didn't show it before. 
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> 
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> But sure, I still can show it. probably in the end of week. I'll write you in dm.
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Jupstar ✪ want to review my changes so I can release them soon?
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/milestone/1
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why do all servers say x/63 in ddnet?
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> reserved slot?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> are we making sure we send max(numclients, maxclients) for the maxclients amount?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 64/63 is invalid iirc
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, for reserved slot
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check the code please
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaツ> what about if the server prints a message "congratulations to [name/s] for getting (team) rank 1 !" whenever someone finishes a map with rank1
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaツ> could be for a more immediate and therefore rewarding feeling
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ReD | allocaツ how about just spamming `/rank` until you get muted, seems to be what most do 😄
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it's enough to broadcast it on Discord and ddnet.tw/ranks already
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaツ> aight 👍  :)
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> what graphics libraries ddnet client uses? I heard that some clients of TW use SDL2
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, SDL2
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and OpenGL
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> What differences between openGL 3.3 (which you can set in settings)?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> and default one
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> opengl 3.3 is faster and more modern
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> especially faster when you zoom out far
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Thanks. I will use it
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Did I break the background @deen ?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ i think so, or was it not transparent before?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah u right, goona look into it
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, apparently I misremembered
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no changing ui transparency is broken
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in older it works
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> strange, now that i test the old client it doesnt work wtf xd 5minutes ago it worked
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think only ingame it's not transparent
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but outside it is, which is probably what confused me
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the transparency suddenly doesnt work
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not even in ddnet 10
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 14*
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah wait
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u mean ingame its transparent
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah that works xd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> while we at it @deen should i increase the hover infect of ingame buttons, seems a bit low, bcs rn it uses the ui color and dark colors are still dark
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> while we at it @deen should i increase the hover effect of ingame buttons, seems a bit low, bcs rn it uses the ui color and dark colors are still dark
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i can review ur stuff but dunno if i can merge xd
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 May @Jupstar ✪ give me bors r+?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if he already did
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can just try
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah sure, isn't he a reviewer too?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok works
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then nvm
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if we can get a key like CSGO for scoreboard to enable GUI cursor, instead of ingame, then we could change sorting etc. 😄
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyone has an opinion on
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #2813
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2813
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen does #2846
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> really matter for 15.0?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt it only for servers anyway, i dunno if someone runs a server on XP but ok xd
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2846
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok it affects all windows, but still duno xd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ no, for clients too
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We're shipping websockets support to the clients now
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah alright
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> next step will be getting a server behind cloudflare and trying to only open websockets instead of udp
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for master servers / server list?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or ingame server
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ingame server and serverlist
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok will be an interesting experiment 😄
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> master server won't support that unfortunately
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why we have so low value for br_max_requests ?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I used 300 and my browser just Flying comparing to old 25
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because for people with bad network connections it can get laggy
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> sad I didnt know about this setting before
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or interrupt other connections in the same network
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> thought that ddnet is just lagyg
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> udp is quite agressive on the network
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> br_max_requests 300 maxes out at 100 KB/s for me
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont know if there solution but default 25 with all countries selected is very sad settings imo
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean it takes a while to load
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Having a static setting will never be perfect, and checking how many responses don't arrive also doesn't work since we don't know if the server is just down
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you could argue that since the start of DDNet internet speeds have improved so we could set it to a higher level
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I thoug about some sort of average ping for countries, so user will pay attention on flags we have in settings
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> All this time I thought it just some internal sever setting but not real server location
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I highly doubt ws would be any use for us
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Learath Have you selected countries in your browser?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am not sure either 😄
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 why? no more spoofing
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I tried, was wondered about boost in load
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> TCP has to many disadvantages
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Hey bois and girls. Lost the link to the censoring item. Where can i find it again? Really want to stay up to date with that feature 😜👀
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet cloudflares protection is much better optimized for one of those next-gen sites that has a "real-time" interaction with the server. Like whatsapp web
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess it'll behave like shit under the high throughput we need
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe it'll be helpful for serverinfo though, where spoofing matters yeah
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> wow, someone plays on wxp
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @LCSG47 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2812 ?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> Yes I think websockets with cloudflare will get us a better protection from ddos.
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, but we will also need to pass the domain when we connect on websockets to support cloudflare
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise they can't know where we want to go
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw, maybe close #2786
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2786
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> maybe we could use chn1.ddnet.tw or something like that
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, we could test it on one server in GER and one in CHN
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> yes
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck ^
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Forgot wireshark open
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756179477763194880/Screenshot_2020-09-17_at_18.46.42.png
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2.5Gs of packets 😄
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> In fact, I have been traveling in recent days, so it may take a few days before I have time.
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> np
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen thanks, but
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > I think Pure_luck (on Discord) was interested in implementing this
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> you haven't added that it will take anywhere from 6 months to 6 years to me if I will implement this
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but maybe I underestimate my noob power
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and noob will to implement things ofc. I've decided to shutdown a second server for now
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> cause it's hard to switch between them and get people from one to another
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and mostly I am consumed adding features to my mod and promoting a server, sorry
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that was the easiest solution for me
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and mostly I am consumed adding features to my mod and managing it's community, sorry
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that was the easiest solution for me
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and atm I am consumed adding features to my mod and managing it's community, sorry
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that was the easiest solution for me
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen 1h enough for the announcement?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its very single sided anyway
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> @Soreu Yea that one. But found it myself already 🙂 Thanks tho
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Hope someone finds the time to do it pretty soon. Would be Pog
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yeah
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 could you test https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-osx.dmg please? Websockets build.
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How operational is it supposed to be?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can connect from client to server with ws:127.0.0.1 in host address
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm mostly worried for the linking
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> serverinfo does not work either
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, I forgot the path in DDNet-Server
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756189018231668878/Screenshot_2020-09-17_at_19.24.58.png
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, that path is totally wrong
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I got both wrong
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait really? :d
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did we merge everything
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> <a:YEEEEE:644851795499417601> <a:YEEEEE:644851795499417601> <a:YEEEEE:644851795499417601>
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Jupeyy was busy 🙂
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have you already published some work related to the dissector?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No I want to get it to more than an ugly toy before publishing it
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tomorrow or the day after I'll have something probably
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-15.0-osx.dmg works?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> downloading
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The server is not finding it's datadir
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> huh, is that a new problem?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think we changed anything there
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it also doesn't work in 14.7.1 then I'll just release
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you host a ws server I can try connect to?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The macOS launcher and the server executable are a bit of a mess, I think the very out of date shim needs replacing
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not currently, sorry 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if the client starts, I'm already happy enough
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks for checking
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll patch the shim later
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast it doesn't break any feature that worked in 14.7.1
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks!
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would have been nice if I could finish the data integrity patch
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oooh
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it was still in draft, right?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i didn't check the drafts
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I was too slow
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, I mostly wanted to get the font fix out, rest was just nice to have
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doing like 5 things rn, that one got a bit neglected
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We can do another release when it's done 🙂
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I kinda wanted to get it in before we do any other autoupdates
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I guess we didn't touch any data this time, so it's fine
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ nice ui changes
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2214
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u think about a join queue? would that be abused in some way? most games do this
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe the current protocol makes this hard tho
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <StaYHunterLive> is it allowed to write here for help?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #questions if its not technical
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it is technical because after update, his client doesn't start xd
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> always say atleast the os 😄
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> idk, talk to him in #questions
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> openbsd :lol:
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> openbsd best xd
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.blog/2020-09-17-github-cli-1-0-is-now-available/
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this might be good, i wont need to see the white website that burns my eyes
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cli.github.com/
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf why do we have 2 deens xD
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ one is a fake that dms ppl asking for credit cards
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he should be banned

20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> More connections to keep track of on the server, more attack surface
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DoS gang
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thought so
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/09/17/stabilizing-intra-doc-links.html
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen no https://ddnet.tw/news/ about new release?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam rls missing too
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, forgot the steam release
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done now
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you could always switch to beta version on steam to get nightly builds
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> got a report that ddnet steam on windows showed the auto updater
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can someone confirm?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://prnt.sc/uj3a2f
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, but there is an #ifdef(CONF_AUTOUPDATE) and I build steam version with -DAUTOUPDATE=OFF
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats why im asking for confirm.. but i asked him 5 times xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont get it
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its really steamv ersion xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756225448362508318/screenshot_2020-09-17_13-49-46.png
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this is what mine looks like
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the question is, when u at 14.7 on steam does it show autoupdate
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk how to go back to 14.7
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if u can tbh
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > can someone confirm?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ it didnt show me the update button on steam
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux version tho
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean someone could just put another DDNet.exe in steam directory
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that would explain showing the update button
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sure, its no garantuee, but he normally isnt a very technicual guy
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 2nd guy confirmed
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> steam on windows shows update
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> oh god, learn and news reappeared on main menu
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> need to fix russian translate again xd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> oh god, learn and news reappeared tomain menu
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen ^
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> oh god, learn and news reappeared to main menu
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my text
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I still have 14.7 Steam on PC (W10x64) so will check in less than 2h
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can't explain how that happens
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu well, Steam will probably not let you run it
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> without upgrading
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Soreu u'd need to cancel the steam download fast
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or maybe start steam in offline mode
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I can download old steam version that I uploaded myself
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I can test it locally
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the ddnet logo upscaled?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756227280728227951/unknown.png
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yeah, can confirm. @heinrich5991 any idea why CONF_AUTOUPDATE is defined when -DAUTOUPDATE=OFF
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw when i click run server, it doesnt shwo on lan tab
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki but it's running?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how can i know
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756227948134006784/unknown.png
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Windows? There should be a console window opening
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756228091369619496/unknown.png
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> uh oh
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh...
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Turns out no one tests my beta versions and reports if things work 😦
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make louis tester
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> xd
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but did linux work for u?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but on Steam it indeed doesn't work...
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756228470601809920/screenshot_2020-09-17_14-01-47.png
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i changed the name of DDNet-Server.exe and got this
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but if i change it back it shows the error message
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the hover effect
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly makes the serverbrowser
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feel morem odern
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> big change
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more modern*
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, i know hat the problem is
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with run server
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I got a huge bug
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> main menu remake, now we need editor remake :O
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf why do i see weird skins
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> did they add a skin grabber
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it downlaods skins
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can i make any skin and have it grabbed or is it only database
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from database
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> nouis skin is in database
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :feelsamazingman:
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thats so stupid omg
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> disable it
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we had to remove so many skins
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756229593547145336/unknown.png
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no its a good feature but some skins in database are weird
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wish i could disable some and not others
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let's delete the bad ones from db
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and keep only good ones
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ugh
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> same as maps
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw if u uncheck download skins, downloaded skins still show so maybe have the option just only show default ddnet skins?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this will cause lot of drama
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see it
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> the download skins just means automatically download skins right
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756230025056878762/unknown.png
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like bruh
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> very interesting, control panel doesnt localize
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756230114290696262/unknown.png
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> got my vim editor to another level lol
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756230116777918594/unknown.png
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> for me especially
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> so after you download them unchecking it still means the already downloaded skins are in there
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> on steam version and on own-compiled
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe thanks, will fix
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Can you shorten the Search/Exclude/Server ip boxes? You can't even type that much in it
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> and main menu's "Play" unlocalized,
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> and main menu's "Play" unlocalized
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe no one translated it yet
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> There are so many ugly tees in both the database and shipped by default that I have always started every fresh download by cleaning up :f
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, even worse are the artifacts
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756234996028670219/unknown.png
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks really cheap imo 😄
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> still better than invisible ones
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or plain black
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Who wants to do group for cleaning up the skins database from crap? @louis ?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis @Soreu you have permissions or should I give them to you?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i can clean up a bit but there should be more than 1 person deciding
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> before people start getting used to the bad skins 😄
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk where to edit it
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and dont have perms
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/skins/edit
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Someone mentioned I still have access, though will have to remind myself the access info
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nvm, got in
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis I need an htpasswd line generated for you, then I can permissions for you too
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen Will do it with him and try to get someone else to help deciding
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something like this: https://macminiosx.github.io/passwd-generator/
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so that it won't be only 2 persons opinion
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie ?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @mind ?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie same for you, htpasswd line and you have access if you want ^
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen 
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> things that need to be localized:
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> 
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> main menu -> Play
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> serverbrowser -> Server search: ; Exclude: ; Search ; players (unlocalized) ; servers(unlocalized) ; Name ; Type ; Map ; Players ; Ping
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ was it just not dilated maybe?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe grab the file from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/data/languages and send me an updated version
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nah, that skin was just created in wrong way in the first place
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> dilate won't help
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> no, im about client
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756237270956114021/unknown.png
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what do i choose
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> md5 is ok
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> client just dont localize it
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe but it localized them for me
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> hm strange
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> need to update master maybe
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe are you sure you updated the translations?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because those strings are new
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Soreu if u mean plain black black tee, that is atleast used regulary 😄
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I know, sadly
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> though plain white could be customized for black aswell, while still allowing different colors
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can u have true black with our color limitations?
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Can't we?
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Time to update the feature then :monkaS:
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> :D, 0.7 just fixed would be nice for sure
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 0.7 tees look very strange, bcs feets and stuff isnt properly rendered
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ feel free to start with this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2055 xD
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont thing its a bug
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> can someone help pls i cant open the game, it starts up and after the loading bar is full it closes
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> after i updated it
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what OS?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> windows 10
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> doesnt work with steam
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> or with normal
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont remove beast
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen was libwebsockets the "biggest" change which could cause crashes?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @I.K.U were you on 14.7.1 before?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> i think so
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @I.K.U as a workaround you can try downloading 14.7.1 from https://ddnet.tw/downloads website. does that work?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> idk
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> ima try
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki Not going to, still have to admit it's one of the greatest ones
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen It didn't work for @StaYHunterLive until he removed all files and did totally clean "reinstall"
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just so you know
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he used autoupdated
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Soreu but then also 15.0?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> it works with older client
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why does the client need websockets tho
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they want to try a websocket based server
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for ddos
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> websocket is tcp right
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> console spams:
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> [2020-09-17 21:45:59][http]: task failed. libcurl error: The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> [2020-09-17 21:45:59][http]: http https://skins.ddnet.tw/skin/kitty_coala_cammostripes.png
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not just use tcp directly
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does cloudflare work with tcp directly?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi yeah, that happens when people use skins we don't have in db
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess I could mute them
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does websocket suffer from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @I.K.U i could imagine your firewall blocking us. Could you try temporarily disabling it?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen eh, my fault
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki yes
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it is worse when you have packet loss, but better when we have DoS
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool, interested seeing how it goes
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but some poor dudes with slow internet might be affected xd
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe not (?)
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> eeeee had a suggestion for that, to open multiple connections and use them to prevent that problem
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we haven't implemented it
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen, sorry, but anyway
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756240994508210331/unknown.png
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> other strings are okey, great
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> on german language same
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> with the recent update, my game get's extremely choppy after awhile (due to alt-tabbing alot?) not sure what the cause is but the only solution is to restart the game
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe thanks, will fix
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> yep, thank you too
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> now i can sleep well with think that ddnet's translation is fine xd
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will release in ~30 min
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Soreu I can help, but with me it will go down to <100 skins in no time 😅
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie one rule: you can't decide to delete your own skins
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but my old ones suck
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise those would be gone in no time
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make a list and vote
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "start server" freezes the game for me (linux, steam)
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *run server
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> into a state where i cant close it properly
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's weird, it should just fail to find the file (will be fixed in 15.0.1) and not run anything
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah this time it just crashes
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so when i start it via steam it crashes, when starting it via console everything works
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, it's my bad
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but when it fails it shoud not crash
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `Assertion 'pa_atomic_load(&(b)->_ref) > 0' failed at ../pulseaudio/src/pulsecore/memblock.c:682, function pa_memblock_unref(). Aborting.`
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can we get an nightly without websockets to be sure its that xd
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga hm, I just call exit(1) after execv. I assume the execv fails, I assumed exit(1) after that in the forked process should be ok
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like the forked process not properly dying
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ will take a bit, I'm still building the 15.0.1
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 exactly, but why?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk. atexit stuff?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ooooh
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't think about that, how do we enforce a hard exit without atexit
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there should be docs about that somewhere
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> _exit
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean spawning a process is nothing obscure
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps use `posix_spawnp` if also available on osx
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen i skipped most stuff from today, but would it be an idea to have a client test team. With different os and PC's so we can take care of it before releasing. Announce that we need to test it and what changes are made and there will be people testing. But right now nobody even knows there is a new beta version or nightly build which need to be tested i guess.
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> so now server browser uses websocket? or not yet?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!ʎø1øʞıƝg> is there a ddnet browser now/
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!ʎø1øʞıƝg> is there a ddnet browser now?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!ʎø1øʞıƝg> why is ddnet not compat with bam anymore?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not yet
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756254047178194944/screenshot_2020-09-17_15-43-20.png
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is autoupdater supposed to show on steam
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen , seems there is a problem with "update now" as mentioned above
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> with the recent update, my game get's extremely choppy after awhile (due to alt-tabbing alot?) not sure what the cause is but the only solution is to restart the game
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> edit: looks like enabling opengl fixed it. guess it was disabled prior to the update
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should be fixed with 15.0.1 😄
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yup
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am completely lost with the concept of new home page... are not tabs Internet, Lan, DDNet, etc supposed to be hidden when you select settings tab?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the edges of the menu cursor look a little wonky btw
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what do u mean
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cant exactly tell, something just looks off if u look at it for a long time

23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki no, websockets build crashes
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen should the server close when u close the client?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll rebuild 15.0.2
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have to enable websockets
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forgot
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but my client left the server open after closing the client xd
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i recompiled with ur changes
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it crashed
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I'll just disable websockets for release
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756261898067902514/unknown.png
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no code change required
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also find this pink messages
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> on windows 15.0.1 work fine. Just client console stays open when you leaves the game. So you cannot start client via steam
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen Is there a way to export the skin DB data to any file, so that author, release date etc could be included in a backup?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lovely c++ stl bloat
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >::operator=(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&&) ()`
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yes thx
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xDDD
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Because even though we will remove some skins, it would be good to add them i.e. to ChillerDragon's TeeworldsDB so that they are not lost
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe move them to another directory?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> skins autodownloaded vs all skins?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 they are talking about removing skins from the ddnet database
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the website
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, me too
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that would get confusing
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> another directoy will be nice imo
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> better than inevitably losing them
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so I'd honestly be for everything in general DB and quality ones in DDNet's one that would be auto downloaded
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we could add a flag for each skin in the skin db that says whether a skin should be autodownloaded
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I also think it's ok if we just host the high quality ones
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and people can point the skin downloader at TeeworldsDB if they want all
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> though flag-thing seems nice solution for easy managing
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> can anyone confirm the 64 image quantity limit for maps? (maybe also for map sounds?)
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Is there easy setting to change the db link?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cl_skin_download_url
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Soreu anything we don't host ourselves will inevitably get lost. please consider just moving the skins somewhere else
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> hmmm, can one skin be in more than one skinpack?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 you could also implement the flag 😉
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then we could just create skinpack named "autodownload"
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> "moving them somewhere else" is beyond our access/knowledge, so that'd have to be done by one of you
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> SkindDB is quite simple in its moderation options
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just give me a tar of the current skins, I guess I can host them @deen
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 so we decide to just host a selection of good skins?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems to be the simplest option right now, yes
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Could you perhaps just code allowing more than one skinpack for a single skin?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen downloaded, thanks
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think @heinrich5991 should just archive the old crap like he does with maps and we clean up the official site
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Well, prepare for the rage of Aoe when he notices 00's skins are no longer there xd
