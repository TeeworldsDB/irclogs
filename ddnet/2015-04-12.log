15:21 < Learath2> Got myself a "new" server which has Raw_Read_Error_Rate 222792653
15:21 <@deen> hehe
15:22 < Learath2> and 14000 power on hours
15:23 <@deen> you should increase the raw_read_error_rate a bit, maybe it will overflow

15:23 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 a57f639 def: Minor cleanup
15:43 < unsigned_char> hi
15:44 < unsigned_char> no hi
15:48 < Learath2> o/ unsigned_char
15:48 < unsigned_char> hi Learath2 ;)
15:53 < Learath2> never had such a huge storage im having trouble splitting it up
16:29 < Lady> deen?
16:30 < Lady> I fixed all ddmax maps and I have a question deen 
16:46 <@EastByte> hi unsigned_char, you are here
16:46 <@EastByte> now you gotta develop the hell out of ddnet :3
17:22 < unsigned_char> hi EastByte ;)
17:24 < unsigned_char> I'll leave the mark of the beast in the code ddnet.... muuuhahahahaha
17:27 <@deen> Lady: yes?
17:29 <@EastByte> sizeof(unsigned_char)
17:29 <@EastByte> 1
17:29 <@EastByte> something is missing
17:29 < laxa> it's not supposed to be 4 ?
17:29 <@EastByte> 8 in these days
17:30 < laxa> unsigned char is a pleonasm right ?
17:30 <@EastByte> pleo what?
17:30 < laxa> !fr-de pleonasme
17:30 < Nimda> Translation: pleonasme
17:30 < laxa> !fr-de pléonasme
17:30 < Nimda> Translation: Pleonasmus
17:31 < unsigned_char> !fr-es pleonasme
17:31 < Nimda> Translation: pleonasme
17:31 < unsigned_char> ?
17:31 < unsigned_char> !define pleonasme
17:31 < Nimda> pleonasme has no definition. Feel free to add one at http://www.urbandictionary.com/add.php?word=pleonasme
17:31 < laxa> !fr-en pléonasme
17:31 < Nimda> Translation: pleonasm
17:31 < laxa> !define pleonasm
17:31 < Nimda> A pleonasm is a redundant description. It is describing a word using adjectives that apply to it9s inherent characteristics.
17:31 < Nimda> Example: Person 1: Tim is a stupid idiot. | Person 2: As opposed to a smart idiot? You just used a pleonasm.
17:32 < unsigned_char> !fr-es pléonasme
17:32 < Nimda> Translation: pleonasmo
17:33 < unsigned_char> lol... never hear that word :S
17:36 < Lady> deen I forgot
17:36 <@deen> EastByte: huh? sizeof is the size in bytes. unsigned_char is definitely 1 byte
17:36 < unsigned_char> 8 bits
17:39 < Lady> deen can we make different multipliers for every ddmax server?
17:40 <@deen> that depends on your definition of "ddmax server"
17:40 <@deen> I think we wanted a single category for ddmax
17:40 < Lady> maps will have 1-5 stars yes?
17:40 < Lady> easy, next, pro, nuts deen 
17:40 <@deen> and just subdivide the votes into easy, next, pro
17:40 < Lady> yes
17:40 <@deen> then we would have the same multiplier for easy, next, pro
17:40 < Lady> hm
17:40 <@deen> otherwise it becomes too complicated imo
17:41 <@deen> As I said, I think we should actually just set 1 star for easy, 3 stars for next and 5 for pro
17:41 < Lady> hm....
17:41 < Lady> no 0,5stars?
17:42 <@deen> no
17:42 < Lady> but all pro maps with 5 stars?
17:42 <@deen> if you want different multipliers, they should go into novice, mod, brutal insteal
17:42 < Lady> maybe 1-2-2?
17:42 < Lady> and nuts?
17:42 < Lady> 1-5?
17:42 <@deen> sure, whatever fits
17:43 < Lady> I would make 2 stars for next (easy/hard) and 2 for pro...
17:43 < Lady> 1 for easy is ok because the maps are rly easy and short
17:44 <@deen> ok, so easy: 1, next: 2, 3, pro: 4, 5
17:44 <@deen> sounds good
17:44 <@EastByte> deen: "@EastByte | something is missing" normally unsigned_char is a pointer
17:44 < Lady> deen you will write creators?
17:44 < Lady> in vote list?
17:44 <@deen> EastByte: oh, you mean the person...
17:44 <@EastByte> :D
17:45 <@deen> Lady: if you can find out the creators
17:45 <@deen> did ddmax have a list?
17:45 < Lady> I can read logos
17:45 <@deen> maybe laxa can steal that
17:45 < Lady> no
17:45 < Lady> they had only map names
17:45 < Lady> deen did tyhey have any cfg?
17:45 < Lady> I saw "join team" on one map
17:45 < Lady> idk what it means
17:46 < Lady> if it's suggested or you are forced?
17:46 <@deen> i only have what i sent you, no configs
17:48 < Lady> deen so how/where should I write stars and creators?
17:48 < Lady> so it's easy for you
17:48 < Lady> deen all maps together are now 140MB, not 145 :P
17:49 <@deen> In this format: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/novice/maps
17:50 < Lady> deen ok but right now configs are like
17:50 < Lady> add_vote "Retro 0" "sv_map Retro 0"
17:50 < Lady> can you change it somehow?
17:50 < Lady> so only the nbame stays?
17:51 <@deen> in the ddmax configs?
17:51 < Lady> so I can add number and creator only?
17:51 < Lady> yes
17:51 <@deen> just use sed
17:51 < Lady> ?
17:53 < Lady> what?
17:53 <@deen> wait 1 min
17:55 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/configs.zip
17:55 < Lady> I hope you fixed enter :c
17:55 <@deen> use another editor, not notepad
17:55 < Lady> I don't have other editors
17:55 <@deen> wordpad should work
17:56 < unsigned_char> notepad++
17:56 < Lady> boah
17:57 < Lady> deen so we don't need 'new maps' because they will be always the last ones yes?
17:57 <@deen> right
17:57 < Lady> and we will have everyday new maps
17:59 < Lady> deen you will take maps from test server?
17:59 <@deen> or you make a zip for me, doesn't matter
17:59 < Lady> I uploaded all on test server already
17:59 < Lady> ok thanks bye
18:00 < Lady> I will try to do it :o
18:00 <@deen> afk
18:08 < Lady> ah deen one more thing
18:10 < Lady> or not, because you know it
18:10 < Lady> that I couldn't upload maps with weird names like @#$%^&*() in it
18:15 < Lady> and one map is broken and I can't open it
18:20 < Lady> deen can I delete "tune laser_bounce_num 5"?
18:24 <@deen> yes you can
18:24 <@deen> delete them
18:25 <@deen> and right, uploading maps is a bit broken, maybe better make me a zip
18:27 < Lady> OKAY
18:30 < Lady> deen sknets are on .next
18:30 < Lady> that's stupid
18:30 < Lady> .easy is pretty empty
18:32 < Lady> and .nuts is strange, because there are a few 'coming soon' maps
18:37 < Lady> deen Unknown Mapper if I don't know?
18:38 <@deen> just leave it empty then
18:38 <@deen> not even the |
18:39 < Lady> ok
19:00 < Lady> deen we will move ddmax maps already released on ddnet?
19:04 <@deen> i guess that's the plan
19:04 <@deen> Learath2: any progress with the updater on xp? I'd really like to release to fix a bug with voting
19:05 < Learath2> couldnt fix you can use the old bat thing 
19:05 <@deen> ok =/
19:06 < Learath2> i cant code now tho as i dont have anything on this computer related to teeworlds
19:06 <@deen> I know it's stupid, but we can't expect WinXP to be gone for the next 5 years at least
19:10 < Lady> deen some mappers doesn't want that
19:10 <@deen> don't want what?
19:10 < Lady> index made ddnet versions of maps coffee
19:10 < Lady> and they should stay on ddnet
19:10 <@deen> meh
19:10 < Lady> themix said he fixed parts and stuff and maps should stay on ddnet
19:11 <@deen> they are just afraid that their maps will not be played as much on ddmax
19:11 < Lady> deen themix asked if records will stay...
19:11 <@deen> same with mappers who didn't want their maps on ddmax
19:11 <@deen> of course they will stay
19:11 < Lady> yes I told hm
19:13 < Lady> deen but index said his map the void can go back on ddmax
19:13 <@deen> so much chaos, ok
19:30 < Lady> Bibo said he will tell Tsin that we steal ddmax maps deen 
19:30 <@deen> the same bibo whose ranks I deleted because they were made with bot?
19:30 < Lady> sorry but I ask some active mapper what they want
19:30 < Lady> yep
19:31 < Lady> deen because ddmax will come!!!!
19:31 < Lady> this summer
19:31 < Lady> and they will destroy us
19:43 <@deen> Don't make fun of ddmax. They did a pretty great job back then and now we try to honor them and their maps with this. No need to make enemies
19:53 < Lady> deen I'm not joking
19:53 < Lady> that's what bibo said
19:53 < Lady> exactly
19:53 < Lady> but translated
19:55 < Lady> you know I don't hate them and I tried to help them
19:57 < Nimda> Hopeless by Juandissimo just released on Solo at 2015-04-12 19:54
19:58 < Lady> deen why he said it after 3mins?
