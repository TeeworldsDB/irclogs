14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> guys
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Is there a way to change f1 commands/binds priority?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> e.g bind key "+fire; +nextweapon" and "+nextweapon; +fire"
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Makes the same thing
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> It changes weapon and then fires*
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But e.g when i do bind key "+weapon1; +fire", it fires first and then changes to certain weapon
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I mean that +fire is always before +weapon and +nextweapon is always before +fire and +weapon
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> And e.g i want to +weapon execute before +nextweapon
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Is it possible?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Also "delay (sec)" or "wait (sec)" as f1 commands would be useful
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Noe A delay is not planned. Aso a delay would allow to script a bot. I think @Learath2 looked into some await to at least allow for some correct ordering but i think he abandoned that project because its complicated.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But what you can try is the exec command. I think there are some hacks that even improve weapon shoting delay after change by using ``exec shotgun.cfg`` for example. It might help fixing the order of nextweapon and fire.
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I wanted to make a bind to hammer with gun tho
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> If commands would be executed from left to right, bind should look "+weapon1; +fire; +weapon2"
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I got inspired to try to do that by a player with broken mouse and unable to switch weapons xd
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Also it looks cool
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But command "+weapon1; +fire; +weapon2" executes +fire first and then +weapon commands
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I also tried "+nextweapon; +fire; +prevweapon" but this time +next/prevweapon executes before +fire
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> So the weapon doesn't change
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Did you try splitting it up in multiple configs and use the ``exec`` command? Just an idea idk if it actually works.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I was thinking about that but idk how to do it xd
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I also tried using toggle and +toggle
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I tried to use toggle to switch to certain weapon when you hold tbe button, and switch to the previous weapon when you stop holding the button
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But I think that's impossible without exec command
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Because there isn't command to switch weapon that uses values
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But if i understand how exec command works, it maybe is possible to make +weapon that uses values 0 and 1
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is +weapon1 +weapon2 etc tho
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I know
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea but not togglable
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But i mean values like cl_dyncam 0 or 1
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> weapon1 is hammer and weapon2 is gun
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Btw @ChillerDragon can exec command use .txt files?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Maybe it's possible to use exec as togglable +weapon command
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc it can use txt files
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but better use cfg, follows the style
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> oh okay
