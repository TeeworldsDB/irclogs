00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill quote the message instead then
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> your edits look strange
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how to snap objects before other ones / server side
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i tried this
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/870296079051132988/00a88c41-7100-4ea1-834d-4f68e3f3aadd.png
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> but nothing
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ehe? Why would you want to mess around with the snap order?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> now i recognize that matricks built a really great project with great code in c, but open sourcing without him as maintainer turned it somewhere
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> why not
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 3d illusiojn
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 3d illusion
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, the order of snapping doesnt change anything though
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there are very subtle differences but nothing visible iirc
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> hmm
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> but its possible to change z layer
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i saw it already
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> but its possible to change "z layer"
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/870343874990706778/video01.mp4
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> shield is blinking every direction change
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TacTic> @deen  @Learath2  why online servers that listed in internet only displayed in the client's favorites tab ?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> üòéüëç
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> üê§
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont follow
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> imagine splitting mapitems' enum into small enum classes
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @tela https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/869909642057236480
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @tela https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> damn yeah
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> learath has good taste
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think i still like fira more
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya me too
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> im not a big fan of that a
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> some weird curves and stuff in other letters too
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not sure if i like operator or not https://www.cdnfonts.com/operator-mono.font
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i thought i liked it but now im not sure
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> does this count as #developer chat? lol
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye i mean
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> has to do with coding / terminal fonts :P
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i dont rly hang here so i dont know
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is also sort of a tech chat
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> actually it gets used for that more than dev lol
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> id imagine its annoying to sort thru this stuff to find dev discussion üò¶
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> there was one font i tried to like
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> convert to mono myself
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> with zero experience doing that
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> it was hell
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well to be quite honest, a lot of the dev work just gets done by one person on a single feature, rarely it's used to mitigate issues and occasionally people will ask for input
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> this one also great
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and for issue discussion i think most people prefer github issues
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> true !
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea roboto's not bad
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but i feel like wordpress themes ruined roboto for me
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> lol
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ive never really used wordpress
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://www.dafontfree.io/consolas-font/
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I like this
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> consolas is nice
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> what is that one monospaced font where u can make small customizations on the website before downloading it?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Do you look for fonts for your ide?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> I don't use an IDE i'm not a coder lol
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> its just for terminal
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i can do basic bash scripting and thats about it
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> and basic web dev
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> and by basic i mean no js
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Ah ok, yeah I dont have custom fonts for that
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i used consolas for forever
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's soooo good
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> default on windows but so fkin clean
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also i used courier new bold for a while idk why
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> one good thing about windows :kekleo:
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> üê§
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> actually it does. just implemented what i was talking about
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> but prediction ruins it
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> it works only without antiping
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what did you implement
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> .
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ^
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> windows is not all bad üòÇ
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Just joking I use windows myself üòÑ
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> every OS ive ever used kinda sucks in one way or another lol
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I just like to bash windows
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whoa cool
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i feel that
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Unpopular opinion: If I could install mac os on my pc I definitly would
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> without scuffed hackintoshs
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> I use hackintosh lol
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> as my main OS
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ye kinda
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> did you buy custom hardware?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe make it take a diagonal path
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> from top right to bottom left and back
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> well, I bought all my PC components with hackintosh in mind
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> maybe make it like atom
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> kek
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> could
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> trying to get hackintosh to be stable on any random already existing PC hardware sounds like hell though
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> exactly, I feel like this is the case with "compatible" hardware also though
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hows updating software
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Do apple products work?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol about that
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> well even when I used actual macbooks, I never really updated the OS because most new macos updates are filled with useless features
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> for me anyway
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> like improving a bunch of apple stock programs like "photos" and "music" and stuff like that
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> so yeah, updating is kind of a pain if you want to do it
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> I also use android though so I've never tried to do any kind of syncing with an iPhone or anything, but I know imessage does work
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> arch users with 3 updated packages in stable-repo/sec
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> you have to kind of "like" troubleshooting to deal with hackintosh lol
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Okay probably works fine in ur case then
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I have a macbook that I use for work
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I would like to have the same experience on my main pc
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya I like macos too
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> mostly because I need to use software like ableton and adobe suite and stuff, but also want unix stuff
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> unix mainly
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> unfortunately though hackintosh will be dead in a few years
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> üòÆ why
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> because of ARM
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> once apple stops supporting intel machines it'll be dead
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> I estimate like 5-8 more years though
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :PepoRage: apple
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i know, as evil as they come
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> once its dead im thinking of just running a linux VM inside of windows and keeping it fullscreen always lol
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> until i want to do some creative software stuff or game
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> either that or just two PCs side by side with linux/windows and some sort of complicated KVM switcher situation
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You could just install linux as ur main os
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> or dual boot setup
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya but i kind of hate dual booting
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> fair
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> dual booting sucks
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think i would rather run a windows vm now that i only play teeworlds
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> haha ya
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for shit like adobe
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> im glad ddnet runs perfectly on my hackintosh
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but honestly more recenrly my work has been using figma which has a web version if it doesn't work on linux
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i was booted into windows only for months because i never stopped playing ddnet, until i decided to try it on macos
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> hated it üò¶
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> oo thats nifty
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> meh probably works https://github.com/Figma-Linux/figma-linux
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> worth a shot
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's an electron app i don't see why it wouldn't but
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> who knows
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ive actually never heard of figma
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> is it nice?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's not bad, if you use it correctly it will output usable css
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> oh interesting
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i thought it was something else lol
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's for designing websites
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> remember adobe muse? loool
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i didnt use it
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ive used adobe xd though
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> it was gross
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> it might still be around
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> oh yeah i use adobe too
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> photoshop, premier, and after effects mostly
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i should learn to use final cut
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> heard good things about it
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> final cut killed themselves when they turned into baby mode iMovie
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> kind of like, garage band vs ableton or pro tools or something
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i want something that's easy to use like paint.net
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but doesn't necessarily have everything
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya perfect for you then
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no one uses vegas anymore right?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i think people still do
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but premier is the gold standard for editing right
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya i believe it still is
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and then after effects if needed
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can you edit in after effects?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wasnt clear on that distinction
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i thought after effects was for like layering stuff and simple animation + filters
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> yeah you can but premier is better for just straight jump cuts and stuff
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i see
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> yeah its much better at animation stuff
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> using lots of layers and effects
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think it makes sense then
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you would do your cuts first
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and the move to after effects for the artsy work
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and then move to after effects for the artsy work
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also i assume you would do audio first in premier
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya or if you're work is actual animation then you'd start by animating in AE and move to premier for putting stuff together chronologically
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess you could do it either way
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe AE first is better
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> because you can animate with a bit of buffer and trim to what timing feels right
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya depends on what you're doing
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but then it's not responsive to the clip length
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmmm
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah definitely lol
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i used finalcut/premier for years doing these sort of complicated artsy shits
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> then realized AE is like 10x better and easier for what i do
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like the video art you do?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> gotcha
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> id do this stuff where i'd get a video clip and use like a green screen style effect where it would take out 1 color (the background) and then use the remaining video as a mask for another video
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> and layer like 20 of these on top of each other
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> really hard on rendering lol
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i can see that
