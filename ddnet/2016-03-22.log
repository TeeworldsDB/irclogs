17:37 < John___> Editor question: Can automapper insert tiles into different layers, or only into the one its run on?
17:52 <@deen> John___: only the one it's run on
17:53 <@deen> John___: but there is a similar feature to create game tiles based on a layer
17:53 < John___> bahhhh
17:53 < John___> in that case, anywhere to read the file specification for map files?
17:54 <@deen> John___: there's a python library: https://github.com/ddnet/tml
17:54 <@deen> we use it to analyze map layers
17:55 < John___> nice
17:55 <@deen> in principle you could also edit maps, but iirc there were some problems with ddrace mod
