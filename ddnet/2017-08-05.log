22:19 <+Edible> so its not dead, just renamed
22:20 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> reinvented
22:20 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> actually
22:20 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> or remaded
22:24 < Rei_[DrAzZeR]> hi
22:25 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> not renamed
22:25 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> its slightly if not lot different
22:25 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> or looks like
22:25 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> didn't bothered reading it all
22:25 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> but you can't vote seems now
22:25 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> They made greenlight better now
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> better quality games, etc
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> greenlight doesnt exist
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> try searching it
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> Ryozuki, I know, it's just name. Shortcut for me
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> actually
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> they pay more attention to those games
22:26 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> because, they were big wave of shitty games
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> yea
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> so they decided to switch that platform to something better
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> but actually, it's pretty simillar
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> just more rigoristic rules
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> ;p
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> and, you have to pay 100$ every game you want to release
22:27 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> lol
22:28 <+ddnet-discord1> <Ryozuki> sure?
22:28 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> yes
22:28 <+ddnet-discord1> <Savander> "In order to get fully set up, you will need to pay a $100.00 USD fee for each product you wish to distribute on Steam. You can pay this fee with any payment method supported by Steam in your region."
23:58 <+Edible> that's good
23:59 <+Edible> AAA titles should be on steam
23:59 <+Edible> for everything else, theres plenty of other options
