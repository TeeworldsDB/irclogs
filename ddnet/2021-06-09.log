05:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent 6 hours trying to shove an async fn into a Box
05:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally got it to fit in there but my lifetimes don't work out now because I bounded the fn with 'static
07:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> HEEEY
07:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> HELP ME
07:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> Need help not for teeworlds, but for me
07:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> SOME ONE PLSSS
08:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Nouaa lmao nice old shit
08:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> google mod src was a mix of bad code
08:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'm sure you can still find some
08:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> `if(!this)` by marcella
10:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @loky what do you need?
12:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> so i'm sure
12:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> he updated win7
12:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i adviced download default teeworlds from teeworlds.com
12:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> it works
12:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but ddnet isn't
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno, he can set a steam parameter for the game:
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gfx_opengl_major 1
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But if that also doesn't work it seems to be his setup. Tested nightly yesterday on a VM and it worked
14:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Better put the parameter in quotes
14:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "gfx_opengl_major 1"
14:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. anti virus are often blocking
14:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hehe no ur not the only one ofc. I mean I aint no saint i also sometimes trash message but in your main project where ppl can be interested in it makes sense to at least try \:p
14:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@fokkonaut)
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Nouaa\:  why use google mod when you can use F-DDrace it also has funny commit messages but the project is activley maintained and supports 0.6 and 0.7
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He already used F-DDrace and did the jason54, changing mod name and credits removing me entirely from credits :)
14:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao he did the jason
15:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao can you give us the ddnet discordbot please so that we can set it up on ddnet.tw? It's easier to debug issues and figure out what's wrong with the global bans at the moment
18:13 < ***> Buffer Playback...
18:13 < bridge> [18:11:46] [ddnet] <koma> Guys make some option that will not close the vote after selecting it. A small thing, but nice, and what is the cl_show_votes_after_voting option?
18:13 < ***> Playback Complete.
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> about menu status
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> set `cl_show_votes_after_voting 1` and the vote window won't disappear after voting.
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @koma
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have one question, why do all newfangled languages remove the post and pre-increment?
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it just out of spite?
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its too much advertisement for c++ they are scared to lose users
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or is it the rite of graduation. Something to say you are not C
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> does not work for me
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> where did you type it
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> it works solely on the client side have not entered any flags ore?
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> it works solely on the client side have not entered any flags or?
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> it's a client side command
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> I understand that this is a client command I asked how it is implemented
18:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> search the source code for `ClShowVotesAfterVoting`
18:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I don't know how it's implemented off the top of my head)
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and the languages that remove the ternary because their if-stmts are expressions. That's great for your language but it doesn't look pretty...
19:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> ok
19:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> That's different
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u are probably talking about the menu vote window?
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the actual vote window?
19:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> yes
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but that isnt clear enough, anyway there is `menus_ingame.cpp`
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there will probably be the answer
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> UiCloseWindowAfterChangingSetting
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or ui_close_window_after_changing_setting for f1
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <koma> ty üôÇ üëç
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> why is the zoom not working on the classic teeworlds server?
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @loky it's considered a cheat there
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> aha ty
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> in ddnet it is possible to prohibit zoom?
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> on server
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The server can send a GAMEINFOFLAG_ALLOW_ZOOM set to false to disallow zooming
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> oh ye at gamecontroller?
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> if I am not mistaken
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <loky> ty
19:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can also change it mid-game, done in my mod for example :)
21:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Shiro.> 0.6 > 0.7
