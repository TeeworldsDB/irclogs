02:34 < bridge> <Alexander> no bugs in ddnet
02:34 < bridge> <Alexander> only intended and unintended features
02:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i like that
02:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it's an epic feature
04:07 < bridge> <sokay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079238320879575060/v09044g40000cf828jjc77u2jk0f2mk0.mp4
11:48 < bridge> <murpi> Help, my server browser is confused.

11:49 < bridge> <murpi> o-okey, it fixed itself. üëÄ
11:50 < bridge> <Zwelf> That happened to me yesterday as well. was connecting to a lan server, but ended up on a ddnet server üòÖ
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh i thought it was fixed. @Robyt3 ^
11:51 < bridge> <Zwelf> was using old version. So could be fixed later on
11:51 < bridge> <Robyt3> You mean the smooth scrolling?
11:51 < bridge> <murpi> I'm on nightly
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean, that it uses the wrong server index
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess the server ip must then also be wrong?
11:53 < bridge> <Zwelf> (I was on 16.6)
11:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> Maybe it's an issue with the server info
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah possible
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> skins also sometimes dont work
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> heinrich, ryo when fix xd

12:30 < bridge> <Raks> Loool
12:36 < bridge> <deen> Are the skins missing in https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json ?
12:37 < bridge> <deen> I can see the missing skins on 78.135.85.66:8320 ingame
12:38 < bridge> <deen> Confirmed, just missing the skin info
12:38 < bridge> <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079366874384580618/Screenshot_2023-02-26_at_12.38.28.png
12:39 < bridge> <deen> @heinrich5991 this smells like a master server issue, any idea?
12:59 < bridge> <deen> Can you reproduce this somehow?
13:08 < bridge> <murpi> I couldn't reproduce the issue. Could this be a caching issue? I've had 2 clients open at the time.
13:08 < bridge> <deen> I hope not.
13:11 < bridge> <murpi> Oddly enough, after checking the server logs for 'DoubleDipp', he was last seen 2 days ago.
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah a wrong server info is not too unlikely i guess
13:13 < bridge> <deen> in that case it's probably not a regression in 16.8 at least
13:14 < bridge> <deen> I don't know how renaming files works on Windows. If we already opened ddnet-info.json in process 1, then rename another file to ddnet-info.json in process 2, can process 1 read part of the new file?
13:14 < bridge> <deen> My assumption was always that renaming the file is atomic, thus we either read the old file entirely, or the new file entirely
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont think we save it on disk
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess its master server side
13:17 < bridge> <deen> We save ddnet-info.json on disk and read it
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not the server info
13:17 < bridge> <deen> Oh, was thinking of ddnet tab, right
13:18 < bridge> <deen> it happened in ddnet tab though
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does ddnet-info.json contain the server info + player info?
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isnt that all https master server
13:18 < bridge> <deen> true
13:19 < bridge> <deen> then i have no idea how this issue can happen
14:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> just writting here so I wont forget when the gravity is negative the tee should be mirror in the y axis
14:07 < bridge> <Patiga> yeah the tunes complicate everything, but you still get dj if you 'stand on'/touch a tile below you
14:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> Would actually be cool if you could walk on the ceiling and jump downwards in that case, like in reverse-gravity sections in Mario games, but it's probably too late to change such physics at this point
14:14 < bridge> <murpi> Turn your monitor upside down
14:15 < bridge> <murpi> and then: `bind a "+right`and `bind d "+left"`
14:16 < bridge> <murpi> and then: `bind a "+right"` and `bind d "+left"`
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> that might actually be a fun thing to do murpi
16:23 < bridge> <Chairn> laptop users be like

17:28 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
17:39 < bridge> <Kless_hm> Game doesn't work, crashes on startup
17:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> Do you have a crash dump? Press Windows+R, type `%appdata%` and press Enter. Then open the `DDNet` folder (if you have it) or open the `Teeworlds` folder. Then open the `dumps` folder.
17:48 < bridge> <Kless_hm> Further
17:49 < bridge> <Kless_hm> Further
18:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> Does the folder contain any files that have the day and time of the crash in their name?
18:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> If so, share those files
