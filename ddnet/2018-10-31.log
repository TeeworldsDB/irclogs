00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> @Jupstar ✪  awesome ♥
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just as you unblock the bridge this guy comes back...
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> blocking it again then..
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> is admins making halloween servers this year?
08:27 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fxFo7
08:27 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 6c061eb Dennis Felsing: Remove unused cl_flow variable...
08:38 <@deen> how come our channel gets spammend and #teeworlds doesn't?
08:38 <@deen> can we do the same thing they did? (whatever that is)
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ZombieToad if i remembered how :/
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> help i stole ddnet code for my server and now everyones eyes are angery
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like a feature not a bug
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we are all angry at you
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just started DDNet GER Halloween, can anyone confirm that it's running?
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and working fine?
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> 
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507097857489240066/screenshot_2018-10-31_08-45-11.png
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> cant find them on ddnet tab tho
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> refresh?
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it takes 2 refreshes to refresh btw 😄
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since we download the updated serverlist.json, but still use the old one in parallel and don't reload once the new one is loaded
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise there'd be an annoying stuttering while refrehing
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby it actually is a feature btw, sv_events
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> i refreshed like 10 times
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> still nothing
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ty lol
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/player.cpp#L81-L100
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen halloween also used to use the ddnet.tw theme made by soreu 🙂
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/css-halloween.css
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki thanks, looks nice
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i think forum also had theme
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember it being orang-ish
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant find it tho
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see it in forum settings
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I guess it hasn't been updated
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, looks broken
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm where is the source ?
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i can try updating it
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't know
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> actually I guess that's the problem
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> during some update it was deleted
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that explains why it doesn't work
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd hope @Soreu has the code somewhere?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh he has been inactive for long.. i doubt he will answer xD
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll just ask him on Facebook
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe we should just keep the halloween design all year
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://web.archive.org/web/20130816180616/http://ddnet.tw:80/ lol, bad luck it didnt crawl ddnet on 31 october
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, you can always request a crawl
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://web.archive.org/web/20181031084718/https://ddnet.tw/ Just did one, so there you go for the future
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🙂
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or have a cookie to switch between dark/white
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Soreu said: "Sadly I lost it with moving on new PC 😞
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But it wouldn't really work, since it was made for the older version of phpbb theme"
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> Anyone know about how use bcrypt instead md5 in ddnet ?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby its event eyes like happy on christmas or new year
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt fix all tho
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507157259470503947/unknown.png
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> nub debian
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on windows
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @onby wtf ur server?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not ur
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nvm
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw: rip zombie mods 0.7
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki cuz I don't have source files, and trying to do all in css xd If only i had more time that'd be easier xd
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen  wait, you said it is in forum setting, but broken. that might be enough for me, depending on what's working, so gonna check it now
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> damn, far too broken xd
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> all the files are missing
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just the entry is still there :/
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quick> How to compile server and set it up with MySQL on Linux
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quick> Help Please
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady> How to compile server and set it up with MySQL on Linux   Help Please
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how does the random halloween skin setting work on the halloween server?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/README.md
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there are build instructions here
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady> Thanks Jao
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Sv3N Not without adding in another library or using openssl. We only have md5 and sha2 in source
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki not normal iirc, but @heinrich5991 would know better
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 np i already fixed my problem :D
18:31 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fxbKa
18:31 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d072817 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #1366 from ddnet/upd1145...
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is the anonymous enum stored in the struct? a.k.a saved in the map file too?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507246053662130187/unknown.png
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd think it wouldn't be stored tbh
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's scoped
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm as a struct member you can access it like CMapItemGroup::CURRENT_VERSION :/
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its not stored
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the code uses version to read it
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507248102479233024/unknown.png
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah it's not stored
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The thing MapItemGroup inherits from has a member we ise
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> use*
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 if you still looking for things to do, qshar would say hookprediction😬
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like doing anything prediction related :/
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @qshar  i tried😄
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Nice that you have some free time and willing to put it in ddnet tho👍
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> :feelsbadman:
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is hook even properly predictable? No way to know when the hook will be shot, no way to know when the input will cease
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can only predict the intraticks which I'd think we already to predict
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> implement moving tiles, then it will predict :feelsamazingman:
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Or autologin feature in DDNet client should be really great
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well after we get a proper account system I'd like to think there'll be no need to log in to servers 😛
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> what is the your idea of proper account system?
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ! changelog time
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> something like using facebook account?
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Certificates
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ew facebook
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way we are doing social media accounts 😛
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have that
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> me neither :)
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ed25519 account certificates
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Server has a list of public keys, server sends challange, client signs challange + ip + some session_id sends it back, server now knows for certain which user it is
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Me neither :feelsamazingman:
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Server then advertises the pubkey fingerprint for verified users which other clients can use to match against their friendlist
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> why do you need ip
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Prevents MITM
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. client uses what he believes is the ip. server uses what it believes is the ip. the signatures can't possibly match
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> hm.. You gonna need to implement IP detection to client and server sides
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the client already knows the IP it's connecting to
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I thought he sends his own IP
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't decided on how to do it on the server yet. Maybe someone else can find me a better way to mitigate MITM
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe doing everything over TLS
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But then might aswell move the game protocol over to DTLS. But then can our weak servers support DTLS with many players. But then many other questions I didn't find the answer to yet 😛
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm basically thinking of stealing SSH currently
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> well, choosing low number of rounds and a good salt might do the job
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> xD
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> but anyway it is not clear for me how will you detect the person. Is it some kind of data that identify the client / computer?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The signature of the challange. The player claims to be X, he will prove that by saying he owns the private key corresponding to X
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have a list of public keys. We find the one corresponding to X. He signs the challange. We check if the signature is legit with the public key
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the signature is valid the user is X if not he isn't X
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ok, but then if he remove teeworlds, then his signature will disappear as well
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ok, but then if he remove teeworlds, then his signature (private key) will disappear as well
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Was thinking BIP32 like nonces for that. You get a 6 word recovery key
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You write them down, you can use it to recreate your private key
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> and also user has to transfer his pk (private key) to all computers where he play
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He just needs to write his recovery key in
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> and he can't login on someone elses computer
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was also thinking of maybe storing the private key on ddnet.tw encrypted by a password
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> well, this will be a long key that will consists of many hard to remember chars
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we can't access it but the user can access it
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why I said BIP32 nonces. It's like ```pirate knife potato germany cheese woman```
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you write that down, we derive the loong key
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> that just makes the system more complicated, but I think you can do both `/login [pass]` and the certificate
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ./login [pass] involves a central authority and uses plaintext tw chat
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ye, I get your BIP32
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. fake servers that collect [pass]
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> they can't collect it if player uses autologin
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> but if they write in chat - then yes
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well best we can do with autologin is setting up an ip whitelist
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then ddnet becomes a central authority on where you get to log in
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> just sign (password+serverIP+a lot of salt)
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you let clients choose which servers to autologin on then it's open to faking attacks again
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are you signing with though? If only the password is enough to log in
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sha2(password + serverIP + salt) would work though, but at that point a normal user cant login with chat
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only autologin
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> well, he should be able with both - autologin or write in chat. 
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Yes, writing in chat is not secure, but it will work when player is not at home
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well with certificates he can login anywhere with ddnet client as long as he can remember or writes his 6 words
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> this is just like password, but a bit more complicated to remember
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes but you never write it anywhere public
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's never transmitted to a server
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> thats true
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially not to a teeworlds server, which are very easy to fake
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyways I still need to iron out many things and it helps to discuss it with people
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> :)
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> by the way, how are you gonna handle situation when 2 brothers play on the same computer
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How often does this happen anyways? Just an account selection in settings I guess
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ah, acc selection does the job indeed
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> what about a /login ? xd
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What about it?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you have certificate based authentication no need for a command. Ifyou are using it to send passwords you are sending them out in plain text which opens them up to pishing and allows for bad passwords which gets people hacked
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> multiple accounts for one device should definitely be a thing
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not that hard to make that happen after we have a system in place 😃
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Hu yeah k
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sowwy i always forget how to test a pullrequest?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what was the command to locally merge any pr so that i can compile and test it?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> found it c:
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> yo guys
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> i showed teeworlds to my friend yesterday.
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> he downloaded the ddnet client
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> but his cursor (the orange arrow) is not moving
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `status` from fifo doesn't show addrs... thanks obama
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> what is the solution for this problem?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> issue*
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe try borderless or fullscreen
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds networking really craps out with random data
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> but how do he play switch to borderless if his cursor is not moving?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> settings file
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @sznekszi vanilla client works? inp_mouseold 1
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (f1)
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> yes. the vanilla client is work.
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> but on vanilla client he cant connect to any server.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like lots of problems 😄
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> yep
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> like.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> the servers are showing
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @sznekszi no on vanilla you should look at filters
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> i know.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> And turn gamemodes on/off idunno
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> i know.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> we already do that
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and turn off software firewall
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> but he cant CONNECT to any server
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> okay.
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and check if other udp games work
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sznekszi> sure
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ey i already tried to help him
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> The problem is that he doesn't have appdata/Teeworlds
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> So no settings_ddnet.txt
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> but i sux so idk
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like missing file permissions
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try running as admin to see if that's it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Nani the fuck how i didn't think about that
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gigi7187> GQNHC-P3VGB-QECZ2
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @sznekszi TRY

22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> btw it would be nice to have the "controls" windows showing the actual keys and not the qwerty version
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> no cause u need to know what enter in f1 , so showing qwerty version that F1 use is fine imo
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, I might add a http server to ddnet 🤔
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> What do you mean "what enter in f1" ? In my controls, show all is set to "semicolon", on my keyboard it's "m" and when i press "m" in f1 i get "m"
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i mean f1 doesn't use qwerty
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> When i wanna bind keys like $ i go to controls and bind it to a random action to know how it's called u know ?
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> Yeah i do that too
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> If u have an azerty i guess u french ?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> yup
