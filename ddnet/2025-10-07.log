05:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> @totar why does your status bar implementation have such a short scheme length limit? adding more spaces was the main way to fine tune spacing
05:04 < bridge_> <totar> what
05:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> don't know how i can make it any simpler for you
05:04 < bridge_> <totar> you can open a pr
05:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> also can't seem to put it at the top of the screen instead of the bottom, at least through the UI
05:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> cant remember if i finished that
05:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> you need to reset text color too

05:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> debatably that's a bug of the chat component and not the status bar tho
05:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> and i dont know if it was there in my implementation or not
06:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning
06:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> gm
09:03 < bridge_> <Teero> I know ;(
09:05 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: surprisingly it wasn't hard to add the check, the hardest part was to compile the program xddd
09:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Chill bro, just bcs you poor and your life sucks doesn't mean you have to kys.
09:45 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: you are such a pro! What now? You gonna pr to llvm?
09:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I did open a pr, but I need to make changes to release notes and probably add some tests
09:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/162160
09:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oh nice
09:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> So in 2030 we can add it to CI 🚀
09:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> milkey is so sick
09:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> 😬
09:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it's two e`s btw
09:47 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> catto and two T
09:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I like how catto sounds, it's my second username now\
09:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I like how catto sounds, it's my second username now
09:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Pog
09:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You know how i feel
09:51 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Jupey
09:52 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yapstar
09:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yapstar has smth
09:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Arab version
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Should I buy overpriced SSD, bcs mine is always full
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> !roll 0 1
10:00 < chillerbot1234> 1
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nice
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Who needs money anyway
10:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Why buy overpriced ssd and not normal priced ssd? 😕
10:20 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Because overpriced ssd has more storage
10:34 < bridge_> <melon> its so scary seeing LLVM having 5K+ PR's, with the oldest one having.. 507 comments from 2023
10:35 < bridge_> <melon> :ChooChoo:

10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Bcs I cannot predict when market prices will be normal again 🫠
10:42 < bridge_> <learath2> I didn't know there was a shortage
10:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I mean it's defs not like with GPUs. But price per gb is not falling since years, so you have to either get good deal or live with 3 years old hardware for same price as when they released. The new models are very overpriced tho
10:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Not like the older ssds were bad tbh. You can also look into spinning rust for more bulk storage
10:54 < bridge_> <learath2> I also have 2 samsung qvo ssds, not great write performance but perfectly fine for storing games e.g.

13:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yay i can unlock leratos phone with touch id now
13:42 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Can anyone explain why both `Localize` and `Localizable` exist? Why is `Localize` not enough? :thonk:
13:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** rosbit mentioned it recently i forgor
13:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think something about the script
13:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if it doesnt take a fixed string but a var
13:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** otherwise the pyson script that generates the lang files gets confused or sumsin like that
13:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> aah
13:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> fair
13:46 < bridge_> <ChillerDragon> 19.6 🚀
13:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> does pyson script add translations from `Localize` if both arguments are string literals?
13:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
13:50 < bridge_> <sqwinix> hi guys
13:50 < bridge_> <DDNet> Hellou :3
13:52 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** everytime i get this bitsh `libfakeroot internal error: payload not recognized!` and everytime i ignore it xd
13:54 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Guys, can you explain what a community token is? And what it will do?
13:55 < bridge_> <learath2> It will let communities manage their own communities, as in what servers are part of the community etc
13:55 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Oh, good.
13:56 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I wonder when they'll give permission for other communities to join the community list
13:59 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Stop, are you new admin?
13:59 < bridge_> <sqwinix> or I am stupid
13:59 < bridge_> <Teero> ???
13:59 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> he's new here
14:00 < bridge_> <Teero> yea
14:00 < bridge_> <learath2> I have been an admin for maybe 10 years now 😛

14:04 < bridge_> <Teero> sadly there are backupos
14:04 < bridge_> <Teero> sadly there are backups
14:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** we can just ask ryo to maintain the backups
14:06 < bridge_> <Teero> you mean to un-maintain the backups?
14:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hrhrhrhr
14:12 < bridge_> <jxsl13> haters D:
14:12 < bridge_> <melon> so rude
14:13 < bridge_> <Teero> no, i mean he should accidentally un-maintain the backups when chiller clears the db so we can drop all backwards compat = ddnet 2.0
14:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** uhm @milkeeycat
14:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i need u xd
14:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> to debug some bug? xd
14:37 < bridge_> <Teero> romantically
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yes ._.
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u in?
14:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> im not interested romantically, sorry
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** nono
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** bug
14:37 < bridge_> <Teero> xD
14:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> xd
14:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** korb
14:38 < bridge_> <Teero> can i help too? (romantically)
14:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** nice
14:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** okay im just gonna dump it
14:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i was browsing this pcap https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-traffic-dumps/blob/master/dumps/075_tw_tinycave_other_player_disconnect/075_tw_tinycave_other_player_disconnect.pcap
14:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> wtf is korb
14:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** a basket
14:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its a german saying for being rejected romantically
14:39 < bridge_> <Teero> btw i just hit 10m tps :)
14:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** gaming
14:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** at packet number 50 i get confused
14:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or at 49 to be precise
14:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** in packet 50 the server sent a snap_single with tick 8646
14:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** correction with tick 8642
14:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** because 8646 - 4 is 8642
14:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** packet 50 snap_single was sent with tick 8646 and delta tick 4 so we need to sub the 4 to get the actual tick we delta against
14:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so far so basic and i already got it wrong xd
14:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** anyways
14:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that still is fair because in packet 49 the client acknowledged snap 8642
14:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** now my question is: why?
14:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** why did the client acknowledge snap with tick 8642
14:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i do not see the server sending it
14:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** in packet 48 the server sent snap 8644-4 so 8640
14:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and 8640 is not the same as 8642
14:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh
14:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hm the server send tick 8642 in packet 46
14:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i confused the tick types i think
14:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the client should store at the raw tick being sent not the delta obviously
14:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** nvm got it
14:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> You're welcome xd
14:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thank
14:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yo @milkeeycat u live in ukraine right?
14:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> yup
14:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i hope its not somehow insensitive to ask
14:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but is it dangerous?
14:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It's mostly fine where I live, sometimes there're drones and planes at night which keep me from sleep -.-
14:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** Okay nice to hear "mostly fine"
14:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the drone thing must suck
14:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i had a gigantic UFO above my house yesterday at 2AM it was just hovering and flying circles that was hella loud and scary
14:55 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat did you ever consider leaving the country? just to be safe?
14:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I don't have where to go :p
14:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** I see, you can always crash my couch :3 
14:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> xd

15:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> What happened here? The auto-merge was disabled, but then it merged the old commit anyway?
15:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon when did https://github.com/others contribute to ddnet?
15:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Updating the "others" should be done completely. If you only add some, it becomes complicated to keep them in the order that they contributed.
15:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ono credits bug on master
15:37 < bridge_> <pioooooo> Race condition ig
15:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> The change to others wasn't merged into master
15:37 < bridge_> <kebscs> 19.5 already?
15:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 19.6
15:38 < bridge_> <Teero> 20.0 soon :o
15:38 < bridge_> <kebscs> Idk if we had any big feature this patch

15:38 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Party like it's 19.99
15:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero omagwad feature shamer
15:39 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Should make all the tees in the skin menu do the same
15:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** should let them auto path find through the menu using AI
15:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** like the client whos name shall not be named menu
15:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** old rule 7 client by meskalin

15:43 < bridge_> <Teero> only works via wine though
15:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** linux L
15:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** bad support for cheat clients
15:43 < bridge_> <Teero> isn't it autobanned on every ddnet server anyways? xd
15:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** legends say rqza never started cheating only because he is on macos
15:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** might be autobanned ye
15:44 < bridge_> <Teero> XDDDDD
15:44 < bridge_> <Teero> rqza is on macos?? XD
15:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** onmg
15:44 < bridge_> <Teero> noby is on mac too tho
15:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he is on macos longer than i play the game
15:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** noby had to develop own macos only cheats
15:45 < bridge_> <Teero> xD
15:45 < bridge_> <Teero> dw all my cheats are cross platform
15:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> does it support edos?
15:46 < bridge_> <manikoo> send

17:33 < chillerbot1234> Elo @melon I just wanted to remind you that: make learath tipsy and eepy, steal laptop and forcefully remove 0.7
17:34 < bridge_> <melon> :topkekMate:  ty
17:34 < chillerbot1234> Elo @melon I just wanted to remind you that: steal learath's beer until he leaks passphrase
17:34 < bridge_> <melon> :baked:
17:40 < bridge_> <melon> ```
17:40 < bridge_> <melon> error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects
17:40 < bridge_> <melon> error: Error building trees
17:40 < bridge_> <melon> ```
17:40 < bridge_> <melon> 
17:40 < bridge_> <melon> i hate git.
17:41 < bridge_> <cutetabby> i have connection related question in #questions, wanted to repost here
17:43 < bridge_> <learath2> I messed with your permissions because you were trying to steal my passphrase
17:43 < bridge_> <melon> i was || <- THIS close tho!
17:43 < ChillerDragon> cutetabby when repost
17:44 < bridge_> <melon> tabby — 17:38
17:44 < bridge_> <melon> is there a domain i can exclude from my cloudflare warp?
17:44 < bridge_> <melon> or how would i go about excluding ddnet from it?
17:44 < ChillerDragon> L ddnet vpn filter
17:45 < bridge_> <learath2> L dragon
17:45 < ChillerDragon> no!
17:45 < ChillerDragon> on dragon server you can use cloudflare warp actually!
17:47 < ChillerDragon> isnt cloudflare warp a scam anyways? no way it can actually improve the ddnet connection
17:47 < bridge_> <cutetabby> my isp takes 120ms to go through one specific tunnel for one specific ip, that i want to connect to while also connecting to ddnet
17:48 < bridge_> <cutetabby> with warp it takes 2ms
17:49 < ChillerDragon> sounds sus
17:50 < ChillerDragon> what is this ip you also want to connect to?
17:50 < bridge_> <cutetabby> 172.65.189.167

17:56 < bridge_> <Teero> `insufficient permission` is my favorite error xdd
17:56 < bridge_> <Teero> i don't know where i got it from but i always hear a void in my head saying `insufficient permission` every time i see it
17:57 < bridge_> <melon> teamspeak? xd
18:00 < bridge_> <Teero> YES
18:22 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> can i update turkish translation now? or would it be easier if i update after 11043 get merged?
18:23 < bridge_> <manikoo> do it now so fiqocus will not be alone
18:23 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> alright monika!
18:24 < bridge_> <manikoo> (TBH IDK WHATS BETTER)
18:25 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> oh now i think it doesnt matter if i wait for 11043 or not
18:26 < bridge_> <vahemaaa> deen can merge it whenever he want
18:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> 11043 will be merged soon. You can base your git branch on those changes already.
18:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I have a very important question
18:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat ye
18:36 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> #11043
18:36 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/11043
18:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im single and looking yes @milkeeycat 
18:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> imagine you have a global constexpr variable and you had a check which would check its casing, would it be named `ConstexprGlobalVariableCase` or `GlobalConstexprVariableCase`? xd
18:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** making these decisions on clang level is nuts
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat wtf is a constexpr variable btw?
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** constexpr is const
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so it can never change
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and variable
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** means it can vary
18:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability/identifier-naming.html#cmdoption-arg-ConstexprVariableCase
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wdym const variableß??? xd
18:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> there's such a check already xd
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** sounds troll
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** is it const
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or is it variable
18:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> constexpr is const
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so
18:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how is variable
18:39 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> someone called a check for constexprs  `ConstexprVariableCase` ._.
18:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yeye i am messing with you
18:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** someone pointed that out to me once and i found it hilarious
18:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that constant variable makes no sense
18:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** bro idk such a hard question
18:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u gotta be consistent with the other stuff
18:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but not sure if there is something comparable
18:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> some languages use var and const var, some use var and val
18:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> some languages use var and const var, some use var and val(ue)
18:40 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> some languages use var and const var, some use var and val(ue)/const
18:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im sure there are some clang ppl u can ping that will be able to decide smarter than me
18:41 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I'll flip a coin, if reviews won't like, I'll change it
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so random
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** pls also mention that you are not sure about it
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so it doesnt slip through review
18:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** someone probably has a educated strong opinion about it
18:42 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> if it will get merged, he will have to live with my opinion as well :p
18:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** imo it should be `GlobalConstexprVariableCase`
18:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** because there is already `GlobalConstantCase`
18:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so global before const
18:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and constexpr is same as const
18:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** duh
18:44 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I was just looking at `GlobalConstantCase` xd
18:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and wat do u think?
18:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but then shouldn't it be `GlobalConstexprCase`? ._.
18:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> naming is hard 😬
18:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh 
18:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
18:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea probably
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no ConstantVariable case whatsoever
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** HAH
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** because
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u know
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its either variable or constant xd
18:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hrhrhrhhrhhr
18:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** Now i am quite happy with `GlobalConstexprCase` actually
18:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** just copy paste all `Constant` case cases and replace `Constant` with `Constexpr` and its crisply clean consistent 
18:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ~~`ConstexprVariableCase`~~ xd
18:53 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Hi guys
18:53 < bridge_> <DDNet> Hellou :3
18:54 < bridge_> <sqwinix> How can I import the DDNET client into a browser? Is it even possible? I just saw TeeWorlds in the browser and thought about it
19:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can follow the instructions in the README to build the client to WASM via Emscripten. You can't join any online servers though. You also need to build a server with websocket support, as none of the public servers have it enabled.
19:34 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Ah, ok. Thanks
20:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: Can you review #11002? I need it for #10588

20:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> Not sure why git shows the difference like that. On #11049 it shows an empty difference for the merge.

20:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> unnormalized utf?
20:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> unnormalized utf8?
20:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's a whitespace-only change according to github
20:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> weird

20:42 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I don't understand
20:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> look at the `status` command
20:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> look at the `status` rcon command
20:42 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Server()->ClientAddr
20:42 < bridge_> <sqwinix> ?

22:19 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you know any amd64 instruction which has more than one explicit output?
22:19 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Guys, how do I do sleep correctly? Or can I use os_sleep(10000);
22:20 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I didn't find any functions with Sleep
22:20 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Guys, how do I do sleep correctly? Or can I use os_sleep();
22:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> You should rarely need the equivalent of sleep. What problem are you trying to solve?
22:21 < bridge_> <learath2> How would you define “explicit”?
22:21 < bridge_> <learath2> - Arithmetic instructions also “output” to flags
22:21 < bridge_> <learath2> - One operand IMUL outputs to two registers
22:22 < bridge_> <learath2> How would you define “explicit”?
22:22 < bridge_> <learath2> - Arithmetic instructions also “output” to flags
22:22 < bridge_> <learath2> - One operand IMUL/MUL outputs to two registers
22:22 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Well, I want to ban certain cheat versions, and I need a sleep delay before the ban.
22:23 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you count ticks
22:23 < bridge_> <robyt3> Sleeping would be very bad, that would stop your entire server. On the server-side, you usually store in how many ticks you want to perform an action.
22:24 < bridge_> <sqwinix> Okay, thank you
22:24 < bridge_> <Teero> you want to stop your entire server? xd
22:24 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> when you provide where to put the output I think, for example in `add rax, r15` the result will be stored in `rax` but `idiv r15` will store results i n `rax` and `rdx` which weren't provided in the instruction(so `idiv` doesn't count)
22:24 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I'm a beginner, I just started learning C yesterday.
22:24 < bridge_> <sqwinix> I'm a beginner, I just started learning C/C++ yesterday.
22:25 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the server is an endless loop
22:25 < bridge_> <melon> there is `time_get()` which we use for that, or you could use `std::chrono`
22:25 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and you are somewhere in that loop
22:25 < bridge_> <learath2> There aren’t any that I can think of. Maybe something esoteric in the vector extensions
22:25 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and sleep halts that loop, which is bad
22:26 < bridge_> <sqwinix> thank you melon 🍭
22:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think it used to be expensive to call `time_get` often, so it's also cached for each tick
22:27 < bridge_> <melon> i thought time_get just uses std::chrono under the hood tbh
22:27 < bridge_> <melon> xd
22:27 < bridge_> <learath2> Don’t think you could even encode such an instruction afaict
22:27 < bridge_> <melon> i thought time_get just uses std::chrono under the hood tbh (oh yeah it does.)
22:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> It used to call platform-specific functions
22:28 < bridge_> <Teero> xdd i was benchmarking 1s of gameplay with my physics for some time, until the check for time became the bottleneck XD
22:28 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Okay, that's good 😬 Then my instruction selector tool will work only with instructions which have one "explicit" output
22:32 < bridge_> <learath2> Found one, BMI2 extension introduced `MULX` which has 2 explicit destinations 😄
22:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Encoded as a vector instruction, yeah I’m not too familiar with how the VEX flag works
22:41 < bridge_> <learath2> Good news though looking through the >2 operand instructions I couldn’t spot any other that uses 2 explicit outputs 😄
22:41 < bridge_> <learath2> So have fun reorganizing your code to accommodate a single instruction from an extension
22:57 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oof not sure
23:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Wait …
23:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Here it is xd https://youtu.be/Fkopj_BsV0w @vahemaaa
23:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's still in mine. not sure exactly what it is that depends on it still, i think it's teamspeak for me
23:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> i just allow for now. don't target me pls :justatest:
23:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> the web engine component being bound to the Qt version has always seemed like a problem to me
23:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> i do not vouch for Qt web engine
23:18 < bridge_> <melon> i dont even remember why i had it in the first place
23:18 < bridge_> <melon> probably because i tried out that QtEditor you use(d)
23:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> Qt Creator is definitely Qt6 by now
23:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> the vulnerability comes from Qt 5 as a whole being unmaintained
23:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> > Starting with 5.15 LTS, LTS releases are available only to the commercial license holders. For open source users, such LTS releases are available as regular releases only,[6] thus 5.15 is now in the commercial-only LTS phase. Qt 5.12 LTS was the last Qt version to offer an offline installer.[7] As of August 2024, Qt 6.8 is the next LTS version. You can read more about Qt releases in Qt's documentation.
