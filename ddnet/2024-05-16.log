00:23 < bridge> <_gwendal> fucking mutexs :ouch:
00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> well that’s not a C thing
00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a fundamental multithreading thing
00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> you can write code to avoid the use of locks/mutexes
01:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `rayon` makes that easy in rust 🙂
03:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That is also just one button click

04:29 < bridge> <louis> attempt #1 of a vae ddnet map generator 😭
04:30 < bridge> <louis> diffusion approach would probably be smarter
07:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> look epic tho
07:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> looks epic tho
09:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder
09:30 < bridge> <totar> What kinds of maps are you trying to make?
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> it's a little annoying how common `curl | sh` installers have become instead of shipping a proper package. I keep having to audit scripts
10:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Packaging is pain, so people tend to ship their installers this way 😄
10:49 < bridge> <avolicious> It just works
10:49 < bridge> <avolicious> It just works (mostly)
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> It works very well but it sends shivers down experienced peoples spines 😄
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> I may have made a typo in the url, someone may have sent me a malicious url to the thing I'm downloading
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> The thing might be sending a different script depending on the user agent, so if I fetch it with firefox I get a nice clean script, but when curl does it it's not clean
10:51 < bridge> <avolicious> Thats why some installers already provide: `curl -sL URL | sha256sum`
10:51 < bridge> <avolicious> they give you the proper instruction with the already filled in sha checksum. Or you can get it from the latest release
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not so important in my threat model. I'm going to run these people's software anyway
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've actually not found a thing that didn't have an AUR package
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've actually not found a thing that didn't have at least an AUR package
10:52 < bridge> <learath2> I meant the malicious website I ended up on due to my mistake or a malicious link
10:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. but then a .tar.gz would not be better than the `curl | sh`
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> I would rather they package normally like we've been doing for what now 3 decades?
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> I always fetch the script, inspect it, then run it with sh myself
10:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's "normally" here?
10:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it's in the original repos, yea, I agree, that's better
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> Go through the proper channels, put it in the repos
10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> everything else seems roughly equivalent to me
10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (i.e. I don't find `curl | sh` to be worth complaining about more than providing a direct binary download)
10:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess the problem comes from the fact that people want to use debian but also want to use up-to-date software for some reasaon
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/312681.html
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     rust's avoidance of shared mutable state has deep consequences; when we formally verify programs in Rust we can use FOL and avoid separation logic since the type system protects us from mutable aliasing, while this is not true in caml despite being 'functional'

12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> I was just about to send you this yesterday, then I got into an argument with someone, then I forgor
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240612656730079282/Screenshot_2024-04-27-11-42-47-959.png?ex=66473212&is=6645e092&hm=bee37102ff0514eb7cd0b8fd580cd1d9eaaf8ce385d0f0b8c5a2974e0d1336a3&
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> That's literally how I imagine ryo
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol no
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> You don't understand ryo at all
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a gym bro
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, he is big buff manly man, no programmer socks, no cat ears
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok not that buff yet
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> shh
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but getting there
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> Would be funnier if he did both XD
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> Now that would be hilarious
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would love some rust socks tho
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> my birthday is on the 29th
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:34 < bridge> <teero777> Haha do cat ears and socks video on the Himalayas while playing tw and send it to chillerdragon for tw in 2024
12:34 < zuhaitz> I have 101% CPU ussage in DDNET Steam, GNU Linux Ubuntu 24.04 (also happened in 22.04), GNOME Shell.  Intel i7-10750H (12) @ 5.000GHz  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile 
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know 101% means just 1 core is used
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> Is it with the default settings?
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and why u spam this
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> Limit your fps in the graphics settings. That should only affect gpu but still
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have 24000% cpu usage while compiling
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have 2400% cpu usage while compiling
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok maybe gnome cpu thing 100% means 100 xD
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> j$(nproc) xd ofc you're gonna use everything
12:35 < bridge> <peter0x44> htop goes over 100% for one core for me sometimes
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but probs not cuz ddnet doesnt use all cores
12:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> When I'm compiling
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc
12:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> I don't know how or why it gets that number
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> boost
12:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> I mean, in the display at the top with the usage for each core
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> turbo maybe
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
12:42 < bridge> <gumbatw> that is good, one core should be maxed out for max fps
12:47 < zuhaitz> I have 101% CPU ussage in DDNET Steam, GNU Linux Ubuntu 24.04 (also happened in 22.04), GNOME Shell.  Intel i7-10750H (12) @ 5.000GHz  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile 
12:47 <@heinrich5991> zuhaitz: please stop spamming
12:47 < zuhaitz> heinrich5991: spamming?
12:47 < bridge> <gumbatw> and? this is good for ur performance if one core is maxed out
12:47 < zuhaitz> heinrich5991: bridge is writing 100 lines in a minute and I am spamming? xD
12:48 <@heinrich5991> zuhaitz: yes, you posted the same message three times already
12:48 < zuhaitz> heinrich5991: And bridge wrote 100 lines per minute.
12:48 <@heinrich5991> the bridge is bridging this channel to discord

13:52 <+bridge> <learath2> LOL
13:52 <+bridge> <learath2> not the truenas thing, the guy ignoring heinrich
13:53 <+bridge> <learath2> Can someone go to irc and tell him that the bridge was trying to help him
13:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (I kicked them and set the channel +m, having no ability to communicate with them anymore)
13:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (resulting in insults via DM, obviously)
14:07 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 14:06 Ignoring ALL from heinrich5991
14:07 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> Done.
16:05 <+bridge> <devinci24> Does someone know if there is a way to keep seing someone's time after putting them into spectator? Withouth modifying client code.
16:05 <+bridge> <devinci24> 
16:05 <+bridge> <devinci24> With normal behaviour the names go under the "spectator" category but I would like to avoid that, is it possible?
16:06 <+bridge> <zhn> as player?
16:06 <+bridge> <zhn> isnt there '/time <name>'
16:06 <+bridge> <devinci24> sry, I meant to see their times whent tabbing
16:07 <+bridge> <meloƞ> what you basically want is to remove the "spectator" tab and just keep everyone listed in the scoreboard? - i dont see why not
16:07 <+bridge> <meloƞ> what you basically want is to remove/disable the "spectator" tab and just keep everyone listed in the scoreboard? - i dont see why not
16:07 <+bridge> <devinci24> Ig yeah, can I do that server side?
16:08 <+bridge> <learath2> For everyone else, you can
16:08 <+bridge> <learath2> For the person in spec, you can't
16:09 <+bridge> <zhn> you can use another client that has verbose spec tab
16:09 <+bridge> <devinci24> What does that mean?
16:09 <+bridge> <devinci24> That basically I can't see the time of someone who is spectating?
16:09 <+bridge> <learath2> You can just snap the spec'd tee somewhere far far away
16:10 <+bridge> <learath2> For everyone else, if you snap it as if they are still ingame, it should show up in scoreboard
16:10 <+bridge> <learath2> But you cant do the same thing for the tee thats in spec himself. He has to be really in spec to have freeview
16:11 <+bridge> <learath2> Atleast that's how I remember that piece of code
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we should maybe implement a proper spec-while-playing mode
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> where we don't have to tell the client that they're spectating
16:12 <+bridge> <learath2> Well we don't have a use for it but if you can imagine some uses for it we can consider it
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but rather the client informs the server that it's currently interested in seeing the following x,y,width,height rect
16:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> better user experience by not requiring a roundtrip for starting the spec-while-playing
16:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ("/pause")
16:13 <+bridge> <learath2> Hm, is it not seamless now UX wise? It's just protocolwise a little hacky
16:14 <+bridge> <learath2> But we definitely can streamline it, we define the protocol
16:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not seamless currently
16:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we wait for the server to tell us that we're spectating
16:19 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, that can arrive pretty slow depending on ping
16:19 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, that might be a valuable thing to add
16:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (and it would also make the protocol better ^^)
16:28 <+bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 what are you up to nowadays btw? Do you work?
16:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the rest is probably "prefer not to state in a public channel"
16:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, cool. A friend asked me and I was like hm, I think he is still doing something academia
16:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 does ur friend ask about us here
16:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :KannaSip:
16:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Not that one. Another one does ask me why on earth your company does anything related to compilers at all 😄
16:37 <+bridge> <learath2> That one doesn't understand anything about what we do here either. It baffles him that we are spending time contributing to something that we refuse to monetize
16:44 <+bridge> <learath2> Oh I found a cute rust crate https://crates.io/crates/o2o
16:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> opt-in structural typing?
16:48 <+bridge> <learath2> I don't think I've heard of this term before "structural typing"
16:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, yep sounds like it
16:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, at my new job I'm mapping lots of structs to eachother. I use lots of reflection for it. Was curious how one would solve a similar problem in Rust
16:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what kind of job do you have?
17:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just reinstall windows at this point, no way it's so broken
17:04 <+bridge> <learath2> Backend engineering. I'm both helping design and implementing a new backend. We interact with a lot of external apis and we have internal ones, structs with many fields that need to be mapped to eachother
17:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hi which lang do u use
17:05 <+bridge> <learath2> Go. Can't use the original ones from the external apis because they need to be normalised (naming typing) and we don't want our internal api to rely on an externality
17:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc
17:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u like it?
17:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the language and the job
17:07 <+bridge> <learath2> Mh, the language I'm kinda enjoying. I did miss having a nice to work with gc language. The job is a little mundane imo, nothing novel, just lots of plumbing work as I like to call it
17:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are you at least rich now?
17:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> richer than rich
17:07 <+bridge> <learath2> Go is very much C like but has the niceties of a modern language and a gc to help write decently performing code quickly
17:08 <+bridge> <learath2> They pay me almost nothing as I'm technically an intern 😄
17:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
17:08 <+bridge> <learath2> Honestly they are getting an amazing deal. Below minimum wage intern doing the work of an entire developer
17:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> classic
17:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Tbf I don't think they expect straight out of uni interns to be of any use normally. Which is what my cv looks like
17:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but normally after uni u get paid properly
17:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i've never heard of doing interns after uni
17:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u do interns during uni already
17:10 <+bridge> <meloƞ> was gonna say, you expect to be paid a "normal" salary atleast after uni
17:10 <+bridge> <learath2> When you do none during uni like myself you have to settle for whatever
17:10 <+bridge> <meloƞ> meh atleast you get experience and can build up your cv a bit
17:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on my uni it was part of the modules already
17:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u couldn't not do interns xd
17:11 <+bridge> <learath2> Perhaps I could find something better if I looked more carefully. But finding someone to take a leap on you. With an empty cv is not that easy
17:11 <+bridge> <learath2> At my uni it's either 2 electives or an internship. I did 2 electives
17:11 <+bridge> <meloƞ> german uni go stronk
17:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah, tbh it doesn't matter.. just don't do an intern for 2 months+
17:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at some point they either hire u or you leave
17:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or it's open source 😏
17:12 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I'm doing 3 months and they have already indicated that they might be interested in hiring me but idk. The job might be a little mundane for my taste
17:13 <+bridge> <learath2> If they offer a stupid good salary, I'll take it but I doubt it. So I'll look for something else next
17:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> are they amazed of u?
17:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my first employer for the internship was
17:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> as i built their entire app
17:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which they failed to market
17:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but i did my job
17:14 <+bridge> <learath2> Idk, he did indicate that he expected me to not be capable at all 😄
17:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they offered me part time 4h day for like 500 month iirc
17:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> now im at 2600 kek
17:16 <+bridge> <meloƞ> from my experience, every place i ever applied to, immediatly offered to hire me simply because i seemed "interested in working with the company"
17:16 <+bridge> <learath2> I've been eyeing think-cell to apply to. They seem to have a really interesting job and they are pretty much always hiring more C++ devs
17:16 <+bridge> <meloƞ> from my experience, every place i ever applied to, immediatly offered to hire me simply because i seemed "interested in working with the company" - and its not like i'm that good at what i do - its just that i am trying to fit in :D
17:16 <+bridge> <learath2> Their product itself seems meh, but the work they have to do and how low level they go is right up my alley
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> after 1 months latest you should ask for a job
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3 months is redicilous
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u talked here every other day about capitalism is shit and now you let yourself to be abused so heavily
17:18 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm a person of integrity. I said I'll do 3 months. I'll do 3 months
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but they are not persons of integrity
17:18 <+bridge> <meloƞ> you usually ask for the job the second they dont need a second guy overlooking what you do - the second you're capable of working alone you should be paid for what you give :D
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they say they hire, they wont
17:18 <+bridge> <learath2> It's not abuse as I see it though. I get a CV entry and some pocket money for work that lets me do lots of learning on the job
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u have a finished uni cert
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u should get at least 2.5k € netto
17:19 <+bridge> <learath2> If they say they hire, they have to
17:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only if it's on paper
17:20 <+bridge> <learath2> There is one more aspect of this that I won't talk about. But they do have to hire me if they say they will
17:20 <+bridge> <meloƞ> there are verbal contracts, but the second they give you an exact number of pay - you should request to get that on paper
17:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd very seriously not trust that
17:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u underestimate how greedy these ppl can be
17:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure there are also good ones
17:21 <+bridge> <learath2> Heh, I wish it was that easy. I did think it was that easy
17:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but some would take it very far
17:21 <+bridge> <meloƞ> when i finished my apprenticeship as a **inhales** precision mechanic mechanical engineer i had an entry pay of 2.8K netto
17:21 <+bridge> <meloƞ> when i finished my apprenticeship as a **inhales** precision mechanic mechanical engineer i had an entry pay of 2.8K netto, and the apprenticeship was disappointingly easy
17:22 <+bridge> <meloƞ> when i finished my apprenticeship as a **inhales** precision mechanic in mechanical engineering i had an entry pay of 2.8K netto, and the apprenticeship was disappointingly easy
17:22 <+bridge> <learath2> Anyway. I'm not exactly worried about finding something else. I just want to find something I enjoy a little more
17:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well always depends on the current market. but as dev it should be rather ez
17:22 <+bridge> <learath2> Until then I can do this internship and relax
17:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure
17:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the good thing about interns is u can take them very unserious
17:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u dont plan to stay
17:22 <+bridge> <meloƞ> or serious - depending on if you're interesting in staying
17:22 <+bridge> <meloƞ> or serious - depending on if you're interested in staying
17:22 <+bridge> <learath2> I don't really half ass anything tbf. It's a personality defect of mine
17:23 <+bridge> <learath2> I'll rewrite it 8 times if need be. It'll be done properly or not done. It's not an amazing trait in a professional setting
17:25 <+bridge> <learath2> It's also the reason the sixup patch still bothers me to this day
17:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is part of a different problem
17:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> supporting smth dead
17:26 <+bridge> <teero777> yea sometimes that's very annoying. like if someone writes bad code and you know you could do it better but you're not *allowed* to or it would just confuse the other person and you don't have enough stamina to explain to them why it is bad what they are doing and how they can do it better. it's very frustrating
17:26 <+bridge> <learath2> That aswell, but it was during that random burst of activity in vanilla, so I wasn't thinking of that back when I implemented it
17:27 <+bridge> <learath2> The way we hooked in everywhere is definitely what annoyed me 😄
17:27 <+bridge> <learath2> I did atleast get to properly decode the game messages, so I'm happy about that part
17:29 <+bridge> <learath2> My very first commit was like 500 lines of just cleaning stuff up 😄 working in a dirty codebase also bothers me
17:36 <+bridge> <louis> i'm just using the entire ddnet map database
18:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> c++ is dirty thats why so many rust rewrite is exist /s :gigachad:
18:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tbh companies want a balance of good code and get things done mindset I guess
18:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so u cant always do it perfect due to time
18:27 <+bridge> <learath2> Exactly, so I'm not a great candidate to be an employee
18:57 <+bridge> <chairn> you can still be a public servant or a soldier 😛
18:57 <+bridge> <peter0x44> the university degree just to end up like that
18:57 <+bridge> <peter0x44> brutal
18:57 <+bridge> <peter0x44> and I don't want the university that door is closed to me always
18:58 <+bridge> <peter0x44> brutal
18:58 <+bridge> <peter0x44> and if don't want the university that door is closed to me always

21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hi Anwender
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how r u
21:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hi answender
22:20 <+bridge> <mazty> why when i use LinesDraw for draw a line in my code, just i can saw the line if i dont have entities
22:20 <+bridge> <mazty> help
22:21 <+bridge> <mazty> why when i use LinesDraw for draw a line in my code, just i can saw the line if i dont have turned entities
22:21 <+bridge> <totar> what method to make them?
22:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u forget to map screen properly?
22:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also screenshots would help
22:28 <+bridge> <louis> hm?
22:28 <+bridge> <louis> im quite a novice the architecture is VAE based
22:28 <+bridge> <mazty> Mapscreentoinferface?
22:28 <+bridge> <totar> this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder
22:28 <+bridge> <louis> pretty basic vae with conv and convtranspose layers
22:28 <+bridge> <mazty> Mapscreentointerface?
22:28 <+bridge> <louis> yes
22:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:28 <+bridge> <mazty> yes
22:28 <+bridge> <mazty> i have it
22:29 <+bridge> <louis> quite poor performance with basic architecture, i might work a bit on this over summer
22:29 <+bridge> <louis> and maybe try different methods (looking at a gan mainly)
22:30 <+bridge> <totar> is diffusion too expensive to train?
22:30 <+bridge> <louis> could try that too but i'm not too knowledgeable
22:31 <+bridge> <louis> the data isn't huge so idt compute would be much of an issue
22:31 <+bridge> <totar> yeah
22:31 <+bridge> <louis> honestly using heinrich map database is probably a better idea
22:31 <+bridge> <totar> I would think diffusion would be a good choice
22:31 <+bridge> <totar> since you can get complex structure
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u show a screenshot of the line that works?
22:32 <+bridge> <louis> yeah i was thinking that earlier as well. i'll probably give it a shot
22:32 <+bridge> <totar> probably you don't texture clear
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty> i have
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty> i use this ```cpp
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     void Avoid::DrawLine(vec2 pos1, vec2 pos2, ColorRGBA color)
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty> {
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     Graphics()->TextureClear();
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     RenderTools()->MapScreenToInterface(m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Center.x, m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Center.y,m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom);
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     Graphics()->LinesBegin();
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     const IGraphics::CLineItem LineItem(pos1.x, pos1.y, pos2.x, pos2.y);
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     Graphics()->SetColor(color);
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     Graphics()->LinesDraw(&LineItem, 1);
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty>     Graphics()->LinesEnd();
22:33 <+bridge> <mazty> }```
22:33 <+bridge> <totar> idk
22:34 <+bridge> <mazty> i just can see the line if i use cl_overlay_entities 100

22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `MapScreenToInterface` seems to be for GUI code tho
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `MapScreenToGroup` would be for ingame
22:37 <+bridge> <mazty> ah
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and one where it's working?
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to see how it looks like potentially
22:37 <+bridge> <mazty> ah

22:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you call your code in players.cpp?
22:38 <+bridge> <mazty> a
22:40 <+bridge> <mazty> nop xD
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think ur stuff is rendered
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but behind the background
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my guess
22:40 <+bridge> <mazty> eyyy
22:40 <+bridge> <mazty> now works
22:40 <+bridge> <mazty> thxxx

22:52 <+bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks casually helping making bots lmao
22:53 <+bridge> <teero777> let's guess what the `Avoid` class could be doing :troll:
22:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well the tee hitbox is defs no quad :lol:
22:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe i should stop helping
