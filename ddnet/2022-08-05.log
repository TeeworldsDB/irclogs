00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sorry, forgot to paste the link üòÑ https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1004599596477054987
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe a cmake bug? I haven't seen this when cross-compiling
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you use the cmake toolchain file like this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/release/build.sh#L165
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but do i need openssl or some cross compiled lib as well?
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes, this is the call to cmake i use:
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `cmake -G Ninja -DDEV=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/mingw64.toolchain ..`
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they should be in ddnet-libs
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try without -DDEV=ON
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> same result üôÇ
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, if i comment some lines in CMakeLists it works
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> commenting this allow compilation <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/35280a7a2fad69e15486aa9cfd4240d757a6c495/CMakeLists.txt#L2999-L3001>
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and now obviously, my mingw gcc is too old for mutex üòÑ

04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which project?
04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> <https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter>
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004992518204690482/unknown.png
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also, when can there be a separate freeze skin and ninja skin?
08:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the new visual changes are nice, but it doesnt make sense if we keep a dark-dressed ninja tee to represent a frozen tee...
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and yeah some people are gonna say "well we cant use a single frozen skin to accommodate all tee skins"
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but a ninja skin is just objectively worse as it doesnt accommodate any tee skin differences either
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> on top of not making sense
08:25 <+ChillerDragon> ou yes pls replace ninja with ice cube
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> on one hand i really like the concept of ninja skin as freeze, it just feels at home
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> 
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> on the other this is kind of a funny idea anyways
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005007198193201162/unknown.png
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> cute
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> i need that
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel is that an actual skin? i wanna buy
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kaic> hii
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kaic> i'am worked in ddnet for 55 days
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> not yet, i just doodled it in 4 minutes
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> even this is better than black ninja (wtf this sounds racist)
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005009924897652806/unknown.png

09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> YES PLS ADD PETS
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tbh light ninja as freeze and dark ninja as weapon i can get used to
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> add it in ddrpg
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a new ddnet franchise game
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually id love tees to be like a franchise similar to mario yk
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thatd be awesome
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we could sell saddo plushies.. ‚ù§Ô∏è
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nouis plushie
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> :nouis:
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005011877035790347/PXL_20220121_224015095.jpg
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually ive had ideas of like a tw rpg game
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be very cool
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what would be the story?
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i didnt think that far üòÖ
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how about the tees meet the threes which are triangle shaped foes as opposed to the spherical shaped tees
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> reminds me of nepal flag üòÑ
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Threes and Fours
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Tees and Foes
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> just make a story similar to kirby + any isekai
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Explore and enjoy the ti.e with some plot twist
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> fits for tw
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> just make a story similar to kirby + any isekai
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Explore and enjoy the time with some plot twist
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> @louis i prefer ice blue over white and black
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> plushies!!!!!!!!!!

10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> While I agree with all these, I'm not sure what the point of code like this is. Not like you are changing any minds with it, nor does your project control any significant capital to make real change
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005025966013292574/unknown.png
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Answer of the project owner
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I agree with him, but these terms dont change anything about his livelihood is my point
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Of course you're right, it doesn't prevent a Russian from using this code.
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> <https://github.com/Tyrrrz/.github/blob/master/docs/why-so-political.md>
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Of course you're right, it doesn't prevent a Russian from using this code or doesn't stop the war
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> god i already hate this guy
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> like i get its for support and all but how is this going to not only change the war but whos using it? its kind of stupid that he expects us to use the code with an active mindset on the whole russia ordeal
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> "we did it boys, war is no more"
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> You just have to laugh and move on with your life. People don't even care about real licenses.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it was a huge project like sqlite3 I could see some use to it. It'd force big companies that use sqlite3 to basically say russia bad
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh yea good point
10:24 <+ChillerDragon> but which big corp use sqlite3? :troll:
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Most people think that if a code is open source, they can do whatever they want with it.
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> Which they usually also can
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> True. Hence the audacity of corporations like streamlabs basically stealing OBS
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> sqlite3 can be used if the site is not getting more than 150000+ hits per day.
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> I wonder if at some point github will search for code copyright violations like youtube does for music and video copyright violations
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> If you report a stolen code in a dmca thread on github, it will be removed.
10:27 <+ChillerDragon> Ah yea but nothing automated
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely not, the fact that their copilot is basically ignoring all licenses they probably don't care much about copyright violations
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> copyrighted code? how would thay work? your enum has the same name as nvideas?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> But you still can't prevent that person from using your code xd.
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 tru they would have to report them self :D 
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> copyrighted code? how would that work? your enum has the same name as nvideas?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Can github use my code to improve the copilot without me accepting something?
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> I think a certian amount of pattern and variable naming could be defined @Voxel i mean university always claim they got tech to detect students stealing code but maybe they just say that :D 
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> @Nora it does
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> weird
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel its also weird with music or video isnt it?
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> its blurry
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean with music its different because its more defined and disconnected. with code its all building blocks
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005030111311052881/unknown.png
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> Code is pretty defined too
10:31 <+ChillerDragon> Code might have same similar enum names and songs might have similar lyrics
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005030390249050242/unknown.png
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> üò®
10:32 <+ChillerDragon> I tried to use DMCA thingy on github once to take down a teeworlds bot repo :D but it didnt work because he dint violate copyright ... who would have seen that coming
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly most of copyright law is very much a grey area. Lawyers and governments always like to pretend it's very well defined. I guess the only thing that's consistent in copyright rulings is that the side with more money usually wins in the US
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> yea its a mess
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> but youtube kinda solved 14yo putting full adele song in their minecraft letsplay
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> same github could cover posting decompiled minecraft code to github (which they prolly do alr because they care about mc :D)
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Source engine has open source code on github
10:36 <+ChillerDragon> not sure if software licenses are more complex due so many different types and forks and shit
10:36 <+ChillerDragon> im sure lawyer jopstar could solve this in 100 lines of code 
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> to write perfect legal AI that reports software license violations
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Learath2 how is the 0.7 dissector coming along?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't made any progress
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it's nothing special to the dissector. I havent made any progress in anything
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you progressed in life üôÇ
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> old man 
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> progresstination this should be a word
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> no idea what it would mean tho
10:44 <+ChillerDragon> im also just ideling in irc bcs im too lazy to debug da fakin protocol
10:44 <+ChillerDragon> this channel is worse than tiktok
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm I guess if you take a very literal definition of progress, yes
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> time helps you to mature and think things through
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> when making songs open source? :trollge:
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what do you mean with that?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do you want to make a freeze skin? @Ravie  just turned the ninja skin white, but maybe you have an nicer idea
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @louis  you can test this build https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/actions/runs/2803132457

13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh voe.sx seems to be pretty annoying with its adds xD I tried to find a way to upload the videos, without using youtube :/ Does someone know a good alternative, with no adds, that is still fast and allows enough upload space
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Chillerdragons service xd
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> wot
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Opentube
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> wot about it xd
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> a
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> didnt read the prev message was too long
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> @c0d3d3v yea if you have a vps with disk space you can just serve mp4 files using any web server and upload as fast and much as your disk and bandwith allow
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> honestly i wouldnt recommend using opentube even if i activley use it. Its ugly and its a kinda works for me setup :D 
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> I can't belive im saying this. But whats wrong with discord videos? xd
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> its basically a free file hoster .. well assuming that your data is worth nothing hrhr
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> no ads and can be shared even outside of discord
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> discord's stuff can also be shared outside discord
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also a surprisingly cheap file hoster
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> was that bridge lag or did you just copy my message? xd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I misread your message
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> o
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Before the update, when you were freezed your skin turns into ninja skin with ninja sword and all that, me and other people want to have that style back as we‚Äòve grown very used to it and we find it alot more aesthetically pleasing
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Instead of all these ice cube ideas, just make the tee itself ice blue
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Just a suggestion
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Since i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fitting to the game at all if the tee turns into an ice cube
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to me, it doesn't sound too bad to put an ice block around the tee
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that we happily lived with the skin changing to a literal ninja for years üòÑ
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hows it not fitting
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also what if someones skin is already ice blue
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Tees are usually round
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean ill try today
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my graphics skills are alright but pale in comparison to ravie or voxel
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> It will take me a long time to force myself to get used to an ice cube tee
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> For my part
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Thats how i was introduced to the game and I liked it
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds to me like 'change is bad'
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is okay
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I wouldn't call it something else
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. not claim that a ninja actually fits better for freeze
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> It does but as a creator you‚Äôll always face that
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if the freeze skin was a literal poop emoji for years we would get shamed for trying to change it i swear
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Probably
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> But you had no problem implementing ‚Äûcl_old_gun_position‚Äú for these people
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I‚Äôm just suggesting that you could do it again
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we'd have a problem implementing `cl_old_gun_position` today
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> i think the ice "cube" could still be round to fit the tee shape
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> That‚Äôs what I think
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea that would be better
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd suggest to look at actual drawings instead of theorizing what might or might not look better
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think this theorizing will lead to useful input
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> i suggest doing an actual draing of something thats round instead a cube
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure, do it üôÇ
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I can‚Äôt draw, I only have my theories xd
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can then compare
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> my drawings sok tho
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> but if the cube looks solid its just a wrong hitbox
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not for collision ^^
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> ha tru
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then ask someone who drew a whatever-shaped ice object to try to make it round to see how it would look like
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't like this idea dismissing before we've actually seen it ^^
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> are there drawings alr?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> If we‚Äòd portray freeze as Ice cube, how do we portray deep?
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> darker ice
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> ez
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Just same with different eyes? I‚Äôve found that idea always lme
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Lame
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think there were some attempts already, e.g. in Zeta-Hoernchen's old ddrace
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't want to dig it up rn, you can look for it if you want
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll find much about it with a blank internet search
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I found your github tho
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1005110423818874910/image0.jpg

15:53 <+ChillerDragon> yea those edges are very round
15:53 <+ChillerDragon> that might work
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't quite look like ingame, ingame it was a lot more transparent, I think
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/videos/users/chiller/tee_on_the_rocks.mp4
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> feet should be covered too i guess
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> and im not an artist so this is more concept than the real thing
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659709445.png
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theres already a similar skin in the database

16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i guess this tee inside should be less saturated
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not bad
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> it will probably break with weirdly shaped skins :c
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> wow but i gotta say the light skin is a hughe change. Going from dark to light is gonna need some time to get used to

16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD

17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh man, the oldest, unmarked issue/discussion
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/237
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we have the tools to make it predictable now
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we can use a prng per run and the seed can be transmitted to the client at start
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can only upload videos <100mb and I do not want to cut my videos
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ok then use a selfhosted web server
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that looks really funny. What I fear about Ice block is, that the player would think you can slide over the floor as an ice block...
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> iv been playing with this ice skin since i posted it. Not sure what to say about it \:D
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would like to first polish up our new game design and then thinking about adding options for old animations/design (In the current state it would not be to hard to allow such options). We should try to determine what is annoying in the new design and try to improve it and polish that up. I'm not against options for old design, I personally also grown up with the old design and for example sometimes miss the old stars... But I personally w
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> have you implemented the ice cube as a overlay or is this just a skin?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its just a skin
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but the skin is my ice texture slapped onto default.svg
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> My first Idea was such a skin as an overlay, so that you still can tell the persons skin
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so just add sprite rendering code and u done
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but the texture is not too nice imo
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> should also be a non perfect cube like yours so that it does not matter if the player skin peaks out
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye i assume fat skins will always look cursed
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that looks also nice, If we would create such an skin with only the ice without the tee, I could implement it and then we can test how it looks with different skins...
