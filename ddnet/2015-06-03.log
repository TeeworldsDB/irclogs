21:53 < Savander> no idea why in teeworlds it's not the same in all directions :P
21:53 < Savander> (borderfix didn't do anything ^^)
22:17 < o_be_one> Savander, i see just a white image
22:20 < Savander> its transparent
22:20 < Savander> white graphics 
22:27 < o_be_one> okh k
22:41 <@heinrich5991> Savander: what about dilate?
22:43 < Savander> i did
22:43 < Savander> before borderfix
22:43 < Savander> i exported this graphics from illustrator ( vector graphics)
22:44 < Savander> and looks... much worse, than in program.
22:45 < Savander> circles aren't looks like perfect circles in teeworlds :P
22:54 <@deen> right, that's why you use quads instead of tiles
22:54 < Savander> :)
22:56 < Savander> i don't think, it's fixable. When i rotate tile, it just have border bug
22:56 < Savander> (1px from space)
22:56 < Savander> xd
