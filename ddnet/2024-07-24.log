00:02 < bridge> <0xdeen> Doesn't android have its own native ssl library? Maybe use that instead of openssl
00:05 < bridge> <headshotnoby> http://github.com/headshot2017/ddnet-3ds/releases
00:05 < bridge> <headshotnoby> this port feels much more stable than the other 3 consoles i've ported it to so i went and released the ROM for it

00:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> Oh well:
00:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> > Note that this does not give you SSL/TLS support. If you need SSL/TLS, you have to build curl with a SSL/TLS library, e.g. OpenSSL, because it is impossible for curl to access Android's native SSL/TLS layer.
00:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> Can we use native Android https layer instead or would that be too much work?
00:09 < bridge> <0xdeen> @headshotnoby Why DDNet 9 btw?
00:09 < bridge> <0xdeen> Because last version with SDL1?
00:11 < bridge> <headshotnoby> it's been the easiest version for me to make ports of
00:11 < bridge> <headshotnoby> SDL gets replaced with system calls during the porting process
00:11 < bridge> <headshotnoby> SDL gets replaced with system functions during the porting process
00:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @headshotnoby: when contribute your stuff to the SDL repo hehe
00:54 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
05:42 < bridge> <sedonya> gm
07:03 < bridge> <louis> is there any way to anti-alias things like the vote progress circle?
07:09 < bridge> <Ewan> u can turn on aa for the whole game
07:09 < bridge> <Ewan> otherwise no
07:11 < bridge> <louis> where @mpft
07:11 < bridge> <louis> well im sure the vote timer circle can be aliased, i meant like in the code somehow
07:11 < bridge> <Ewan> not currently
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> u could write a shader or implement it in software
07:12 < bridge> <louis> actually none of the ui elements have anti aliasing i guess
08:15 < bridge> <headshotnoby> 1158 files changed
08:15 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
08:28 < bridge> <totar> why are there coauthored commits
08:29 < bridge> <totar> oh those were real
08:29 < bridge> <totar> just old
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh neat:
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/3243
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apparently i subscribed to that thread a few years ago xD
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since we talk about android currently, this would allow us to query the display cutout
10:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Does SDL2 not work for PS2 or N3DS for example? There seems to be a PS2 specific renderer and PS2 and N3DS joystick implementations in the SDL2 source code
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do our other libs even work for these platforms?
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> curl and stuff
10:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Would definitely be more work than the currently suggested workaround of copying the ca bundle to your own storage
10:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like there are existing ports of the libraries, e.g. for 3DS
10:39 < bridge> <robyt3> https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Compiling_ScummVM/Nintendo_3DS
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> considering we already have trouble with android, i wouldn't want to do such stuff xD
10:40 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ddnet 9 used opengl to render graphics anyway so that's out of the question
10:40 < bridge> <headshotnoby> (graphics.cpp)
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> What if we had an SDL-renderer based backend?
10:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> yeah, what if, i've yet to see one implemented on ddnet
10:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> it might be too slow for the console ports either way
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean, what other changes were necessary? Did you rip out SDL completely?
10:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> yes
10:42 < bridge> <headshotnoby> for all the console ports
10:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: probably use the teeworlds license at least for the parts that you translated 1:1
10:43 < bridge> <robyt3> I see. At least according to the source code, using SDL for PS2 seems feasible though. There is also a PS2 specific renderer which uses the PS2 native API I guess.
10:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991: so have two license files?
10:44 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i used a library bundled with ps2sdk called "gsKit" for rendering graphics on the ps2 port
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @headshotnoby when will you port to gameboy advance
10:44 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
10:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991: sounds messy i would have to move it to some external/ folder and then have a own license there like teeworlds does it for their dependencies i guess
10:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: if you want. you don't have to, though. teeworlds has licenses for multiple things in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/a1911c8f7d8458fb4076ef8e7651e8ef5e91ab3e/license.txt, if you want
10:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> and i can integrated other license code just like that on a per file basis fully mixed into the code?
10:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> so weird
10:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have to hand pick all the snippets of code through the entire protocol lib that are too close and add some notes to the readme
10:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> at this point sue me thats too messy for me
10:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> alone the maintenance when restructuring the code is not worth the legal consequences
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In luluworlds i just claimed magnus did the original implementation of the entire code base xd. Thats wrong but at least its not as messy as saying which parts are too close and which arent
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/luluworlds/luluworlds/blob/3a05b8d45b0b8f0bfcc8b5acee1efbcf2e448cbc/LICENSE
10:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that works
10:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> thanks lawyer heino
11:13 < bridge> <louis> can we remove this from the ddnet client browser?
11:13 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265597764210003979/image.png?ex=66a21744&is=66a0c5c4&hm=8833193e79fb5416ddb2617f25d25650745efa2d92f74d3f001f2699ed06942a&
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
11:17 < bridge> <soulyvevo> what do those servers have to break the compatibility with ddnet lol
11:18 < bridge> <sedonya> Can I get a link to the repository?
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they simply don't want ddnet clients to work on their servers
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no extra features AFAIK
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> work in progress currently
11:19 < bridge> <robyt3> #8632
11:19 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8632
11:19 < bridge> <sedonya> A!
11:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> should have been called lalaland.
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> They want people to use their own closed source client
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> Ah heinrich replied. Thanks discord mobile client for keeping my chat up to date
11:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> thats wild
11:37 < bridge> <louis> i trained a really simple classification model on all the irc logs
11:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> wouldnt be surprised if that would be some troll backdoor stuff
11:37 < bridge> <louis> its only 50% accuracy though. it guesses depending on the message who out of the top 20 developer chatters said it
11:38 < bridge> <louis> although the model is simple enough to train on a laptop ^^ maybe i'll see if it can get to a respectable number on google colab or something
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> Now turn it around and try to generate a thing heinrich would say
11:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool 😮
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when release
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to talk to myself
11:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just classification. it can only *tell* you that you're apparently talking to yourself
11:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fun fact, it's actually possible to select multiple things if you hold ctrl
11:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265607150504247316/image.png?ex=66a22002&is=66a0ce82&hm=3ecb8c206fdb41ad1595b89ebfa4846d11ab0926cf159810ad7b45ffd1354461&
11:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> likely depends heavily on the program
11:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I found it works in firefox
11:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's firefox
11:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chrome apparently doesn't implement it
11:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how can it be even useful? xd
11:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: this is for you: https://pnut.sh/
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> doesn't work in chromium, common chromium L
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> firefox 🇹🇩
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now we need electron based on firefox
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else it aint work in my epyc desktop web apps
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> now we need to invent a time machine, go back in time and beat the guy who invented electron
12:15 < bridge> <Iza> there is gonna be a website redirect in the vpn ban message?
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> yo how could this result in UB?
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> if(v.empty())
12:19 < bridge> <teero777>   return;
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> int Index = 0;
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> while(1)
12:19 < bridge> <teero777>   Index = ++Index % v.size();
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> ```
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> ```
12:19 < bridge> <teero777>  warning: operation on ‘Index’ may be undefined [-Wsequence-point]
12:19 < bridge> <teero777>   155 |                 Index = ++Index % v.size();
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> ```
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> The code you provided can potentially result in undefined behavior (UB) due to the specific operation in the loop. Let's break it down:
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> ```cpp
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> if(v.empty())
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>   return;
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> int Index = 0;
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> while(1)
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>   Index = ++Index % v.size();
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> ```
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> ### Explanation:
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 1. **Check for Empty Vector:**
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    ```cpp
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    if(v.empty())
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>      return;
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    ```
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    This part is safe. If the vector `v` is empty, the function returns immediately.
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 2. **Initialization:**
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    ```cpp
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    int Index = 0;
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    ```
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    This initializes `Index` to 0. Again, this is safe.
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> 3. **Infinite Loop:**
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    ```cpp
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    while(1)
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>      Index = ++Index % v.size();
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    ```
12:21 < bridge> <fluffysnaff>    This is where the problem lies. The warning `operation on ‘Index’ may be undefined [-Wsequence-point]` points to a potential issue with the expression `Index = ++Index % v.size();`.
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> There is no sequence point
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> Ew chat gpt
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @fluffysnaff no spam please
12:22 < bridge> <teero777> huh wdym?
12:22 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> they deleted my messages
12:22 < bridge> <teero777> ah lool
12:22 < bridge> <teero777> ah lol
12:23 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> can't have some fun in ddnet, said same thing as learath but in gpt
12:23 < bridge> <learath2> `Index = ++Index` is already UB because there is no sequence point between two accesses to `Index`
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at least the compiler detects it…
12:24 < bridge> <teero777> ah okay
12:24 < bridge> <learath2> `Index = ++Index` is already UB because there is no sequence point between two writes to `Index`
12:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 Yo, do you think a parser should know what architecture it parses data for? Before I was thinking that only codegen should know about architecture because it has to spit out platform dependent stuff and it was working so far, but now I need to set stack offset for local variables in symbol table and in happens in parser and it currently can't get the size of a variable because it doesn't know architecture, what do you think 'bout it? x
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> Why does your parser know what even a variable is?
12:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :thonk:
12:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I wonder how good it works. Their website looks really cool. I don’t think it’s very useful for me tho. C already runs everywhere and is fast. It’s mostly the other way around I would need it. I would like to have my shell scripts to run as fast as C.
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> Your lexer should be spitting out a list of identifiers along with their types and where they need to be stored. Then as a step in codegen you should figure out how big that type is and then calculate the needed stuff
12:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991: I am really impressed if it can turn the GCC code base into a shell script. Having a fully functional C compiler in pure POSIX shell would be really cool hehe
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> GCC is written in C++
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh lol
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Didn’t know that
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> plus a lot of GCC extensions, probably
12:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> where do I have to put stuff in symbol table? 0_o
13:01 < bridge> <learath2> What kind of symbol table are we talking about here?
13:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> somethign like dat :\
13:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265625059863691284/image.png?ex=66a230b0&is=66a0df30&hm=e48415630e4542004a9d2d1ffc3857431e0dceb19cbf87fa99e8ea5dc4ad2203&
13:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it stores declared variables
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> I would generate a symbol table WITHOUT offsets right after the lexer. Then I'd have some architecture specific part of the compiler populate the offsets
13:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a, ok
13:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thx :owo:
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> hf
13:03 < bridge> <learath2> You are making a fun compiler, I'm doing api calls to shopify :pepeW:
13:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have almost working structs 😏
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u can do stuff like ```
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     Foo foo;
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     foo = Foo {
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         a: 69,
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         b: 420,
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     };
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
13:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but can't access values :lol:
13:57 < bridge> <learath2> First time I've seen write-only structs in a language 💪
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> Hello,
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> 
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> I played the DDNet client for about 5 days normally and yesterday I tried to connect to some DDNet servers (Ukraine), but the same error always appears:
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> You have banned for 10 minutes (Visit ddnet.org/vpn).
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> 
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> And of course I don't use a VPN. I can connect to servers in other parts of the world, but the ping is high :c
13:57 < bridge> <vess_mano> Is it possible to do something about this?(
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> Actually not even just write-only, write-onlyonce
13:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can write as many times as you want xd
13:58 < bridge> <vess_mano> My name in game Ves_Mano
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> This belongs in a ticket #✉-create-a-ticket
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> Create a ban-appeal ticket, with your ip and I'll try to fix it
14:40 < bridge> <archimede67> @robyt3 maybe you have some news?
14:41 < bridge> <robyt3> It's being worked on but I can't give any estimates
14:43 < bridge> <archimede67> okay thanks
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> It's quite interesting how many people inquire about an android client now. It won't even be that playable imo even if you fix it up
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Not a very phone friendly game
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah makes 0 sense, most of them wont touch it a second time xd
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's like playing minecraft on phone
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u do it once, and then never again xD
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but maybe we underestimate that some ppl really only play games on mobile
15:06 < bridge> <murpi> @forgottenabscat would disagree
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are always exceptions
15:06 < bridge> <murpi> There are lots of people playing on the ancient android version on our novice servers
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am not saying that a mobile version does not make the game more accessible than a pc. But i would not really call these novice servers playing the game, no front
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but t0 with 20 tees on a novice map is just a gangbang
15:19 < bridge> <murpi> What clientID does the old android version have?
15:19 < bridge> <murpi> 903?
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smth like that yeah
15:22 < bridge> <murpi> The client ID appeared a total of 4252 times in the last 2-3 days on DDNet, excluding the CHN servers
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what does appear mean?
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. are they unique connections?
15:24 < bridge> <murpi> As in someone connected to DDNet server with that specific client ID.
15:24 < bridge> <murpi> No, because some people have dynamic IPs
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok but are they unique among IPs?
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 4000 IPs
15:25 < bridge> <murpi> hmmm, no I don't think so
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway, we'll see how many mobile pros will pop up
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> forgottencat is the only one i know yet
15:34 < bridge> <murpi> Actually, yes it is
15:34 < bridge> <murpi> ```sh

15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then gg
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didnt know ddnet has so many unique players
15:39 < bridge> <murpi> I think you can check for unique players on the steamdb site
15:39 < bridge> <louis> tbf i can imagine a control scheme that would make mobile pretty playable
15:39 < bridge> <murpi> (that are on steam)
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i've seen touchpad players playing gores, so yeah
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah once android released
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on steam
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> android steam
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:40 < bridge> <louis> that doesnt require too egregious of a claw grip or too big of a screen 😅
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> long way until google gives up play store
15:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @murpi: ddnet only keeps logs of the last 2-3 days?
15:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How long does that script take to run?
15:41 < bridge> <murpi> @mystery.fox is the ultimate touchpad queen 😄
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i meant her xD
15:42 < bridge> <murpi> Yes
15:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> She is biggest trol
15:42 < bridge> <murpi> maybe a minute or two idk xd
15:42 < bridge> <murpi> if I do CHN too, probably 10 minutes
15:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd average shell script performance hehe
15:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But to be fair it also does ssh connections
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now leak on your servers @chillerdragon
15:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> On da phone
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's less than a second i laugh
15:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I assume in the last 2-3 days there were no players on my servers
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest in peace
15:44 < bridge> <murpi> :feelsbadman:
15:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe gctf
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> g spot ctf
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since community thing, my servers are also mostly empty
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> how
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs nobody plays on non community servers
15:45 < bridge> <louis> i want a community spot how many servers do i need to host
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Well, I'm not gonna do that discussion a second time.
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Good luck tho
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 😅😅
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (this thing isn't thought through)
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ((entirely))
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🫠
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and came to stay forever
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> good luck keeping this alive until your retirement.
15:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 *laughs in 0.7 zcatch*
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> zheuzheuzheu
15:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No community thing over there
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> and also dead
15:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye
15:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> I kept it alive while I was active, I'd guess
15:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> but gctf is active
15:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> right on spot
15:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> 🔨 🥹 🔨
15:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> 🥹 🔨
15:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> better
15:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Host block server with F-DDrace instead
15:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> don'z wanna steal your OG spot
15:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> don't wanna steal your OG spot
15:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Haha, there's some other servers using F-DDrace already
15:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🤩🥰
15:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> It's pointless when I'm not remotely interested in that to host it..
15:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true
15:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> cough, ddnet zCatchbservers
15:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> cough, ddnet zCatch servers
15:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> DDRaceNetwork zCatch
15:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> all I hear is people conplaining.
15:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye
15:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> complaining*
16:07 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @jxsl13 why dont u guys have community tab yet
16:07 < bridge> <soulyvevo> kinda surprising ngl
16:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> you mean gctf?
16:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> too small, I heard
16:08 < bridge> <soulyvevo> u have zcatch too no?
16:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> in 0.6 no
16:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> on 0.7 kind of dead
16:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ooh
16:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> how hard would it be to just move everything to 0.6 and get that community tab
16:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think that could attract some players
16:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> dunno, it's work that I don't wanna do ._.
16:11 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and btw fokko has only 2 servers from what i see
16:11 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and has his own tab
16:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> I did not apply for nothing, so just quoting here, kind of
16:12 < bridge> <soulyvevo> kk just curious
16:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8407 feel free to be the first one to give feedback on that topic :gigachad:
16:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> thought about using the timeout token for authentication but the threw that thought out of the window. Malicious servers and stuff.
16:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> then
16:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, completely different topic ._.
16:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> ddnet the trusted authority
16:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> for tls certificates
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> Time to test in prod
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> does anyone know a map that has spec enabled?
16:34 < bridge> <soulyvevo> Spectateer
16:35 < bridge> <learath2> also needs to be easy enough to get to the start line on touchpad 😄
16:36 < bridge> <soulyvevo> oh

16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno, maybe someone added a bug
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if you know you can press k
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why would u ever press that button
16:46 < bridge> <okjnguh> how can I fix this?
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, you could tell on which server it happens
16:47 < bridge> <okjnguh> idk
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then a dev can take a look
16:47 < bridge> <okjnguh> ok
16:47 < bridge> <okjnguh> on all servers
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with latest ddnet client?
16:48 < bridge> <okjnguh> This is a problem on all servers, no matter where I go, I don’t know what to do ((
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you use the latest ddnet client?
16:49 < bridge> <okjnguh> yeap
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i joined 57.128.201.180:8321

16:52 < bridge> <okjnguh> ok
16:54 < bridge> <okjnguh> i dont have this button(
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> press F1 and say what version it says top right
16:54 < bridge> <okjnguh> ok

16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you use russian as language?
16:56 < bridge> <okjnguh> im russian but i speak English
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me it looks like this
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265684117241069578/image.png?ex=66a267b0&is=66a11630&hm=b96b981449d29a955a735cf334e54cebe22e294ba181b1379387d7572dfd974a&
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in this screenshot, what does the button next to "kill" say?
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in my screenshot it says "pause"
16:57 < bridge> <okjnguh> yes, its correct, but i dont have button " респаун "
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is it different to yours
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you play with small resolution?
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i change my resolution then i also dont see those buttons
16:58 < bridge> <okjnguh> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265684595542593576/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_56d46eaf-35ef-4a47-aab5-c5c319f3f8ba.jpg?ex=66a26822&is=66a116a2&hm=05d4565627f9704f650db918d3b11da4b331942a1fc571784a57851071837fed&

16:58 < bridge> <okjnguh> ok
16:59 < bridge> <okjnguh> one moment
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did it work in earlier versions of ddnet? with your small resolution
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe the translations were changed and are longer now
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or maybe a dev removed them bcs they were too long, dunno
17:00 < bridge> <okjnguh> I tried changing the screen resolution, it didn't help
17:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to  16:9 ?
17:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it depends on your aspect ratio
17:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Was changed so the buttons are not shown if there is not enough space
17:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Previously the buttons overlapped with smaller resolutions
17:06 < bridge> <okjnguh> I have a square monitor(
17:09 < bridge> <okjnguh> when I just downloaded the game, everything was fine, I downloaded the game 3 days ago, and yesterday when I turned on the game, the button disappeared
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah the button was removed as robyte said.
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think you can better use `k` anyway. if you don't like `k`, press F1 and type:
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `bind <key> kill`
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where <key> is any key you like, e.g.
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `bind q kill`
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then you only have to press q to respawn
17:11 < bridge> <okjnguh> (
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just try it out, you won't regret it 😉
17:18 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I just think different people like different settings.
17:19 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> As for me, android client can start to play anywhere, and the hook system has a big advantage because it could rotate instantly
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @forgottenabscat did you actually play on pc once?
17:20 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Yes
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah nice
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> must have felt weird the other way around xd
17:20 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I find that i hate how the hook aims
17:20 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I dont know how you guys rehook using mouse
17:21 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> And at a fast speed, thats also impressive for me
17:21 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I play lumine on pc once, i can only finish half:brownbear:
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i could not play gores on mobile.. the input lag and the missing feedback are too bad
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also couldn't imagine that training alone can fix it
17:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Maybe antiping can fix..
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i meant the input lag from the hardware
17:24 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Your brain will antiping finally
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and missing feedback from hardware
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you mean like that 😄
17:25 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Tough way though

17:28 < bridge> <snwrrex> thanks
18:15 < bridge> <marmare_314> @robyt3 Hey, I wanted to revisit #7320, but I am not really happy with it anymore. I don't think it improves the code quality much. I think much of the complexity of the envelope editor code comes from storing the envelope points as integers. We could also only use floats in the editor and then convert them to integers when saving. Do you think that would be reasonable?
18:15 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7320
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "ideas for editor" ... 
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> invents a complete new game :lol:
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265705043001081949/image.png?ex=66a27b2d&is=66a129ad&hm=bf45cfa3a86de768dcb8d0511acee20d60369259d20ccce09d922f262f053028&
18:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems reasonable I think. Though at some point you also need to convert to fixed point temporarily, like when checking whether the point time is between two other times when moving a point.
18:39 < bridge> <learath2> Mm, why floats? They are a lie in this case, we only have fixed precision
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use a double and then u have insane precision
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we dont used fixed point numbers.. we use fixed point numbers with bad precision xd
18:53 < bridge> <marmare_314> Yes, the question is if it is ok for the editor to not be completely accurate. If the difference is at most 1ms Im not sure it really matters
18:54 < bridge> <robyt3> If you load a map and save it again without changes I would expect it to be unchanged though, so it shouldn't add any rounding errors like this
19:00 < bridge> <marmare_314> Of course, that should be fine
19:20 < bridge> <zhn> why it got merged without any discussion :justatest:
19:23 < bridge> <robyt3> Was already a pretty large discussion considering is was about the shade of two colors 😄
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> You made UI change. It was someones fav color. You will be killed now
