00:55 < bridge> <Ewan> there is no USB OTG on my motherboard I guess so this may not be possible

09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> my car uses 6l/100km if im on a highway (120km/h )
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and gas is at 1.6‚Ç¨ more or less
09:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> That's.. a lot
09:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> Almost more than mine
09:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> a lot?
09:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its fine xd
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> For 120km/h?
09:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its the average from refuelling
09:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if its all 120
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> My car uses 4.9 on 100
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> (But almost 14l/100  on 220+ smh :justatest:

09:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> according to my poor math
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> train was like 50‚Ç¨ per person
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr oh it said 6l/100km with the car having 4 full grown humans
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> is ur calculation with just 1?
09:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i went mostly at 130km/h

10:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The 0.6 vanilla client sorts by name by default. This name is what filled the server back in the days.
10:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where is the screenshot from souly coming from? Is that a public channel or what is it
10:09 < bridge> <teero777> oh you are so confused chiller xd
10:10 < bridge> <teero777> We all named ourselves property of Souly xd
10:10 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller can't differentiate ig xd
10:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok still same question tho
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> yes, it is a public mod application

10:52 < bridge> <Assa> does somebody know what m_Type in maplayers is supposed to be? I Need an explanation for the different types, like TYPE_BACKGROUND_FORCE, TYPE_FOREGROUND, TYPE_FULL_DESIGN and if they are enabled to render entities or not
11:02 < bridge> <Assa> background force and type full design is not supposed to render entities, man this function gives me nightmares
12:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> They're threads, "new" feature
12:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> So it's a skill issue on your bridge
12:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds bloat
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lmao
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> are we gonna get chiller on discord
13:00 < bridge> <filoqcus> @blaiszephyr Is there some command that when the server starts the command is entered into the rcon? Because ‚Äúhide_auth_status 1‚Äù doesn't work when starting the server.
13:01 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Does anyone know what's this? CMenus::OnConsoleInit()
13:01 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353700128523030558/Screenshot_2025-03-24-19-59-51-242_com.android.chrome.jpg?ex=67e29afd&is=67e1497d&hm=f995fdd97a659a316948b10b6f8a5b1fce76477e68132008768fa43aa8359bfd&
13:01 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> There's no OnConsoleInit in CMenus at all
13:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's the problem
13:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it can't find it
13:03 < furo> @filoqcus That is not a setting. It is a command which you can run when you are authed.
13:07 < bridge> <filoqcus> Is it possible to generally disable the green color in rcon? By modifying the server code
13:07 < bridge> <filoqcus> :justatest:
13:09 < furo> Search for `m_AuthHidden = false;` and replace the three occurrences with true instead. This will still allow you to enable it again with `‚Äúhide_auth_status 0`, but it will be disabled by default.
13:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you have to either delete this line https://github.com/K1nop1c0/TEST/blob/bd657f541ac1505473f78541d2302af3a227fd44/src/game/client/components/menus.h#L692 or implement `CMenus::OnConsoleInit`

14:00 < bridge> <chairn> soon 10k issues and prs
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> refactored `CMapLayers::OnRender`  and managed to do this without templates.
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> Against my expectation, there was a lot of redundant code and checks in it.
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> Only downside is, that I know use 8 methods instead of just 1
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> Will test this at home and cleanup even more, then do PR
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what templates do you refer to?
15:27 < bridge> <Assa> none
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how have u done this

16:12 < bridge> <teero777> the client already has that info no?
16:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i... dont know
16:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i only know about the "auth level" which isnt specific enough
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> the play has a list of all commands it can execute and the auth level it has
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> the player has a list of all commands it can execute and the auth level it has
16:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that works for alot of things on the list
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> would be cool if this would work pure clientside

16:20 < bridge> <fushi_gg> no, just max volume will be reduced

16:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but they arent
16:21 < bridge> <fushi_gg> so even for apps I haven't adjusted a volume slider for it still won't be able to earrape me

16:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> quick question, are .ghost files just demo files or?
16:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> they are not
16:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think they store much less data than demos
16:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> rip
16:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> teero is working on a tool to convert ghosts to demos though
16:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> and he made a library to load ghost files too

18:21 < bridge> <teero777> im working on the physics right now xd
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> since you need to simulate the grenades and stuff to make the demo in the end

20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> people writing tests
20:42 < bridge> <teero777> yo im a little bit confused about the pickup entity code. apparently the entity can be a POWERUP_NINJA but it can also be a POWERUP_WEAPON with the subtype of ninja?
20:42 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/76140c1c1db6a14cadd04a60cf2684c091064619/src/game/server/entities/pickup.cpp#L131-L154
20:42 < bridge> <teero777> is this for map compatability or smth?
20:43 < bridge> <teero777> or can the subtype never be ninja?
20:43 < bridge> <teero777> @robyt3 you probably know xd
20:43 < bridge> <teero777> do you mind sharing your wisdom
20:46 < bridge> <kebscs> for me doesnt look like ninja can be both
20:46 < bridge> <kebscs> powerup_ is whatever is on map, hearts, shields etc
20:47 < bridge> <kebscs> and theres no powerup for every weapon but just generic one so have to use subtypes in this case
20:47 < bridge> <kebscs> just ninja is separate
20:47 < bridge> <teero777> okay so why does POWERUP_NINJA exist?
20:47 < bridge> <teero777> no xd
20:47 < bridge> <teero777> subtype could be ninja and it would result in the same thing
20:47 < bridge> <teero777> thats the issue
20:49 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess bcs ninja wasnt released together with other weapons?
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> those enums changed in 0.7
20:49 < bridge> <kebscs> so they split for some reason
20:49 < bridge> <teero777> ```c
20:49 < bridge> <teero777> case POWERUP_WEAPON:
20:49 < bridge> <teero777>   if (pPickup->m_Subtype >= 0 && pPickup->m_Subtype < NUM_WEAPONS) {
20:49 < bridge> <teero777>     if (pPickup->m_Subtype == WEAPON_NINJA) {

20:49 < bridge> <teero777> }
20:49 < bridge> <teero777> ```
20:49 < bridge> <teero777> this is my c code rn xd

20:50 < bridge> <teero777> so ninja is indeed not a subtype of weapons?
20:50 < bridge> <teero777> thats good to know ig

20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc
21:01 < bridge> <teero777> there is so much dead code in the physics xdd
21:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> probably because people dont touch physics
21:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> scared of breaking it
21:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> @teero777 you online?
21:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> do you know what kind of time is persisted in the ghosts? is it ticks?
21:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> milliseconds?
21:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> IIRC 25 tps
21:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> half speed?
21:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> afair - thats one of the reasons you cant rebuild a run from a demo 1 to 1

21:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> afair - thats one of the reasons you cant rebuild a run from a ghost1 to 1
21:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> k
21:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> afair - thats one of the reasons you cant rebuild a run from a ghost 1 to 1
21:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> tho ofc, @teero777 knows the answer
21:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> üçà
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> 25tps yes
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> it has a start tick too
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> and the racetime
21:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> you keep your juicy peel for today, melon
21:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> :cat_cracked_hehe:
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> @jxsl13 check https://github.com/Teero888/ddnet_ghostloader_c99/blob/master/ghost_loader.h
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> thats all the data you get
21:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm checking that
21:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> just wanted to reimplement it in Go for fun.
21:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> this is so disturbing
21:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> ehm, I meant the time field of the header actually D:
21:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> is is in milliseconds or ticks or what's in there?
21:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://github.com/Teero888/ddnet_ghostloader_c99/blob/master/ghost_loader.c#L235
21:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be in milliseconds, the times come from the `CRaceHelper::TimeFrom*` functions AFAICT
21:50 < bridge> <teero777> oh you mean the finish time? xd
21:50 < bridge> <teero777> yes thats in ms
21:51 < bridge> <teero777> the ticks themselves are in 25tps
21:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Not 50?
21:51 < bridge> <teero777> no xd
21:51 < bridge> <teero777> same as demos
21:52 < bridge> <teero777> the server only sends 25tps
21:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah but like, isn't the start and finish measured on the server side?
21:52 < bridge> <teero777> yes.
21:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and if it's reasonable it shouldn't be tied to network ticks
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> If the server was running with `sv_high_bandwidth 1` then I assume demos and ghosts would be 50 TPS instead
21:56 < bridge> <teero777> i know demos can be 50tps if specified. dunno about ghosts
21:57 < bridge> <teero777> it would work ig
21:57 < bridge> <robyt3> There's nothing else limiting them to 25 TPS
21:58 < bridge> <teero777> my tests are still failing :(((((((

21:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Ghosts just store character data at specific ticks, they could theoretically use completely different tick rates as well
23:15 < bridge> <Assa> When you have a rendering issue, but only with one backend and you don't know why ...
23:17 < bridge> <Assa> something something only vulcan only in foreground ... madness
23:48 < bridge> <learath2> are you writing your own simulation or is it using twgame?
23:57 < bridge> <teero777> I'm rewriting the ddnet physics in c99 xd
