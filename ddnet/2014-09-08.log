00:02 < laxa> nice
00:03 < laxa> deen: you there ?
00:03 < laxa> Is there a way to abuse settings and shoot grenades straight away ?
00:03 < laxa> cause aaa can do it...
01:03 <@deen> laxa: don't understand
01:04 < laxa> well
01:04 < laxa> apparently
01:04 < laxa> with only the game engine
01:04 < laxa> you have a way to shoot like you were looking top
01:04 < laxa> without looking top
01:04 < laxa> or any other direction I guess
01:04 <@deen> yes, that works
01:04 < laxa> How oO ?
01:04 <@deen> where you look is independent of where you shoot
01:04 <@deen> it's just 2 separate things in the protocol
01:05 < laxa> yeah ok
01:05 <@deen> i don't know if any client (except bots) do it
01:05 < laxa> I know someone than can do it
01:05 < laxa> he says he only uses the client
01:05 < laxa> and that work in vanilla
01:05 < laxa> he can "cheat"
01:05 < laxa> by shooting grenade straight top
01:08 < laxa> deen: so, any idea how he could do that ? With F1 commands I guess.
01:14 <@deen> no idea
01:40 < laxa> deen: bug on teeworlds
01:40 < laxa> deen: client doesn't use the proper layout of keyboards
01:40 < laxa> if I do that : bind m say toto
01:40 < laxa> then I'll need to press "," on my keyboard
01:44 <@deen> yes, i heard that
01:44 <@deen> sounds like it happens on Windows
01:44 <@deen> was it always like that? does it work differently with vanilla?
07:48 < laxa> It's always been like that I think. Iirc, I never had to switch my config for going right and left.
07:48 < laxa> I have an azerty keyboard
07:48 < laxa> "a" and "q" are switched compared to qwerty
07:48 < laxa> and in my config, it's written a for +left
07:49 < laxa> even though I press "q" to go left
10:04 < laxa_work> and I tested on vanilla, it's exactly the same
11:34 <@deen> then i guess we should keep it like it is
11:35 <@deen> otherwise ddnet client wouldn't work for people with arabic keyboards for example
11:58 < laxa_work> hum ok
11:58 < laxa_work> deen: question : do the server know when we use dummy feature ?
11:58 <@deen> no
11:58 < laxa_work> ok
12:13 < laxa_work> That thing about shooting up without looking up is bothering me
12:13 < laxa_work> it's cheat, and I would like to know how to do it T_T
12:18 < laxa_work> then masybe we can remove it
12:24 <@deen> ask the person who does it, not me
12:26 < laxa_work> He doesn't wanna tell me boah :5
18:21 < laxa> deen: I have a new idea :p
18:22 < laxa> It's about changing or replacing the ranking system
18:23 < laxa> so my idea is pretty simple : the more a map has finishers, the less it gives points
18:23 < laxa> you could add a new ranking, find a formula to takes this into account of the current finisher points
18:32 < laxa> or maybe simply give bonus points if a map has not many finishs
18:40 <@deen> no
19:00 < laxa> ok lol :(
19:19 <@deen> Wohoo, DDNet Persian getting some players!
19:36 <@deen> Oh, Persian Pro is down
19:36 <@deen> bor: I hope you and KinG have nothing to do with that
20:07 < bor> deen: hi , i didn't have something to do with that , although i can't speak for king .
20:08 <@deen> ok
20:08 <@deen> hi
20:09 < Savander> hello
20:09 < bor> hi
20:09 <@deen> hi Savander 
20:13 < Savander> New record !,3 
20:13 < Savander> 35 players
20:13 <@deen> DDNet Persian 50 players
20:13 < Savander> n1 :)
20:13 <@deen> bor: maybe we need more other servers on DDNet Persian?
20:14 <@deen> i don't know how long Persian Pro will be down, but i can run zcatch, ictf, openfng and that stuff
20:14 < Savander> ;]
20:14 < Savander> Im so happy
20:15 < Savander> My servers gaining popularity ;3
20:15 < Savander> mrau :D
20:18 < Savander> i should change my webiste
20:18 < Savander> because, now looks bad
20:20 <@deen> EastBite: any news from the spoofing group?
20:36 < bor> it reached 62 players :P never seen this much players on our servers before 
20:37 < bor> openfng would be nice but cpu usage doesn't seem to allow more than 2 more servers 
20:46 <@deen> we had 70 before =)
20:46 <@deen> yeah, cpu seems pretty weak
20:46 <@deen> i don't know if the server is lagging or if it's just the connection Iran -> GER
20:54 < bor> is openfng running ?
21:08 <@deen> no
21:11 < bor> are you going to run one ?
21:23 <@deen> yeah, but if i do it now the players will lag
21:28 < laxa> Savander: wtf, how you get players ?
21:28 < bor> how about you take down the novice server that has 0 players and replace it with fng ?
21:29 <@deen> no, not like that
21:29 <@deen> i mean they will lag because i have to download a lot and compile
21:29 <@deen> better do it when servers are empty
21:30 < Savander> I don't know laxa 
21:30 < Savander> just my servers ;3
21:32 <@deen> Meskalin has an exploit and uses it to kick people on ddnet servers =/
21:32 <@deen> apparently it's in the timeout protection
21:45 <@deen> well, and he find it funny that i don't know how to fix it
21:46 <@deen> really nice community we have
21:48 < laxa> deen: yeah, kids !
21:53 < Savander> laxa
21:53 < Savander> and what with you database?
21:53 < Savander> xD
21:53 < Savander> you started?
21:54 < laxa> I don't have the motivation to code outside work :(
21:54 < laxa> and player would not use it I think
21:55 < Savander> :D:D
22:18 < laxa> wtf
22:32 < Savander> ddos
22:32 < Savander> xD
22:32 < Savander>  
22:32 < Savander>  
22:32 < Savander>  
22:32 < Savander>  
22:32 < Savander>   
22:32 < Savander>  
22:35 <@deen> The Persian server seems to lag a lot, even without any attacks
22:35 <@deen> Persian Pro looks much more stable ping
22:41 < Savander> better servers?
22:42 <@deen> better servers and better connection
22:42 <@deen> ping 100 vs 300 between the 2 for me
22:42 < laxa> seems more like a routing problem than anything else
22:42 < laxa> otherwise, there is something really wrong lol
22:45 <@deen> yes, there is something really wrong
22:45 <@deen> Internet is bad in Iran
22:45 < Savander> ye
22:45 < Savander> i habe 300ping on yours
22:45 < Savander> and 120 on pro persian
23:02 < bor> king said shattel (our datacenter) was better compared to ParsOnline or Asiatech 
23:03 < bor> maybe we should just get a server with more cpu ?
23:03 <@deen> doesn't seem so =/
23:03 <@deen> i don't think it's the cpu (mostly)
23:03 < bor> which DC is persian pro servers on ?
23:04 <@deen> http://www.ouriran.com/
23:04 <@deen> I think
23:05 <@deen> But they seem expensive
23:05 <@deen> for 1 month it's 133000 Tomans
23:05 <@deen> if you get it for 1 year then 85000 Tomans / month
23:07 < bor> we are paying 90000tomans/month now
23:07 <@deen> bor: did you do something on the server? all processes look normal but 90% of RAM is used
23:07 < bor> no , nothing recently 
23:07 <@deen> very weird
23:08 < bor> last thing i did was install teamspeak but that was like 1 week ago
23:08 < bor> can't you check which proccess is using ram ?
23:08 <@deen> exactly, but no process is using
23:08 <@deen> and now it just goes down
23:08 <@deen> i think that's a sign that the hoster is doing weird stuff
23:09 <@deen> i had a server in iran once, and they said it's 512 MB RAM, but i could only run 3 ddnet servers and 100% was used already
23:09 <@deen> which is more like 50 MB
23:09 < bor> overselling is very normal around here ... 
23:09 < bor> they sell 32GB ram when they have 8GB
23:09 <@deen> yeah
23:09 <@deen> is our server not kvm?
23:10 < bor> and its up to vmware to figure something out on how to keep server from exploding 
23:10 < bor> they don't sell Dedicated hardware for 512MB ram
23:10 < bor> its a vps with vmware
23:10 <@deen> aah
23:10 <@deen> ok, that explains it
23:10 < bor> you need to get at least 4GB of ram to get a Dedicated server
23:11 <@deen> i always get kvm servers because you can't oversell as easily
23:36 <@deen> I added a donation button on http://ddnet.tw after all (there is a way to send money with paypal for free now)
23:36 <@deen> Can anyone tell me if the language is correct after you click on the button?
23:40 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/Nr1deehn7731
23:41 < laxa> YOUHOUUUUJ
23:41 < laxa> finished brokeyschallenge !
23:42 <@deen> laxa: nice
23:42 <@deen> Savander: eeeh
23:42 <@deen> why is the button not displaying?
23:43 < laxa> 5:36:76
23:43 < laxa> !calc 11-5
23:43 < Nimda> Error while parsing the result
23:44 < Savander> i don't know
23:45 < laxa> deen: I'll donate right now.
23:45 <@deen> laxa: before i remove it again?^^
23:45 < laxa> But is it possible to have like teeworlds official's forum ?
23:45 < laxa> donor icon
23:45 < laxa> on forums
23:46 < laxa> :p
23:46 <@deen> hmm
23:46 <@deen> I think it looks a bit weird, like some people are special =/
23:46 < laxa> You could as well ad moderators / testers icons
23:46 <@deen> any other thoughts?
23:46 < laxa> Nah, it's ok.
23:46 <@deen> Savander: try again?
23:46 < Savander> now works
23:46 <@deen> thanks
23:47 <@deen> and when you click on it it's in english?
23:47 < laxa> Yup it is
23:47 <@deen> good
23:47 < laxa> But my system is running in english
23:47 <@deen> mine too
23:47 < laxa> So I would not expect french :)
23:47 <@deen> but it was german before...
23:47 < laxa> hum
23:47 < laxa> question
23:48 < laxa> if I send a donation via e-mail
23:48 < laxa> is it free of charge ?
23:48 < laxa> no it isn't...
23:48 < laxa> Iirc, noother donated me to buy game on steamshop
23:48 <@deen> only from some countries it works, it's stupid
23:48 < laxa> it wasn't free of charges
23:48 <@deen> and only since 1 month
23:48 <@deen> before then it cost money
23:48 < laxa> ok so
23:48 <@deen> which is one of the reason why i didn't want donations
23:48 <@deen> when i log into paypal and click on "send money"
23:48 < laxa> if I use the button, it's the same as giving to your e-mail right ?
23:48 <@deen> there is a "send money to friends and family" button
23:49 <@deen> no, with the button you pay fees
23:49 <@deen> and when i click that button it says "these payments are free"
23:49 < laxa> There is nothing about fees on my page...
23:50 <@deen> paypal is weird...
23:51 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/paypal.png
23:51 <@deen> eh
23:51 <@deen> now
23:51 <@deen> the second one is for free
23:51 < laxa> if I send to you via e-mail
23:52 < laxa> for 21 euros
23:52 < laxa> there are 75 cents of fees
23:52 <@deen> then it's probably cheaper with donation button
23:52 <@deen> yeah, 60 cent with button
23:53 < laxa> done
23:53 < laxa> how much cost ddnet GER only ?
23:53 <@deen> not much actually
23:53 <@deen> 10 € / month
23:54 <@deen> so you just paid 2 months of GER
23:54 <@deen> Chilean one is 26 € / month =/
23:54 <@deen> I'd shut it down if there weren't so many players and other chilean servers
23:56 < laxa> So, 60 cents of fees ?
23:57 <@deen> let me check
23:57 <@deen> i'm just reading my funny spam mails
23:57 <@deen> someone is offering me bandanas from china
23:57 <@deen> i wonder if that has anything to do with bandana brothers
23:59 <@deen> laxa: hm, i didn't receive anything
23:59 < laxa> wtf
23:59 <@deen> ah, there it is
23:59 <@deen> just appeared
23:59 <@deen> 73 ct fees =/
