00:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u know about this?
00:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> so in ffxiv its common to use reshade
00:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> and im running ffxiv on linux
00:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i found this https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt
00:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> reshade is made to apply post shaders to make a game look nicer for gameplay or pics
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> is ffxiv on linux natively
01:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> no

02:17 < bridge> <Night_L> Hi, I am looking for some help with the hook mechanism. In this stage (map <bizarre untold> TP93), when dummy fell into the rightmost wall, you can not hook directly by any chance when standing still(checked by hook collision). But you have a slight chance to hook it when you move right. The hook seems to stretch a little bit and become longer. I would like to know why this happens and how it relates to the implementation

02:33 < bridge> <cyberfighter> because hooklines dont count for momentum and the hook will stop if you are a certain distance from it, so if you are going in the same direction you can hold it for a little bit longer because it will have to travel a bit farther until it gets out of your range
04:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
05:01 < bridge> <nytebk201> Am I making it clear that hook moves with tee. So having momentum will cause the endpoint of a single hook to stretch?
05:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> good C@/day
06:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw it reads good S-at-per(der)-day
06:44 < bridge> <lolkildal> the hook has a certain length, but this length is calculated not from the point from where you hooked, but from your tee, so if you move towards the hook with enough speed the hook can fly almost indefinitely.  An example of this is try falling from a great height and hooking downwards.  in general, on the Wiki there is a mention of this in advanced behavior https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Hook

15:07 < ChillerDragon> bliet asan fakin useless i thought i can just iterate on arrays how ever i want with random indecies and asan would complain if its bad
15:07 < ChillerDragon> it didnt
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc it does, as soon as it is out of bounds
15:17 < ChillerDragon> thats what i thought
15:18 < ChillerDragon> i went 1 too high out of bounds and it didnt complain it just set some other integer to zero :D
15:18 < ChillerDragon> average c++ moment
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can just repeat myself
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it must be a skill issue
15:18 < ChillerDragon> yes
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or a serious bug in asan
15:19 < ChillerDragon> which is more likely?
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> skill issue xd
15:19 < ChillerDragon> chiler being stoopid or asan being bugged
15:19 < ChillerDragon> who knows
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean, u probs on some hipster OS
15:19 < ChillerDragon> i use arch BTW
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess they have some basic tests to detect simple out of bounds like this
15:25 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/ef
15:25 < ChillerDragon> this is my bugged code ripped out
15:25 < ChillerDragon> ``for(int i = MAX_LINES; i > 0; i--)`` where MAX_LINES is array size
15:26 < ChillerDragon> pls fix asan thank jopsti
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant read code without colors
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> come matrix and send with highligther
15:28 < ChillerDragon> lerato u here?
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah ther eis a out of bounds
15:28 < ChillerDragon> can you make it show in asan?
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now show your cmake command
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does this programm compile?
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just for you
15:29 < ChillerDragon> ``CC=clang CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined -fsanitize-recover=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer' CFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined -fsanitize-recover=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer'  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug``
15:29 < ChillerDragon> tbh i only tested within tw 
15:29 < ChillerDragon> not this minimal example
15:29 < ChillerDragon> idk how to asan on a single cpp file have no tooling for that xd

15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u happy now?
15:31 < bridge> <robyt3> `-fsanitize-recover=address` is probably a bad idea, you don't want to continue executing after OOB accesses
15:31 < bridge> <robyt3> You may not get the ASAN report until the program closes otherwise
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there u hear it
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> master robyte knows
15:32 < bridge> <robyt3> There are false negatives, i.e. cases were ASAN can miss OOB access, but this is probably not the case. You'll have to read the paper for that https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/37752.pdf
15:33 < ChillerDragon> send command robsti
15:33 < ChillerDragon> why did it not alert in my tw codebase
15:33 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume in your code base there is another member variable directly behind your array, so the OOB access on the array still ends up in valid memory
15:33 < ChillerDragon> a rite
15:33 < ChillerDragon> lets add the var
15:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure if ASAN adds shadow memory around member variables
15:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe only around full objects
15:36 < ChillerDragon> ok watever i cant reproduce the issue in minimal maybe it needs classes
15:36 < ChillerDragon> but thanks robsti ill remove the recover
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> Am here, what need?
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> `CRegister` is such a complicated class for what it does
16:49 < bridge> <learath2> All because we had to add 0.7 support :pepeW:
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @_voxeldoesart https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/transforming-the-future-of-music-creation/
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/shame-on-you-gif-25797108
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> its why i want to drop 0.7
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> Oh I also have to replace my `unique_locks` with `CLockScope` :pepeW:
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> imagine not having Mutex<T>
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> If only `std::mutex` had thread-safety annotations, then we wouldn't need the wrappers
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> mutex should be a generic wrapping a type
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> like in rust
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> but since c++ doesnt have sum types like rust it wouldnt be safe anyway
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> well maybe u can do a safeish lock
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> use std::sync::Mutex;
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> let mutex = Mutex::new(0);
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> let mut guard = mutex.lock().unwrap();
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> *guard += 20;
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> // out of scope unlocks, or u can manually drop()
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> such a simple idea and so powerfull
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> why c++ doesnt have this
17:46 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> isnt this like that jukebox thing

18:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> "But with any new technology we have to approach it responsibly and that's not lost on us. It's start by recognizing that artificial intelligence is meant to amplify human creativity, not replace it" -actual quote from the video

18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they all talk shit anyway xd
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> AI is there to replace humans
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nothing else
18:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
18:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> replace rust
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even if they only do it partially, ppl will require more and more capabilities
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and at some point they need the capability of smth over a normal human can do
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and this AI is probably more intelligent than a human, so we also dunno if we can control it

18:17 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> anyways sometimes i wish ai wasnt trying to replace us. if people were smart and had ai be sort of like, co-exist with us instead of trying to dominate us, then it'd be better
18:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but with every new ai model implimented, people just use it as an excuse for them not to do the "hard work"
