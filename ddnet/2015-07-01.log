00:01 <@deen> Oh, GER is shutting down immediately
00:01 <@deen> nice
00:02 < Learath2> ???
00:04 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ger-mail.txt
00:05 < Learath2> how much is ger monthly ?
00:05 <@deen> nice news after USA going away as well and Chile having ping 150 for half the players
00:06 <@deen> 33 $ / month or 337 $ for a year
00:10 < Learath2> I can take it tomorrow and give you one more month to figure out what to do if its not actually going down in 10secs or smth
00:10 <@deen> take it?
00:11 < Learath2> well he said on his mail he can transfer it to another account on nfo
00:12 <@deen> I guess I'll make an account at that hoster. i don't think we can find a better hoster
00:12 < Learath2> just saying i could sponsor another month
00:12 <@deen> and ask xrothx to transfer it over to me
00:12 <@deen> same for the usa server probably
08:26 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: do you know how to compile teeworlds win 64bit?
11:16 <@deen> EastByte: with a 64bit gcc?
11:17 <@deen> any reason to do that btw?
11:17 <@deen> all windows versions support win64 and hopefully the client won't need more than 4 GB
11:17 <@deen> ah, can't use the nice new 64bit instructions, hm
11:18 <@deen> maybe i should try building 64bit ddnet client for win
11:19 <@EastByte> I think we should try it atleast
11:19 <@EastByte> to offer a 64bit version
11:19 <@deen> yeah, i'm curious how much faster it is on modern cpus
11:20 <@deen> oh, maybe that's why some people complain that ddnet client has a bit lower fps than vanilla!
11:20 <@EastByte> and there still is possibility for prediction fails due to the 32bit fpu?
11:21 <@deen> well, some servers run 32bit
11:21 <@deen> so you have prediction fails no matter what. should just switch over to fixed size float numbers
11:32 <@deen> i could actually use wine to build the windows versions, but i think i'll stay with my VMs for now
11:49 <@deen> but it's funny that it's easier to build a portable windows binary on linux than a portable linux binary on linux =/
11:54 <@EastByte> ^^
11:54 <@deen> for some definition of "funny"
12:01 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I don't, but I think SushiTee does
12:01 <@heinrich5991> no idea if he's still active, though
12:02 <@heinrich5991> what's the reason for 64bit though?
12:02 <@heinrich5991> float is 32bit on both 32bit and 64bit systems
12:03 <@deen> is it really?
12:04 <@deen> i always had problems with tunes working only on 32bit or 64bit
12:04 <@deen> depending on where the mapper tested them
12:05 <@deen> ah, it's just the internal precision that seems to change
12:05 <@heinrich5991> yes, it's really 32bit on both
12:06 <@heinrich5991> but internal precision won't affect the results
12:06 <@deen> sure it will
12:06 <@deen> you always get some small error in floats
12:06 <@heinrich5991> no. each result is defined by the standard
12:08 <@deen> I think it's x86 vs sse, see for example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22710272/difference-in-floating-point-arithmetics-between-x86-and-x64
12:08 <@deen> x87*
12:08 <@heinrich5991> as I understand it, the result of each floating point operation is round(operand1 <op> operand2)

12:15 <@heinrich5991> mh, ok, seems my idea of it was wrong
12:15 <@heinrich5991> deen: as you say, fixed-point might be the solution
12:26 <@deen> switching to fixed point numbers would probably break too many maps
13:22 <@deen> now i have a problem. i don't have opus libs for win64
13:22 <@deen> guess i need to compile them myself

16:58 <@deen> i need to redesign the downloads website
17:01 <@deen> should just copy the layout of the TW site, looks better
17:03 <@EastByte> yea would be better to have changelogs next to the links
17:03 <@deen> exactly, and links vertical
17:03 <@deen> i thought of that on my own, then i checked the TW website, and that's just what they have^^

20:55 < Learath2> deen: do you happen to know that there is a huge hole in hardcore7 
20:57 < Learath2> not sure if you fix up oldschool maps tho
20:58 <@deen> huge hole?
20:58 <@deen> can you cheat the entire map or just skip a few parts?
20:58 <@deen> the latter we keep in oldschool maps
20:58 <@deen> the former we fix
20:59 < Learath2> not the entire map but a good 20 min portion i guess
20:59 < Learath2> cant quite calculate how much you skip b/c dont quite remember how long it took
20:59 <@deen> then everyone used that cheat already and I'd have to remove all ranks, which is not great
21:00 < Learath2> prolly
21:15 <@deen> Tadaa, a new site: http://ddnet.tw/funding/
21:20 < laxa> nice !
21:20 < laxa> No teamspeak server :D
21:20 <@deen> haha, right, let me add that :P
21:20 < laxa> How do you decide which donation is going to which server ?
21:20 <@deen> they all get split among them
21:20 < laxa> my donation was in 2015 no ?
21:20 < laxa> ok
21:20 <@deen> but GER and USA were sponsored until now
21:20 <@deen> so they're half payed for 2015
21:21 < laxa> Maybe a list of all donators would be appreciated
21:21 <@deen> and let's just forget about 2014 and 2013^^
21:21 <@deen> Yeah, I thouht about that as well
21:21 <@deen> Give them a badge on forum and a list somewhere?
21:21 < laxa> No
21:21 < laxa> Just their name with maybe amount donated
21:21 < laxa> with option to hide or not
21:21 < laxa> you know the opera ?
21:21 <@deen> no
21:22 < laxa> hum
21:22 < laxa> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera
21:22 < laxa> the Paris Opera has a list of all donators
21:22 < laxa> but you gotta give a huge amount of money to appear in their list :p
21:23 <@deen> so?
21:23 < laxa> Well, I think it's standart nowadays
21:23 < laxa> about donation/coding
21:24 < laxa> names of people investing are stored somewhere :p
21:24 < laxa> This is an example : https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/l-opera-et-vous/ami-mecenes/les-mecenes-et-les-grands-donateurs
21:24 < laxa> In this case, they make a difference between huge giver and small giver
21:26 < laxa> I think it's confusing to separate the cost of each server
21:26 < laxa> maybe do something like
21:26 < laxa> xxx / 2000 total server
21:26 < laxa> and cost of each server
21:26 < laxa> * total servers cost
21:26 <@deen> well, the idea is that people can also write which server they want to donate for
21:27 < laxa> Ok
21:27 < laxa> it's confusing to me, and if I donate, I don't care for which server it is. I give for server costs
21:28 <@deen> i think some people will find it interesting
21:28 <@deen> I always get asked what each server costs etc
21:28 <@deen> so i can direct them to this site now
21:28 < laxa> anoder idea, if you get too much donation, you can make stretch goals for goodies or new server opening
21:29 <@deen> well, i could also pay off the last 2 years where i didn't get donations :P
21:29 < laxa> also, thinking now
21:29 <@deen> but I'm not going to get too many donations anyway
21:29 < laxa> maybe ddnet could make his own API :p
21:30 <@deen> I think it would be misleading if I sum up all the server costs
21:30 < laxa> That's not what I mean
21:30 < laxa> you let the total cost of each server
21:30 <@deen> for example someone from south africa would donate, thinking he supports the south african server, but pays nothing for it
21:31 <@deen> because it's fully sponsored already
21:31 < laxa> you say : ger cost 400e / year
21:31 < laxa> but you say : we need 1000 euros / year
21:31 < laxa> 1000 being the total cost of not sponsored servers
21:31 <@deen> yeah, but why would someone from south africa want to pay the german servers?
21:32 < laxa> they donate to ddnet
21:32 < laxa> not south africa especially
21:33 < laxa> that's just my 2 cents, do whatever you feel best :)
21:33 <@deen> thanks
21:33 < laxa> it just confused me on first sight
22:01 <@deen> who of you guys just donated?^^
22:03 < savander> funding is automated or you just adding data?
22:11 <@deen> i do it by hand
22:11 <@deen> you can look at it, it's just some ugly javascript
22:11 <@deen> laxa: now added a "Total 2015" thing
22:11 < savander> (can be generated by python or something haha)
22:12 <@deen> sure, but didn't want to calculate around in css
22:13 <@deen> Now about the donors, it's a bit difficult to find out who they even are =/
22:13 <@deen> i just see their paypal name often, hm
22:13 < savander> http://getbootstrap.com/components/#progress
22:14 < savander> you have bootstrap
22:14 <@deen> savander: feel free to change it to use bootstrap
22:14 <@deen> i just did it quick and dirty, no idea about web tech
22:14 < savander> &&.
22:14 < savander> ^^.
22:15 < savander> will be on new site!
22:19 <@deen> paypal takes a lot of the donations
22:20 <@deen> 5 â‚¬ sent => 4.40 â‚¬ received
22:20 < savander> fee :?
22:20 < savander> ;/
22:20 <@deen> yeah
22:20 < savander> it wasn't free?
22:20 < savander> in some countries?
22:20 <@deen> yes, but people don't know how
22:20 <@deen> hm, I guess I'll write the explanation text again
22:20 < savander> ye, you should
22:21 <@deen> but no one used my tips even when it was on the site^^
22:22 < savander> do it like: if you click paypal -> redirect to new site with instructions
22:22 < savander> then to paypalxD
22:23 < savander> €
22:23 < savander> omg
22:24 < savander> i couldn't found this!
22:24 < savander> on windows it's easier hahaha
22:24 < savander> alt + u 
22:24 < savander> on debian now, Right Alt + 5
22:24 < savander> ^^>
22:24 <@deen> alt + u is Âµ?
22:24 < savander> â†“
22:25 < savander> nope
22:25 < savander> â†‘
22:25 < savander> €‰%
22:25 < savander> lol.
22:25 <@deen> I like this list of key bindings for common unicode stuff: https://github.com/kragen/xcompose/blob/master/dotXCompose
22:25 <@deen> also works in tw of course
22:27 < savander> shortcut to make a screenshot?
22:27 < savander> you know maybe?
22:27 <@deen> f-something
22:27 < savander> of window ofc!
22:27 < savander> not whole screen
22:27 <@deen> ah, not in teeworlds
22:27 <@deen> no idea, i have my own
22:27 < savander> lol
22:27 < savander> shift + printscr
22:27 <@deen> shift-print for me
22:27 <@deen> oh^^
22:27 < savander> ^^.
22:28 < savander> and i can make a selection
22:28 <@deen> good choice by ubuntu
22:28 <@deen> debian*
22:28 < savander> it's not cinamon choice?
22:28 <@deen> dunno, i don't use that
22:28 < savander> http://imgbox.com/7buuecyR
22:29 < savander> cinnamon  -> window manager
22:29 <@deen> there are way too many forks happening in the windowing space
22:33 < savander> meh, python doesn't support incrementation by ++?:C
22:34 <@deen> yes, and that's a good thingâ„¢
22:35 < savander> why?
22:35 <@deen> nim doesn't either
22:35 < savander> why it's good thing?
22:35 < savander> want to know :D
22:35 <@deen> because ++ can be used inline and lead to bugs and/or confuse people who read the code
22:36 < savander> so it's for cleaner code?
22:36 <@deen> yes
