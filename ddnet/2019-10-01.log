16:06 <+Ryozuki> Hacktoberfest is here
16:07 <+Ryozuki> Maybe tag some issues with it
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Can I choose a repo for hacktoberfest?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh ty for the reminder time to get free clothes.
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> well they cost time
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have applied this commit to 0.7 (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/39704a04a7c7e4db04d90b13c989ec94b4b42202), its working fine so far but now when the chat is opened or i am in /pause (so whenever ResetInput() is called) it will just continue the last movement
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If I also reset m_SavedInput in this function, just like the normal one it does work, but that isnt made in ddnet, so there has to be another way?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut it seems the staging branch has a backup of the old ddnet7 branch
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut ah, perhaps you pushed new changes without pulling the ones from github first?
