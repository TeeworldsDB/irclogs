05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeverEndingCycle> Anyone know how to compile the fng2 server on windows?
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeverEndingCycle> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeverEndingCycle> I tried with CMake and MinGW, but I couldn't get past this error:

09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @deen is map search broken for website or is it just me?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> When I click on a map or search for a map it gives me a white screen
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> didnt i read something that u can load saves on any server now?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti yes, should work. doesn't?
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> just wanted to be sure because it would be a mess to deal with the different servers when i have good ping on 5 different locations xd
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @TearlessAbyss46 what browser u using
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> Only tried with chrome atm
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 thanks, fixed
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It was only broken for the country-specific map pages: https://ddnet.tw/maps/ger/Kobra
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Normal one worked: https://ddnet.tw/maps/Kobra

10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> New android rls when
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti When someone fixes the build and stuff
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :feelsbadman:
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's some work and I don't want do it personally
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but personally I think watching and chatting would be enough, don't need fancy playing ability
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> yes
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> chatting is super unnattractive in android client
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> and i only use it for spec and chat sometimes but 903 is banned
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> an android client focused on watching and chatting that doesn't suck to use would be cool
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I unbanned 903 btw
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> 903 is also Some cheat client, Baumalein i think thats why its banned
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its an old version of pwnclient
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> o
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> nby knows ofc
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> baumalein is 16 or 708
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> HMM
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> deen unbanned pwnclient, gonna test :troll:
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> really no fun with trolls everywhere, I'm banning it again
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it easy to change the version number of mobile client to 902 or 904 or something
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> i tested and it worked with my special pwnclient
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753543397662261288/Screenshot_2020-09-10-11-11-07-246_tw.ddnet.jpg
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> deen i was joking i dont have any bot client xd
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats what they all say
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> U especially
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i literally set my bot client version to 999999 to make it as obvious as possible, so no, U
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> im on 14071 so no U
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> stop spoof
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> i would press update if it had Ctrl shift q bind
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen i just tried and 903 works?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it take time to take effect
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> > I unbanned 903 btw
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Cuz he unbaned
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 4:11 AM] deen: really no fun with trolls everywhere, I'm banning it again
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> he said he banned it again
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or plans on it
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> when was the last time someone tried to join with 903 pwn on fng
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> honestly ive never seen it on fng, but on bombay a few people
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mostly jericho
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Jericho still alive??
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> unfortunately
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> üôÑ
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> big ban
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> He annoying DDRace player and sometimes blocking didnt see him long time
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because he was namebanned on ddnet for botting all the time
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lol
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :kek:
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> he plays with stupid names like Medivh and Grubby now
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if atall
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lifeban range
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i did lol
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on my server banned his /16
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on my server banned his /16 forever
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753545246037508166/lifeban-2.jpg
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :feelsamazingman: :feelsamazingman: :feelsamazingman:
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti and to answer ur question, yeah its been at least a month since ive seen him, i assume it is because the client bans on most servers deters him from playing
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if this is removed he may come back and start using it again
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont ban 903 but i did ban a huge range to get rid of him
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> HMM last finish in february
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and bombay/ddnet do ban 903
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and well i guess thats when he was finally namebanned
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> once they banned 903, he switchd to sash client
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @Melio explain urself playing with a botter
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753546146651308042/Screenshot_2020-09-10-11-22-53-455_com.android.chrome.jpg
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> smh
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ban
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> so many old players in that list
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lol
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> They all robot friends
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont know hardly any of those names lol
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ochirej is his dummy obviously
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Im also a robot friend
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> who is that
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Since im friends with noby
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Jericho
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> XD havent seen him in ages
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Same
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> he was banned finally
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> he wasnt even good, how was he a botter
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lmao
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well, if he was good, he wouldnt be botting
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> he was a rager
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Always angry eyes
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> with a valik fake skin
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Melio i literally never saw him without a bot client lol
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mustve banned him twenty times on block server
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Wolf is playing again btw
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :feelsamazingman:
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and several times on ddnet too
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does not even try to hide it
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/345588928482508801/631862516754022410/Screen_Shot_2019-10-10_at_9.35.49_AM.png
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also that
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> shameless hammerbotting
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> i remember him playing weird at times, but i wouldve never thought of a bot since he was really not good
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> I played heaven with him
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :feelsbadman:
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> remove rank pls
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> remove louis
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Melio i think he was just good at hiding it
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> by being bad
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Melio> xd
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> what is hammetriggerbot and m4hbot?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π hammertriggerbot looks for a certain pattern of inhuman firing combined with snapping mouse movement (inaccurate name, i know) and the m4hbot on this server is the name for the new hammerbot detections
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> where each of the systems looks for a different combination of 4 factors across a span of hammers and isnt as easy to explain as the first one
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tldr; if someone triggers all of that stuff and doesnt have a dummy theyre basically 100% cheating
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> "and doesnt have a dummy" we know how to hide our cheats now üòé
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> at least use up some mod's time watching to see if its a dummy or not i guess
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> does [bbvideo][/bbvideo] work on desktop?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> desktop?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that looks like forum syntax, doesn't work in ddnet forum anymore i think
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> often i see links like [bbvideo][/bbvideo] on my phone's chrome browser
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> (on ddnet forum)
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, no
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's just broken in the forum
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you can just click the link
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and i'm too lazy to fix it since the forum software seems a bit messy and no one uses the forum anyway
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753640721969446942/unknown.png
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Add scrollbar xD
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> remove servers üòÑ
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol so many now
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do we still have KR servers even?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> filter says yes
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I added Korea back today actually
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or Just put all the European servers into EU flag?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> üòÑ
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we only have GER and PL
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd be for the scroll still xd
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 could you merge the style thing?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd like to prepare my next PR with that included
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 any chance to get my two larger changes in? skin downloader and start menu, would be nice to beta test them a bit before release
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll look at the start menu, that one seemed simpler
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen is quicker than me üòõ
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take a look at the skin downloader
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen will be the first one to complain when his PR hits the style checker
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I call it now
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (just execute `python3 scripts/fix_style.py` before committing)
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can probably add it as a pre-commit hook or something
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nah, at work I'm responsible for a tool that does these kinds of clang-format/tidy/etc runs on changes, so I can't complain with good conscience üòÑ
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay üòÑ
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll add a precommit hook
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not a good idea to do a precommit hook imo
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sometimes clang-format will totall destroy your layout. I prefer to do it between commit and push so I can check what it changed
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, how do you get the changes in then?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> either change it in a way clang-format likes it
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or // clang-format off, // clang-format on
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, I mean how do you get the style changes made by fix_style if you don't do it before you commit
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just an amend?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do git add
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then fix_style
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then you see the changes it made with git-diff
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> git commit -a --amend
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen do we still need dilate?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought that went away with the new renderer or something
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think so, you can remove it
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wait
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we need dilate
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we don't need borderfix/add/etc
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen concern about the skin downloader:
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we haven't reviewed the skins in the DB for sanity
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> indeed
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's an invisible skin
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does the language stuff have to be part of that PR? It's making the diff rather annoying to review
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I guess you added a new localized string too
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I always add the localized strings
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just skip the data files when reviewing?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah sure
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get distracted very easily, that's why it bothered me I guess, but it is actually part of this pr
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The code looks good, I'll test it for a bit
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> üôÇ
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen can you remove invisible from the skin db?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all other skins at least remotely look like a tee
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @deen i dont think its necessary to reserve a slot on Testservers xx
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk if the limitation of divisability by 16 applies to skins too, but maybe we should run them through to check for that aswell
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should probably get a list of most used mapres and ask some artists to work on undoing the borderfix
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if it's worth spending artist's time on this
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds waay to large of a task
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's one of the reasons people whine about the new renderer
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the other one being the opengl driver deciding to use LOD1 while we are at default zoom
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I still don't get neither why the driver decides this at all nor why we can't control it at all)
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I get a 404 on all skins
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you forget to set up nginx or sth?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, the new renderer seems to absolutely kill macOS performance outside the game
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> More like chrome performance, seems only chrome, discord and spotify are affected
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does dilate do btw?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems it hogs the GPU even while it's not in view at all
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Edge_padding maybe?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, it pads edges
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If a pixel is transparent but has a non transparent neighbour, it takes it's color instead
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though idk why we need it, maybe the old renderer was susceptible to the same issue
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, now that I think about it, I don't get why we'd ever need it
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 fixes
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed*
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> We needed dilate because without it stuff rendered ingame had weird white border in most cases, sometimes the custom graphics were even displaying as totally black if dilate was not used
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 i can delete the empty skin, which one is it?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, found it
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> The opengl alpha blending causes some rendering problems without dilate. 0.7 fixed it by using premultiplied alpha for textures and colors
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> We need dilate tool, because inkscape export transparent pixels as zeros(no color)
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> When OpenGL linearly interpolates from the texture it will interpolate between black(zeros) and colored pixels, that's why a wrong color gets displayed for these edge cases.
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does dilate fix that? After the texture is dilated, the pixel is set to full alpha, wont the same issue occur the next pixel over
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Thats how a non dilated tileset will look like after splitting alpha and hiding alpha
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753664670887575553/unknown.png
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> and that's how it will look like on a dilated one
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753665051604418701/unknown.png
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does splitting and hiding alpha mean in this context?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> taking out transparency
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Taking out?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you mean making all pixels 100% opacity?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> yes exactly
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The dilated one looks like a glitchy mess, how does the renderer know what to render what to not?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> the full transparent pixels are ofc transparent and not even displayed (interpolating between two transparent pxiels)
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you show me the dilated one without maxing transparency everywhere?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> with alpha channel u dont see the extra pixel, they are still full transparent
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> I removed the opacity to show the difference
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> I removed the transparencyto show the difference
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I missed the last step in dilate, it just takes the old alpha values and applies them everywhere
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aha, it dilates many times, not just once
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 11 times
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> https://developer.nvidia.com/content/alpha-blending-pre-or-not-pre
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix doesn't really seem to be the same issue, is it?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I guess premutiplying would fix this too
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, at 0 alpha wont the edges still be just pitch black, causing interpolation issues?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Well that causes multiple issues. The edge thing is just one of them
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> there are some interesting things you might want to know about this tool:
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> 1. It does not have a threshold for alpha values, thats why in the 2nd pic from mind, there are some broken pixels(e.g. inkscape exports some pixels with alpha values of 10 or less (10 / 255)
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> 2. The pre multiplied alpha(if not generated before) requires CPU time on fly, so a disadvantage too
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> But 0.7 fixes it with that approach
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is opengl blending like this anyway? The pixel with 0 alpha shouldn't even render, why interpolate to it?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> never really digged into blending and filtering with opengl =\
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if anyone even knows these things. Whenever I chat with graphics people it's always soooo handwavy
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> call jupstar our opengl guy :bluekitty:
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> the cpu time for premultiplying when loading the few images is kinda negligible
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If GCC produced binaries that only works on 90% of computers, there'd be outrage
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yet opengl seems to be almost ubiquitous with it's horrendous compatibility
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vulkan takes the problem of no one complying with standards and moves the responsibility of keeping track of all the broken shit to the developer
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that true tho
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkan givesu  more control
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess atleast vulkan primitives always work on cards that claim to support vulkan
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u can indeed work around the shit maybe
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, atleast it gives you the tools to work with the mess you are handed by the driver people
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even web people aren't this lenient with api version compliance. The answer to "Which github api version does your client interface with" is never "Oooh idk, it's like 4.5 but we are kinda missing some features"
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or "it mostly complies with 4.5" üòÑ
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/SuperSDL/blob/master/src/graphics/renderer.cpp
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me trying to use vulkan, i dont touch this since long so i dont remember shit now
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah the vulkan experience 570 lines, did you get anything rendering? üòÑ
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe a triangle
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got a pyramid rotating around shaded flat at around 700-800 lines
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i definitly dont want to be a graphics programmer
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One problem with vulkan is that there doesn't seem to be best practices around yet, and only driver people have the knowledge required to know the best way of doing something
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just hand me a ez api
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's much more fun on a gameboy
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> there are best practices :D
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> per vendor and per architecture
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i want to make a game for gameboy or a old console like that
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its super hard
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hi jao
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The good old days when you could actually take a nice opcode table and know exactly what the processor will do
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/SimpleGame/blob/master/src/engine/graphics/renderer.c
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one is with opengl
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually got to render lot of stuff
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even text
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's so odd that we can do calculations in fractions of cycles nowadays
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.2 cycles for a 64bit 64bit multiply
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki why didn't you use gl1?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gl1?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> opengl 1?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> y
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like shiny new stuff
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho the whole thing is in pure C
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xDD
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to get it to run on your toaster ovens temperature display
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have so many abandoned stuff
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are u the same? xd
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Attention span way too short sadly
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> writing that "SimpleGame" was fun tho
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more a engine than a game tho
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> To answer the question, because the alpha blend function is set like that.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> when texture sampling happens it will multiply RGB with the textures alpha
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> with pre multiplied alpha it does basically nothing(multiplies it with 1)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> => the average pixel from the texture sampler is not affected by the transparency of the transparent pixel, bcs pre multiplied
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> 
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> So only the framebuffer is still affected by the transparency of the sampled texture
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> 
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> example with full white and full zero pixel
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> without pre alpha
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> (1, 1, 1, 1) + (0, 0, 0, 0) = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> => (0.5 * 0.5, 0.5 * 0.5, 0.5 * 0.5, 0.5) + (Framebuffer.RGB * 0.5)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> 
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> with pre alpha:
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> (1, 1, 1, 1) + (0, 0, 0, 0) = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> note, no multiply here, bcs pre multiplied:
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) + (Framebuffer.RGB * 0.5)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> 
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> that's also why dilate will look different than pre multiplied, but i cannot judge what looks better, both have advantages and disadvantages
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> implementing simple stuff feels good
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ so when blending it considers pixels with 0 alpha too for some reason?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> yes
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> interpolation is faster then if checking
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And between two pixels with the same alpha, isn't the rgb blended?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> yes exactly (rgb + rgb)/2
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But if the rgb is blended, even after you premultiply, won't you have issues at the edges?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki you know what's great working on older hardware? None of that floating point junk, you get to work with nice actual pixels
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> it looks different but its not a problem cause alpha isnt multiplied, so its a smooth transition
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://streamable.com/bsdzf8
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i implemented a switch button there :o
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> beautiful
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ huh, I'd think it'd look odd if you blend to black while the background is obviously not black
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki cute button
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> but its a smooth transition into transparency
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> its not like its directly black because its still colored
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well at the edges it'll effectively be (rgb + black) / 2 which is just rgb/2. That's effectively halving the lightness, There'd be a darker outline around two bright colors, I think
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Same thing happens in photography if you ever work with raw files on an older camera, you can spot the parts where the interpolation algorithm gets a little thrown off while debayering
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> but its not like this
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> but remember non pre muiltiplied does this:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> ((1, 1, 1, 1) + (0, 0, 0, 0)) / 2 = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> AND THEN still multiplies the alpha again(pre multiplied does not do that):
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> (0.5 * 0.5, 0.5 * 0.5, 0.5 * 0.5, 0.5)
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i abandoned it after making some kind of tilemap :feelsbadman:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753676061920723015/unknown.png
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> cool colored noise
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ so it'd have an even darker outline if not premultiplied
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> yes
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there a way to not blend with that black at all?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not really a part of what we want to render
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 <https://github.com/edg-l/SimpleGame/blob/master/src/engine/entity.h> do u think this is a good aproach xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ò´œÉ—èŒµœÉ> yes with nearest sampling(nearest pixel), but the texture will look crisper, not so smooth
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, thanks for the insight
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki uh, is this like a fake vtable? üòÑ
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like ghetto things like this, so you are golden
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never actually seen how a vtable is
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A vtable is just a "struct" stored at the start of an object that has pointers to all its virtual methods
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ahh
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when you do a virtual call, the compiler makes sure it goes through the vtable
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's why virtual calls are kinda bad for high performance applications
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LLVM is getting there with devirtualization but it's still a huge amount of work
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have my linked list impl <https://github.com/edg-l/SimpleGame/blob/master/src/engine/list.c> :justatest:
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might be obvious to you and me that an object is of a type but it's actually quiiite murky with the rules of the standard üòÑ
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like linked list implementations, they are easy enough to implement intrusively
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gives you cache locality
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also, you can do something extremely cute to your `engine_list_delete`
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is it
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëÄ
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've made a rainbow dilate bug :justatest:
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753678809571524768/unknown.png
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did i tell u about my macro magic? <https://github.com/edg-l/SimpleGame/blob/master/src/engine/math/vector.h> xD
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it's a doubly linked list though, not quite as pretty
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The macro stuff is sadly unavoidable
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The preprocessor is just so weak
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just c++ templating would clean that up pretty well, c++20 concepts would even make it relatively safe
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what c++ concepts?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++20
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++20 is coming with a great new feature called concepts
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It allows you to define concepts, concepts usually tell what something can be done with a type but they can check everything about types
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this like rust trait bounds?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/generics/bounds.html
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like it
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ syntax is rly ugly tho
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you can do something like `template<typename T> concept Incrementable = requires(T a) { {a++} -> T }; Incrementable increment(Incrementable x) { return x++; }`
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah like rust trait bounds, but I actually prefer the syntax
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I think rusts syntax isn't for human consumption at all so take my opinion about that with a grain of salt
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> c++'s take on that somewhat resembles go's interfaces
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a bit duck-typey
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's how templates always were, so it'd be hard to get away from that
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i find template syntax rly ugly idk
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Concepts bring with them the new template shorthand notation
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> struct S<T: Display + Debug>(T);
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would an and of concepts in c++20 look
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `void foo(auto k)` is now possible
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although maybe a bit nonobvious that it implies monomorphisation, leading to code bloat
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> auto in other places doesn't
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```cpp
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> template <class T>
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> concept Integral = std::is_integral<T>::value;
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> template <class T>
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> concept SignedIntegral = Integral<T> && std::is_signed<T>::value;
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> template <class T>
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> concept UnsignedIntegral = Integral<T> && !SignedIntegral<T>;
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki Correct me if I'm wrong but it wants T to satisfy both Display and Debug. right?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u have to define a new concept to use a conjunction?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah something like `template <class T> struct S { T a; } requires Display<T> && Debug<T>;` I think
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still learning the syntax, it's a rather new feature
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```cpp
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> template <class T = void>
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     requires EqualityComparable<T> || Same<T, void>
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> struct equal_to;
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah u can do it directly
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might need parens
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its from the cppreference web
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then it doesn't üòÑ
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cppreference best website
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uf i rly need to get used to this syntax
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just get so confused
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its just me
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reading templates
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is a nightmare
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, it's quite meh
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But these simple templates are nothing
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah xD
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should see the SFINAE monsters people write
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `template<class T, typename std::enable_if<!protocol7::is_sixup<T>::value, int>::type = 0>` this is mine, I'm very proud of it

20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's the only one I've ever produced
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well only one that got used in anything
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SFINAE is such a hack, I'm kinda disappointed that the standard supported this kind of thing honestly
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They really should have put their foot down and introduced better syntax for this
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Instead they made things like void_t, enable_if, is_greater...
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The point of std::enable_if is to cause substitution failure for a template. The reason why you want substitution failure is because it's not a failure,
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> okk
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looking at that stuff
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found out about https://github.com/agda/agda
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "dependently typed programming language "
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A theorem prover, something like coq?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o

20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a mathy language i see
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the first paragraph introducing it says anything about a theory,  you run
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's absolutely guaranteed to go waaaay over us mere mortals heads
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >Agda is also a proof assistant based on the propositions-as-types paradigm, but unlike Coq, has no separate tactics language, and proofs are written in a functional programming style.

20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the difference between coq
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its based on a  PhD thesis
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Leave it to the mathematicians to make something complicated, this man  Martin-L√∂f took something so pure and simple: Types. Made it into an absolute mess
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at this üòÑ

20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why is singapore so lonely?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/753688355509895358/unknown.png
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the order of countries seems random btw, maybe we should fix that
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I tried the skinfetcher but everything was giving me a 404

21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only logical next step
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Decimate Slack
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/293493549758939136/753640721969446942/unknown.png why we have different order of the countries?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nvm, didn't see deen's message xd
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen forum is down btw
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 403 Forbidden
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, fixed
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I want to add a .github workflow check that makes sure images are dilated. Should I do that in style.yml or in a new file?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> style.yml probably
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait, what files need to be dilated. Skins not?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only mapres?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk
