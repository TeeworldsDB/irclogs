15:07 < Nimda> HookThrough3 by [A] Awesome just released on Moderate at 2015-10-29 15:00
15:08 <+devnull> you run a https server on 'forum.ddnet.tw' with an invalid certificat
15:08 <+devnull> https://forum.ddnet.tw
15:20 <@heinrich5991> devnull: apparantly tls isn't supposed to work. maybe they should idsable it
15:21 <+devnull> http only login in forum
15:21 <+devnull> nice job
15:22 <@heinrich5991> good point
15:22 <+devnull> that is a invitation for mitm attacks
15:22 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:23 <@heinrich5991> mitm isn't even needed, you can just sniff the password
15:23 <+devnull> jups
15:54 < EastByte> heinrich5991: no reason to disable tls, self signed certificate works fine if it is manually accepted by the user
15:54 < EastByte> still waiting for letsencrypt beta invite for ddnet.tw
16:10 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: fundamentally insecure in some browsers
16:10 <@heinrich5991> e.g. chrome
16:10 < Learath2> EastByte: you could get a startssl cert
16:11 < Learath2> should be fine
16:12 <@heinrich5991> i.e. you could argue that the false sense of security is worse than the obviously bad http
16:12 < Learath2> or atleast fix the common name and unexpired
