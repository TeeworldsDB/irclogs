00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does anyone know if there is a way to search for images? xd
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i know there is like reverse image search but it needs the actually image. What if i have a rough imagination of a nice wallpaper i want. Can i skribble it in paint and ask the web to give me a similar version but in nice?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probs no
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sad :/
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> remember as much as you can and search for specific keywords
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean there is already this thing where i can skribble in paint and it creates photorealistic stuff so it was worth a hope i guess
