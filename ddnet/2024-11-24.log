00:54 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> help pls
00:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> so you’re the slownet guy
00:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
00:57 < bridge_> <Solly> (theres more than 1)
00:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> :pepeRage:

00:57 < bridge_> <Solly> (and they all awnt to claim ownership of it)
00:57 < bridge_> <Solly> (x-x)
01:00 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> lol
01:00 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> its just a game mode
01:17 < bridge_> <montikboom> Give me tunes
01:17 < bridge_> <montikboom> Plis
01:17 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> i bought it:(
01:18 < bridge_> <montikboom> ......
01:18 < bridge_> <Solly> https://github.com/Teero888/tune_calculator
01:18 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> yea, i was so lazy to do myself
01:18 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> wow

01:18 < bridge_> <montikboom> Pizdec
01:19 < bridge_> <Solly> ^ i hope that means idiot in russian
01:19 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> but not so good
01:19 < bridge_> <montikboom> I using this tunes
01:19 < bridge_> <montikboom> I mean
01:19 < bridge_> <montikboom> I will use
01:19 < bridge_> <Solly> its maths theres not multiple ways to do it
01:19 < bridge_> <Solly> and also you can just pull tunes from any server
01:19 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> for example an air jump impulse so low
01:19 < bridge_> <Solly> whats your server ip?
01:20 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yes, that's because it's the correct value
01:20 < bridge_> <totar> you need to adjust the values by hand a little bit
01:20 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you've got a higher ground jump impulse with the same gravity then you're making the jump too high
01:20 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> but on server it dont very good looks
01:20 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you've got a higher ground or air jump impulse with the same gravity then you're making the jump too high
01:20 < bridge_> <Solly> i guess that is fair
01:20 < bridge_> <totar> hook speed also is usually much higher
01:21 < bridge_> <montikboom> Where?
01:21 < bridge_> <totar> I made a few maps with slow tune years ago lol
01:21 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Hook speed higher than 80 is brokey for some reason
01:21 < bridge_> <montikboom> I have it
01:21 < bridge_> <montikboom> W map
01:22 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> i started a six servers slownets btw
01:22 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> idk why
01:22 < bridge_> <montikboom> I started the SlowNET hype btw
01:22 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> its so good
01:22 < bridge_> <montikboom> :kek:
01:22 < bridge_> <Solly> `    Console()->Register("tunes", "", CFGFLAG_SERVER, ConTunes, this, "List all tuning variables and their values");`
01:22 < bridge_> <Solly> its part of the base game x-x
01:23 < bridge_> <montikboom> Server or client?
01:23 < bridge_> <Solly> client
01:23 < bridge_> <Solly> oh wait u can only do it on server
01:23 < bridge_> <montikboom> We are now cooperating with [GS] servers btw
01:23 < bridge_> <Solly> `    Console()->Register("tunes", "", CFGFLAG_SERVER, ConTunes, this, "List all tuning variables and their values");` ->
01:23 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> good
01:24 < bridge_> <Solly> `    Console()->Register("tunes", "", CFGFLAG_SERVER, ConTunes, this, "List all tuning variables and their values");` ->
01:24 < bridge_> <Solly> `    Console()->Register("tunes", "", CFGFLAG_CLIENT | CFGFLAG_SERVER, ConTunes, this, "List all tuning variables and their values");` :)
01:24 < bridge_> <montikboom> there command in F1 to see all tunes on server
01:24 < bridge_> <Solly> im evil
01:24 < bridge_> <montikboom> This is how I got the tunes that were sold for $2
01:24 < bridge_> <Solly> what a hustle
01:24 < bridge_> <montikboom> And still selling
01:24 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> These IDIOTS oh god
01:24 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like literally it's just maths
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> some math is worth money
01:25 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and like, middle school physics
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> probably not the tunes
01:25 < bridge_> <montikboom> This is 900 lines of code to get slow
01:25 < bridge_> <montikboom> U just don't understand
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> ?
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> what
01:26 < bridge_> <totar> you don't need 900 lines
01:26 < bridge_> <montikboom> you need to write 900+ lines of code
01:26 < bridge_> <montikboom> To get slow
01:26 < bridge_> <totar> the entire website is less than 500 lines including the html and css
01:26 < bridge_> <montikboom> no u need to re-create whole ddnet server to get slow
01:27 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If we're just doing tunes then you only need a few more lines than the number of tunes...
01:27 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'd get if you're actually doing hacks on the server side to lower tick rate while pretending to the client that you're running a normal 50 tick server
01:27 < bridge_> <montikboom> u just don't understand
01:27 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You do NOT need to recreate the server, you just write a fancy little mod
01:28 < bridge_> <montikboom> No recreate whole ddnet server, dll's and the client
01:28 < bridge_> <montikboom> No, u need to recreate whole ddnet server, dll's and the client
01:28 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You mean recompile?
01:28 < bridge_> <totar> it's possible you could do a empirical
01:29 < bridge_> <montikboom> No, I know to get slow u need to create own os, own pc, own router, own server, own client
01:29 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok ok yeah now I get it
01:29 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> make sure to collect your own silicon sand and refine it by hand
01:30 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> bro wtf is slownet
01:30 < bridge_> <totar> it's possible you could do empirical tests by randomly adjusting the tune values and comparing it to a real modified tickrate to get tunes that are actually more accurate, due to quantization differences
01:30 < bridge_> <totar> but I doubt they do that
01:30 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't think the tune precision allows you to even take into account differences that small

01:33 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> funny
01:33 < bridge_> <Solly> theres not a client side get tunes command
01:33 < bridge_> <Solly> is there?

01:33 < bridge_> <montikboom> Yes

01:33 < bridge_> <Solly> what is it
01:33 < bridge_> <montikboom> Why do u need that
01:34 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> you can do `dbg_tuning 1`

01:35 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> i rad
01:35 < bridge_> <montikboom> U can also disable that on server, but players can't use antiping and prediction if there any tune changes
01:35 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> why would you want not to send tuning info lol
01:36 < bridge_> <montikboom> To donat leak it lal
01:37 < bridge_> <montikboom> Some geniuses leaking this tunes like "I'm hacker, I got tunes from websit 😎🤙🤙"
01:38 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i dont understand whats so fascinating about all of this
01:38 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> neither do i understand whats so hard in making tunes like this
01:38 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> genius
01:38 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> oh lol its all based on ddnet++
01:39 < bridge_> <montikboom> Ddnet++ have bugs
01:46 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The kind of people who can't bother to do basic math are also the kind of people who would play an easier version of the game rather than spend time practicing 😏
02:24 < bridge_> <zhn> nation of ||retardation||
02:32 < bridge_> <teero777> nice rhyme 🤙
02:33 < bridge_> <zhn> i have no other words for such a phenomenon
02:33 < bridge_> <zhn> even block servers had some kind of real reasons to war with each other
02:34 < bridge_> <zhn> there it's just... spreading tunes that are available to everyone? eh
02:35 < bridge_> <zhn> and still no real attempt to make an actual "slow" tickrate (maybe there's, ping if i have missed something)
02:36 < bridge_> <teero777> Well I could make a server like that but why the effort
02:36 < bridge_> <teero777> If it is just for a bunch of noobs
02:38 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I could do that too but my only motivation is simply out of spite towards these noobs thinking tunes are magic
02:38 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I could do that too but my only motivation is simply doing it out of spite towards these noobs thinking tunes are magic
02:39 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I wouldn't really have much use for it
02:39 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess having accurate slowmo collisions would be valuable for trying certain things out in slow motion
02:39 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> turns out it's not totally useless as a practice tool
02:42 < bridge_> <Solly> u need client support for that
02:42 < bridge_> <teero777> Accurate slowmo collisions? What are you talking about. Just only use tunes so the client prediction isn't broken. The serverside should use real slowmo
02:43 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yes that's what I was thinking of doing
02:45 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I was saying that the biggest value of making real slowmo would be fixing the collision issue, because that's the most noticeable problem
02:45 < bridge_> <teero777> quantization is a bigger problem imo but yes
02:46 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't care about correct discretization of time because I'm not trying to like make TASes
02:46 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it just needs to feel about right
02:52 < bridge_> <fantik08840> what to do if it says the server has not responded yet?
02:54 < bridge_> <fantik08840> ?
02:54 < bridge_> <Solly> is it a ger10 server
02:55 < bridge_> <fantik08840> no
02:55 < bridge_> <fantik08840> Redcastle
02:55 < bridge_> <Solly> probably the server, nothing u can do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
02:56 < bridge_> <fantik08840> how do others play?
02:56 < bridge_> <Solly> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
02:56 < bridge_> <Solly> do other servers work
02:57 < bridge_> <fantik08840> yes
02:57 < bridge_> <fantik08840> I can't come here
02:58 < bridge_> <fantik08840> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1310061825672351764/image.png?ex=6743d9a7&is=67428827&hm=7439c59d4d28206e55517c34d204a0db9f56dab03a937619e55db2a664c27e74&
03:00 < bridge_> <montikboom> :justatest:
03:00 < bridge_> <fantik08840> 😫
03:03 < bridge_> <zhn> not really, simulating slow tickrates possible with current one
03:04 < bridge_> <zhn> especially 25 ticks 10 ticks 5 ticks...
03:04 < bridge_> <zhn> where are you from?
03:05 < bridge_> <fantik08840> Ukraine
03:06 < bridge_> <Solly> how
03:06 < bridge_> <Solly> my client bugs out when u do that
03:07 < bridge_> <Solly> my client bugs out when u just decrease tickrate
03:07 < bridge_> <zhn> server is located in russia, ur isp blocks outgoing connection and so does isp of server but with incoming ukr connections
03:07 < bridge_> <zhn> so your only solution to use vpn
03:07 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You need to interpolate and create fake ticks server side
03:07 < bridge_> <Solly> prediction will still fail
03:08 < bridge_> <zhn> ive talked about slowing down physics, not tickrate of both parts
03:08 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> also send the client tunes that match the slowdown
03:08 < bridge_> <zhn> you can simulate 2x slowdown with default 50 tps
03:08 < bridge_> <Solly> that doesnt fix it?
03:09 < bridge_> <zhn> just ask client to not use prediction kekw
03:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Doesn't? Why not?
03:09 < bridge_> <Solly> a tiny tickrate difference screws up prediction
03:09 < bridge_> <zhn> theres little hack to do it but i don't know if im allowed to share it :p
03:09 < bridge_> <teero777> If you have a low ping it fixes it. Since you receive enough snaps
03:09 < bridge_> <Solly> and the error of setting tunes probably makes it no twork
03:09 < bridge_> <fantik08840> how my friend plays?
03:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That's why you send 50 ticks to the client even if only 25 of those ticks actually happened server side
03:09 < bridge_> <teero777> I would guess it is still better than normally
03:09 < bridge_> <zhn> his isp lets outgoing connection to this russian isp
03:10 < bridge_> <teero777> No, the server only sends 25tps in any case
03:10 < bridge_> <Solly> im saying the difference between 50 ticks with tunes and 25 ticks is enough to screw up prediction
03:10 < bridge_> <Solly> or atleast thats what i think
03:10 < bridge_> <zhn> just disable pred :troll:
03:10 < bridge_> <Solly> boo
03:11 < bridge_> <zhn> you can do so server side too btw
03:11 < bridge_> <Solly> server does prediction?
03:11 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it might be a bit jittery but over here we play with good ping 😤
03:13 < bridge_> <zhn> no, i meansl server can control clients prediction behavior
03:13 < bridge_> <zhn> in very rusty way but whatever
03:13 < bridge_> <Solly> with the 1 wide gores that are on slownet servers, a bit of jitter = annoyinh death all the time
03:13 < bridge_> <Solly> oh... but removing prediction makes it unplayable for alot of people
03:13 < bridge_> <zhn> no it actually doesnt
03:14 < bridge_> <zhn> specially if you are playing at 0.5x speed xd
03:14 < bridge_> <zhn> e*
03:14 < bridge_> <Solly> oh yeah i guess idk about that
03:14 < bridge_> <Solly> for normal servers doing precise anything with 50+ ping or higher is different
03:15 < bridge_> <Solly> it feels icky
03:15 < bridge_> <Solly> but with prediction up to 100 if fine x-x
03:15 < bridge_> <Solly> i mean was playing 250 with some person and it was fine except they had to be static for me to hook them
03:17 < bridge_> <zhn> i don't really play with default pred since im a proud antiping user so
03:17 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The game is very playable at 150-ish ping as long as you train your friends to move predictably when you're trying to hook them
03:17 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> cant you just use cheat engine or something to slow the game locally?
03:17 < bridge_> <zhn> antiping did let me to play on chn server back then with 300 ping
03:17 < bridge_> <Solly> u can slow down the game and server, but u can also just change the tickrate on both
03:18 < bridge_> <zhn> but they are skilled enough now to kill lagging bag of balls
03:18 < bridge_> <zhn> or you can slowdown it server side kekeke
03:18 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I play on US with 130 ping like half of the time so I'm also a big antiping enjoyer
03:19 < bridge_> <Solly> and client will go AAAAAAA
03:19 < bridge_> <zhn> no, since i don't change net tickrate
03:19 < bridge_> <zhn> only physics are being slowed down
03:19 < bridge_> <Solly> ....
03:20 < bridge_> <Solly> cheat engine slow down or any speed hack works by replacing the library functions which return time
03:20 < bridge_> <Solly> which makes the server run as if it is at 25 ticks/second if u were to slow it down to 50%
03:20 < bridge_> <zhn> i didn't get the reference honestly
03:20 < bridge_> <Solly> ?
03:21 < bridge_> <zhn> what exactly you wanted to say in contrary of this xd
03:21 < bridge_> <zhn> your dots are angry :justatest:
03:21 < bridge_> <Solly> my dots are disapointed
03:21 < bridge_> <Solly> assuming you didnt know that speed hacks worked by changing how the program sees time
03:23 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> My speed hacks work by replacing the quartz crystal used by my CPU clock
03:23 < bridge_> <Solly> .... (these are angry dots)
03:23 < bridge_> <zhn> my solution (and probably teeros too since i don't there's more than 1 good approach to this exact thing) doesn't have to use any time hacks
03:23 < bridge_> <Solly> "ah yes let me reduce my clock speed by 2x, that will decrease the tickrate" (ass argument)
03:23 < bridge_> <zhn> i don't think*
03:24 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Hey it's my solution too :)
03:24 < bridge_> <zhn> our solution 🇨🇳
03:25 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We all have the same obvious solution and Solly seems to disagree about whether it'd work before even trying
03:25 < bridge_> <Solly> because the reduce tickrate by half and tell the client is easy x-x
03:25 < bridge_> <zhn> nah they just thought of changing exactly tickrate
03:25 < bridge_> <Solly> youre welcome to try but its alot of effort to do it your way
03:25 < bridge_> <zhn> they don't understand what we want to do xd
03:25 < bridge_> <Solly> (and i aint doing it)
03:26 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well completing the actual variable tickrate PR is *also* a lot of work
03:26 < bridge_> <Solly> make tunes halve speed, but on server actually run at 25tps and interpolate
03:26 < bridge_> <Solly> ive already done it x-x
03:26 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok so then get it merged >:)
03:27 < bridge_> <zhn> make tunes tickrate dependent*
03:27 < bridge_> <Solly> and if youre going for half speed, stick 0.5 in teeros epic tune calculator
03:27 < bridge_> <Solly> its sortof a tas tool so it cant
03:28 < bridge_> <Solly> it works perfeclty if the tickrate doesnt change mid session, if you do then prediction messes up for some time
03:28 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is it a significant length of time?
03:28 < bridge_> <Solly> depends on the difference between the start and end tickrate
03:28 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'd expect it to only take like a fraction of a second...
03:29 < bridge_> <Solly> but if you set it at start then there is no prediction to mess up
03:29 < bridge_> <Solly> its my crummy implementation rather than an actual restriction
03:29 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is prediction based on a long period of previous ticks, not just the couple latest ones received?
03:29 < bridge_> <zhn> its not precise enough i think
03:30 < bridge_> <Solly> if you just half the tickrate then yes it is, you can play the map at half tick rate, save demo, replay on full speed
03:30 < bridge_> <Solly> i dont actually know why it messes up, it just does
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> your latency is the biggest factor in messing up prediction, tick rate only matters because it affects your average latency.
03:33 < bridge_> <Solly> oh oke
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> well
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> I guess if the server is using inaccurate prediction then the tick rate would matter a little bit more
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> I guess if the server is using inaccurate physics then the tick rate would matter a little bit more
03:34 < bridge_> <totar> but you would be desyncing on every single tick so it would be pretty bad
03:34 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ohhh, that makes perfect sense
03:34 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I remember spending a fair bit of time working on latency estimates that one time I wrote proper netcode for a little game thing
03:34 < bridge_> <totar> but you would be desyncing on every single tick so it would be pretty bad either way
03:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @montikboom what bugs did you find in ddnet++?
03:44 < bridge_> <montikboom> When you are in another Team, you can vote for any server setting, and if you are alone in the Team then it will be applied instantly
03:44 < bridge_> <montikboom> This is one of the bugs, there may be others, but I didn't try to look for them.
03:49 < bridge_> <zhn> are these votes supposed to be team-wide?
03:50 < bridge_> <montikboom> I didn't understand
05:25 < bridge_> <louis> what do u mean when u say tick rate
05:30 < bridge_> <Solly> ticks/second
05:31 < bridge_> <louis> i wonder if tunes can perfectly replicate halved speed for everything except collisions
05:32 < bridge_> <louis> probably not because a lot of calculations are interpolated between ticks
05:32 < bridge_> <Solly> non
05:35 < bridge_> <louis> normal clients wouldn't go crazy though, i think your position would only get desynced on a few niche events
05:35 < bridge_> <louis> + the slower the multiplier is the less you'd be able to tell
05:37 < bridge_> <totar> quantization is rough
05:37 < bridge_> <totar> you only get 32 positions per tile
05:38 < bridge_> <totar> so if you have really low gravity you basically just float in a horizontal line
05:39 < bridge_> <louis> i bet you could probably run at 1/5 speed and just teleport the player to each new tick 10 times a second instead of actually sending the physics
05:39 < bridge_> <louis> then if you have cl_predict 0 on client your movements would register on the next tick under 100 ping? i'm not sure if that works
05:40 < bridge_> <louis> you'd be playing in 10 frames per second though 🤣
05:41 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> low framerate is a whole lot less noticeable when the movement is very slow
05:42 < bridge_> <Solly> youd be heavily relying on intra tick aiming
05:42 < bridge_> <Solly> youd be heavily relying on intra tick aiming (not a problem)
05:45 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> When I skimmed some of the code I think I saw places where values are truncated instead of rounded? Which is obviously extra bad for very small velocities and accelerations
06:32 < bridge_> <Solly> ```
