07:39 <+Learath2> I'll ban myself
07:39 <+vali> you are abusing your permissions
07:40 <+Learath2> i'd ask you which one but I have better things to do
07:40 <+vali> they should take your permission away
07:40 <+vali> you cant handle your permissions
07:42 <+Learath2> I'd love to stay here and chat with you but I have bureucracy to attend to
07:42 <+Learath2> feel free to yammer on
12:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> wtf
14:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Laboon just a troll
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> oh ok
16:37 <+laxadedi> https://ravomavain.eu who is the owner of that host already ?
16:38 <@heinrich5991> ravomavain
16:40 <+laxadedi> thanks
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> gandi.net ?
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xd
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> <vali> troll?
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <vali> you abused your permissions with another moderator
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
18:30 <+vali_> captain niveau wir sinken
18:31 <+vali_> was wollt ihr denn noch alles machen?
18:31 <+vali_> ich servier euch die wahrheit ins gesicht
18:31 <+vali_> deen bekomm mal dein affenzirkus wieder in die reihe
18:32 <+vali_> alles unterqualifizierte moderatoren/admins
18:32 <+vali_> die warten nur darauf das ich auf einen server joine und werde gebannt
18:33 <+vali_> und jetzt haben sie mich in discord gebannt weil sie keine ahnung haben wie man Ã¼berhaupt einen discord server leitet
18:33 <+vali_> for anyone who doesnt speak "GERMAN , please use a translator
18:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't care ;D
18:34 <+vali_> i only wrote you cant handle your permissions and i get a ban?
18:34 <+vali_> really sad life 
18:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You are write the story
18:36 <+vali_> 80% of the ddnet team does nothing against bots and blockers on the servers
18:36 <+vali_> but if vali comes, then you must annoy/ban him and even though I did nothing
18:37 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> du bist nicht erwÃ¼nscht vali
18:38 <+vali_> du send mal weiter deine nudes weiter
18:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> @jao please speak english here
18:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> xF
18:38 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> you are not welcome*
18:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> xD
18:38 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> ðŸ˜ƒ
18:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I never saw, that someone annoy anywan
18:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyone
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> he thinks using vote bots to kick players is doing "nothing" ðŸ˜„
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> and if he gets kicked for it it's just to annoy him ðŸ˜­
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Drama alter
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> lol
18:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> alert
18:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> poor vali  ðŸ˜¦
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> can someone make a tl;dr why most blockers hate ddnet? xD
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> h
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because yes
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no reason
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ddnet is biggest
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> saw a lot of guys leaving the tournament server because ddnet hosts it
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> do most blockers even hate ddnet ?
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and i was like wtf
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @HMH I think it has a reason why every ddnet block server is empty
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ._.
19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> probably
19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> there reason is like "oh no, ddnet has everything! Fuckers!"
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "monopoly!!"
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "They are stealing our gamemode:"
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or maybe they go to the block server with mods
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> modified block server*
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> there are still a few block srever without mods more or less full
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> btw i think starblock would fit better on the block server
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> its the best non-mod block map imo
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> they think ddnet destroyed tw
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> oh
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> >:
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> when i stopped playing teeworlds (shortly before ddnet was released), it was more or less dead
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> vanilla is played by a rly small amount of players
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like, reallly small
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and in my opinion, i started searching for mods the second day after i got bored of vanilla
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and in my case, i started searching for mods the second day after i got bored of vanilla
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> How fast ?
19:07 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> they also think ddnet limits other mods from growing
19:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and started playing infection (old)
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> anyone here has tried solus linux?
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @jao 
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i dont get it
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ddnet is open src
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> when i choose to do the tournament mod i picked ddnet so i wouldnt have to do the freeze tiles from 0 etc etc
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> also the sql support is really useful
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i would never do a mod with the normal src, not because im a fanboy or smth but just because the ddnet src has more features lol
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDnet is good starting point ðŸ˜„
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes and they even host my server 4 free
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> this is the opposite of limiting mod grow
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but imo, it could be split into ddrace and base
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, ddnet could be very good base for mod environment
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> @Laboon I guess it's hard to grow your mod because ddnet's community is so big
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but DDNet
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is more like ddrace
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so they should hate people beccause they prefer to play
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ddrace
19:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> than their mod
19:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @jao 
19:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I think it's mainly the case because solo players cant play it
19:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> there needs to be at least 2 players
19:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and with few players it gets boring pretty fast because you're always playing against the same guy
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> event DDNet can't force people to play a mod
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so it's not like, ddnet stopped these mods
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> from growing
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> the ppl just choose to play other stuff
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> block and ddrace is the same mod lol
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @ChillerDragon we're talking about tournament
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah oke
19:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ;p
