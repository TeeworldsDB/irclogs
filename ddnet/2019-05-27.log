00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both are just chrome skins
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> @heinrich5991 send more useful firefox extensions
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm an old enough eu citizen that isn't allowed to vote in the eu yet ðŸ˜›
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 that works
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> update-desktop-database
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I will upgrade to 32GB because of pci passthrough. Sadly the linux kernel is swapping when you have 16GB and give 12GB to the VM even with just a webbrowser on the host. There is ram left, it's just at 85-95% but it's still swapping my browser. I tried playing with swappiness but didn't help.
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 deen's blog is based on an older version of https://github.com/poole/poole, when they had a single css file without sass, so you might try version 1.1.0 https://github.com/poole/poole/tree/v1.1.0
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think poole doesn't come with tags
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro is the seemingly empty ram maybe given to the igpu?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen do you know how i can check?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but i didn't think about that, might be
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i set it in the bios
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> okay, i will check in the bios
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Heh: https://github.com/mstorsjo/msvc-wine
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone want to try this out with DDNet?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```#define TS Server()->TickSpeed()
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define TICK Server()->Tick()
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define GS GameServer()
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define CHAR(C) (((C) < 0 || (C) >= MAX_CLIENTS) ? 0 : GS->GetPlayerChar(C))
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define PLAYER(C) (((C) < 0 || (C) >= MAX_CLIENTS) ? 0 : GS->m_apPlayers[C])
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define TPLAYER(C) (((C) < 0 || (C) >= MAX_CLIENTS) ? 0 : (GS->IsClientReady(C) && GS->IsClientPlayer(C)) ? GS->m_apPlayers[C] : 0)
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define CFG(A) g_Config.m_Sv ## A```
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is pretty cool :o
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> nice
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There's no reason to use macros for those though
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its faster than typing all that stuff isnt it
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macro magic is harder to read imho
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can just use a small function and make it inline
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only use macros when necessary
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Since macros are simple text replacements you'll run into all sorts of trouble, like multiple evaluations if C is some function
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ive seen this in another mod and found it cool, since i never saw this in teeworlds before
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZimE I assume you already use an adblocker (use 'ublock origin') Â­â€“ container tabs is also a useful addon
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it allows you to be logged into a single website with multiple accoutns
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> es
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have an hour or two free, anything that needs fixing? ðŸ˜›
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> the opened issues?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's what I'll do if there is nothing urgent
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> idk if theres things to be fixed in my latest commit
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but its not that urgent tho xd
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well your notices are still not thread-safe
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ik xd
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you told me you would leave them like that coz there's actually no things to make that thread safe
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but @heinrich5991 doesn't seem too thrilled about that idea ðŸ˜„
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> how to fix then, do i need to create a thread safe thing idk what? xd
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> get rid of the notice
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you'd need a thread safe queue
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you could drop the notice yeah
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @jao oof
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> how to "notify" the user then
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> either way, currently you are leaking m_CurrentNotification
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in console
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh you aren't hmm
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yea but they won't open console each time they would save a replay
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> they need an info on the actual screen
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do you save a replay if not from console
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> key bind
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then they will know to look in console if they want that info
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah but they will not do that each time and maybe they will have replay disabled and they will save a replay but not take a look in console, then realize that replay was disabled and they lost the replay
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao some feedback that the replay has been recorded is a good idea
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe a chat message?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> can we
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> chat messages are sent by the server no?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember what it's called but the client can print blue local chat messages
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> oh really? xd
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> client messages
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> system messages
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> one of these
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> do we use that anywhere currently?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `CChat::ConEcho`
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok i'll try that way
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd first add a method in `CChat` to echo stuff
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then use that, and rewrite `ConEcho` to use that aswell
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but even that won't be thread safe without a queue  :/
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> .. xd
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this isn't too too easy to implement tbh
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yea i imagine
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's quite easy to implement for your case
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can just poll for it
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but in general I guess the proper solution is a queue of CJob-like things that get executed in `CClient::Tick`
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> the `Engine` already have a queue no?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> a queue of `Job`
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you mean the jobpool?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> those are ran in threads
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what we need is a queue of jobs that are ran synchronously
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ahh
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> currently when you call into the client to do sth from a thread it's quite unsafe
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because you don't know at what point the main thread is in it's execution
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> is there a way to know when a task has finished other than in the task itself?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well heinrich rewrote a lot of the job code, but if he didn't remove them I had callbacks available
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> those would also be in the thread
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or were they
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, look where the callbacks are executed
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can poll for the jobs state as I said before
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah heinrich removed the callbacks ðŸ˜›
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so what i can do is wait for my job to finish then in the client loop when its finished show the notification?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so that its outside of the thread
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, that'd work
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast until someone gets a decent queue there
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yup, i'll try that then xd
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in hindsight this update system i made is quite horrible
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why didn't anyone stop me? ðŸ˜„
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> idk xd
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 my apologies for not warning u
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it works
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the callbacks can still be had by subclassing IJob or CJob or so IIRC
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yeah but they'd be called in the worker thread right?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should poll for completion if you want to do stuff in the main thread
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's actually a good idea for this PR I think
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I think we should maybe get a queue of things to be done in the main thread
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Same as the planned one for the server
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but too much for this PR I guess
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats why i suggested he poll
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hmm i think about that but if there's more than 1 job how can i keep track of all of them
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> store a list of jobs to poll
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have you continued working on the sql refactor?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i said i would do it but i never did it xd
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not too too far yet
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I said I would do it but I never finished
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I started writing all the prepared statements
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mostly need to code a threadsafe queue but I keep rewriting that
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When making  basic components like those i keep scrapping work to get it as good as possible :P
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how would the queue work?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fifo, things go in, things go out
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but still, when u are executing the task in a thread u shouldnt access the gameclient cuz its not thread safe right?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah the thread puts a callback in the queue
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When it gets executed it'll be in the main thread
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u want to make something like a asynchronous main loop or smth
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the run loop
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After/before everything is done look at the queue
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there are things to do, do them
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Preferably limit it to a couple tasks so that the frametime isnt too long
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its purpose is not for multithreading ah
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just toqueue tasks
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well its mostly to allow worker threads to communicate with the main thread in a safe way
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bru my github is full xd
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Storage: 1.41 GB / 1 GB (141%)
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wtf 1GB is max
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tf are you storing?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> his bots
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only some of my cutted tw demos
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh and my maps

18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> medias
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i probably have to setup my own git server agian ._. but lazyness and im scared that i kill my server one day
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any ideas how to sync tw data for free?
19:19 <@deen> tw data?
19:19 <@deen> rsync, unison, git?
