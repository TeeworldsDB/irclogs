02:55 < bridge> <teero777> You can say that those are cheated ranks but you should not mention the names of the clients since first of all this is a public chat so your message could be a trigger for people searching for the client which is advertising and second of all there are many cheat clients so you shouldn't assume a specific one even if it is likely.

07:40 < bridge> <Ewan> zzzzz
07:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> for the last few days i've been learning about register allocation
07:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it works :poggers:
07:41 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
07:41 < bridge> <Ewan> how is that even implemented on your part
07:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it maps many virtual registers to a few real hardware ones, it chooses them using GrApH cOlOrInG
07:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And then at runtime your CPU does the opposite, which I find kinda funny

13:47 < bridge> <chairn> why "*immortal idea"?
13:47 < bridge> <Assa> good xD
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> because people thought of this already 15 years ago
13:49 < bridge> <zhn> yep
13:49 < bridge> <zhn> we have thousands of ideas that lay on teeworlds or ddnet forum
13:49 < bridge> <zhn> probably on ddnet discord too but it just got too old for us too have a look at xd
14:11 < bridge> <Assa> Does anyone know what [m_Type of CSpeedupTile](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/69c92a79e6bab9f9390245f518c5340222c544dc/src/game/mapitems.h#L502>) does? Is this the same as the tile index?
14:16 < bridge> <Assa> has to be
14:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yes.
14:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You can check IsSpeedup
14:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah wait
14:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> There's only that one tile on speedup layer, but the code checks for any: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/69c92a79e6bab9f9390245f518c5340222c544dc/src/game/collision.cpp#L727
14:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You can add different tiles tho, just need to check it differently

14:32 < bridge> <Sans> :PES2_Woah:
14:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Nice
14:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Does it work ingame?
14:33 < bridge> <Assa> can't test yet
14:33 < bridge> <Assa> but I'll make it work
14:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> oki nice one
14:33 < bridge> <Assa> also Map testers immediately feature requested a MaxSpeedTile
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> setting the MaxSpeed immediately without accelerating, will do this afterwards
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> maybe make a clampspeed tile instead
14:35 < bridge> <Assa> this would server another function, yet another possible tile for the speedup layer
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> be careful due to entities
14:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> The tile has been chosen to work on the overlay entities
14:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think the client currently doesnt render other speedups tiles anyways
14:36 < bridge> <Assa> you mean I shouldn't use IDs >= 128?
14:36 < bridge> <Assa> Oh the client just checks if "IsSpeedup" is true
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> not sure, I think it doesnt matter and the client "should ™️" be able to handle this somehow
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that also explains an old bug i encountered
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> expect prediction errors on older clients
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> well maybe older clients actually think they are the old speedtiles
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> which would be perfect
14:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true

16:39 < bridge> <teero777> hello where did i get pinged
16:44 < bridge> <teero777> quick question do i have to copy the ddnet license here too?

16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you copy pasted yes
16:50 < bridge> <teero777> well its half half xd
16:50 < bridge> <teero777> its copy pasted and then modified to use c xd
16:50 < bridge> <teero777> from different files across the whole repo
16:50 < bridge> <teero777> so do i just copy paste the license in there?
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can do that yes
16:50 < bridge> <teero777> okay thx
17:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich made me use the license for a rewrite in a different language^^
17:07 < bridge> <Assa> better this way than suddenly having a letter from a lawyer
17:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which lawyer lool
17:08 < bridge> <Assa> heinrichs lawyer, because you broke the license (this is a hypothetical)
17:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well yes talking personally is better than through lawyers ..

17:29 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @ryozuki do you have any recommendations for kb software/firmware for wireless kbs?
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm no idea
18:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok thanks ;)
20:05 < bridge> <filoqcus> @blaiszephyr Why don't you do input in the terminal? :>
20:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just don't see the point of wireless keyboards in the first place, at least not on the desktop
20:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> having to use batteries and less reliable communication are such obvious downsides, not to mention the cost of all that
20:16 < bridge> <louis> its not really less reliable
20:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> Huuh
20:17 < bridge> <louis> i'm pretty sure most wireless keyboards can charge thru usb c
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean yeah, not in practice, but radio over air is never gonna be as good as twisted pairs of copper
20:17 < bridge> <louis> so if you're out of battery it just turns into a wired kb
20:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> batteries degrade and I much prefer components that last effectively forever
20:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Oh wireless keyboard talk.
20:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's good until you don't care about your keyboard being wireless anymore and you just keep it plugged in - which effectively made you buy a keyboard with a feature you don't use :KEKW:
20:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wireless just feels wasteful to me you know
20:19 < bridge> <louis> actually (from google), some wireless is actually faster than wired
20:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> I have wireless keyboard and mouse for my raspberry server
20:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> *some* wireless is faster than *some* wired
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and sure, the speed of light in air is faster so theoretically wireless has the advantage but...
20:20 < bridge> <louis> if you wanna put emphasis on the word "some" then lets just stop the conversation here xd
20:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm just saying that with current technology the fastest wired is going to be faster than the fastest wireless
20:21 < bridge> <louis> switches and keycaps will degrade too
20:21 < bridge> <louis> although idk any wireless keyboard that has a replaceable battery
20:21 < bridge> <louis> im sure it cant be impossible
20:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> good ones will still survive decades
20:22 < bridge> <louis> not to a discernible degree
20:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> can't really avoid mechanical wear... I'm not willing to use a capacitive touch input just for the sake of longevity lol
20:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, if you get a good keyboard the amount of latency is already way below discernible
20:23 < bridge> <louis> well im actually planning on switching to a wireless keyboard sometime in the near future
20:24 < bridge> <louis> less desk clutter and easier to move around
20:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't tell me you use wireless headphones 🤢
20:24 < bridge> <louis> not at my desk lol
20:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok thank god
20:24 < bridge> <louis> when im out i would if i didnt lose my qc4s on a plane :(
20:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I kinda get the point of wireless mice since I tryhard sometimes
20:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but if you set your cable nicely it's really hard to notice the extra drag
20:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's probably a lot more relevant if you're one of them low DPI gamers
20:25 < bridge> <louis> u also cant do fun spinnies with wired mice
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but wireless keyboard to me is the most pointless of them all, though it may depend on how restricted you are in your cable placement
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you route your cables really specifically I could see how it'd make moving your keyboard annoying
20:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for me my keyboard stays in the exact same spot 99+% of the time
20:28 < bridge> <louis> i use my desk for other things so i move it to the edge a lot
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> really depends
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i used a computer for so many years before i realized just how low latency u can actually get shit to be
20:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> simply have a bigger desk 😏
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> if you have a decent/average amount you probably won't notice wired/wireless input differences but if you already try to eliminate it everywhere else it's just another variable
20:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I could totally fit a second desk for non-computer things and it'd be really nice but I haven't bothered so far
20:29 < bridge> <louis> university dorm desk 😔
20:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 😔
20:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if you want a bigger desk, then you need to have the cash
20:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if you dont have the cash, then you need to get a job
20:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if you dont have a job, then you need to go to school
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> im reading this moving between my desks
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> theoretically wireless has fewer input lag, bcs it travels by shortest path.
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but ofc that depends on how good the signal transformers are
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we don't use the word modem enough
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they're modems but we don't call them modems
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> modulator-demodulators
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
20:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> transceiver is another cool word
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i agree
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you know what's not cool
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> credit
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i emailed this apt complex looking to tour and said upfront i have zero credit history and no guarantor so if they can't do a higher deposit it'd be a waste of time
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> they said that'd be no problem
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i applied today and the lady calls me like "your credit report came back as denied *but* it's no problem we can just use a guarantor"
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> my dude
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i am supposed to be out at the end of this month
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it's joever
20:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust rust rust rust rust rust
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> rust indeed
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> not a problem if u play with sound off
20:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I play rhythm games...
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> based
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> do u play real rhythm games
20:46 < bridge> <louis> cue elitist take in 3.2.1..
20:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> osu! doesn't count I guess

20:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I know I should get the arcade versions running :P
20:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I never appreciated IIDX much so I'm clearly a fake rhythm gamer
20:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> dw I'll shit on half the "rhythm games" out there, I'll out-elitist most people ez pz
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> ive never played any of them anywhere but the arcade im just being funny
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> arcade versions are ez to get running these days i thought
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> they're just windows binaries with minimal extra work i think
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> is spicetools still what u use for that
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> assuming you can get the games themselves which isn't hard
