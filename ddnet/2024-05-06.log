00:00 < bridge> <teero777> It's 0 now so in like 18 hours you can start the stream xd
00:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> @mpft was gonna say, if you start streaming now we'll be sad
00:39 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i will do it tomorrow about noon mountain time
00:39 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i will do it tomorrow about noon mountain daylight time
01:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Go stream now ewan xd
04:30 < bridge> <sans._.> Why does the master server report 2 formats for skins?
04:30 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236867531810013194/image.png?ex=66399227&is=663840a7&hm=be653d430960f81619b04789ce12c4b81f8617b8edc016da7fa5b67e6878cf44&
04:34 < bridge> <sans._.> Yea I dont use custom colors, anyway how am I on 0.6, and how are those numbers representing color? (I'm trying to make a skin renderer)
04:36 < bridge> <zhn> so what skin do you render in first
04:36 < bridge> <zhn> first one or second one
04:36 < bridge> <sans._.> So far I'm just trying to make sense of it, havent done anything yet
04:36 < bridge> <zhn> ig there's some skin renderer for both 0.6 and 0.7 written in typescript
04:36 < bridge> <sans._.> I've seen some yea, I could use those
04:36 < bridge> <sans._.> my use case is, I have a findPlayer function, and it returns whatever it finds after a request to the master server
04:36 < bridge> <sans._.> from there I have that skin data
04:36 < bridge> <sans._.> im kinda stuck on getting from skin data to an actually rendered image
04:37 < bridge> <zhn> afair master should show information about which protocol player uses
04:37 < bridge> <zhn> you can render skin by player protocol
04:37 < bridge> <zhn> like if player uses 0.6, render 0.6
04:37 < bridge> <zhn> if 0.7 -> 0.7
04:37 < bridge> <sans._.> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
04:37 < bridge> <zhn> ah its a magic xd
04:37 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236869502130458715/image.png?ex=663993fd&is=6638427d&hm=bc21f1da5768c05433e61a87b3b8e4373297dc1b74650aa81e8ce483dfdd9e62&
04:39 < bridge> <sans._.> I can tell which is which now that you've told me
04:39 < bridge> <sans._.> but as far as I can see, there's nothing specifying a protocol
04:41 < bridge> <zhn> wait wtf
04:42 < bridge> <zhn> how did you get 2 different skin formats in one response
04:43 < bridge> <sans._.> Master server gives an array of servers, I filtered them for the server I'm in, from there I went to server.info.clients and that's another array of all connected (and connecting) clients
04:43 < bridge> <zhn> ah
04:43 < bridge> <sans._.> each client may have a skin property, and if it does, it's in 1 of those 2 formats
04:43 < bridge> <zhn> its two different players
04:43 < bridge> <zhn> got it
04:43 < bridge> <sans._.> yea xd
04:44 < bridge> <zhn> you can just check if there name in structure you fetching
04:44 < bridge> <zhn> so if it has name, its 0.6 one
04:44 < bridge> <zhn> otherwise 0.7
04:44 < bridge> <sans._.> yea I know, problem is how do I get from that to an image buffer or at least a url
04:44 < bridge> <zhn> by yourself xd
04:44 < bridge> <sans._.> :why_god_why:
04:45 < bridge> <zhn> there's couple skin database you can check by knocking some fancy url
04:45 < bridge> <sans._.> I'd rather only support the official one by default, with some other way of adding other db's
04:45 < bridge> <zhn> ddnet uses https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/community/ for community database and https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/ for official ones
04:46 < bridge> <zhn> just append skin name to the end and send a request
04:46 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm guessing there's no way to check from which db any skin is?
04:47 < bridge> <zhn> https://api.skins.tw/database/skins/ also usable
04:47 < bridge> <zhn> these all are 0.6
04:47 < bridge> <zhn> except of latter one (i don't remember actually)
04:48 < bridge> <zhn> yeah these all are 0.6
04:49 < bridge> <zhn> idk if there 0.7 db online available
04:49 < bridge> <zhn> better make one yourself
04:49 < bridge> <sans._.> oh btw, for 0.7 skins, which one do I use? I'm guessing `marking` but then what are all the other keys for?
04:49 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236872381302312970/image.png?ex=663996ab&is=6638452b&hm=77e27855dd11481ca24be9b8c9b157b7cccda7bfc943fac15e16adddd21c811a&
04:49 < bridge> <zhn> they're all parts of one skin
04:50 < bridge> <zhn> 0.7 skin is constructed by rendering all of them combined
04:50 < bridge> <zhn> also 0.7 color is different from 0.6
04:50 < bridge> <sans._.> how so?
04:50 < bridge> <sans._.> I still dont get how those numbers represent color XD
04:51 < bridge> <zhn> uh, enable custom color on your skin
04:51 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236872929535594546/image.png?ex=6639972e&is=663845ae&hm=8925a64261a8d9966823e406fde4fd67c3f3146e44b68766a933b55839cf5d08&
04:51 < bridge> <sans._.> yea
04:57 < bridge> <zhn> https://github.com/AlexIsTheGuy/TeeAssembler-2.0/blob/main/dist/color.js is readable enough i think
04:57 < bridge> <zhn> anyway afair this string is just concatenated 4 bytes
04:57 < bridge> <zhn> represented in 16 base
04:58 < bridge> <deathgood> try color&255, color/256&255, color/256/256&255
04:59 < bridge> <sans._.> ?
04:59 < bridge> <zhn> yeah literally
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> this works perfectly for 0.6 skins
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> with/without color
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> now i need something to handle 0.7 skins
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> <a:nod:604500081114087434>
05:04 < bridge> <zhn> have never knew that js is so ugly uh
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> this is why we use typescript
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> also that's compiled js, from typescript
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> im assuming, at least, cuz it's in a dist folder xd
05:04 < bridge> <zhn> :kek:
05:04 < bridge> <zhn> outplayed myself
05:04 < bridge> <sans._.> anyhow this
05:05 < bridge> <sans._.> know any 0.7 skin renderer?
05:11 < bridge> <zhn> there's no 0.7 skin renderer in public
05:11 < bridge> <zhn> i think so
05:11 < bridge> <zhn> you should figure it out yourself by lurking 0.7 skin renderer code in upstream
05:49 < bridge> <Ewan> this one has the most skins because it mirrors all other services + has many skins of its own <https://uniqueclan.net/proxy/skin/>
05:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think this is an inherent issue in js
05:52 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236888377710739577/image.png?ex=6639a591&is=66385411&hm=8dcc5fe54383f8d3701ef693141ed58242ffd4002a4f42c2748a4c1c3028aaa9&
06:01 < bridge> <zhn> gm
06:02 < bridge> <Ewan> did i ping u :monkalaugh:
06:02 < bridge> <zhn> >:(
06:03 < bridge> <Ewan> sry
06:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i usually turn it off
06:03 < bridge> <zhn> no you didn't xd
06:03 < bridge> <zhn> im just curious if pinging online people is something off the road
06:04 < bridge> <Ewan> some ppl get mad about it idk
06:04 < bridge> <zhn> btw did you ever see an atomic segfault with sigsegv
06:04 < bridge> <Ewan> when storing or loading
06:05 < bridge> <Ewan> im trying to think of how this could happen lol
06:05 < bridge> <Ewan> but it doesn't sound unfamiliar
06:05 < bridge> <zhn> on loading
06:06 < bridge> <zhn> i saw a so question about it and that clearly stated that gcc had a bug with unaligned data in atomic
06:06 < bridge> <zhn> but its kinda 2015
06:06 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
06:07 < bridge> <Ewan> std atomic?
06:07 < bridge> <zhn> yup
06:07 < bridge> <Ewan> bizarre
06:07 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if i've ever encountered that
06:07 < bridge> <Ewan> can't remember
06:08 < bridge> <Ewan> if u attach debugger does it break on an intsinsic
06:08 < bridge> <zhn> its actually just CHttpRequests state from ddnet codebase being checked in another loop
06:08 < bridge> <zhn> maybe its the problem
06:08 < bridge> <zhn> id shouldn't check it every tick though
06:09 < bridge> <Ewan> is the CHttpRequest valid
06:11 < bridge> <zhn> wdym
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> do u have a ptr to it
06:11 < bridge> <zhn> its under shared ptr, not a nullptr
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> ic
06:11 < bridge> <zhn> i couldn't use it any other way
06:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i just wonder what the debugger says before segfault
06:13 < bridge> <Ewan> also it's just being init like CHttpRequest ctor -> std::make_shared?
06:13 < bridge> <Ewan> or some other tomfoolery
06:14 < bridge> <zhn> clean std::make_shared
06:15 < bridge> <zhn> btw seems its loop problem
06:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
06:15 < bridge> <zhn> it didn't sigsegv this time
06:15 < bridge> <zhn> i should check httpstate a bit rarer
06:15 < bridge> <zhn> is this a real word xd
06:15 < bridge> <Ewan> less frequently
06:15 < bridge> <zhn> my brain is malfunctioning
06:16 < bridge> <Ewan> rarer isn't a word
06:16 < bridge> <zhn> got it
06:16 < bridge> <Ewan> more rarely/less rarely
06:16 < bridge> <zhn> i fucked up my sleep schedule
06:16 < bridge> <zhn> again
06:16 < bridge> <Ewan> sadge
06:17 < bridge> <Ewan> im getting over that myself
06:17 < bridge> <Ewan> woke up at like 2 today
06:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but the weird thing is i went to bed at like midnight the day before yesterday and still woke up at 2 pm...
06:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but the weird thing is i went to bed at like midnight the day before yesterday and still woke up at 2 pm yesterday...
06:18 < bridge> <zhn> same!
06:18 < bridge> <zhn> maybe it has something to do with weather
06:18 < bridge> <zhn> we had like +15-20C
06:18 < bridge> <zhn> and then
06:19 < bridge> <zhn> kabooom
06:19 < bridge> <zhn> 20C drop
06:19 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
06:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it's colder here too cuz it's spring
06:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but that really doesn't say anything where i live
06:19 < bridge> <Ewan> colorado weather is very erratic
06:20 < bridge> <zhn> i can't say the same about my state
06:20 < bridge> <zhn> but last years
06:20 < bridge> <zhn> idk
06:20 < bridge> <zhn> nature goes crazy
06:20 < bridge> <Ewan> climate change is real
06:20 < bridge> <Ewan> can't wait until we get 120 degree summers and -20 winters
06:21 < bridge> <zhn> yappie
06:21 < bridge> <zhn> there's no need in nuclear winter, we'll have the winter another way
06:21 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
06:22 < bridge> <zhn> i bet if global community will do anything in future
06:22 < bridge> <zhn> or will they go like
06:22 < bridge> <zhn> "climate cycle huh"
06:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> record breaking temperatures? freezing ice caps? crazy coincidence
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> record breaking temperatures? melting ice caps? crazy coincidence
06:23 < bridge> <zhn> xdd
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody will act until it's too late
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> it's already too late
06:23 < bridge> <zhn> sad but true
06:24 < bridge> <zhn> i did a little presentation about ecologists
06:24 < bridge> <zhn> and should have been write a little research on this topic
06:25 < bridge> <zhn> found out that there's no actual impact behind these people since none of them are actual manufacturer xd
06:25 < bridge> <zhn> manufacturers*
06:25 < bridge> <zhn> factories go brrr
06:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
06:27 < bridge> <Ewan> small companies and individuals are already doing as much as they should but each plastic straw is nothing compared to the pollution being created by international transit and meat packing
06:27 < bridge> <Ewan> and in that area it's all about execs and their wallets
06:28 < bridge> <Ewan> this is where we need to depend on legislature to do what's best for the world but all of the first world countries have already proven they don't give a shit about the future
06:28 < bridge> <Ewan> so it's probably over
06:31 < bridge> <zhn> had a read about pagers cancellation on a wave of drug-dealing in us
06:31 < bridge> <zhn> like
06:32 < bridge> <zhn> they really sent children to the prison instead of removing key figures of drug-dealing
06:33 < bridge> <zhn> and now they want to ban phones in us xd
06:33 < bridge> <zhn> for underages*
06:33 < bridge> <Ewan> typically
06:34 < bridge> <Ewan> law enforcement and incarceration in the u.s. is just nasty
06:34 < bridge> <Ewan> not necessarily about putting away those who do badly but more about maintaining some political image or fulfilling politicians' interests
06:35 < bridge> <zhn> why lobbying is still a thing wtf
06:35 < bridge> <zhn> and its legal in us
06:35 < bridge> <Ewan> $
06:35 < bridge> <zhn> our world is doomed i suppose xddd
06:35 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
06:35 < bridge> <Ewan> usually the politicians are getting a cut of whatever the lobbyist is lobbying for
06:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean not usually but often
06:36 < bridge> <Ewan> and especially in the headline cases
06:37 < bridge> <Ewan> doomed indeed

11:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you already said that
11:28 < bridge> <robyt3> thanks, I'll add that to my TODO list
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> got it integrated

12:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (actually, maybe `expires: Sat, 27 Apr 2024 07:53:08 GMT` is easier to parse than `cache-control: max-age=86400` because we can use curl's date parser (which we already use elsewhere))
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u know if the -I option for includes only accepts absolute paths?
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> `-I`

14:30 < bridge> <teero777> Give me one of those screens pls :owo:

14:57 < bridge> <teero777> aipgores theoritical perfect time :D
14:57 < bridge> <teero777> aipgores theoretical perfect time :D
14:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> Hmm, make it Times two and i might considere
15:00 < bridge> <teero777> so 67s?
15:00 < bridge> <teero777> sure
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> man
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hate depending on C libs
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> or cpp
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wasted 2 hours trying to link something
15:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the current example?
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> you are asking me or?
15:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yep
15:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what C lib did you try to link?
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i forked a rust library that uses a llvm library
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> called tablegen
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/tblgen-rs-alt
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> for some reason it fails on ubuntu, when running cargo test
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it works locally
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it also works on macos
15:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah 😦 yea. depending on big C++ projects like LLVM is a pain
15:54 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki when edlang-cranelift?
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/tblgen-rs-alt/actions/runs/8969217906/job/24630181711?pr=5
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish cranelift was a optimizing compiler
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> but sadly they just want it to be fast for compile time and wasm focused
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean the "optimizing compiler" use case is well-covered by LLVM
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, its what edlang uses
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont even have a fully working language so multiple backends is too much work xd
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i would love to see something like LLVM but that its library friendly
15:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> a.k.a usable as a library outside the language it is made in (be it c++ like llvm or rust)
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm is too much cpp focused
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> the C api is a after thought
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a nice idea
15:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd say the best bet for that would *not* be to rewrite LLVM from scratch, but enhance LLVM's ability to be a library
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> make a "language-server" but for library interface generators
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> some standard protocol
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the language server protocol is a bit too much "whatever vscode does" I've heard
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd yeah but i meant the idea of  protocol to have easy codegen for the library in the language u want to use
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess defining the api in a json file or smth
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> and use it to codegen
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds inefficient, I don't like it
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> how is it ineficient?
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> this would be a gargantuan task anyway, you'd have to have a very very good reason
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> using JSON/HTTPS is slow for APIs
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the json file is just to generate for example the rust library that provides a nice interface to say llvm
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think u misunderstanding me
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the file is used only at compile time to get a native library
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> which u use
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are a couple of projects that do something like that
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> my aim is to have nice libraries for stuff made in other languages
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I fixed that up a little while trying to get nice python bindings for libtw2-huffman
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> that looks nice
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> but llvm is made in cpp not rust
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm sure there's something similar for C++
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I remember swig from the old days, but it wasn't that good IIRC
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIG
16:01 < bridge> <learath2> A common interface description language wouldn't be the worst idea. It sounds so obviously like a good idea that I wonder why there isn't one around already
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's IDL
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah xd
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's used in web, and uniffi uses it as well
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> you know what is the current common interface description language? C
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not really an interface description language
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know it was half a joke
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, it was called WebIDL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_IDL
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks like nobody rly thought much of IDL
16:03 < bridge> <learath2> I guess one of the biggest issues is efficiently passing stuff from language to language
16:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I think I heard uniffi is moving away from using an IDL :/
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> limitation: https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/issues/1586
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but the limitation could be fixed
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Does uniffi have requirements on the types of functions that can be exposed to other languages?
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. it has a data model that covers some types, can create more types and can pass opaque types ("handles")
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it cannot pass anything that falls outside of this data model
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> some days i wanna continue edlang, some others i want to restart ryoOS
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> but no time kek
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> do programmers who retire spend their time doing their dream projects?
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> or they just go drink beers and forget
16:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wonder if how well I'll be able to program when I retire
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> same
16:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the ability to think decreases with age
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> my thought is that when i retire ill do projects that require lot of time
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but maybe the mind isnt there anymore
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wonder how well I'll be able to program when I retire
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but maybe the brain isnt there anymore

16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> what was the previous buzz word before AI came?
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot
16:32 < bridge> <Ewan> cloud
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh true
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its still here isnt it
16:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> low code
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> another idea i have is to || rewrite some c/c++ libraries to rust || but only not rly big ones
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/xiph/opus/tree/main
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this a big project to port
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks quite big
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> also it uses goto kek
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho just to jump to error handling
17:09 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not small
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe a skin index would still be nice, for the skin list and to not do useless requests. but maybe as a first step this would already be good 😄
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah pls

18:13 < bridge> <learath2> And this specific definition of it isn't even that bad 😄
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> `|x| = -x` is true if x is negative?

18:14 < bridge> <learath2> y
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> or if x = 0

18:16 < bridge> <learath2> Not many, I've learned to take these things as just definitions 😄
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> If I were making math from scratch I'd say 0 is a counting number

19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> but tbf i set my alarm way too early
19:41 < bridge> <imilchshake> i might do a prototype based on my procedual map generator as i can easily produce thousands of maps as training data o:
19:42 < bridge> <imilchshake> but then It'd just learn to replicate maps that are already generated, so the output woulnt be that useful i guess
19:42 < bridge> <imilchshake> but then It'd just learn to replicate maps that  can already be generated, so the output woulnt be that useful i guess. But maybe it learns to 'generalize' maps and can make even cooler shit o:
19:43 < bridge> <louis> im thinking of downloading the ddnet map database and just feeding it through some simple vae to see what happens
19:44 < bridge> <louis> also you could do some diffusion stuff since ddnet tiles can easily be represented as noise

21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> laggs for me too
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft lmao u lure random twitch bots
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you read twitch chat?
21:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> @mpft i See what you're cooking, i Like your voice :PeepoSimp:
21:56 < bridge> <totar> Could the ddnet license be changed to prevent the distribution of open source cheats? Obviously wouldn't apply to past versions but if it's allowed by the current license it would be nice
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how would a license like that would look like?
21:56 < bridge> <totar> Idk
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wouldnt that already require to define what a cheat is
21:57 < bridge> <totar> Sure
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds hard :lol:
21:57 < bridge> <totar> Anything that modifies a players input
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also let's be honest.. ppl that share cheats don't care about licenses lmao
21:58 < bridge> <totar> But open source cheats will be subject to github rules
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and github will completely ignore us
21:58 < bridge> <totar> dmca exists and is free xd
22:01 < bridge> <avolicious> then they will move to gitlab or their own vcs server 😄
22:01 < bridge> <totar> Significantly more restrictive licenses exist so I think it's definitely technically possible
22:01 < bridge> <avolicious> its very hard to even sue them
22:01 < bridge> <totar> You don't need to sue just dmca
22:02 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont get it tho xD
22:02 < bridge> <avolicious> They are probably not gonna go open source
22:02 < bridge> <avolicious> because they want to put in their malware stuff
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i personally dislike making ppl criminals, be it on accident or on purpose. so i prefer the most free license.
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that cheats are spreading sucks, but probably is inevitable
22:02 < bridge> <totar> true but atleast it prevents the spread of the cheat source
22:03 < bridge> <avolicious> I doubt
22:03 < bridge> <avolicious> It will just be a lot of work for ddnet admins
22:03 < bridge> <avolicious> It will just be a lot of work for ddnet contributors
22:04 < bridge> <totar> Even if you don't act on it atleast it's a legal deterrent like gpl licenses
22:04 < bridge> <avolicious> mhmm, they mostly dont care about legal stuff
22:04 < bridge> <totar> But they're not doing anything illegal as it is
22:05 < bridge> <avolicious> on long term it will be much more work than usage
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is a reason i kinda dislike gpl too 😂
22:07 < bridge> <totar> It's only as much work as you want to do, you can just put the clause in the license and do nothing if you want
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @totar but if u know other games doing it. i'd like to see such a license that you imagine. i wonder if it legally (at least theoretically) works
22:15 < bridge> <avolicious> Well its mostly against ToS, there are just a few open source games available

22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
22:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> (joke)
22:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> such a license would not be an open-source license anymore
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ☹️
22:19 < bridge> <totar> Why take an ideological open source stand point when we already prevent the discussion of cheats in the discord and in game.
22:20 < bridge> <totar> If we truly did not care about what people did with the source code then all discussion of it would be allowed
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well but we don't have to actively give ppl a platform for discussing it
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that was mostly a statement of fact
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but you're right that I also want ddnet to stay an open-source game
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/06/check-cfg.html
22:23 < bridge> <totar> You don't need it to be obstructive of legitimate uses, cheats which are unable to join official servers could be allowed by the license
22:25 < bridge> <totar> Actually nvm our license forbids this
22:25 < bridge> <totar> Lol
22:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does our license forbid?
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that's compatible with GPL and a lot of others
22:38 < bridge> <totar> Hmm actually I might have been wrong
22:40 < bridge> <totar> I guess both terms are used in foss licenses
22:52 < bridge> <Ewan> tater should be purple
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true /team 48
23:01 < bridge> <learath2> If only that was real
23:10 < bridge> <peter0x44> ddos is illegal too, but that doesn't stop anyone
23:10 < bridge> <peter0x44> it would not make any difference
23:11 < bridge> <totar> ddos is more anonymous than cheat distributing. but you're right, people do illegal things when they won't be caught
23:12 < bridge> <peter0x44> but... it was known who was doing some of the ddos and it made no difference
23:12 < bridge> <totar> I think deen did not want to pursue criminal charges or did not have the time and resources
23:13 < bridge> <peter0x44> law enforcement doesn't care about that, let alone whatever this license would be
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> afaik the german police simply ignored his request
23:14 < bridge> <totar> the idea is that law enforcement doesn't need to care because you can use dmca which github and gitlab would have to respect, but I think the idea is dead anyway
23:16 < bridge> <totar> idk it's not easy for them to gather proof so I can see why they don't care
23:16 < bridge> <totar> I've never heard of regular police investigating ddos before
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i think 48 isn't purple anymore
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol someone from intel (with a intel.com domain) contacted me
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1237156909027561584/Screenshot_20240506-233846.png?ex=663a9fa8&is=66394e28&hm=8f070aa54f861c2dc26e12dd30b8f839d564f2cf022d50a1514b795ee0abe910&
23:40 < bridge> <totar> Ireland?
23:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why ireland but i guess intel has bases in places xd
23:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> im more of a amd guy thon:NekoEvil:
23:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> im more of a amd guy tho :NekoEvil:
23:42 < bridge> <totar> your github profile does look very relevant for what they're asking for
23:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
