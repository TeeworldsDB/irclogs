00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/aoc/blob/master/2020/11/solve.py I don't quite like this one
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was pretty but in the process of trying to figure out wtf python was doing I destroyed it

02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is teehistorian open to everyone? Can I download it?
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually maybe
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but it shouldnt be
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Why? I need it now
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for what
04:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~Replay bot~~
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean the teehistorian recorder? it's part of ddnet, open source like all other parts of ddnet
05:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I know why this went unnoticed. Only like 2 people know how the automapper even works 😛
05:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've found the auto-automapper pretty much useless and it tends to crash and burn with more complicated big automappers, if it doesn't crash the game completely it comes up with some gibberish tiles. I guess it works fine only with things like grass main
05:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh I thought it was supposed to be pretty decent
05:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it seems to crash when you use the little known NoLayerCopy command which changes how the automapper works to a great advantage
05:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you find an easy way to reproduce the crash please create a github issue
05:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all crashes are bugs
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think not a single automapper using this command has worked so it should be easy to reproduce
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think not a single automapper using this command has worked with seed/auto so it should be easy to reproduce
05:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah it crashed when i tried grass_main
05:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then I guess it doesn't even work with grass main :bluestripe:
05:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um, antiping seems to be awful
05:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how do you play with it
05:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when i click A it just crashes instantly
05:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh
05:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've had a lot of issues with antiping also, it plays pretty smoothly but here's not a single day without seeing some weapon freak out and with tune zones it's just a mess
05:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> antiping best feature
05:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> solution: dont use bad tune zones
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then I still get flashing guns and such
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um can you try playing on china with antiping?
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't do the noob blocker because of how bad it is to even move
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm alone it should be predicting perfectly
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> then its probably not antiping related
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've always used it to just smooth out the little delays on my already decent connection, usa server ~120 ping is already terrible
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Learath2 I meant teehistorian archives
05:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Open it to public if it's not already
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Then I could test some anticheat parsing algorythms
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> As well as it would be ez bite for cheaters who could use it for any way to reproduce inputs since its tooo ez to parse, catch and permaban
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Clear ddnet community
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no ppl can set up replays on lan
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think there could be a selection of trehist files used for testing
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Doesn't matter for teehistorian files
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but full database access is bad, i think u can probs get permission if ur making anticheat tho
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think it does matter? how does it not
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Why is that bad
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> full databae access for anyone is bad
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> So yeah, I got your opinion, but why
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ppl will use demos to just learn all skips of a map and how to do it
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> That makes the point, yes...
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> But we had a little discuss about that
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 🤔
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is that even bad?
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yed
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Encourage people to try speedrun when they can see how pro does it (or in case of n9 - bots it)
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not like viewing an r1 demo will empower them
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> That's somwwhat hard topic to discuss, but yeah, you got the point
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea well im still against it
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also if someone only does 1x set of movement on official server how can u detect it
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> It makes entering into speedruns much easier, which is great, but lets pro speedrunners see all the skips other pros found
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah which is bad
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also maps like brainduck become moderate 3*
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> But as another good reason: people will watch replays of other people playing
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> So they could report it when there is somwthing weird happening
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Oh yeah... Puzzle maps ofc
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk its hard to make it work imo
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cuz ppl can just post to youtube tbh
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Btw
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> There is no way right now to convert teehistorian into demo
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> As far as I know
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theres on
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> there is
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Oh, cool then
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Anyway... I wanna parse archives and try to find something interesting
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon: what was ur desktop environment again? you also had trouble with gfx_resizable if i remember it correctly
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> yes
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> i had it on gnome
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> i think i still have it
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok bcs i changed behaviour of it in #3403
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3403
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just wonder if that fixes that, but it still could be a bug in gnome 😄
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> fix gnome then :p
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> ima test later if i dont forget it. Can you ping @ChillerDragon in the issue then i get a mail :)
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> eh pr* not issue
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder why there is no crypto hype anywhere isnt BTC near all time high
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cuz everyone who did it wrong lost their money
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they don't want to do it again then :)
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (about crypto-nobos)

21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if its true
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have a amd gpu?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this might be why it doesnt use full cpu
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787414500441718784/unknown.png
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah, I'm surprised the icc is biased this way
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a ilegal practice right?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not sure if it's illegal, but it's definitely scummy
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> lol hexediting the game to gain fps boost
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> thats nice :D

21:25 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder how many totally non tech gamers followed this random reddit post and feel super hacker now
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not nice
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ridiculous
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> intel should be ashamed
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> its bad and all
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> but that he posted a fix is cool
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Saw a similar hack for horizon zero dawn to get a "smoother experience" hex edit a byte here, similar post with 0 context
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> lemme post something adding a backdoor :D

21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the post has context
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and sources
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> i link the same sources :brain:
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is the icc better than other compilers? why would u use it?
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> nobody reads sources anyways
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> icc optimizes better for intel
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They change this
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787415900567371806/unknown.png

21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When are corporations taking over anyway? :/
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazon has enough money to form the Amazon Party and take over the american goverment
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why havent they done so
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess they dont need to
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they pay 0 taxes
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A guy in turkey tried that, he was so close to winning that they exiled him
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> lol what
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> wat a guy in turkey tried to buy the goverment? :D
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> life goals
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> bois if you invest in bitcoin now you can buy any goverment in 2022 :D
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> oh congraz for launching ur web thing ryo
21:43 <+ChillerDragon> 11h ago im late to the party
21:43 <+ChillerDragon> i would be 1st stargazer but i cant read rust :D
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol it has nothing yet
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly stalk :pepe_straight:
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He formed a party used his insane amounts of money to market his party and almost won the election
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> donald trump of turkey
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> good thing it cannot occur here in France
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why not? campaign finance laws? or do you just tax the rich so much that there are no more rich ppl? :d
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> campaign finance laws + time on tv/radio is controlle
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> d
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they cannot spend more than around 25 millions i think, or something like that
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in turkey time on tv and radio was controlled too, but only a minimum and no one wanted to show this guy, so he bought his own tv channel
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and each tv/radio channel has to broadcast proportionnal time to representation in the last election
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but if you got 5% or more votes, you are reimbursed by the state, hence the strict control and the limit
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish we had a modern democracy that's not completely corrupt too
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> right now, Nicolas Sarkozy, former french president is on trial for frauding his campaign finances in 2008
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> right now, Nicolas Sarkozy, former french president is on trial for frauding his campaign finances in 2007
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Donald Trump of france? Or just a populist that had corporate backing?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 16 851 000 € max
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, he potentially got money from Lybia hence the fraud
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Kadhafi sent money or not, that's what the trial must decide
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if he did, then the counts were falsified to hide it, if not, then probably no falsification occurred
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's very illegal in turkey, foreign funds are not allowed to be used in elections at all
