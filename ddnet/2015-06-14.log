02:43 <@deen> I'm back. Did I miss anything?
11:22 < BeaR_> io
11:25 < EastByte> oi
11:26 < EastByte> ah deen you are back alive :)
11:26 < EastByte> deen: I guess you didn't miss anything important
11:26 < EastByte> the automatic map releases seemed to work
11:28 < BeaR_> \o/
11:28 <@deen> hi!
11:28 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vLe5N
11:28 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 f1a595f def: Version 7.7.2
11:28 <@deen> BeaR_: I saw some of the flaming on the forum
11:28 <@deen> not sure how to deal with it
11:29 <@deen> i don't really like rules and especially enforcing them
11:29 <@deen> no idea why people can't just get along
11:29 <@deen> EastByte: except on the last day ;)
11:29 < BeaR_> y, unfortunately /:
11:30 < Shiki> whoa, BeaR_ !
11:30 < Shiki> why don't you play vanilla?
11:30 < BeaR_> well I deleted yesterday 1 page of random insults in the offtopic forum
11:30 <@deen> BeaR_: wow
11:30 < BeaR_> hey shiki
11:30 < Shiki> hi hi
11:31 < BeaR_> deen: they opened a topic just to insult each other ..
11:31 < EastByte> 09:52:00             <-- | deen (~deen@ddnet.tw) has quit (Ping timeout)
11:31 < EastByte> 11:15:31             --> | deen (~deen@ddnet.tw) has joined #ddnet
11:32 < EastByte> normal downtime?
11:32 <@deen> well, ddnet.tw was down, as usual^^
11:32 < EastByte> okay
11:33 <@deen> i reported it around 11:00 and they fixed it
11:33 < EastByte> ah, so you have to report it before something happens^^
11:33 < BeaR_> Shiki: I played a capgame yesterday!
11:33 < EastByte> what's a capgame?
11:33 < Shiki> ok, it's time to join my clan then!
11:33 < Shiki> I'm glad you're back
11:33 <@deen> what's with the TW on steam stuff
11:34 <@deen> ?
11:34 < BeaR_> EastByte: 2 captains, picking there team
11:34 < Shiki> it got greenlit
11:34 <@deen> what does that mean, Shiki ?
11:34 < BeaR_> yup
11:34 < EastByte> BeaR_: hmkay
11:34 < Shiki> gonna be released as soon as digital paperwork is done
11:34 <@deen> ok
11:34 < EastByte> what exactly will land on greenland?
11:34 < EastByte> light
11:34 < EastByte> whatever
11:34 < BeaR_> :D
11:34 < BeaR_> probably teeworlds in it's current state
11:34 < BeaR_> 0.6.3
11:34 < Shiki> teeworlds.com client I suppose
11:35 < EastByte> ah
11:35 < BeaR_> no steamworks ):
11:35 < Shiki> btw why no steamworks?
11:35 < Shiki> they require map editor to be standalone to integrate it into steamworks?
11:35 < BeaR_> not sure probably because of the license
11:36 < EastByte> the 'license'
11:36 < Shiki> hm, wasn't it BSD-like license?
11:36 < BeaR_> I've no clue at all :D

11:38 < EastByte> there were people who wanted to sell their clients
11:38 < Shiki> well, it seems ok for me, why can't they sell it?
11:39 < EastByte> it is legitimate I guess
11:54 <@deen> Shiki: it's not fully fixed
11:54 <@deen> Shiki: can you follow me ingame?
11:55 < Shiki> ok, coming
11:55 <@deen> there are 20 auto-recordings happening every second in some mods, that's pretty horrible^^
11:55 < Shiki> meh :(
11:58 < EastByte> auto recordings?
12:01 < Shiki> yep
12:02 < EastByte> ah so the mod causes flooding ddr records?
12:02 < BeaR_> 20 users online in the forum lol
12:02 <@deen> BeaR_: sigh, they love the flame...
12:02 <@deen> everyone comes to read when flamewars happen
12:06 < BeaR_> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/dfb87d8a558b68db9db53fb240bc78ba69b05e8b/src/game/client/components/statboard.cpp#L185
12:07 < BeaR_> huh what's this :D
12:07 <@deen> BeaR_: that looks weird^^
12:12 < Shiki> what's the issue?
12:13 <@deen> we don't understand the code
12:14 < Shiki> it calculates of the statboard that will be drawn
12:14 <@deen> yeah, but why not just "w = 5 * 100 + 140 + 110" or something
12:14 < Shiki> copypasta from teecomp actually
12:14 <@deen> i don't see a need for a loop
12:15 < BeaR_> :D
12:15 < Shiki> it makes clear intentions to allocate each label in 100 width units and for special cases width is different
12:15 <@deen> for me that code just causes confusion^^
12:15 < Shiki> would you rather have one constant?
12:15 <@deen> when I see a loop I expect something to happen
12:16 <@deen> no, I would rather have "w = 5 * 100 + 140 + 110" or something
12:16 < Shiki> magic number makes lot more of confusion to me
12:16 < Shiki> ah
12:16 < Shiki> :D
12:16 < Shiki> makes perfect sense
12:16 <@deen> with a comment
12:16 < Shiki> k, I will update it with fix to autorecord
12:16 <@deen> thanks =)
12:16 <@deen> and thanks for adding and fixing all the stuff in ddnet client so quickly
12:16 < Shiki> thanks for reviewing!
12:16 <@deen> apparently I'm not reviewing that well, I didn't even notice that code^^
12:17 < Shiki> BeaR_: does! :P
12:17 < BeaR_> :P
12:18 < BeaR_> well there are more little things but not sure if it's worth it to put time into fixing them
12:19 < Shiki> btw I would like a consultation from someone who knows serverside -- I'd like to know when exactly GameInfoObj->m_RoundStartTick is sent to client
12:19 < Shiki> especially in cases of pase and other special cases
12:19 < Shiki> and is it right to expect new value each tick in case of pause or other cases when it's updated constantly
12:23 <@deen> no idea
12:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vLvJm
12:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8523fdc def: Update credits
12:24 < Shiki> on that on ChillerDragon's server it's sent each 2 tick, on ddr in TILE_BEGIN it's each 4th-6th tick...
12:25 < Shiki> ok, I put magic (heuristical) constant 7 and hope it will do ^^
12:29 < BeaR_> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L746 might be interesting but dunno what it does
12:30 < BeaR_> be careful abot this: if((pChr = pPlayer2->GetCharacter()))
12:30 < BeaR_> ^^
12:43 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] nzyuzin opened pull request #214: Fix bug with constant demo autorecording. Fixes #213 (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vLvT9
12:43 < BeaR_> deen: Is there a way in Nim to write sth like this: "uint32_t mFooMember : 16" ? Currently using {.size: 2.} but not sure if I'm doing it correctly
12:44 < EastByte> what's the 16 for?
12:45 < BeaR_> mFooMember will have a size of 16bit
12:45 < EastByte> mFooMember: uint16
12:45 < BeaR_> well actually it's an enum value with a size of 32bit
12:46 < BeaR_> not sure currently writing a wrapper for a C Api
12:46 < EastByte> me too^^
12:46 < BeaR_> ^^
13:58 <@deen> BeaR_: I'm not sure i understand that c code even^
13:59 < BeaR_> ok thx anyway :D
13:59 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #214: Fix bug with constant demo autorecording. Fixes #213 (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vLvT9
14:00 <@deen> Shiki: still records
14:01 < Shiki> wtf
14:01 < Shiki> where?
14:01 <@deen> on the same server
14:01 <@deen> wait
14:01 < Shiki> are you sure?
14:01 <@deen> i think i forgot to pull
14:01 <@deen> ^^
14:01 < Shiki> I checked there at least twice
14:01 <@deen> alright, works
14:01 <@deen> thanks
14:01 < Shiki> thanks for merging!
14:13 <@deen> If anyone wants to fix something: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1588
14:14 < EastByte> the dummy feature is such a mess
14:14 <@deen> yes!
14:14 <@deen> moving it server-side would be a solution I guess^^
14:15 < EastByte> hmm
14:16 < Edible> wb deen!
14:16 <@deen> thanks
14:17 < EastByte> econ in the ddnet branch is kinda broken btw.
14:17 < EastByte> looks like there is a 1 second timeout before receiving tcp packets
14:18 <@deen> i don't like/use econ, but if you have a fix, PR please
14:18 < EastByte> well I would like to pullrequest this: https://github.com/east/ddnet/commit/d9cc5a7458aa1c39830f28d86f32d7f6a1ff48be
14:18 < EastByte> to fix the econ server restart problem
14:19 <@deen> sure, looks fine
14:19 < EastByte> okay
14:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #215: Fix: econ port rebind on restart (DDRace64...econfix) http://git.io/vLvBg
14:20 < EastByte> oh wait
14:21 < EastByte> https://github.com/east/ddnet/commit/0128456ed3991816ec45038d95e7cb07a6ef04c2
14:21 < EastByte> why is this in the pullrequest
14:21 <@deen> first merge, then make PR
14:22 < EastByte> but the branch is already merged to DDRace64
14:22 < EastByte> okay the PR says only one file changed
14:22 < EastByte> so it's fine?
14:22 <@deen> yeah
14:23 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vLvRk
14:23 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 d9cc5a7 east: allow reuse of tcp addr on restart

14:23 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 fcec3ac Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #215 from east/econfix...
14:23 < EastByte> I actually wanted to make this fix years ago
14:23 < BeaR_> eh no need to merge
14:24 < EastByte> what do you mean?
14:24 < BeaR_> if there are no conflicts you dont need the merge the master branch into your own branch
14:24 < BeaR_> and if so it's better to rebase imho
14:24 < EastByte> ah okay
17:06 <@deen> Shiki: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/216
17:09 < Shiki> WTF
17:11 < EastByte> 0x0000000000477f2a in CStatboard::RenderGlobalStats (this=0xa5a4c0 <gs_Statboard>) at src/game/client/components/statboard.cpp:156
17:11 < EastByte> 156  if(m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_GameFlags&GAMEFLAG_TEAMS)
17:12 < EastByte> m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj is NULL
17:12 < Shiki> thanks!
17:12 < EastByte> np
17:12 < Shiki> I suppose fix consists of adding NULL check for m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj
17:12 < Shiki> maybe you want to commit it? :)
17:14 <@deen> meh, i guess
17:14 <@deen> people are having fun on Tournament server GER #2 btw
17:16 < EastByte> oh forgot about tournament
17:23 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] nzyuzin opened pull request #217: Fix #216 (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vLfIL
17:26 < Shiki> fixed, sorry for that bug
17:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #217: Fix #216 (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vLfIL
17:46 < EastByte> hm my client doesn't do autorecords on ddrace servers anymore
17:52 < snife> deen r u there?
17:54 < EastByte> he is currently ingame on tournament server 2
18:20 < Shiki> EastByte: are you sure?
18:20 < Shiki> recording starts after you pass the start line
18:21 < EastByte> Shiki: I'm talking about the normal autorecord
18:22 < EastByte> we had 3 different recorders, has it changed?
18:26 < Shiki> EastByte: hm, what's the normal autorecord?
18:26 <@deen> Shiki: huh, you changed that?
18:26 <@deen> settings -> general -> autorecord
18:26 <@deen> that should of course still work in ddrace servers
18:26 < EastByte> Shiki: I'm talking about the demo recorder which records independent from racetime
18:27 < Shiki> well, yep
18:27 < Shiki> I changed when OnStartGame is called
18:27 < Shiki> OnStartGame starts autorecord
18:27 < Shiki> changes were done to avoid starting autorecord after server pause
18:28 < Shiki> and recent changes were done to avoid starting autorecord in race mods
18:28 < Shiki> since there's race_demo.cpp for that
18:28 < EastByte> deen: maybe no one has demos of the current weel event now? :D
18:28 <@deen> oh god...
18:29 <@deen> please don't avoid autorecord in race mods!
18:29 <@deen> many use that to record what they spec ingame
18:29 < Shiki> I was told in this channel that it wasn't necessary to start autorecord since there's race_demo.cpp :'(
18:30 <@deen> evil channel!
18:30 <@deen> afk

18:31 < EastByte> wut?
18:31 < Shiki> shit
18:31 < Shiki> sorry
18:32 < Shiki> > 15:02 < Tobii> i meant you dont have to start the normal autorecord at all if the player passes the start line
18:32 < Shiki> > 15:15 < Tobii> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/d7e5a7b9abfdfd1da032df6a5b19896e0c0e15af/src/game/client/components/race_demo.cpp#L30
18:32 < Shiki> dunno maybe I misunderstood that
18:32 < EastByte> hm
18:35 < Shiki> so if I understand the problem correctly -- autorecord still should start when client first joins the server?
18:36 < EastByte> yes
18:44 < WolfAlex_> EastByte: is the ddnet-client also predicting tiles from ddnet on non ddnet servers?
18:44 < EastByte> what kind of prediction?
18:45 < WolfAlex_> gamelayer
18:45 < WolfAlex_> tile 61-63
18:45 < WolfAlex_> 60-62*
18:46 < EastByte> hm let me see
18:50 < EastByte> WolfAlex_: what tiles are these?
18:51 < WolfAlex_> these tiles with that you collide (in some directions) and in some you can walk thru
18:51 < EastByte> TILE_STOP = 60,
18:51 < EastByte> TILE_STOPS,
18:51 < EastByte> TILE_STOPA,
18:51 < EastByte> dunno how they are called
18:51 < WolfAlex_> yes
18:54 < EastByte> hm there seems to be no ddnet check
18:54 < EastByte> so I guess it's predicted in every mod
18:54 < WolfAlex_> add that check ._. pls
18:55 < EastByte> could you test it pls? :D
18:56 < WolfAlex_> is the ddnet check still just a check of the gametype?
18:58 < EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/shared/serverbrowser.cpp
18:58 < EastByte> I think these are used
18:58 < WolfAlex_> hm
18:59 < WolfAlex_> maybe rewrite the ddnet check, so other mods based on ddnet can also use the client-prediction
19:01 <@deen> apparently we will have a livestream
19:01 <@deen> by hallowed1986
19:01 < EastByte> ah he is back?
19:01 < Shiki> ok, I don't have time to deal with this issue now, I look into it later
19:01 < Shiki> demo issue, I mean
19:02 < EastByte> I guess we won't update the client this night so...
19:12 < WolfAlex_> EastByte: also the settings command does not work for /r 
19:17 < EastByte>  /r ?
19:17 < WolfAlex_> rescue
19:18 <@deen> i think it only works at server start
19:18 < WolfAlex_> i mean that chat command
19:19 < WolfAlex_> that says if something is on or off xd
19:19 <@deen> ah
20:05 <@deen> livestream running on http://ddnet.tw
