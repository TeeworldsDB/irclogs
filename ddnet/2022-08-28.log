04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Pretty name!
04:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks c:
06:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> wtf
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This is getting really tiring I'll explain so many times map creators make money thus if you are a loser you can still make a map and make money that way or you can make skins and sell them
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That's only the beginning of the game later on there should be more
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> As I said it's getting really tiring attack and another attack
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> can i sell monkey skins?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> i already told you, only twinbop
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> I'm gonna be honest with you. This community will never respond positiv about this topic. If you want to do it then just go for it. People in this community don't like change. It is what it is. If you really want to realize this whole idea you need to find 1 person that knows this game really well and knows what the player actually want. There are way bigger problems to be handled right now then making profit. I you actually launch that proj

13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What is `coverage.map`? It came with the last update

13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> map for integration test
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What does it do?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tee falls thru tiles, if we broke something very badly we get asan warning
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> will practice mode include super?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> or does it work way to differently
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> or does it work way too differently
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want it to. I think the safeguards from people making ranks with it have been around for long enough that it's safe-ish to implement now
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have the cheat flag all the way from ddrace times and the practice flag is also very sticky. I trust them enough
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we should implement this nicely though cuz not everyone is supposed to see you while being super in a practice team, and the transparency shouldnt be changed from others, and and and
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> needs client & server change to be done correctly

23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we could 100% optimize this BTW lots of reused tiles here
