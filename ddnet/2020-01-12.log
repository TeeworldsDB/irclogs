13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> is trashmap down? getting timeouts when creating server
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> nor join any on the list
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> Ddos
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> wtf did u rly change rifle -> laser and laser -> shotgun?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> whats wrong with u
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> shotgun was never named laser lol
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> ah ye my bad, shotgun didnt change
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> just rifle -> laser
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It was a 0.7 change and @ChillerDragon applied it to ddnet
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> why
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> just why
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idl
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> k
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> it just confuses everyone
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is it so bad for you?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> people were used to it, it was like that since forever
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> why change it after 1000 years
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @fokkonaut hes jsut complaining for the sake of it
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> leave it be
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> ^
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> he even complained with wrong facts
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> kinda shows how far he would go just to whine
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> snail toxic
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aight
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> there was no reason for that change
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> now i have to redo 20 binds or what
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u have to redo 1 bind lol
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> uff such work
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> jao was saying it was dumb a month ago, everything was ok, now i complain about it its just trashtalking
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> ok
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> fair enough
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> you dont know my bind scripts
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :greenthing:
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> typical ddnet admins
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> unplayable
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> typical toxic players :greenthing:
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, it was changed in user-visible ways?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> for me it makes sense
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> my binds are server cmds
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> as a new player u expect laser to be a laser
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> not a rifle
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> why not allow both
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye i guess that would be better
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, but it's an rcon command, so it's not *that* bad
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> there are no new players
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd also go for `laser` instead of `rifle` first
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> @Jesus Christ’s Life matter!
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wtf snail
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> as an old player you expect it to be rifle
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there are far more old players
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so which one has a bigger impact :tee_thinking: :tee_thinking: :tee_thinking:
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cleaning up unexpected quirks also has its benefits
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @jao ye as i agreed keeping both is better
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but clearly laser is more intuitive
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> than "rifle"
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also "there are more old players so it should stay that way" is a bad approach imo
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> just because we've been used to something flawed and accommodated to it doesnt mean it should stay that way forever
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (but i agree unnecessarily forcing ppl to change their habits is also bad if we can keep old ways while introducing a better one)
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rifle makes no sense tbh
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a rifle fires lot of bullets
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is just a laser
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that was the plan for laser at first, thats why there are unused rifle bullets
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @snail you can do such breaking changes on major version changes (like 0.6 -> 0.7) i dont see how it’s flawed it’s just a different name
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well in that case its more about being counter intuitive
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> than a real flaw
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> still "clunky"
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> to have a laser named rifle
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the real flaw is that sv_pausable is named sv_pauseable
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lmao
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :justatest: :justatest: :justatest: :justatest: :justatest: :justatest:
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> If people get used to the rifle name now it makes it less annoying when updating to 0.7
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> If this is a real problem then it should be fixed in the upstream
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in vanilla it's not exposed to the user
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It should still be consistent
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And names of sound files could be exposed to power users
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> wtff who calls the blue laser a rifle
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> the shotgun is shotgun and laser is laser
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wtf who calls the sytoox a cha
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> waiting for the war between _rocket_ and _grenade_
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> gun-pistol
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mishmish> lol
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen how do you build curl for mac?
17:45 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-lib-update.sh#L212
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Hi i found a bug with animations
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> when you use penalty tiles the animation doesnt change
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> so it is not tied to the gametime
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> like it says it does
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> when you hit synchronize
