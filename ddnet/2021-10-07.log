10:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao you could go through french community with that, if u have any anti-ddos solution for fivem
10:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's a guy scamming the entire community, ddosing each server then coming to them, selling his shit protection based on iptables
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We're already hosting a majority of US servers
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> just not proxied of course
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if I remember he's like selling his shit iptables rules for about 400â‚¬
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> lol
10:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> No idea why anybody would purchase that
10:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> because they get massively attacked (by the same guy selling the protection lol, but they don't know about that)
10:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Should be pretty common sense
10:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Should be pretty common sense not to purchase some random scripts to be fair
10:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> his iptables rules is a whitelist based protection, + he even added a fake rule inside his script to whitelist himself (or any ip) by sending a packet with a specific udp checksum
10:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> reisux
10:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nou
10:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> his iptables rules is a whitelist based protection, + he even added a fake rule inside his script to whitelist himself (or any ip) by sending a packet with a specific udp checksum value
10:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> +1, but well, some "big" servers created by people who doesn't really have knowledge, when they get attacked a lot, they just want it to stop tho, they don't care to buy that much
10:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig they make much more than the price of this protection, with all the shit they sell
10:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddosmafiaaa
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> You'd be surprised
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> there's the type of people who spend $1500 on server list boosts
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but spending $200 on a dedicated server is too much for them
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ddmafia :pepeH:

15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Itube> Go live
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <LCSG47> u
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Itube> no you pro Streamer
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> @heinrich5991 would it be possible to default the ban reason to just say 'follow the server rules' or '/rules' instead of 'no reason given'?
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> (if no reason given) ^^
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi is this about rcon or votes? or the global bans?
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> rcon
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the motivation is that this is your most frequent ban reason and it'd allow you to type less?
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Yes!
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Lazy sheep
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> deen already changed the default ban duration from banned for life to 30 minutes
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> indeed :P
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> just demote
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ez
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I don't see that deen changed the default ban duration, that seems to have come from somewhere else(?)
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi if you'd find that interesting: do you want to make the PR? I can tell you where you need to make the changes (I can also do it, doesn't take long)
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> hm, weird. I thought he changed it
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if you emote-mute players they still can change eyes
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> emotes without emoticons
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> damn, these smooth emojis in beta really look nice ðŸ™‚
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks @Jupstar âœª
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they look really weird when you played 10 years with the others xD, almost too smooth
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder if this change will break people's workflowâ€¦
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> new challenge xd
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i use it since it was merged, and using an old client looks really bad now, so i guess its just getting used to it xD
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 GER1 Insane is not in the list right now
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 45.144.246.100:8306
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its back
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it seems to be an issue with the hhtp master
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because it also happens with my server
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (which has always been ignored by everyone)
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> It happens to our servers sometimes too
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Instead of 0.6 it only registered as 0.7
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Instead of 0.6 its only registered as 0.7
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, its a problem with the http master not getting the request correctly, idk. Because it only requests every few seconds it can easily "oversee" packets or something and then server isnt registered for the next few runs
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 is instant and self-requested though
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why it always work
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you set Leak IP for your server in DDNet and manually ping it in Favourites, it also works
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand that explanation
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK the server's response must be missing 10 times before it's removed from the list
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so 50s?
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, apparently it retries faster if it doesn't get the response fast enough, 1s per try
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so 10s
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (it still allows the older info responses though)
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Weird, why and/or how did the ddnet server disappear then?
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I double checked, it also was not part of the DDNet tab anymore
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But nice to know that its not a problem from my side at least xd
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand why servers go missing
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the list is way more volatile than I expected
