02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool thing we could do is create a form that lets you enter like 5 GitHub issues you would like to see fixed and then people can review what issues are the most wanted
04:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> for those who saw my box2d video and are interested
04:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> http://github.com/headshot2017/ddnet-box2d
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u can learn cpp and fix it :monkalaugh:
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> will anyone mind if i'll replace NoHit* bools in CCharacterCore with int m_Hit?
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer using bools
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will only know if u make a pr and ppl discussi t
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> pro
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1: Why? 2: The character core is shared across the network, have you considered compatibility?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 1 - possibility to iterate `DISABLE_HIT*`
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 2 - i don't want to change net objects, only game part
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª can we use https://github.com/google/angle ?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for bad graphics opengl driver problems
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh, only GLES 2.0 on dx9, that would default all users to our GL 1.x backend probably
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> And also depends how good the dx9 backend is written
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But we could theoretically try
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Most ppl that currently have bugs manually change the graphic settings
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the fallback works
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 if you are on your mac, could you do me a favour and do
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `gfx_opengl_major 4; gfx_opengl_minor 5`
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> restart and send me the renderer string in the F1 console
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think except on linux we can also just prevent GL 3.3 if you don't have like OpenGL 4.3 or even 4.5
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on master?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> doesnt matter
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> latest version is fine too
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/di
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok thanks
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can create a 4.1 context btw
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's the max supported on atleast my version of macOS with my hw configuration (10.15 with an amd gpu)
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/amd/ati/
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I guess radeon 555 is amd, apple just didn't rename the driver ðŸ˜›
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i'll atleast do it on windows for now
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why btw?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just a heuristic you noticed that drivers that can't do 4.3, 4.5 don't do 3.3 correctly?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah seems like there are drivers that are old but say they already support 3.3
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably mostly AMD
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> AMD 7800 or smth
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or 6000 series
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI-Radeon-HD-4000-Serie
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they for sure atleast
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rest isnt clear, if thats only on windows 10 or also on win7
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But they don't support it fully?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they have bugs
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cant imagine another reason ppl change to GL 3.3 and have texture glitches
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my father also has an 6000 series i think
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with win7
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you 100% sure that we are within spec of 3.3? We were using functions from the future in the 2.x backend atleast
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but 3.3 has renderdoc
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2.x was blindly writing
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How strict is renderdoc when it comes to the spec? Or the software renderer you tested on, how strict is that?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> renderdoc atleast shows when you use invalid API, i tested it
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ofc not all possible stuff
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Invalid as in the driver says its invalid or does renderdoc do its own checking
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've encountered drivers that just let you use higher version functionality or silently fail
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> renderdoc has an own software renderer
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, so barring a logic mistake in our code, the 3.3 renderer is atleast correct as far as renderdoc is correct
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well my android phone works atleast xxD
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if a shitty 5 years old 5 watt system can render it correctly, then the chance is atleast not too small
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only I could get my hands on such a broken system it'd be pretty fun to debug
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> let me find that old amd card xd
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok HD 5670
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and it even renders on GL 4.5 correctly under win10
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the driver is from 2015
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> either under win7 it was worse and they fixed the drivers for win10
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or i had a different problem last time i tested xd
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the wikipedia article is wrong then
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it says 5000 series only support GL 4.4
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> MINIMUM:
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> OS: MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® XP or newer
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Someone with steam access should update this
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> XP isnt supported and probably won't anymore
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - HTTPS and discord api
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for xp we can use old serverbrowser and disable discord api
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure what the current state is and if it starts on xp at all. maybe no one cares anymore
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt start ðŸ˜„
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, probably not worth making a build without discord api
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah probably not ^^

20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lol
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then we can remove the ifdefs in code for xp too
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah sounds good
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon find -delete or sth lile that
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rm test\_1\* did the job
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> Someone recommends some c++ gui (other than GTK+) for linux?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im just suprised never saw that
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> qt5
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or ls -print0|xargs -0 rm etc.
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ye
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i just crashed my client by loading 100k skins \:D
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> Ty, I'll check that ðŸ™‚
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: really? but memory limit?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i had cases where i had to increase the stack size so i can pass more files to a program, was multiple MB of params
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wtf ðŸ˜®
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> llvm-cov wanted to have every path and our source code at work is huge
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> impressive
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> few mb of paths as code ðŸ˜„
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> must be more than 50k files
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also historically grown long parhs ðŸ˜„
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i calculated with 7mb stack and 128 bytes per path
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only some part of stack is reserved for params i think
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah makes sense
