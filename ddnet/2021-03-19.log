00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If it helps what I saw is that the person who called /save can only /load otherwise you get that 'dont belong to this team' message. Happened to me with a mate when we were in a team of 2 only.

00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It consistently happens when you save and try to load as the main tee that saved, at least for me.
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> With just 2 tees, me and my dummy
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It doesn't happen when saving and loading as the dummy
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But when you try and load with your main tee, it always says you don't belong to the team
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Loading just consistently doesn't work with your main tee, for whatever reason. (When using a dummy)
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think it's related to the order of people connecting to the server?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The last one connected can /load just fine?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hey I'm working on a small pull request (in the file `src/game/editor/editor.cpp`) and executing the `fix_style.py` script changed some lines I did not edit myself
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do I exclude/include those lines or is smth wrong with my setup in some way?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The last one connected can /load just fine? (The last person that connected to the server during the /save can load it even if they connect to the server first when loading the save.)
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, I'm fairly positive it has something to do with the order the tees connected in. The last tee connected during the initial /save can always /load.

13:20 <+ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum why tiles per second? I am not sure if my code is correct but normal walking speed would be 2 then a hook swing around 4

13:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/suites/2297118382/artifacts/48139913 you probably need a github account to dl it @Im 'corneum
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> this works without account idk how long i will keep it there tho https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/chillerbot-ux-windows-latest.zip
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> ``cl_show_speed 1``
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol theres no way walking speed is 2 tiles per second
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also omg i hate local/global variable stuff so much its always confusing and doesnt work
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> use `g_` prefix for global variables
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and `m_` for member variables
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and `s_` for static variables ðŸ˜„
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean apparently it's not consistent, we loaded a save just like that with murpi. I saved I loaded it worked just fine
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can get it to happen consistently please make a save and when it won't load let me know the code, I need to take a look at the save
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> @louis well then my code is broken :D
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> i assumed vel / 32 gives you tiles per tick and divided by tick speed it should give per second
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (units / tick)/32 gets you (tiles / tick), 50 ticks in a second so multiply by 50 not divide ðŸ˜›
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well in that case it would be broken anyways as you'd be calculating 100 tiles per tick o_o
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why no
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why should it
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (units / tick)/32 = (tiles / tick)
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1 tile = 32 units
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so 5 units per tick = 5/32
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then you have 5/32 tiles per tick
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then multiply with 50
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because 1 second has 50 ticks
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well he said he divided tiles/tick and divided by tick speed, so that means his tiles/tick would be 2*50 if he calculated 2 for the end result
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i meant the answer he got before or w/e
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think he has a unit mistake somewhere else
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 100 tiles/tick sounds insane
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait isnt vel in debug tiles/second
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or is it smth else
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should be tiles per second iirc
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Doesn't matter I just want to compare runs. But blocks per second is a simple to understand unit
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Hope it's sensitive enough
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> well the current value is some value
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> I could just show the vel divided by 32 then walking speed is 80
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> idk what this ramp thing is
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon you dont have discord anymore?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ramp doesnt matter here, we use it to make sure your speed doesnâ€™t get too high
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It also gives the extremely odd behaviour of you stopping if you go too fast ðŸ˜›
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 1 second into the run. looks like more than 4 blocks from the finish. i need something to tell me if i got a fast swing or slow swing because you cant really tell otherwise. on this map specificly, you need to hold your speed for so long that it adds up
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/822482005148434522/screenshot_2021-03-19_15-41-05.png
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 1 second into the run. looks like more than 4 blocks from the start to me. i need something to tell me if i got a fast swing or slow swing because you cant really tell otherwise. on this map specificly, you need to hold your speed for so long that it adds up

16:27 <+ChillerDragon> No I do not have discord anymore @Im 'corneum I updated https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/chillerbot-ux-windows-latest.zip its now more accurate btw this client also has all the other features you requested. Like typing for fonts in editor and rename before finish.
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesnt matter, ull fail the ending on that map anyways
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i got it like 80% of the times
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 24sec time now
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol p big diff in rank 1 and 2 on that map
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah nether and fudgy are on another level
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but i think its all about swings in his map because nether did a 23 on a server with health so he couldnt shoot all the time
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u have a less-than-optimal swing u lose a lot of time since u hold for long times in a row
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats what i need the speedo for ðŸ˜„
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> optimized gameplay :monkaS:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> imagine someone who optimizes their display for best gameplay
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like using a skin w/ lines on important angles
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i treid some and mostly its just too annoying
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and that entities wheel UI always on
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wish the entities map could be displayed over game tiles in some cases
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well it might be possible actually
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh i wish there was some setting to disable ninja particles unless its a pickup
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cuz with a lot of frozen ppl in 1 place, the particle effect rly  gets in the way
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> Chillerbot best client btw
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/3104642254782501629/
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> any idea what happened?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> smells like a permission issue or maybe the broken storage.cfg we have?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon this is much better thanks ðŸ™‚
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi probably deleting the Teeworld dir in %appdata% and habing ddnet client recreate it should fix it (better than running as admin)
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ok
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how deen makes money ðŸ˜› ^
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Even if I took all the donations for myself, I think there are easier ways to earn money ðŸ˜„
