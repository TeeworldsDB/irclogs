02:36 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> melon: itâ€™s back up
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> another arch update broke ddnet? i think this time its nvidia driver which causes big stutter 
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf is this 
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> current latest arch is fully rendering ddnet client unusable for me
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to switch to debian?
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> I feel like linux generally is pretty unstable rn xd
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it vibe coders?
10:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: will there be another debugging stream? :santatrollet:
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> breaking the linux ecosystem
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh hell na @milkeeycat 
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> time to switch to stable distro
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> have 10 years old software
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet 9
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just downgraded all packages and called it a day @milkeeycat xd this bug someone else can debug
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet 9 is goated
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> I am still waiting for valve to hire me for linux ecosystem
11:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ChillerDragon: you also get the stutter? are you sure it's from nvidia driver? i use nvidia-open for last like couple months and now i get stutter frames
11:04 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> maybe i go back to proprietary for a while
11:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Since when? I got it from yesterdays update
11:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I just assumed itâ€™s NVIDIA because that was one of the packages I upgraded
11:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> hmm that's weird. i still havent figured out if it's my new cpu, new graphics driver, and maybe ddnet changing some rendering stuff XD
11:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> too many changed variables
11:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t think itâ€™s ddnet
11:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> You could also try teeworlds which changes less or older ddnet
11:58 < bridge_> <A Moderator> chillerdragon: when mmotee
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zwelf i got some sql warning in my mod and have no idea how to debug it. ``2025-04-12 11:59:38 I mysql: can't free last result (free_result:stmt:5025): Statement has no result set``
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is just a warning and everything still works but i still have the feeling it should be investigated
12:06 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @zwelf2 ^
12:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty
12:49 < bridge_> <A Moderator> we have the same on BW - i'd be interested in knowing that too xD
13:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Tbf I wanted to add more named colors for a while to support all 16 named css colors

15:17 < bridge_> <A Moderator> how did you install mariadb? given its a linker error i assume you're crosscompiling and you're using the msvc mariadbclient?
15:23 < bridge_> <filoqcus> I downloaded mariadb from https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&r=11.7.2&os=windows&cpu=x86_64&pkg=msi&mirror=mangohost.
15:23 < bridge_> <filoqcus> 
15:23 < bridge_> <filoqcus> Also, I'm not using cross-compilation this time. I'm on Windows.
15:23 < bridge_> <filoqcus> :nouis:
15:23 < bridge_> <A Moderator> you're using mingw with gnu, cant use msvc mariadb
15:23 < bridge_> <A Moderator> check if mariadb is available in msys2
15:30 < bridge_> <filoqcus> It's in msys2
15:33 < bridge_> <A Moderator> use that then xD

18:25 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
18:25 < bridge_> <learath2> This is with connlimit set to 5 and connlimit time set to 20
18:25 < bridge_> <learath2> Within 20 seconds, that's way more than 5 connections
18:28 < bridge_> <fushi_gg> that is indeed a lot more than 5
18:28 < bridge_> <learath2> I think I know why, it's comparing the port too ðŸ˜„
18:31 < bridge_> <fushi_gg> that sounds like an easier fix then atleast
18:32 < bridge_> <fushi_gg> I already thought it had something to do with the timer or not recording connections properly
18:35 < bridge_> <learath2> This should do for now. I'll have to look into doing this with a `std::map` later
18:36 < bridge_> <learath2> With an ordered map getting the oldest entry should be cheap, and finding the ip in the list should also be cheap
18:37 < bridge_> <learath2> And we can keep track of all ips, it's perhaps not the optimal data structure to store ips, a trie would be better, but whatever, we don't need to over optimize
18:41 < bridge_> <learath2> @zwelf2 are you around?
18:42 < bridge_> <zwelf2> more/less
18:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Do you know off the top of your head what `PlayerDiffWithoutNew` is and why it might be happening in fairly new teehistorian files?
18:44 < bridge_> <zwelf2> PlayerNew is for tee spawning
18:45 < bridge_> <zwelf2> if it is missing, we dont know where the tee spawned
18:47 < bridge_> <zwelf2> can you check whether the playernew is actually missing or if this is a bug in the replayer?
18:47 < bridge_> <learath2> There is a playernew is there, what would cause it to get deleted? a Drop?
18:48 < bridge_> <zwelf2> yeah, drop sounds like it could do it
18:48 < bridge_> <learath2> tbf, there is nothing in there that would drop it
18:48 < bridge_> <zwelf2> why is there a diff after a drop ðŸ˜…
18:48 < bridge_> <learath2> I didn't find a Drop, I was just curious what might cause it to be lost
18:49 < bridge_> <zwelf2> and also playerOld
18:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Just 3 ticks ago the `PlayerChange` worked completely fine for that cid
18:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Would you mind taking a quick look at the file if you have a couple minutes?
18:49 < bridge_> <zwelf2> heh. yes. But only in an hour or so
18:50 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, if I don't figure it out myself in an hour I'll drop you a message
18:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Worst part is this is all written in Rust so I'm not very good with gdb and rust ðŸ˜„
18:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh, this is acutally absurd. I thought it was cid 1 causing the issue, it's cid 2, 2 never joined ever
19:07 < bridge_> <learath2> and it's not the map change thing, or he somehow managed to stay in preauth/auth for 23 minutes across 5 map changes
19:08 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, I give up on this one. You can take a look but somehow we are losing joins in a new way
19:10 < bridge_> <learath2> or we are logging playerchange for non-existant cids that's also possible I guess
19:34 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
19:34 < bridge_> <learath2> 2271831 AuthLogout { cid: 2 }
19:34 < bridge_> <learath2> 2276127 AuthLogin { cid: 53, level: 2, identity: "..." }
19:34 < bridge_> <learath2> 2276209 AuthLogout { cid: 2 }
19:34 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
19:34 < bridge_> <learath2> The double logout, I didn't think this one was ever possible, even the double login makes more sense
19:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Timeouts can generate logouts on tees that aren't even logged in ðŸ˜„
20:44 < bridge_> <learath2> Exceptionally productive day. Very surprising. Now food time
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> It seems like we have a new bug that we don't write `PlayerNew` teehistorian chunks after a `PlayerOld`
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Same file
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> ```
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> PlayerDiff cid=0 diff=(0, -5);
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> PlayerOld cid=0;
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> PlayerDiff cid=0 diff=(-1, 0);
20:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> ```
20:59 < bridge_> <learath2> There is no `PlayerOld` in there either for that cid though
21:00 < bridge_> <zwelf2> We probably don't update the player position for dead players anymore in teehistorian
21:00 < bridge_> <zwelf2> or similar
21:01 < bridge_> <zwelf2> (probably different, but bug is very likely in ddnet and hopefully recently introduced)
21:01 < bridge_> <learath2> FWIW the cid that causes the issue never even Joined the game, let alone PlayerOld or PlayerNew'd
21:03 < bridge_> <zwelf2> ^ the sequence here should also never happen
21:04 < bridge_> <zwelf2> (same file, unrelated to the cid=2, but still
21:06 < bridge_> <learath2> All a little sad really, a lot of files that will forever require special extra cases to parse

21:55 < bridge_> <always> no problem
22:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> you should fix the CI
22:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> clang-tidy tells u the issues if you scroll up a little bit in the build w clang-tidy workflow log
23:22 < bridge_> <kollpotato> does ddnet store chat/console logs somewhere as files?
23:23 < bridge_> <kollpotato> ive been thinking of doing an analysis of what people most commonly say in the chat
23:23 < bridge_> <always> most common message in ur servers: u fat
23:27 < furo> @kollpotato You can use the `demo_extract_chat` tool to extract the chatlogs from your demos. Otherwise you can define a log file with `logfile [file]` and then `logappend 1` to always append to it.
23:35 < bridge_> <kollpotato> thanks furo
