01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Skeith suggested that one could disallow people from finishing as a team if they lose one tee
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to fix people skipping first parts with extra tees
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't really like that, I think it should be okay to lose someone on the way and still get a team rank
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> uh no, bad idea
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem is that I see no way to distinguish between "tee acidentally lost on the way" and "tee intentionally killed to skip early parts"
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so unless we find a way to do that, I think it should stay possible to finish with an incomplete team
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Playing with more than 2 tees will almost always be slower anyways. I believe people would mostly only use extra tees (dummies) to bypass certain parts, not actually speedrun with them.
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's undeniable that people play in larger teams for fun as well
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can obviously say that you don't want to support that
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think that'd be bad
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think it's fine to do that, as long as everyone finishes.
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what if it's on a faily map
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but that's unlikely with larger teams
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> i thought if someone dies in a team all die
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only with /lock @Dr.Funmanteddy
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> oh ok
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> but then why would you get a team rank for an unlocked team?
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Team ranks should be used for speedrunning, it sounds more like they're just playing the map... Idk, I just prefer the old idea of speedrunning, 2 tees doing the map as fast as possible
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it was deemed okay to lose tees on the way @Dr.Funmanteddy
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Skeith so you're saying that team ranks are only for speed runners. that's fine
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> well yeah you can keep the finish but the team rank its self should be for locked teams
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I disagree with that statement, I think they're also for people playing in a team for fun
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'm extrapolating that statement because you say that teams shouldn't be able to finish for a team rank if they lose someone. that seems unrealstic for larger teams playing for fun, hence my statement above)
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It sounds like there should be a different category for speedrun ranks then, I really thought team ranks were the whole point of that
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why a different category when speedrunners are always on top?
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rank and teamrank points should be consolidated into time points, solo+dummy gives based on rank and 2p maps gives based on teamrank with no kills
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if that was to be added
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i think there isnt much point to do that
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because he's saying that speedrunning should not contain killing tees for speed
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Because skipping parts with the use of extra tees that you kill off afterwards seems weird for speedrunning
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's also part of the game, i don't understand why you would want to restrict that
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> cutting is part of any race game
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Well, it wasn't a part of the game initially, dummy didn't always exist
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I guess you could have other players help you
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> i think its fine if its just dummies but like if you got 20 people to help you and kill would be silly
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dummy didn't exist since the beginning of ddnet?
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But I don't think anyone really did that back in the day?
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm talking before ddnet
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, ddnet only has ranks since ddnet
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not that i know, it was added shortly after
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> commit 3dce4c94899f95c8b9ca52bd25fd6a2a52e10b62

01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>     Add dummy (Thanks to //toast and Monsta)
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ddnet created on july 2013
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But speedrunning in the past didn't make use of them, is what I'm saying. Sure it exists now and you could view it as a mechanic, but I don't think a majority of speedrunners enjoy that you need to do it
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, codebrowser lacks a scroll bar for history panel
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think it would at least be a quality of life improvement if future maps didn't allow it. At least for speedrunners.
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> do you have any example of map being cut with tees being ditched?
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Water Lily
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> My rank was beat by Cireme, he didn't even know that certain skips existed until he watched me and Shinoa play it, he was surprised
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Skipping parts gave that much of a time save
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Skipping parts with the use of dummies gave that much of a time save
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> This is the skip he didn't do in his run, but still beat our ranks, due to using dummies
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990038482007240744/unknown.png
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It saves a lot of time
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990038660210630676/unknown.png
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You skip the long section at the bottom by putting 2 tees through the first 2 parts quickly
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm sure there are maps that have bigger time saves using this method
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shows one for me on Firefox
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> doesn't for me
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990040332660011018/unknown.png
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> firefox 101.0.1
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ubuntu
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @Cireme Do you have any input on the topic?
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Respond in #general I guess
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> > But speedrunning in the past didn't make use of them, is what I'm saying.
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You're stating this as a fact. Can you provide any reasoning or evidence?
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Nope, just experience
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Doesn't mean much I guess
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh i thought it was updated version
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im pretty sure the android build is broken anyway
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Does anyone have tried to build for android recently?
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes works for me
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh then fine ðŸ™‚
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did/can you upload the apk on ddnet.tw/download ?
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why, u cannot relly use it, no controls
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can use it with keyboard and mouse xD
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah but compiling SDL is currently broken
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sdl/src/audio/openslES/SDL_openslES.c:163:25: error: mixing declarations and code is incompatible with standards before C99 [-Werror,-Wdeclaration-after-statement]
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>     const SLInterfaceID ids[1] = { SL_IID_VOLUME };
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao, i kinda feel like Sdl is alwys broken for me
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what the hell is that error?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they use local variables but dont delcare them at the start of the function i guess
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in c99 u put your locals at the start
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, but why c99 anyway? can't you change standard?
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes i'll add it i guess. maybe cmake is doing this, i read that arch also had problems with that ðŸ˜„
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> -std=c11 i think
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, maybe indeed cmake adds its own set of flags
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16965638/remove-default-flags-on-cmake>
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Arch-Linux-Bizarre-Zstd
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw this was not a performance hit actually
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it was just that c99 has no timespec structure or smth like that
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> already posted by ryozuki i think
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but yeah flags can have weird interaction with optimization pass order as well
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah no, posted by you last week ðŸ˜„
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/987940120818749460
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but its funny that its kinda related
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sdl/src/render/opengles/SDL_render_gles.c:26:10: fatal error: 'SDL_opengles.h' file not found
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> #include "SDL_opengles.h"
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I dunno, smth is really broken in SDL repo xd
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how big is the android studio dependency?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1-2gb
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i remember for a school project having to download like 20GB of their ide+compiler
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe if u compile urself xD
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it was on windows though
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe i choosed default installation which came with simulator/emulator as well
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even then it should not be 20gb xD
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe the emulator img is that huge
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i ended up deleting it as soon as the project was over
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> android studio was struggling to run on my poor pc with 4gb ram
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i had to buy another stick
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which was actually the only good thing to come out of that project ðŸ˜„
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Chairn gradle only support java 17 yet
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe thats a problem for u
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/20372
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u tried with java 19
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why DEV=ON ?
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in the cmake call in cmake_android.sh
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> back then it probs was not related to checksum
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then its easier to use debug & release client
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does it overwrite other stuff too?
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i kinda dislike all this complexity anyway
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it keeps debug symbol, i don't think we need them for android
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they are stripped by gradle on release
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's c89, c99 is the one that allowed mixing
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> more annoying is that it uses a border instead of an outline and changes the line breaks all the time when i hover over one element ðŸ˜„
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah true misread it
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> before c99 ðŸ˜„
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you still scrape for new maps?

16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> bruh you are fast :D
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @ChillerDragon why you didn't use timeout utility rather than wait_for_fifo in integration_test.sh ?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> currently, script lives forever if server crash
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I wonder how @ ChillerDragon is displayed in IRC
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> he's using matricks

17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> shouldnt it be compile time instead
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok dunno if we ship sqlite ourself
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it does pass integration test with my outdated version
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> @Chairn you mean `expect` or what? No particular reason i tend to just crack down stuff my self instead of working with other tools. It just easier for me to understand
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> and it just works :D i have horrible expirience with `expect` and see no reason to add another dependency if bashs native fifo check works so well

18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no i mean timeout https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timeout.1.html
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do i use valgrind.supp file?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i cant see my mouse cursor when teeworlds is open unless i hide the application (osx 10.15.4, ddnet 16.1)
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it wasnt like this in ddnet 15.5
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> did u try changing display mode or renderer
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> in graphics tab
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> update OS

20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh changing gl version fixed it also giving 3-4k fps ty
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks can you cancel #5504 ?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> thx
21:15 <+ChillerDragon> @Chairn ah nice im def gonna use that in some of my projects but dont see how its useful in the CI
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> script can lives forever if server crashes
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> with timeout 20 it will last 20 seconds max
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oO
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is that safe ? <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/prediction/gameworld.cpp#L34-L36>
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no wtf
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess he wanted to write if
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no just no xd
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but maybe the remove entity makes problems
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe its safer to copy all objects to a temporary list first
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this code is such a mess xD
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im still trying to attach gdb to one of the client
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> both crash
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i cant fucking have interactivity with gdb through the script...
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> I always get MemoryLeak messages from UBSan whenever i close the client or crash :d
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i got them too, you can ignore them
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> best part is that these leaks are not from the client but from other libs
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> This is why source is not visible like others?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> Or says Direct/Indirect leaks
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i'd say it is safe
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just really unintuitive code
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Chairn yeah i'm also able to reproduce on integration test, but this time not wayland related
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/990340644511813673/log
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this fucking bash is creating a subprocess of itself and i get pid of bash and not ddnet...
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check the integration test script
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i solved that part ðŸ˜„
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im trying to attach debugger to running instance of ddnet in the script
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i got only bash subprocess' pid with $!
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thatâ€˜s weird, sounds like it should work
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if we invoke the process with & and no nohup or other stuff
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, it uses `||` and i realised i modified the wrong line
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and obviously it doesnt crash anymore
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like its very timing dependent
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nice heisenbug we got here
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where should i set the breakpoint?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> destructors aren't called when it doesn't crash...
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like stack corruption of vtable corruption
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> address executed is on 2 instructions
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i think i get libpng related messages this time :d

22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our storage is not thread safe
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> create an issue on github pls and ping heinrich or smth that the jobs should be cleaned before any kind of destruction happens
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I dunno if storage is save for saving but since the code exists for ever i guess its fine^^
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah no its actually loading data
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then it probs not fine, dunno, maybe for just opening files it is
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess aslong readfile from storage isnt used or snmth like that
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i give up
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> its beyond my capacities
