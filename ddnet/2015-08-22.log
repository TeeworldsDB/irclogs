13:08 <@EastByte> [22:52:43] Savander: in the future, maps will be automatically checked to make sure it has start + finish line :P
13:08 < Savander> [22:52:52] hhahaha
13:08 < Savander> [22:52:56] should be...
13:08 < Savander> [22:52:57] :D
13:08 < Savander> [22:53:04] it was big mistake..
13:08 <@EastByte> [22:53:48] well you could badly see it because of the tiles above
13:08 <@EastByte> [22:53:53] (which were green)

13:08 < KinG_> [03:16:39] hey
13:08 < devnull> [03:21:05] hi
13:08 < KinG_> [12:30:23] hey
13:09 <@deen> EastByte: i have a tool to check this around and i used to use it when releasing a mapp
13:17 <@EastByte> deen: is it in your tml branch?
13:18 <@deen> maybe
13:19 <@deen> nope, didn't add it
13:19 <@deen> Now it's there, but dunno if it ever worked well, haven't used it for a long time
13:22 <@EastByte> well I already changed properties.py a little bit to show some information
13:25 <@deen> sounds better, since that has to be run anyway
14:05 <@deen> maybe the autorecorder should just save the map name in the file name instead of "autorecord_date.demo"
14:06 <@deen> and a way to sort demos by filename and date then
14:06 <@deen> might be more convenient
14:48 <@deen> nice, now GER2 has ping 150 for me (amazon in frankfurt)
14:48 < Savander> it's eur?
14:51 <@deen> ?
14:51 < Savander> eur.ddnet.tw?
14:52 <@deen> no, GER2
14:52 < devnull> can't even ping ger2
14:53 <@deen> ingame i mean
14:53 <@deen> icmp is disabled
14:53 <@EastByte> devnull: any idea why abc doesn't work in ger2?
14:53 < devnull> nope
14:53 <@deen> EastByte: fixed
14:53 <@deen> EastByte: still had the block*fifo files
14:53 <@deen> how did you release maps without abc? :P
14:54 <@EastByte> there weren't many players on ger2, so I ignored the bc there
14:54 <@deen> =/
14:54 <@EastByte> so it's absolutely neccessary?
14:55 <@deen> yes, every step in the list is
14:55 <@deen> some people wait for these broadcasts
14:55 <@EastByte> okay, I will keep that in mind
14:59 < BeaR__> btw, can someone change 'Dust's Leaf' from 'Novice' to 'Solo' at http://ddnet.tw/releases/
15:00 <@EastByte> deen: are the map on /releases/ requested from database or is the full html regenerated on each update?
15:01 <@deen> BeaR__: thanks, fixed
15:01 <@deen> EastByte: have to update the releases file if you made a mistake while releasing
15:01 < BeaR__> nice (:
15:01 <@deen> full html regenerated based on releases file
15:02 <@EastByte> can I do that aswell?
15:02 <@deen> do what?
15:02 <@EastByte> "update the releases file"
15:02 <@deen> yes
15:02 <@deen> check the git-update.sh, it's pretty simple
15:03 <@deen> just run these lines: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/git-update.sh#L13-L16
15:03 <@deen> line 12 too for /mapinfo
15:03 <@deen> should maybe rename "update-points.py", back then we only stored points^^
15:03 <@EastByte> but why wasn't fixed after I ran git-update yesterday?
15:04 <@deen> EastByte: the releases file is extremely time-consuming to build
15:04 <@deen> so it will not be rebuilt
15:04 <@deen> you have to edit it manually or remove the wrong entry

20:27 < Chairn> error time_t does not name a type
20:27 <@deen> on windows?
20:27 < Chairn> yup
20:28 <@deen> yeah, i figured that code wouldn't work on windows^^
20:28 <@deen> but it should work kind of like that
20:28 < Chairn> first time appear in storage.cpp
20:28 < Chairn> and another weird error in system.c
20:29 < Chairn> src/base/system.c: In function 'fs_getmtime': src/base/system.c:1697:14: error: storage size of 'sb' isn't known   struct stat sb;

20:34 < Chairn> looks like there are some other errors
20:35 < Chairn> nvm
20:37 < Chairn> seems like mouse is released correctly
20:37 < Chairn> but now, if you hold shift + click on red point in quad, mouse is blocked until you release shift or click
20:40 <@deen> it was always like that
20:40 <@deen> that's ok-ish i think
20:40 <@deen> but if you can fix it without breaking anything, do so
20:40 < Chairn> anyway, cant reproduce mouse hanging like you describe it :o
20:41 < Chairn> i never manipulated quads ^^

20:58 < Chairn> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/221w8e43.aspx
20:59 <@deen> i also read that it should work
20:59 < Chairn> just have to include sys/types.h & sys/stat.h in windows and not only in unix
20:59 < Chairn> it compiles
20:59 <@deen> make a PR for that?
20:59 <@deen> you could also test if it works^^
20:59 < Chairn> ok
20:59 < Chairn> yeah, 
20:59 < Chairn> i make a test file ^^
21:04 < Chairn> well, it works

22:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: teleporter 0? how do you know where the teleporters are?
22:00 <@deen> what are you referring to?
22:01 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/265#event-389584455
22:01 <@deen> teleporter?
22:01 <@heinrich5991> oh wait... switches
22:01 <@deen> it's about switches
22:01 <@heinrich5991> man I should learn how to read...
22:02 <@deen> ^^
22:02 <@heinrich5991> can you set switches with number 0? ^^ is switch number 0 just "no switch"?
22:02 <@deen> i didn't even understand why they need switches with number 0
22:02 <@deen> i think so, yes...
22:02 <@heinrich5991> ah
22:03 <@heinrich5991> maybe they wanted to be able to clear the switch number
22:13 < Savander> LESS looks pretty cool!

22:45 < dhkmt> hello
22:45 <@EastByte> hi
22:45 < Chairn> hello
22:45 <@deen> hi
22:46 < dhkmt> could someone tell me how i can translate the index of a title back into a valid position?
22:47 <@deen> what index of a title?
22:47 <@heinrich5991> dhkmt: index of a title? what does that mean?
22:47 < dhkmt> oh, i mean tile
22:48 <@deen> and what's a valid position?^^
22:48 < dhkmt> vec2 
22:49 <@deen> can't say i understand what you want to do =/
22:49 < dhkmt> so like CCollision::GetTile with param0 my index and return a vec2
22:50 <@deen> CCollision::GetPos
22:51 < dhkmt> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/collision.h
22:51 < dhkmt> can't find GetPos
22:52 <@deen> It's in ddnet :P
22:52 <@deen> i'm not familiar with teeworlds souce
22:52 < dhkmt> troll
22:52 <@deen> ?
22:52 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/collision.h#L73
22:52 < dhkmt> your not familiar with teeworlds source but developing an own client.. troll.
22:53 <@deen> ddnet is based on the ddrace source. I've never developed anything for vanilla teeworlds
22:53 <@deen> so i have no idea which parts came from TW and which from DDRace
22:53 < dhkmt> w/e the ddrace source is based on vanilla (i believe)
22:54 < dhkmt> but thank you :)
22:54 <@deen> if that doesn't exist in vanilla, but you really need it, you could copy the code from ddnet
22:54 <@deen> it's pretty simple: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/collision.cpp#L853-L861
