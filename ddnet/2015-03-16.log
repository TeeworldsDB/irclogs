00:57 < Learath2> Got to some conclusions today
00:57 < Learath2> 1) Windows is a stupid OS
00:57 < Learath2> 2) I will switch to using a helper process to replace the executable
00:57 < Learath2> 3) Windows is inconsistent
00:57 < Learath2> 4) Some executables have magical properties
00:57 < fstd> news at 11
00:58 < Learath2> nite
00:58 < fstd> night :)
00:59 < Learath2> Srsly tho before even a single instruction is executed one executable somehow takes a handle to itself and others dont 
00:59 < Learath2> its just stupid
00:59 < Learath2> anyways nit 
14:18 < Shay> Hello!
14:18 < Shay> If anyone is here to help me, please answer =x
14:22  * Shay slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
14:22 < Shay> @deen, I need your help!
14:24 <@deen> hi
14:24 <@deen> Shay: what's up?
14:25 < Shay> English or German?
14:25 < Shay> or Russia?
14:25 <@deen> english channel, so english
14:25 < Shay> Ah ok
14:26 < Shay> You send some broadcasts to all your servers. How you do that without the rcon console? I mean if you're using an external program for that, please help me. I host some Servers myself and I want to make that too, if I have some new
14:26 < Shay> news*
14:26 <@deen> fifo console
14:27 <@deen> and then a big 'echo broadcast foo > servers/*.fifo
14:27 <@deen> but only ddnet server has fifo console
14:29 < Shay> okay..
14:30 < Shay> Also I can't send an echo broadcasts to all servers?
14:30 <@deen> huh?
14:32 < Shay> also
14:33 < Shay> I want to send a big broadcast to ALL servers at the same time. But without to be online in teeworlds: Also I need an external program for that. 
14:33 <@deen> as i said, i just use echo
14:33 < Shay> yea
14:33 < Shay> how can I use echo? :D
14:34 <@deen> command line
14:34 <@deen> you're on linux?
14:34 < Shay> Windows serv
14:34 <@deen> then it's impossible
14:34 <@deen> sorry
14:34 < Shay> meno
14:34 < Shay> ok 
14:34 <@deen> i only wrote it for linux
14:34 <@deen> i have no idea about windows stuff
14:34 < Shay> I heard, xRothx will give up his root?
14:35 <@deen> no idea
14:35 < Shay> Wait
14:35 < Shay> Zitat:
14:35 < Shay> What server? [12.03.2015 15:33:57] xRoThx : Host it on windows.. [12.03.2015 15:34:02] DawnDN: DON'T FUNCTION [12.03.2015 15:34:10] DawnDN: it only exists a Linux version [12.03.2015 15:34:13] xRoThx : Run a virtual machine on it ;) [12.03.2015 15:34:18] DawnDN: AND I DON'T HAVE FUCKING LINUX [12.03.2015 15:34:30] xRoThx : Run a virtual machine on it ;) [12.03.2015 15:34:35] DawnDN: lol dude [12.03.2015 15:34:35] xRoThx : virtua Linux machine ;) 
14:36 < Shay> and than
14:36 < Shay> I don't have anything anymore  [12.03.2015 15:35:44] DawnDN: why? [12.03.2015 15:36:12] xRoThx : I will reinstall it soon
14:36 < Shay> he reinstall his root 'caus he can't pay it anymore <3
14:37 <@deen> ok
14:37 < Shay> also you need a new German hoster? :D
14:39 <@deen> i don't know
14:39 <@deen> i expect xrothx will tell me if that's the case
14:39 < Shay> okay ^^
14:39 < Shay> but when the time is coming
14:39 < Shay> and he delete his root and the 4 servers
14:40 < Shay> you can ask me
14:40 < Shay> I can host them if you want
14:42 <@deen> thanks, that's great
14:42 <@deen> but they're pretty expensive
14:43 < Shay> how do you mean that?
15:01 < Learath2> deen: you around ?
15:15 <@deen> Learath2: hi
15:15 <@deen> Shay: GER servers are pretty expensive per month
15:16 <@deen> I'm actually going afk now =/
15:16 < Learath2> well ping me when you are around
15:21 < Shay> deen I have a root :D
15:32 <@deen> Shay: with 100 GBit/s ddos protection?
15:33 <@deen> Learath2: yes?
15:33 < Learath2> the self replacting executable just refuses to work with windows xp
15:34 < Learath2> so i think we will be going back to some kind of helper process for windows
15:34 <@deen> ok
15:34 <@deen> so just a batch file again
15:34 < Learath2> for windows 
15:34 <@deen> yeah
15:35 < fstd> but does it work on OS/2?
15:35 < Learath2> one more thing fstd how do we update dlls tho 
15:36 < fstd> same way, from within the helper process?
15:36 < Learath2> Windows unloads dlls after the process terminates 
15:36 < fstd> well that's what you want, isn't it?
15:36 < Learath2> not immediately tho
15:37  * fstd doesn't understand
15:38 < Learath2> helper process waits for process to quit 
15:38 < Learath2> process quits we start replacing 
15:38 < Learath2> dlls arent released by windows left
15:38 < Learath2> s/left/yet
15:39 < fstd> hm that sounds beyond broken
15:41 < fstd> maybe you can force the issue
15:42 < fstd> by calling WIN32PlsNowDoReleaseTheDllsExExEx() or so
15:43 < Shay> deen same protection like the royal servers from xrothx atm <3
15:43 < Learath2> Btw after my research i was not able to find a single other executable that takes a handle to itself automatically fstd
15:43 < Learath2> only ddnet
15:44 < fstd> you need a ktrace equivalent which actually works, i think
15:44 < fstd> something which dumps all system calls
15:45 < fstd> without being retarded about it or using up all memory
15:45 < fstd> other than that, i think it's pretty futile to guess what's happening
15:51 < fstd> lol TFW coworker has a massive black eye and sez he "fell"
15:51 < fstd> oh, wrong chan, too
15:51 < Shay> :D
16:04 < o_be_one> hi all
16:47 < Shay> Hello =3
16:54 < Learath2> fstd: i will go thru the commits going back one by one and finding which one introduces the handle
16:54 < Learath2> but thats for another day today ill make the helper process
17:00 < fstd> no need to do that one by one, Learath2
17:00 < fstd> you can bisect it
17:03 < fstd> (which invariably results in finding out that the offending change has been introduced in a huge massive merge- or refactor commit)
17:03 < fstd> ;)
17:14 < Learath2> fstd: bisect ?
17:14 < Learath2> havent used that yet
17:30 <@heinrich5991> fstd: copied refactor to trunk
17:39 < fstd> heinrich5991: heh, oh yeah
17:40 < fstd> Learath2: well it's divide and conquer basically
17:40 < fstd> if you have N commits between a known good and a known bad revision, then you can find the bad commit in log(N) steps
17:40 < fstd> log2(N)
18:25 < eeeee> yeah if windows doesn't unlock .dll immediately you just have to wait
18:25 < eeeee> oh, also
18:26 < eeeee> you can do autoupdate the chrome way
18:27 < eeeee> namely storing different versions of .exe and .dll at the same time, in different dirs somewhat hidden from the user
18:28 < eeeee> and the ddnet.exe exposed to the user would merely find the latest version and exec it
18:43 < Nimda> The Trip by Hindu just released on Moderate at 2015-03-16 18:39
18:43 < fstd> y u ship shared libs in the first place, isn't that kidn of missing the point?
18:47 < fstd> i had to pull them out and fiddle with the bam files in order to convince ddnet to build, which then went fine linking against my system's versions of libopus and that other thing (forgot what it was)
18:48 < eeeee> huh
18:49 < eeeee> but for windows thats the only option
18:50 < eeeee> or ur suggesting we static link the shit out of everything?
18:50 < fstd> well i see how it needs to be like that for release tar^Wzipballs targetting windows
18:50 < fstd> dll hell or so they call it
18:51 < fstd> but there are precompiled versions of libopus for windows, linux, mac os in the repo, even
18:51 < eeeee> also for curl and sdl
18:52 < eeeee> however they probably break apis every so often
18:52 < eeeee> so someone would have to whitelist certain versions or sth
18:52 < fstd> bam has all the mechanism needed to link with (or error out) an appropriate version of something requested
18:53 < fstd> i mean it kind of works for vanilla and their sdl/freetype dependencies
18:54 < eeeee> works on lunix 
18:54 < fstd> yeah because there's a precompiled lunix version in the repo, that's my point
18:54 < fstd> or am i missing something here?
18:55 < eeeee> no i'm not arguing we should ship shared libs on linux
18:55 < eeeee> i don't really care much about linux, i think most linux users can figure out how to run ddnet no matter what kind of crap we ship them
18:56 < fstd> well i'm not too sure about that
18:56 < fstd> because many of those 'linux users' are actually windows users who rented themselves a VPS for running server teeworlds
18:57 < eeeee> server teeworlds doesn't use sdl/freetype/curl/opus tho
18:57 < fstd> hm, fair point
18:58 < fstd> still it would be cool if there was an option to link with the system provided libs, if present
18:59 < fstd> it's kinda sad to see yet another project breaking BSD compatibility for virtually no reason
18:59 < fstd> at least the out-of-box experience, sure it can be fixed by hand
20:44 < Learath2> ive encountered many linux users for whom i wondered how they even managed to finish the installation
20:50 < asdf__> he
