18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> What do think about issue_template for github ?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 do you have some python skillz?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guis?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is master2 ddnet?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its broken for me lul
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only got my ranking back when i blocked master2
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ReiTW | Blizzard I don't sure it much but I know my way around
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Savander dunno, not sure if they're beneficial
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon what do you mean, ranking?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> they are, especialy with open source projects
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> register
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in master
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i called it ranking xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i dont block maqster it wont register
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it always fails and reconnects to master2
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> heh?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> "if i dont block maqster it wont register"?.?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i cant register inmasterserver
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like master2 is broken
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only if i block master2
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes and i was toled master2 is ddnet
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if that also happens for other people
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but what do you  mean with block @ChillerDragon

20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i diseabled it  in hosts
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> did anyone saw the news for wifi?

21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yup
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> rip MITM for now ❤
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Jupstar ✪  i got my pc running now. the article you send was right, i gave the computer to some specialist and he updated the bios. what a fucking stupid shit. -40€
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao is there anything that an automated script might help map testing with?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just read that embedded standard images are a problem, maybe we could autodetect those?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and then?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I can easily detect them myself, that's not the issue
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, I was thinking there might be a small check list that a script could cover, nagging mappers to fix the map
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, I was thinking there might be a small check list that a script could cover, helping mappers to fix the map
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh that oyu mean
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> missunderstood
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye that is good
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well they are already detected by the client, mappers just don't realize what the detection means I guess
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or they are too lazy to check
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, even the client knows it
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe you could make the client automatically embed images, so that it's not possible to select between external or standard images
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or is there any use for not embedding external images?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, just generality of the editor, I guess
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao what do you mean by "it is detected by the client"?
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you see it in the editor?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think they are colored differently
