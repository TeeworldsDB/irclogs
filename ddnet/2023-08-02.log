00:01 < bridge_> <reitw> @essigautomat can you show your netplan config file?
00:01 < bridge_> <Assa> mangle table looks clean like baby skin
00:01 < bridge_> <reitw> if you didn't touch any of those, they'll be empty
00:02 < bridge_> <reitw> also when you fix your bug restart docker as it adds iptables rules
00:02 < bridge_> <Assa> system uses the NetworkManager
00:03 < bridge_> <reitw> lol do you have a gui
00:03 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, the server has a usecase for it
00:08 < bridge_> <reitw> dynamic means it obtained an IP through dhcp, noprefixroute afaik is for ipv6 but ipv6 sux
00:15 < bridge_> <reitw> nvm dunno for what it is
00:15 < bridge_> <Assa> It just randomly started working again

07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > CPU heat output is limited by the resistance of the semiconductors.
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Technically true but not applicable... Super conducting CPUs already exist (at below room temp), and they don't use semiconductors. They don't have an exact transistor equivalent but use digital logic circuits such as Quantum Flux Parametron (QFP) and rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ), which are comprised of Josephson Junctions [0] which are made from the same super conducting material. Relying on quantum effects of a gap between two conductors rat
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> So while it is true that CMOS are limited by the resistance of both the conductor interconnects AND the semiconductors. Super conducting circuits only appear to need a conductor... There are other drawbacks, such as larger feature sizes due to the nature of super conducting materials, and QFP and RSFQ might be more complex? but this is potentially offset by huge advantages: zero resistance buys not only power efficiency and minimum heat generation

09:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Claimed. Nothing is for sure yet 😉
09:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And superconductivity is yet another topic
09:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But if it happens. Epic non gamer moment
09:51 < bridge_> <screeeny> yes true the two claims only talk about some properties of it.

13:59 < bridge_> <999__om> hello any one knows how to host a non-official server on rdp?
14:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's rdp? remote desktop protocol?
14:01 < bridge_> <999__om> an microsoft azure rdp

14:01 < bridge_> <999__om> that one
14:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u dont need winrar
14:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on modern windows
14:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw
14:02 < bridge_> <999__om> any idea?
14:10 < bridge_> <botondpont> https://tenor.com/view/arch-btw-arch-linux-i-use-arch-btw-spongebob-gif-26193715
14:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can start the ddnet server by double-clicking the ddnet-server.exe after unpacking
14:21 < bridge_> <999__om> ik but i wanna make it online
14:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> change `sv_register 0` to `sv_register 1` in data/autoexec_server.cfg`

14:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Real or not real, I find their way to communicate their discovery really weird
14:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it was leaked initially i think
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but this is definitly smth
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and its fun to watch
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how it develops
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ppl compare it to the transistor invention xd
14:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If it's true it's much more imo
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> either way we got nothing to lose
14:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so i grab my popcorn while reading hn

15:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @reitw unproductive
15:30 < ChillerDragon> any crypto maximalists here? im thinking about giving a local wallet a shot again any recommendations?
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why u want crypto
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i always try to give it a thought, but the "money" itself is not that useful if u cant spend it on useful things
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and idk im too busy to trade
15:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what kind of cryptocurrency would you want to buy?

15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no mention of blender
15:37 < bridge_> <Iza> I'm not into crypto but I have a question, where can I download your teeworlds client?
15:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: ^
15:51 < bridge_> <Assa> Does anybody of you have expertise in apache2 proxy configurations? I want to pass the traffic from my webserver to another webserver with the right path e.g. /adguard. I tried:
15:51 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
15:51 < bridge_> <Assa> ProxyPass /adguard http://127.0.0.1:8080/
15:51 < bridge_> <Assa> ProxyPassReverse /adguard http://127.0.0.1:8080/       
15:51 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
15:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you want to pass /adguard paths to 127.0.0.1:8080?
15:52 < bridge_> <DDNet> 127.0.0.1:8080 is not a DDNet or KoG server.
15:52 < bridge_> <Assa> yes
15:52 < bridge_> <Assa> xD the bot, localhost is not a ddnet server
15:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> i.e. https://youserver.tld/adguard/abc to http://127.0.0.1:8080/abc ?
15:52 < bridge_> <DDNet> 127.0.0.1:8080 is not a DDNet or KoG server.
15:53 < bridge_> <Assa> no, more https://myserver.to/path to http://127.0.0.1:8080 (so root dir)
15:53 < bridge_> <DDNet> 127.0.0.1:8080 is not a DDNet or KoG server.
15:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but https://myserver.to/path/abc should not be forwarded?
15:55 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, I just want to redirect without needing to open port 8080
15:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you only want to forward one path, not any subpaths. ok
15:59 < bridge_> <Assa> lol I asked chatgpt and  just said I should do this:
15:59 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
15:59 < bridge_> <Assa> RewriteEngine On
15:59 < bridge_> <Assa> RewriteRule ^/adguard/(.*)$ http://localhost:8080/$1 [P]
15:59 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
16:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm, not sure if that works
16:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but it also doesn't adhere to your specification
16:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it also does sub-paths
16:00 < bridge_> <reitw> RewriteRule is probably the best way to go
16:01 < bridge_> <reitw> but then /adguard won't be proxied to your server
16:01 < bridge_> <reitw> maybe 
16:01 < bridge_> <reitw> ```
16:01 < bridge_> <reitw> RewriteEngine On
16:01 < bridge_> <reitw> RewriteRule ^/adguard(.*) http://localhost:8080/$1 [P]
16:01 < bridge_> <reitw> ```
16:05 < bridge_> <reitw> but then maybe /adguard won't be proxied to your server
16:06 < bridge_> <Assa> both are not working
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> have u tried nginx?
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its been ages since i used apache
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:12 < bridge_> <Assa> okay, the second server on 8080 seems to redirect me to /login, which redirects me to the login page of the first server
16:12 < bridge_> <Assa> interesting issue oO
16:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you should use curl to debug these issues
16:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if the server behind hte proxy doesn't know it's behind the proxy, it'll generate wrong redirects
16:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't know if apache can fix those up
16:14 < bridge_> <Assa> thanks, you are right and I know now where the issue is
16:18 < bridge_> <Assa> time to break everything again 🤪
16:18 < bridge_> <stnwtr> traefik is a pretty neat proxy
16:19 < bridge_> <stnwtr> sorry i didnt follow this chat
16:21 < bridge_> <Assa> I guess at this point I am just posting debugging puzzles, as a programmer you are just solving puzzles all day 🤔
16:21 < bridge_> <reitw> from what I've heard nginx & apache works the best when used together
16:22 < bridge_> <Assa> idk what a super reaction is and why it did it
16:22 < bridge_> <reitw> lmao
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what? no
16:23 < bridge_> <reitw> traefik is very good, there's also caddy
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just forget apache exists
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have  to try caddy but seems nice
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the most effortless probs
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and this https://varnish-cache.org/
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as a server side http cache
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> caching HTTP reverse proxy
16:26 < bridge_> <reitw> yes, that's what alot of people will say, even if yes nginx performs way better than apache2, apache2 still has some benefits & you can use both together
16:26 < bridge_> <reitw> like nginx as a reverse proxy & apache2 behind
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nah
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i am against that opinion
16:28 < bridge_> <Assa> okay now I found the problem from yesterday:
16:28 < bridge_> <Assa> When I switch the DNS server in the router to server, the server host itself loses internet connection???
16:29 < bridge_> <reitw> lol wtf
16:30 < bridge_> <Assa> all other machines have no issues, and even use the dns server sucessfully
16:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you might want to pcap that 😄
16:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> to understand it better
16:38 < bridge_> <stnwtr> yeah well i like traefik pretty much because its finally working xD
16:38 < bridge_> <stnwtr> also i like the automatic tls stuff and its just so powerfull with middlewares
16:38 < bridge_> <stnwtr> yeah well i like traefik pretty much because its finally working xD
16:38 < bridge_> <stnwtr> also i like the automatic tls stuff and its just powerfull with middlewares
16:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> caddy also has automatic tls
16:38 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki @heinrich5991 i would like to hold btc as an investment and spend watever hister coin the local stores accept
16:40 < bridge_> <stnwtr> yeah sure, most modern rev proxies does
16:40 < bridge_> <stnwtr> just looked at caddy ... it seems to be so easy :o
16:40 < ChillerDragon> @Iza chillerbot-ux i assume? binaries can be found here https://chillerbot.github.io but i recommend compiling from source if you want the latest version i do not release that often since i run from source personally
16:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I wouldn't try to hold bitcoin as an investment. nothing more than play money, anyways
16:41 < ChillerDragon> why?
16:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> xd
16:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it seems super volatile. traditional investments seem better
16:42 < ChillerDragon> like?
16:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> etfs
16:42 < ChillerDragon> hrmpf
16:42 < ChillerDragon> i currently have 4 times more money in btc than in etfs xd
16:43 < bridge_> <Assa> when I use nslookup, it uses the local dns. If I switch the configuration in my router, the dns server is unreachable?!
16:43 < ChillerDragon> i like the idea of having money with a fixed supply
16:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think I read somewhere that bitcoin's fixed supply might be unsustainable
16:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because transaction fees do not seem to give the same rewards as the block rewards
16:45 < ChillerDragon> in can be split in small chunks but yeah its not a lot
16:45 < ChillerDragon> it*
16:45 < ChillerDragon> btc in its current form can not work as money anyways
16:46 < ChillerDragon> but its cool to have "open source" money instead of spy ass banks imo
16:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> with bitcoin you probably have even less privacy
16:47 < ChillerDragon> yes
16:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but open-source non-privacy? :p
16:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> when did you put the money into bitcoin
16:47 < ChillerDragon> same as i prefer having all my online chats logged to github and ddnet.org
16:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> monero is a cryptocurrency with privacy AFAIUI
16:48 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 difference is everyone can see the data
16:49 < ChillerDragon> i rather have stuff public than leaking it only to companies
16:49 < bridge_> <Iza> ChillerDragon: do you have any other clients?
16:49 < ChillerDragon> @Ewan idk over the years
16:49 < ChillerDragon> @Iza yes what do you need?
16:50 < bridge_> <Iza> is there any client that specifically is based on the 16.2.2 version of ddnet?
16:50 < ChillerDragon> for gaming?
16:50 < bridge_> <Iza> or any version of it
16:50 < ChillerDragon> thatd be chillerbot-ux
16:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> sounds maybe like cope
16:51 < bridge_> <Iza> what are this clients features and use-cases? if you dont mind me asking
16:51 < ChillerDragon> i do mind actually
16:51 < ChillerDragon> but i can answer anyways
16:52 < ChillerDragon> i put in basically all the stuff which i personally need, can code and think wont be merged in ddnet
16:52 < ChillerDragon> such as typing font mapres in the editor
16:52 < ChillerDragon> a password manager
16:52 < ChillerDragon> auto reply in chat
16:52 < ChillerDragon> spike tracer
16:52 < ChillerDragon> show last killer in block
16:52 < ChillerDragon> auto drop money on fokkos server
16:53 < bridge_> <Iza> is the client known to the people? or how is it promoted?
16:53 < ChillerDragon> i basically have one bind for small talk that saved me 1 grey hair already
16:53 < ChillerDragon> i do not promote 0.6 software no
16:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
16:54 < bridge_> <Iza> so no one would randomly stumble upon this client?
16:54 < ChillerDragon> me spamming the chat gave it some attention
16:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Just say that someone uses it and bots xd
16:54 < ChillerDragon> it having bot in the name is also good marketing for 12yo wannabe haxors
16:55 < ChillerDragon> oh yea i think the block warlist thingy is somewhat known in some block cricles
16:55 < ChillerDragon> you can mark enemys red and friends green using chat commands that end up in public chat
16:55 < bridge_> <Iza> so do you think there are quite some people that use this client?
16:55 < ChillerDragon> because i wanted to make the code non intrusive i couldnt swallow the message :D 
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Iza there is always a chance u talk to the real ChillerDragon in-game
16:56 < ChillerDragon> it ships with spyware and usertracking
16:56 < ChillerDragon> people that have spyware on are usually when i check around 1 or 2 people online
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It leaks your bank account
16:56 < ChillerDragon> https://chillerbot.zillyhuhn.com/api/v1/users
16:56 < ChillerDragon> here all people using it
16:56 < ChillerDragon> and having spyware option on
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
16:57 < ChillerDragon> that be 5 ppl and me, myself and I
16:57 < bridge_> <Iza> "âœŸâ‚³Î·Å§yâœž" is this really a players name? xD
16:57 < ChillerDragon> utf8 moment
16:57 < ChillerDragon> i didnt put fake data there for marketing
16:57 < ChillerDragon> its real spy trackers showing live data
16:58 < ChillerDragon> i built that because someone wanted to have his playtime tracked but i never finished that feature
16:58 < bridge_> <Iza> I just wanted to know how well spread this client is, thanks for the answers
16:58 < ChillerDragon> so for now its just unjustified data collection
16:58 < ChillerDragon> hello gdpr officiers reading irc logs
16:58 < ChillerDragon> for bot tracking?
16:58 < ChillerDragon> btw the client also sends a message to the server
16:59 < ChillerDragon> identifying it self
16:59 < bridge_> <Iza> what would that message be?
16:59 < ChillerDragon> its not a chat message
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```py
16:59 < ChillerDragon> the server has to listen for it
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> >>> ftfy.ftfy("âœŸâ‚³Î·Å§yâœž")
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> '✟₳ηŧy✞'
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> btw
16:59 < ChillerDragon> looks twish
16:59 < ChillerDragon> heinrichhaxor
17:00 < ChillerDragon> i think i made a ddnet pr once leaking chillerbot in status comamnd
17:00 < ChillerDragon> got declined
17:00 < ChillerDragon> AH thats why you asked about the version
17:00 < ChillerDragon> you wanted to track chillerbot based on version num
17:01 < bridge_> <Iza> does it listen for it? idk how the ddnet servers are setup
17:01 < ChillerDragon> nah
17:01 < ChillerDragon> sadly not
17:01 < ChillerDragon> so moderators can not see it
17:01 < bridge_> <Iza> thats unfortunate
17:01 < ChillerDragon> yes i wanted to market chillerbot to ddnet staff
17:01 < ChillerDragon> checking status
17:01 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:01 < ChillerDragon> why do you even care?
17:02 < ChillerDragon> @Iza
17:02 < bridge_> <Iza> im not sure if i should publicly say what im looking for
17:02 < ChillerDragon> sus
17:03 < ChillerDragon> classic ddnet moderator moment
17:03 < ChillerDragon> come join climb server
17:03 < ChillerDragon> and whisper me
17:03 < bridge_> <Iza> what's that?
17:03 < ChillerDragon> ddnet map type
17:03 < ChillerDragon> ddnet://176.9.114.238:8302
17:04 < ChillerDragon> i am gaming there rn

17:04 < ChillerDragon> this pr would have shown all the hax and chillerbot in status command
17:05 < ChillerDragon> but heinrich said it bad
17:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Bloat
17:06 < ChillerDragon> @Iza since you have a valid use case now maybe you can convince heinrich
17:07 < ChillerDragon> eventho i can already envision heinrichs arguments against it haha
17:07 < bridge_> <Iza> what are his arguments?
17:07 < ChillerDragon> fak now u left
17:07 < ChillerDragon> the one he will make
17:07 < ChillerDragon> is not good in public chat xd
17:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> where's the source code for https://chillerbot.zillyhuhn.com/api/v1/users ?
17:13 < ChillerDragon> pls no hax me
17:13 < ChillerDragon> sec
17:14 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/api-server
17:14 < bridge_> <Iza> from what i heard, he has a valid concern too
17:14 < ChillerDragon> who is "he" ?
17:14 < bridge_> <Iza> heinrich
17:15 < ChillerDragon> about adding it to status?
17:15 < bridge_> <Iza> if it goes wrong, it will just make things more complicated than it already is
17:15 < bridge_> <Iza> no the server check
17:15 < bridge_> <Iza> for your client
17:15 < bridge_> <Iza> or yes status
17:15 < ChillerDragon> ye
17:15 < ChillerDragon> heinrich is a miesmuschel
17:16 < bridge_> <Iza> btw can you figure out what your latest client is?
17:16 < bridge_> <Iza> maybe i can do what you told me to
17:16 < ChillerDragon> im scared @heinrich5991 why did you ask for src? 
17:16 < ChillerDragon> doubt
17:16 < ChillerDragon> but lemme check
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: cause I was curious
17:17 < ChillerDragon> a
17:17 < ChillerDragon> oke
17:18 < ChillerDragon> its basically a heartbeat
17:18 < ChillerDragon> chillerbot-ux do some http request and then the server counts them as online as long as they do not timeout
17:18 < ChillerDragon> not too elegant i guess but whatever chillersoftware moment
17:19 < ChillerDragon> @Iza u still on?
17:19 < ChillerDragon> go some ddnet server
17:31 < bridge_> <Assa> okay it get's even crazier: the adguard is working, even if it's not configured in the router for all machines
17:31 < bridge_> <byfox> is it possible to get the timestamp for the points command via api at once
17:31 < bridge_> <byfox> or will it be necessary to translate from datetime to timestamp?
17:31 < bridge_> <byfox> url: https://ddnet.org/players/?json2=ByFox
17:31 < bridge_> <Assa> so I can go on cnn.com and don't get ads (with adblock disabled)
17:32 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> are you using dns blocking? or is it installed locally on a few devices only?
17:33 < bridge_> <Assa> it's installed on one device and working for all in the network (which is weird, how?)
17:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> veerryy unlikely, but network caching? 😄
17:35 < bridge_> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> The API doesn't have any options, you'll have to convert the data yourself :)
17:35 < bridge_> <Assa> tested on 2 other machines, maybe the router DNS is upstreaming to it?
17:35 < bridge_> <Assa> i am lost
17:35 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i know that ad blocking through DNS is a common thing, maybe it was setup somehow somewhere
17:36 < bridge_> <byfox> my 1 core on the server is poor.
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Give it some money
17:38 < bridge_> <Assa> Ah, services like this are broadcasting itself as a DNS service and the router picks it up, it even may like it more then other DNS servers, because it has a DNS rebind protection
17:41 < bridge_> <Assa> so yesterday i played DNS ping pong because they were both seing each other as upstream dns, isn't networking fun? ...
17:42 < ChillerDragon> dadi jopsti can i has your credit card?
17:43 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> absolutely not
17:43 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 😄
17:43 < ChillerDragon> or @heinrich5991 you got some sussy credit card generator i can use to sign up a oracle account?
17:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I don't has credit card ChillerDragon.. I dislike their insecureness xd
17:43 < ChillerDragon> they offer 4core 6gb ram vps for free if you give them your credit card :D 
17:44 < ChillerDragon> wot u have jopsti
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds very trustworthy
17:44 < bridge_> <reitw> Yeah
17:44 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> we all smartheads, lets go hack the ICBC
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon no xd
17:44 < ChillerDragon> i mean they all do it
17:44 < ChillerDragon> all these web scale cloud services
17:44 < ChillerDragon> offer free tier shit
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Why do u think I have one
17:44 < bridge_> <reitw> Bruh discord fucked up amoled mode on phone app
17:45 < ChillerDragon> they lure you in and then they charge the shit out of you if you want more
17:45 < bridge_> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> I don't think converting the dates would be that intensive, no? Also aren't the dates already timestamps?
17:45 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪  "wot u have" means what do you have if not a credit card?
17:46 < bridge_> <reitw> @chillerdragon most of them does that, to avoid people to just recreate new accounts
17:46 < bridge_> <reitw> @chillerdragon most of them does that, to avoid people who just recreate new accounts
17:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I have PayPal and bank
17:46 < bridge_> <byfox> it's gonna be time-consuming for at least a second or so.
17:46 < bridge_> <byfox> Ps: python
17:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And cash
17:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
17:46 < ChillerDragon> @reitw yea makes sense and also lowers their effort to start paying xd
17:46 < ChillerDragon> doesnt a bank give you cards anyways?
17:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I have a electronic card yes
17:47 < ChillerDragon> honestly i dont even know what kind of cards i have
17:47 < ChillerDragon> i only have bank for pay check
17:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's not really a credit card to
17:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Tho
17:47 < ChillerDragon> and use the card to print cash from machine
17:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I rarely buy stuff anyway xd
17:48 < ChillerDragon> ok mr frugalism
17:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I can rephrase
17:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I only buy stuff I need. And that's not a lot
17:49 < ChillerDragon> ok mr minimalism
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Indeed
17:49 < ChillerDragon> i bought a windows license in a store once
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I never directly bought windows in my life xd
17:50 < ChillerDragon> tru minimalist
17:50 < ChillerDragon> i pay monthly fee for gnome pro
17:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I believe you here
17:51 < ChillerDragon> omagawd i want free vps
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Why
17:52 < ChillerDragon> because vps nice
17:52 < ChillerDragon> and my money rare
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I bet it's shitty anyway
17:52 < ChillerDragon> maybe
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Also your money defs not rare lmao
17:53 < ChillerDragon> i flexed too much with my 4090 here
17:53 < ChillerDragon> it was all my life savings i yeeted into that
17:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah yeah sure xD
17:54 < ChillerDragon> sometimes i catch my self going to starbucks for no reason and thinking i could finance a whole month of vps and make a toast and cup of coffee at home xd
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon we have everything in our community. Dentists, scientists, drug dealers, doctors.. ofc we also need millionaires xd
17:55 < ChillerDragon> cool idea
17:55 < ChillerDragon> but doubt
17:55 < ChillerDragon> i seen plenty gangsters claiming to be millionaires maybe some even are
17:55 < ChillerDragon> ok drug dealers sure
17:55 < ChillerDragon> if selling weed in school counts
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nah we have real ones xd
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Trust me bro
17:56 < ChillerDragon> scientists is probably also a broad term does studying count? xd
17:56 < ChillerDragon> dentists i doubt
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I know both
17:56 < ChillerDragon> leak
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> We even have one working at CERN xd
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nah no leaks from me
17:57 < ChillerDragon> you think one of those millionairs wants to donate me a starbucks voucher and a vps?
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Troll
17:57 < ChillerDragon> i can trade
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> With yourself
17:58 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1690991920.png
17:58 < ChillerDragon> i can offer lets climb rank
17:58 < ChillerDragon> wait do you seriously think im a millionair? 
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Epic. There was a20$ tournament for that once
17:59 < ChillerDragon> xd?
17:59 < ChillerDragon> rly
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you'd have won it
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U could have bought vps
17:59 < ChillerDragon> what a coincidence
17:59 < ChillerDragon> indeed
17:59 < ChillerDragon> you think 5 hours was the winning time?
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon yeah I think the chance is around 95%
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or you from a rich family
18:00 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:00 < ChillerDragon> i wish
18:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Your wish is granted
18:00 < ChillerDragon> pog
18:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon is chill [TD] one of your alter egos or just fan
18:11 < ChillerDragon> im his fan
18:11 < ChillerDragon> i think he is more OG than me
18:12 < ChillerDragon> would be troll if i submit a map called "Chill Let's Clim 4"
18:12 < ChillerDragon> is that legal?
18:12 < ChillerDragon> didnt konsti do something like that
18:13 < ChillerDragon> omg ofc i did typo in the map name ffs
18:13 < ChillerDragon> irc needs edits
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Why not xd
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The 4 is maybe weird. But there are maps with inconsistent indexing xd
18:18 < ChillerDragon> there is 1, 2 and 3 already so why is 4 weird xd
18:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs it's not a map of that series xd
18:18 < ChillerDragon> Stronghold 8 - by ChillerDragon
18:18 < ChillerDragon> thats the joke
18:18 < ChillerDragon> and i think konsti did that with some oldschool map even faking the mapper xd
18:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Strongbold
18:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd konsti mastered troll. They didn't even notice probably
18:39 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> chiller lets climb
18:42 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 random follow up bitcoin it self is not functional as a global money system and not private but the lightning network seems to address both problems i procrastinated looking into it for like 5 years but it seems pretty pog
18:42 < ChillerDragon> just bundling up the transactions to reduce traffic on the main chain
18:42 < ChillerDragon> which makes the underlying coin still valuable
18:43 < ChillerDragon> very valuable if you gamble on it becoming a thing
18:43 < ChillerDragon> when people realize inflaction and bad states are annoying
18:43 < ChillerDragon> i prefer my investments to be gambles than boring etfs
18:44 < ChillerDragon> im stll young and do not have much money to lose so im hoping to gamble some coins and then switch to safer investments once i have capital
18:45 < ChillerDragon> having crypto as legit alternative to banking would be super cool wouldnt it
18:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Value of real money and banks are backed by the armies of the capitalist nations. How could you achieve similar safety with bitcoin?
18:49 < ChillerDragon> you talk about safety or value now?
18:50 < ChillerDragon> i mean its backed by the distributed immutable blockchain and technology?
18:51 < ChillerDragon> in my brain btc is already way more valuable than dollar or euro
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 🥹 git revert 5d4a7ab
19:01 < ChillerDragon> why
19:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/commit/5d4a7ab8d9fd7742a0c396b65331b18da9892d0e
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> f
19:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> f
19:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> if ravie startd complaining about what skins should or should be in the database im going to simply reinvite him to the crew
19:08 < bridge_> <Voxel> if he says no then im sending cope seethe
19:08 < bridge_> <learath2> Safety of the value. Moneys purpose is to be a store of value that is relatively stable so you can store it until you need to trade it for actual goods
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Don't we have community skins for that anyway
19:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> exactly, hes gonna go "why is this in the NORMAL database"
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Can you give an example?
19:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1136345781100630151/image.png

19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That's old news. I doubt he's mad bcs of that
19:16 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 i dont see increase of value as a risk and after a few more bull runs it will probably stop falling much as well
19:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> > Upload timed out. Also only do one upload at a time
19:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> 
19:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> Wait, so I have to only do one skin at a time?
19:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> > Upload timed out. Also only do one upload at a time
19:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> 
19:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> Wait, so I have to do only one skin at a time?
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Just do slash upload and the msg explains
19:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U have to be active at least once per 2 minutes
19:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe I can increase that some day
19:35 < bridge_> <murpi> wdym "mad" :thonk:
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What do you mean what do I mean?
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I meant bcs of voxels normal uploads
19:50 < bridge_> <devinci24> Sadly euro and a lot of "real coins" aren't even that stable anymore.
19:50 < bridge_> <devinci24> We should go back to gold.
19:51 < bridge_> <murpi> He doesn't seem angry in those screenshots
19:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Euro and USD atleast have massive armies behind them that would bomb many cities to rubble before their currency becomes worthless
19:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I mean voxel assumed it might have been related to that
19:54 < bridge_> <Voxel> i feel like ravie quit because he was doing everything
19:54 < bridge_> <Voxel> and if he starts complaining about my job then he just has to deal with it
20:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ravie_ravie give us hint why rq. We nothing without u
20:03 < ChillerDragon> do mapvotes instantly pass if there are only two people?
20:03 < ChillerDragon> im a bit confused i cant see what happend in the demo but it just ended
20:04 < bridge_> <Iza> no the votes always have to be over half
20:05 < ChillerDragon> ah ye maybe the vote is not showing in the demo
20:05 < ChillerDragon> somehow i dont see the chat
20:05 < ChillerDragon> @Iza but could it pass if i do not vote?
20:05 < ChillerDragon> i was afk on my 6h run
20:05 < ChillerDragon> and this guy somehow managed to vote without me having saved
20:06 < bridge_> <Iza> if the server states you as afk then you dont count in the vote counting
20:06 < ChillerDragon> i have auto save on vote but somehow it didnt trigger idk what happend
20:06 < ChillerDragon> ah omg
20:06 < bridge_> <murpi> ```py
20:06 < bridge_> <murpi> message = f'"{ticket_category.capitalize()}" Ticket created by: <@{ticket_creator.id}> (Global Name: {ticket_creator}) ' \
20:06 < bridge_> <murpi>           f'and closed by <@{interaction.user.id}> (Global Name: {interaction.user})'```
20:06 < bridge_> <murpi> AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'capitalize'
20:06 < bridge_> <murpi> 😭 ???
20:06 < ChillerDragon> and then it insta passed?
20:06 < ChillerDragon> python moment
20:06 < ChillerDragon> ruby has it
20:06 < bridge_> <Iza> if you're afk and there's another player in the srv, then yes its insta pass
20:07 < ChillerDragon> then my bot cant even auto save fast enough
20:07 < ChillerDragon> thats fucked
20:07 < ChillerDragon> time to anti afk bot
20:07 < ChillerDragon> just lost a 6h run ffs
20:08 < bridge_> <Iza> you trying to do longest time on chill lets climb?
20:08 < ChillerDragon> i was about to sack it in
20:08 < ChillerDragon> at top5
20:08 < ChillerDragon> like in 30 mins
20:09 < ChillerDragon> longest run is 20h i know during that time stuff happens those are not easy to get
20:09 < ChillerDragon> so i was aiming for 7ish
20:09 < ChillerDragon> guess im back to start and 30min climb map
20:09 < ChillerDragon> because today i learned about afk votes
20:10 < ChillerDragon> good to know
20:10 < ChillerDragon> still bad it exists
20:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> Just some real life happening, I might return if I have time and motivation and there's still place for me
20:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> hey my name matches my avatar now
23:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @ravie_ravie i pray when u come back we dont have a bad UI kek
23:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:11 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> :justatest: I'm not leaving entirely, won't get rid of me that easily, I'll be hanging around
23:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
23:14 < bridge_> <deen> I can relate to real life happening 😄

23:21 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> the exact numbers, thats what i call knowing your stuff.. i guess?
23:35 < bridge_> <chairn> damn, that's a pretty big one already 😄
23:35 < bridge_> <chairn> congrats
23:38 < bridge_> <teero777> a cactus?
23:39 < bridge_> <teero777> i can relate
23:39 < bridge_> <teero777> last time i had a problem with a cactus he ended up as soup.
23:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> xd
