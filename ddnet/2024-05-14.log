01:51 < bridge> <epicbanana20> Is there a way to get access to players stats the way DDstats and ddnet.org do?
01:51 < bridge> <epicbanana20> and ¿can i do it?
01:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The first link I sent you is the ranks database and this is where you see all currently playing players https://master2.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
01:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @epicbanana20
01:59 < bridge> <epicbanana20> Ah i think its rank
01:59 < bridge> <epicbanana20> unsure what is master server tbh
02:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> You can also access the rank data directly in the browser by the way https://db.ddstats.org/
02:03 < bridge> <epicbanana20> Oh
02:03 < bridge> <epicbanana20> i think thats way better actually
02:03 < bridge> <epicbanana20> can i link that to my code in some way?
02:04 < bridge> <epicbanana20> Im trying to make my bot print the stats like the website does
02:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Then you might want this https://ddnet.org/players/?json2=Freezestyler
02:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Is macOS Monterey 12.7.4 still supported by ddnet?

13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     In a high-level language, the programmer is deprived of the dangerous power to update his own program while it is running. Even more valuable, he has the power to split his machine into a number of separate variables, arrays, files, etc.; when he wishes to update any of these he must quote its name explicitly on the left of the assignment, so that the identity of the part of the machine subject to change is immediately apparent; and, finally,

13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Unfortunately, many of these advantages are not maintained in the design of procedures and parameters in ALGOL 60 and other languages. But instead of mending these minor faults, many language designers have preferred to extend them throughout the whole language by introducing the concept of reference, pointer, or indirect address into the language as an assignable item of data. This immediately gives rise in a high-level language to one of th

They cannot be input as data, and they cannot be output as results. If either data or references to data have to be stored on files or backing stores, the problems are immense. And on many machines they have a surprising overhead on performance, for example they will clog up instruction pipelines, data look

13:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does something distinguish your package manager? @ryozuki
13:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> Edpkg --add-repo @{GitHub url} and automatically building Said repo with any detected build Tool !
13:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> @ryozuki Go add that !:owo:
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> didnt think of any idea yet
15:05 < bridge> <zhn> is there any cons of using systemd as regular user?
15:26 < bridge> <learath2> No, similarly to how there are no cons to just using Windows as a regular user. A regular user just doesn't care about anything but convenience
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also not for me as a developer
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually, I like using systemd 🙂
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I don't like using windows
17:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> same - windows is bloated as hell, its startup is ~5times higher than linux - and you have to register everywhere to use basic features
17:07 < bridge> <teero777> what do you think of vim motions in the f1 console? xdd
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> meh. extra code
17:11 < bridge> <teero777> XDD
17:19 < bridge> <teero777> i only recently discovered through someone that alacritty supports vim motions if you press ctrl+lshit+space. my mouse wheel is kinda broken so it's a live saver xd
17:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> shift-pgup/pgdown sometimes works in terminals, too

19:50 < bridge> <learath2> Q: What is your preference in writing a quick parser? Regex or just string manipulation by hand?
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> Also I had a hilarious issue today. While debugging something I had to set a breakpoint somewhere within the json decode function in go standard library. Then I made a call within the debugger, and suddenly it told me I was trying to do "next while nexting`. I was stuck for about 20 minutes there not understanding what was going on. Turns out the debugger is also written in go and uses that exact method I had a breakpoint on when doing injected ca
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> So my injected call was ending up triggering my breakpoint while I was already breaked on there which broke the debugger for some reason 😄
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on how quick u need it xd
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd probably use regex tho
19:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on the complexity. if it's just splitting by spaces, I'd go for hand parsing
19:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give an example?
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> I don't usually use regex, so I wanted to use it just to see how it feels. So I was writing a regex today that splits variable names of mixed conventions into tokens (obv opinionated, as there is no real correct answer). Since the regex engine in go doesn't have lookahead it ended up being quite tricky. All the while I was thinking I could have iterated through the string and split it in 20 minutes but getting the regex right took me 2 hours 😄
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> That's why I wanted to ask around, see what sorts of tasks people use regex for here
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u need gpt 4 xddd
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> If I let gpt write it I wouldn't have learned so much
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's a native regex  speaker
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> And I'm quite certain it won't get it correct on the first try as this is not a common task asked on stackoverflow all the time
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often use regex and still forget everything about them everytime
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> esp. the 2 trillion regex variants that are there
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> I used to have a small postit with a cheatsheet, then I misplaced it
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> What sorts of things do you do with it?
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often replace stuff in code, recently i also wrote a parser
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah most often replace stuff
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or search stuff
20:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I usually use regexes in sed/vim
20:42 < bridge> <lukron55> how would i go about hosting a server on a headless raspberry pi?
20:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please don't cross-post your question to multiple channels
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - install ddnet from package manager or self compile
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - open ports in router
20:47 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah i did try both of them and neither worked
20:47 < bridge> <lukron55> mb i posted in questions first and figured it may have been more ideal to post in developers. will not happen again
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's sad, but these are the steps required.
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also `sv_register 1`
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or `sv_register ipv4`
20:48 < bridge> <lukron55> i tried self compiling and it had an error making it
20:49 < bridge> <harrynfr> another required command may be "sudo rm -rf' / --no-preserve-root"
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it was on latest master u could open an issue on ddnet github.
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but make sure it's an actual compile time error
20:49 < bridge> <harrynfr> another required command may be "sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root"
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything else is more likely a missing dependency
20:49 < bridge> <lukron55> i’ll try again
20:50 < bridge> <lukron55> python had an issue installing and i just had to add -is-python3
20:50 < bridge> <lukron55> i’m not sure if that had anything to do with it
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @harrynfr please don't tell people to delete their hard drives

21:12 < bridge> <harrynfr> sorry
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u didnt follow the readme properly.
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> create a build dir
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then `cmake ..`
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so .. points to the source root directory
21:16 < bridge> <nouaa> I want one (for science)
21:16 < bridge> <lukron55> huh? what readme
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> the readme
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/README.md
21:17 < bridge> <lukron55> also so i shouldn’t enter the build directory when doing cmake?
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you can
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's not necessary
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake --build build if your build dir is called build
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> or cmake --build .
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> if u cd into it first
21:17 < bridge> <lukron55> wait i’m following a tuto that extremely out of date
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> as far as doing a server only build goes u should do something like this
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake -B build -S . -DCLIENT=off
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and then ur ddnet server should be shat out into the build folder
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> run these from the ddnet root
21:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> i suck at cmake, why are you specifing --parallel ? is that -j on crack?
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> same thing
21:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> i see
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> more explicit i guess
21:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it runs unlimited jobs (according to the documentation), doesn't seem like a good idea
21:21 < bridge> <lukron55> Error: could not loads cache after running second command
21:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> rm -r Build
21:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> and then try again
21:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> rm -r Build (or whatever your build folder is called)
21:23 < bridge> <lukron55> still getting the error after removing it and adding it
21:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did the first command error already? can you post the output of the first command?
21:25 < bridge> <lukron55> completely missed the error lmdao
21:25 < bridge> <lukron55> CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:641 (message):
21:25 < bridge> <lukron55>   You must install Rust and Cargo to compile DDNet
21:25 < bridge> <harrynfr> curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
21:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> okay so for ease of understanding, please refer to the readme of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
21:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> scroll down a bit - you'll need the "dependencies on linux / macOS"
21:25 < bridge> <harrynfr> according to rust-lang.org
21:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> follow the readme instead of going to rust-lang.org
21:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like @blaiszephyr says
21:26 < bridge> <lukron55> lmfao im using an outdated wiki to install dependacies
21:26 < bridge> <lukron55> that might help
21:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> which one? i'll update :D
21:27 < bridge> <lukron55> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/LAN_Server
21:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh lol - we're not only focusing only on the apt package manager, this hasnt been updated since rust has been added :kek:
21:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps that should be removed from the wiki, and instead point to our readme
21:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> will do that
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> agree
21:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at least for the building steps. forwarding the ports etc. still makes sense
21:32 < bridge> <lukron55> thanks guys and he she it das s muss mit

21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> translation markers are important for the translation
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can't remove them for the stuff that is still there

21:38 < bridge> <lukron55> although i do need help its stuck like that]
21:39 < bridge> <lukron55> the same percentage
21:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> thats odd - did you follow all the steps from the readme and installed the neccessary packages? 
21:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
21:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're using make -j(nproc)
21:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> try just using "make"

22:27 < bridge> <harrynfr> hey @lukron55 this probably wasnt the best way to go about this but i brute forced your raspberry pi and installed it for you

22:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> imagine you have someone brute forcing a connection over ssh just to fix your build environment :kek:
22:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> imagine you have someone brute forcing your raspberry just to fix your build environment :kek:
22:30 < bridge> <lukron55> wtf

22:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> @heinrich5991 doxxed himself
22:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> @heinrich5991 - doxxed himself
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imagine talking to yourself in a public chat
22:30 < bridge> <lukron55> OMG
22:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> ty ^^
22:30 < bridge> <lukron55> I DIDNT REALISE LMFAO
22:32 < bridge> <lukron55> i forgot termius just shows it in a big green box
22:32 < bridge> <lukron55> 😭

22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> gigachad frfr
22:33 < bridge> <lukron55> that’s my friend btw
22:33 < bridge> <lukron55> i gave up and let him ssh into my pi
22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
22:38 < bridge> <harrynfr> it was quite funny though
22:49 < bridge> <lukron55> where do you get the server config file
22:58 < bridge> <lukron55> autoexec?
23:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its in your Data folder `myServerconfig.cfg`
23:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> The Changes will only Take effect If you Change it under `ddnet/Data/`
23:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> If you Change the File located under `ddnet/build/data` you loose all Changes upon rebuilding
23:14 < bridge> <lukron55> i do not have that
23:14 < bridge> <lukron55> nvm it’s autoexec_server.cfg
23:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its still recommended to use myServerconfig.cfg - Check autoexec_server.cfg
23:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> it executes myServerconfig.cfg in its Last line
23:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> cba to Format my Messages on my Phone rn :D
23:17 < bridge> <lukron55> huh all i see is the autoexec config file?
23:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> Oh sorry i forgot to Tell you to create Said File :monkaStop:
23:17 < bridge> <lukron55> ohhh
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Reminder that naming is important, it HAS to be called myServerconfig.cfg
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Not MyServerConfig.cfg
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Not myserverconfig.cfg
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Etc
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :owo:
23:21 < bridge> <lukron55> got it
23:22 < bridge> <lukron55> so i copy everything in the autoexec config
23:22 < bridge> <lukron55> into the myServerconfig
23:24 < bridge> <lukron55> i get a “failed to open myServerconfig”
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Only add stuff to your myServerconfig that you want to Change, it overrides the config in autoexec
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Important is only
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Sv_register 1
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> For now
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe rcon pw
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Did you rebuild?
23:25 < bridge> <lukron55> i ain’t registering it 😭
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Huuuh
23:25 < bridge> <lukron55> its not for public
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest: why are you building from source and doing all that Work then
23:25 < bridge> <lukron55> fun innit
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
23:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> Anyway, rebuild and try again
23:26 < bridge> <lukron55> how do i rebuild
23:26 < bridge> <lukron55> 😭
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> @harrynfr Mind doing a Clean rebuild for him :justatest:
23:27 < bridge> <lukron55> every time i update the config it needs to be rebuilt?
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> If i Tell you what to do it might Just Break again Like the First time
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Go into your build folder and Just do:
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> `Cmake .. -DCLIENT=OFF @@ cmake --build -j .`
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> If an Error occurs Send it in
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> are you on your phone
23:28 < bridge> <lukron55> what build folder 😭
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yes sry
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> I know you hate my autocorrect
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> Go into your build folder and Just do:
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> `Cmake .. -DCLIENT=OFF && cmake --build -j .`
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> someone wanna brief me on the issue here
23:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> Building ddnet server from source on a Raspberry remotely. Now wanting to add myServerconfig.cfg
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> but the server is built?
23:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> His friend did it for him ig
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> during my stream I noticed that autoexec_server.cfg from the build directory was not being recognized by the server
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> he'd need to put it in his data directory
23:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yes
23:33 < bridge> <lukron55> mainly for:
23:33 < bridge> <lukron55> the name 
23:33 < bridge> <lukron55> the welcome message
23:33 < bridge> <lukron55> the announcement timer
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> No
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> the ddnet data directory
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> like ~/.local/share/DDNet or whatever it is
23:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> Im 99.8% Sure thats Not true, But i cant Check rn because im in bed lol
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it also seems weird to me
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> but when i was testing my server it only worked from there
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> let me look into it
23:35 < bridge> <lukron55> omg 😨
23:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Might have to add the File to cmakelists?
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> what?
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Lemme Check my fork
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> http://2143.christmas/f/JDz5.png
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it def shuold work from either path
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> but i think it's possible something else was taking precedence
23:39 < bridge> <lukron55> all i want to do is change the name change the welcome message and the map or starts on
23:39 < bridge> <lukron55> all i want to do is change the name change the welcome message and the map it starts on
23:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> This works If you add myServerconfig.cfg under
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> set(EXPECTED_DATA
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> In your cmakelists.txt
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Atleast thats how i Made it Work for some godforsaken reason
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Has been almost a Year lol
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Meh Change autoexec and See If it works
23:40 < bridge> <lukron55> i did
23:40 < bridge> <lukron55> hold on
23:41 < bridge> <lukron55> do i need to rebuild when i **edit** the file
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> such weird advice
23:41 < bridge> <lukron55> ok
23:42 < bridge> <lukron55> so i did change the autoexec config file
23:42 < bridge> <lukron55> and it didn’t update
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> can u tell me the absolute path of the file u edited
23:43 < bridge> <harrynfr> /home/lukron/ddnet-harry/ddnet/data/autoexec_server.cfg
23:43 < bridge> <lukron55> ^^
23:44 < bridge> <lukron55> he’s ssh my pi
23:44 < bridge> <harrynfr> before ddnet/ is irrelevant since i just created a separate directory when i built it
23:44 < bridge> <harrynfr> i cloned the repository in ddnet-harry
23:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> Can you Check ewans theory and Just nano into ~/.local/share/DDNet/data/myServerconfig.cfg and Just Check If the Server opens the File correctly ?
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> probably just call it autoexec_server.cfg
23:47 < bridge> <lukron55> one sec guys i accidentally shut off the power to my pi
23:47 < bridge> <lukron55> give us a minute
23:47 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
23:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
23:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> Gl! I Go AFK a bit
23:50 < bridge> <lukron55> right it’s back on
23:57 < bridge> <lukron55> what does this mean
23:57 < bridge> <lukron55> when starting the server it says fails to open myServerconfig.cfg
23:59 < bridge> <lukron55> @mpft what is he on about
