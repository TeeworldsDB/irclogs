00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you can take a look at my commit and DIY or I'll do it tomorrow
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm too tired :/
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u :)
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs idk how i support dunmy
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yay vanilla
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 'libr_anal.so' failed
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dfq it wants me to search for the error :troll:
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wtf is this lib
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anal
13:53 <@heinrich5991> perhaps short for analysis
14:08 <+Learath2> Math Analysis was the only course without an abbreviation in my curriculum last year :P
14:08 <+Learath2> the code was MANA1 though :)
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 did you start already?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 view my issue.
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pushy
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> viewed
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not sure, let's talk about it here with maybe a couple more people around
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it even possible to seperate for dummy and main using a cnetobj?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with a netobj we'd send all the players the exact same thing
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which makes sense to me
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i don't get why you'd ever want to change the score display midgame, or have it different for different players
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but even then you could hack it in using `SnappingPlayer` but I don't really see the use for it
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have it already
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the netmsg is there for sending the client NOT or TO use the score format
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs it normally uses time format, bcs gametype includes ddrace
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't say you can't do it
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I said it sounds pointless, two different things
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not really
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have minigames too, like instagib
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where this gets handy
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i disallow it OnClientEnter, because my score shows the level of the player, not the time (only when in race mode)
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The best would probably to just merge this commit: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/7e2eb335ae5f4b0baca9574243caf4800fea893c
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then we would have it as a game message and it would show up in the demo (only the last set format)
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah i see, I guess it can be useful if you are making one of those mods that does everything
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Exactly
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never liked the minigame/city mods, they always felt like they did everything but everything poorly
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it is implemented already in ddnet, the client just receives it as a sy msg
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, with a netobj you'd have to hook in differently
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lets wait for @heinrich5991 maybe he has a better idea
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but with a netobj you'd `OnSnap` decide which score display the client gets
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. while snapping on gamecontext, you check for which client you are snapping
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace/blob/master/src/game/server/player.cpp#L430
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there we check what to display, in the chat command we send the NETMSG
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> to correctly match
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, with a "gameinfo" one you'd do it in gamecontext or gamecontroller instead
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The only reason against using NETMSG (as right now) is that it fails in demos. So we would need to use a CNetObj?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well that and it doesn't really belong in a NETMSG
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not an event that happens
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just information
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is there some exchange for just information?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like the solo thing we did yesterday
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just extra information about a character
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this one is like that but it's extra information about the game itself
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I tried it with a CNetObj already, it failed in the client (it didnt update right, only when both, the dummy and the main info was identical)
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is the point, getting it dummy supported.
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> where/how did you snap?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, actually we might be stuck with this now if you want to support old clients :/
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is why I didn't really want to merge in any of this isddnet or score-time stuff
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because without a plan we end up like this...
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, old clients wont get support.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (not for this feature)
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they get it displayed differently (00:LEVEL)
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, i bet it's the way you implemented it clientside
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or the way you snap
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will give it another try, but with your style (from your commit)
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 could we add a way for clients/servers to communicate what extended netmsgs/netobjs they support?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut if you have it commited somewhere i can take a look
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure, its in my repo
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sec
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (accidently added some other stuff at the same time)
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace/commit/7dc223d58ce72fb1f1b753097eb3000eec33bfd5#diff-484561fa827fcba7d4ff098e92833c2c
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait, clientside code is this:
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `else if (Item.m_Type == NETOBJTYPE_DDNETGAMEINFO)
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 m_AllowTimeScore[g_Config.m_ClDummy] = ((const CNetObj_DDNetGameInfo *)pData)->m_AllowTimeScore;`
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This is at the position where the AuthInfo gets set aswell
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> appearently, its just this:
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1629/files
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 oh yea communicating capabilities like on irc would be good futureproof or wathever
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can also avoid sending useless packets to clients who will not do anything with it
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so for old clients u assume no capabilities or wathever
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whathever

18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @Learath2 ok so some time ago you told me how to convert teeworlds colors to hsl, now I wrote a code to do it and i see that the values are kinda off, is there a more precise way to do it?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki ü§ì
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon did you contribute to vanilla?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Think some indentation or shit like that
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh an mac build cmake
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commits?author=ChillerDragon
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Why?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon your mute refactor broke it
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> üë∫
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> classic
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but vanilla has no mute? o.O
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I'm talking ddnet
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i knew it i wanted to write tests for it but then i got cofused on dependecys
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> teeworlds ‚ù§
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is broken ?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it doesn't work
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i cant hotfix rn
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i will take a look late ror tomorrow
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sorri
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :c
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> KillerDragon ripped ddnet
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> "sorri"
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> "sorri" uwu
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> "sorri" :3
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol mute function calls "TryVoteMute"
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> copy paste üë∫
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Does anyone know how teeworlds applies color to tees
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woopsie
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> boiii @Alexander stilll xd
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> boii i know how to convert colors i just need some info
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what info
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it disallows too dark colors to prevent blsck
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> hsv or something
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> hsl
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i know how to convert the colors
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I just want to know how does teeworlds put a color on a tee
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I just want to know how does teeworlds put a color on a skin
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any reason why https://github.com/orgs/ddnet/people has a kicked staff member and is missing and admin who is dev? xd
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> who is missing
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I‚Äôm there
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not public u sneaky nobo
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what does it even mean to be in people of ddnet org?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u cant push to ddnet/ddnet master right?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> push access
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> merge prs etc
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can make your membership private
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so why dont u merge ur hotfix?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he obviosuly did
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what do you think about the time score?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how should be continue?
