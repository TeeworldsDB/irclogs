00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet he is hiding his porn in there
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> well if i ever quit tw id make it open src or at least send it to people who will keep it alive
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> shhhh
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what if fng is his porn, did you think of that
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> exposed
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no shaming here
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> can we change fng sac sound btw
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby that doesn't work. you need to send it to people before
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> once you're out, you'll be unreachable
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> to ninja slash
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you dont like the scoreboard sound?
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i mean i doubt it would be something instant where one day im playing like normal and the next day im gone forever
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i assume most people "quitting" just means playing less and less over time
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> hmmm
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe you are being naive in that assumption...
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> 😈
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> make dead mans switch in case u od
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> LOL
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> already have it
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> way to remotely kill the server just in case
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> or u mean to release it lol
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> imagine being assassinated over tw mod source code
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> both i guess
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby mind giving me access to your gitlab repo so I can access it once you're gone?
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and me once both of you are gone
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and me once all 3 of you are gone
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> heinrich ye probably could do that
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> hmmm how many people are on this server?
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832738112911310888/unknown.png
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> can never be too safe
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesn't heinrich already have the source to fng anyway?
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> dont think so
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> thought he was the one that extracted the antibot
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i wonder what happened to savalic :feelsbadman:
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yes i gave him the antibot i made for bombay
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh wow you don't even trust us? 😄
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> does kurosio still play?
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i want to ask them about some things
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i mean it already had all of the parts that ddnet needs
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or if anyone has contact to them
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> no sense wasting cpu trying to detect bots that noone is going to use on ddrace in the first place
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my gitlab username is heinrich5991
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yes sir, add me to the list _coughs_ :P
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> we can have a ceremony like the olympic games, noby passing on the torch
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> keeping the flame alive
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> :D lol
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> dont get ur hopes up im not planning on leaving soon :p
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> ik i was just joking
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ye lol
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> ill add on to the shameless plug, my github username is SPYRESZA but if it requires a gitlab account, i can organise that as well! :P
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i plan on making an for entities generator, combining different borders/tiles/colors from different entity sets (with permission) in some python app
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i plan on making an entities generator, combining different borders/tiles/colors from different entity sets (with permission) in some python app
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so you can customize your own entities using different images
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but i have to learn about <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/> again
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and of course the lovely tkinter which looks ugly af
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check out pyqt
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks less ugly 😉
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> pyqt never worked for me
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and the docs were more confusing
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but maybe i could try again
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did some pyqt apps
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looked quite native, I liked it
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> making actual applications in python should be made illegal
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @noby i wouldnt be surprised if you read journals in your free time around game anti cheats for further inspiration 😉
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> there aren't many resources on this stuff, no one wants to share their solution
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it's mostly divine inspiration
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what's your alternative?
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want some native-looking UI
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but prefer some scripting language
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> this is roughly my idea
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832742727401078794/unknown.png
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 depends on what I'm making
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> Ger1 servers arent shown in the ddnet tab even when u enabled europe, u can see other ger server or nl servers
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would only reach for python for a script
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm learning more perl to replace that too hopefully
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i should learn zig or nim and use that instead
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> to learn more xd
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> should discord presence elapsed time reset when the map is changed?
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i notice for learath it's still 2 hours
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe i have been just talking that long...
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 say I'm making a simple interface for handling a stupid web interface so data entry is easier
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> I dont know if this answers your question - https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/832218894433255485

00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'd make a CLI and if it had to be a gui I'd use java
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do I get a native looking UI in java?
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or I might make a node project, I love those nowadays
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can't but jswing isn't too awful
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> well the ger1 should still be shown in the europe section right?
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Its only GER and NLD now from my understanding. GER1 was replaced with NLD and I think GER is the old GER2
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. native UI is kind of a dealbreaker for me. I don't like this non-native stuff
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I needed native ui I'd go with C++ honestly
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> imma move my question
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yeah cant go wrong with c++ for native. jswing is eww, the fileexplorer as well is not the same when i tried it.
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> aodq knows a bit about minimal c++ ui
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you want something pretty just use node and make a webpage out of it
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now add the one-off requirement, and I'm back at python tbh
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yea the fastest way to make anything pretty is just web, which is sad but meh
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> god I wish python was not awful at dealing with modules, I so seriously want to like it
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, dependency system is as aweful as C/C++'s
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> NO
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you link stuff and it works in C++
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually contemplate suicide each time I import anything in python
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i think its not as bad as what you think lol
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if you want guarantees just use relative imports
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> why do you need a separate interface for data entry? cant integrate it into the website?
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @lynn check out how I generate the 0.7 version of the netmsgs in the ddnet server
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wdym data entry
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sec
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The amount of pain I had to endure to get those imported properly
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> where is this?
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually gave up on the entire project for 3 months because it made me want to break my keyboard in half
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> why do you need a separate interface for data entry? cant integrate it into the website? @heinrich5991
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you wanted to use the native import statement and not import lib I guess?
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/datasrc the seven part
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you only use importlib for hot import stuff
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> luckily deen figured out some combination of -ms in the cmake command so I didn't have to dig into importlib
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/hecrj/iced
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://camo.githubusercontent.com/54e584347854ab6084f26859910d421e45a95f6fe066eb5cb13dc32a78fb6cc3/68747470733a2f2f7468756d62732e6766796361742e636f6d2f4c6974746c6553616e6548616c69636f72652d736d616c6c2e676966
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i see the problem here
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it was referencing the module in the previous directory
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> havent really but would be interested to
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see the problem aswell, it's not rocket science, fixing it is more complex than neurosurgery
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> this is very c++ python code xD
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but whatever, that was a specific case
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it is a little annoying yea
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the problem was that you didn't consider all possibilities there
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did some weird importing logic in libtw2 for a similar use case
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was fairly painless
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (using importlib)
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C++ can be just as hard if you're not as much into it as we are
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> each time I start a python project there are 50 different ways to manage your requirements, a 1000 new ways to structure your project, a billion ways to make virtualenvs
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> especially cross-platform
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same with c++
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd honestly rather work with 8086 assembly then create another virtualenv
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody forces you to use cmake
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or qmake
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anything
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> every sane project either uses autohell or cmake
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now that is just the same with python
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every sane project uses pipenv or something like that
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I bet some python proponent would say something similar
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see above
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, I think meson is another contender @Learath2
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2bc420bef8a81093616da7a2eceff40b7fdc9ea7/datasrc/compile.py#L14>
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ```py
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> def create_flags_table(names):
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn>   return ["enum", "{"] + [f"\t{name} = 1<<{i}," for i, name in enumerate(names)] + ["};"]
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ```
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :P
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you probably dont care but i wanted to share
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @noby you should gather the data and create yourself a nice web ui page to get a player break down with various graphs, information and to the point where you can compare players alongside each other - not that you need it, but would be a cool project i guess.
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> f strings require modern python
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and we run this on some ancient debian iirc
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ...seriously? f-strings have been around forever
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahh i see
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol no
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean yeah but that is barely longer with old style format
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > They joined the party in Python 3.6.
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> how long ago was that
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2016
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> jesus christ
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not old
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it is to me xD
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by most ppl terms
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i could still do that, the server logs a line of data everytime someone shoots laser or hooks a tee and i could run the antibot checks after the fact
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> legacy for the sake of legacy
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i just dont like the argument :P
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol legacy in python means python 2
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not always
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not supported anymore anyway
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what legacy means most of the time
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/naftaliharris/tauthon would like to have a word
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no stop
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> let it die
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just please kill it
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know you think I'm being unfair to your language of choice but I'm not kidding when I say I'd rather use 8086 assembly
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> its fine, im super used to python hate
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> its veeeeery popular...
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> as someone who regularly uses java I have a high high hiiiiigh tolerance for garbage in a language
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> shitting on python is almost like shitting on js
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wasn't feeling unfairly treated ^^
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you're talking to me
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ya idk who anymore
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use rust
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont rly care what lang people use anymore
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ytou should care
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and engage
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in holy wars
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> people should use vim, they should use 4 width tabs
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I look at rust before sleeping so it doesn't look ugly to me anymore
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> as soon as the phrase "real programmers" comes up i stop listening
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> a few more weeks of this and I'll finally be able to read it without getting confused about the damn return type being on the wrong side
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is beuty
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes more sense being -> than on C
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there is someone who wanted to implement ddnet server in rust
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> input -> output
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i was going to help but i dont know rust
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the wrong side is C side
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i prefer types on the right
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u were wrong all this time
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES_SusThink:
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> as a declaration follows use man the C one is what makes sense to me
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont understand that sentence
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use man
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> manual?
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> declaration-follows-use person*
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> o
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> in C "T foo(K bar)" = "foo called with 1 argument of type bar is of type T"
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a function is not of type T
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a function returns a type T
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you read that like "returns type T accepts K
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the other way around
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> C got it backwards
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> C came before, y u flip around decades of convention?
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> convention doesnt mean its good
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it can stall progress
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> POP3 is also a convention
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> IRC is also a convention
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust syntax is way more powerfull than C
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> POP3 isn't a convention used by hand
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> does that mean that they're ideal lol
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everything is an experesion
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 C kinda has it backwards though 😛 pascal, maths 😉
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wait wait, even better
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> SMS :)
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ik, but why change it when there is no advantage to changing it
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still mad at the languages that took that step
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean the "advantage" is definitely more subjective, so i understand how you see it
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> forces me to read code like a dyslexic
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u may be left leaning in politics but ur pretty right leaning in programming
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> right to left to right
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> at the end of the day
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES_SusThink:
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> really it's bikeshedding
00:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> people talk about it because it's just besides the point xD
00:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> takes away responsibility of actually coding :D
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> omg "curly brace" people i hate
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like who cares
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have someone at work who wont touch any lang that doesnt use braces
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and they're the lead dev
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc&t=3181s
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> zig and nim are my favourite new languages honestly
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> same here
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> crystal?
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> nim is python but actually doesn't perform like shit
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> crystal is just less brainfuck rust
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> imo
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> zig is C but all the things I wanted from other languages added to it
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nim also has this syntax
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and first class cross compilation support ❤️
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it reads better for newcomers anyway
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> does nim emphasize safety? i cant remember honestly
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not that i know
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably, everyone adopted it, there must be a reason for it
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw zig is not as safe as rust
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it was zig that had manual memory management right
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh ofc
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it also makes the lexer prettier
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the parser*
00:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Perfect as I hate safety 😛
00:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> a buffer overflow a day keeps the doctor away
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and millions of dollars away
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ☕
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> destroying capitalism with buffer overflows
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah that's why I'm not a miliionaire yet
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> fuck if only I used rust
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly I still think the safety of rust comes with way too much brainwork for the developer
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 it just puts the brainwork when you program
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on c++ u deal with the shit after u realize it segfaults :)
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, but I already spend that much brainpower when I'm manually managing the memory
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u will always fail
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's confident
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> since you seem to be an oracle can you also tell me the btc price in 10 days?
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i agree learath
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep im confident ur c++ or c programs will have leaks and safety errors due to memory
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xD
01:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and race conditions
01:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust does not prevent memory leaks
01:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> wow you know all this before I even write a line of code? 😛
01:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
01:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe you should be an analyst instead of a dev
01:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just backed by statistics
01:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that human do errors
01:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> does this mean that you could have errors
01:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but statistics doesn't let you know that I'll always fail 😛
01:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not completely retarded no matter what some of you think about me lol
01:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they tell me you will most likely fail so
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh not just you
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even the most pro programmer
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> pls say stupid not retarded
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh noes
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been caught by the language police
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not a fan of that word, that's all
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is free to use it
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's a bit pejorative :P
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but meh, lots of people in tw say it
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i always say something but it goes unnoticed xD
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I intended it to be pejorative
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :(
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine we are on the level where someone cares about what insult you use on urself
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you know that idiot also used to be a medical term? 😉
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> twitter is leaking
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless there is a different meaning to pejorative
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't it just another word for slur?
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean if i told you i am a f\*\*\*\*\* would you also be okay with that lol
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that is very strange to me lol
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure I don't care how you refer to yourself
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd be very concerned if you used it about someone else though
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you're asking about faggot, not something related to fuck?
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes that is the word
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kinda hard to make out the word there
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean it cant be fucking or fucked because they're not nouns
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> fagott is an instrument
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> german is leaking
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagott
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's called fagot in turkish
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (the instrument, I bet we stole the word from you)
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fagot in catalan
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832754941801660427/131px-FoxBassoon.png
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ill drop it
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @lynn where are you from btw?
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> usa
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i knew it
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Susge:
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, figured, it seems these words are much harsher over there
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> burgerland is screwed ngl
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well they are used in very derogatory contexts here
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> at least historically
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> faggot for me sounds like nothing, but i guess its more because im not a native english speaker
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the spanish word for it is maricon
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and nobody takes rly seriously this insult
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> both the german and englich version of faggot dont mean much to me
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> both are used negatively here
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah maybe since we aren't native speakers that's why we don't really see all the connotations behind them
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I don't have any words in my native language that I'd NEVER utter
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no doubt english players still use retard, not to say they should lol
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well yes its how you call your buddy when theyre doing something gay u know?
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so maybe it's more of a culture thing, there are no banned/taboo words in turkish
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here its common to call others "hijo de puta" son of a whore and nobody bats an eye
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 😄
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ryozoki calls america burgerland i call catalonia spain :troll:
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> exactly the same in german but its one word
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> amk is common enough in turkish that it infected german
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> amk? idk that
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> translate that into english and I'd be banned in many communities
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> amk I guess very very roughly translates to "fuck your pussy"
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832756088255414292/unknown.png
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont want to come across as easily offended, there are just words i prefer not to see/say out of consideration for other people who may be offended
01:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> tranny faggot and retard among these
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and one more which i dont even need to spell out for you lol
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye among is the worst
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> amogus
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amongus
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xddd
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lynn first
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i win!
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what do i win
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Sadge:
01:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES3_PetTheAmongUs:771029769197846578>
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🏅
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i take @Ryozuki 's dev role for 24 hours
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ok that works
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont understand how some people spend half of their life online and still cant cope with the tone.
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i will make a 1 line commit to main ddnet
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> then i get dev role
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just fix 60 typos like chillerdragon
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> POG ok
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really avoid words. These are a subset of words that I wouldn't refer to anyone else with, but I won't just remove the word from my vocabulary altogether
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> to each their own 😄
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idrc
01:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just love people too much, even the easily offended ones
01:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> have u seen white girl twitter
01:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> its cus they are in their own bubbles
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> just like we are in ours
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blue hair
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mind people who are offended, so is their right, but when completely unrelated people get offended it really confuses me
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> some people dont realize they're being offensive most of the time
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that's the only reason i do it
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i also dont get why everyone is listening to what people on twitter have to say.
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's more of a reminder than me being offended
01:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but why do the offended people just ... man up?
01:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> dont
01:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> `/j`
01:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did you know that if you get reminded to breath you will breath manually for 5 mins
01:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
01:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you're blinking faster
01:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you lost the game
01:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> your tongue is touching your mouth
01:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> do these work for anyone anymore?
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> for some reason the tongue one really bothers me
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> the blinking one gets me
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> and the game
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you get me
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> 😳
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> fag
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> actually i think im stuck in an endless cycle of losing the game
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> :troll:
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> triggered
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why did u tell me your weakpoints now i HAVE to say it
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> actually you wouldnt say that if i was serious
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> manual breathing one is the one that catches me
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> unless you're one of those... trans women are women types
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> unless you're one of those... trans women arent women types
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum hey, don't use fag as an insult
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it was ontopic
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Pepeg:
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> admit it's a bit of an abuse of the context :P
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idc either way but
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah but how can i resist? you say which words trigger you and then you give me this setup?? cmon
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wait did i miss something
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no they dont trigger me
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i am sensitive to thme
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> em
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> for other people, mostly
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> they can be helpful imo
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this is getting more and more #off-topic. Language development doesn't belong here 😄
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Main_Page
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we back on topic
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> we should make a tw history book. everytime someone remembers a remarkable event in ddnet hiostory we could add it in a timeline from 2013 to now.... i just dont want to do it
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can i tbe on that wiki?
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> make an account and create a page 😉
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> might be a good segment for my video actually
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> tw/ddnet is quite possibly the largest open source multiplayer game out there rn
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i plan to have a lot of help with it
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if people are willing
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 apparently minetest is at least an order of magnitude larger
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> minetest is kinda crazy
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, knew I was forgetting a game
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its just gonna be hard to get the exact dates from some events. i already forgot when cor exactly finished ddnet
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what i remember rn is ddnet closing down, forris cheating the map falling down, milk white nails, ddnet releasing sdl2, aoe vs hi_leute_gll drama
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it doesn't count
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lol milk
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They don't host their own servers 😛
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> those are exactly the type of things i meant
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wat
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> thats hard to believe lol
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember the night we spent till 4am to handle the damn konsti paying the persian hoster to inject ranks thing
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> xdd
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 lichess? ^^
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sp someone changing the whole wiki to deen is **
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> now lichess would count, damn 😦
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lichess best
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that's a good one
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> oh or that sp someone hash collision map troll
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> fun fact, i actually only started talking to noby because of sp somone
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> fun fact, i actually only started talking to noby because of sp someone
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> proud lichess user
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832760421807030292/unknown.png
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> because of https://tee.world
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> dont waste it here gogo make the timeline
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://steamdb.info/app/1127400/graphs/
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah mindustry too
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> mindustry is good game
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same order of magnitude as DDNet, but a bit lower
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> inb4 ryozuki talks about factorio right about now
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if someone makes a doc for the timeline i would appreciate it
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> cus i could use that as a reference
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> factorio isn't open source
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> a list is too simple imo
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://lichess.org/contact#help-buy this is a very respectable position
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> especially at their size
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> btw i was planning on doing a history of teeworlds vid so ur vid better be history of ddrace only >:(
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://lichess.org/contact#help-monetize
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well it wouldnt be mostly about history
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> about the community, game, why people should play
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> anyone ever got in touch with magnus auvinen?  kinda wanna ask some questions
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> oh right
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but i want the intro to be a bit of history
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like most vids about games
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> "why is ur code so dogcrap"
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lichess entire spendings are public
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really like the lichess project, a true reflection of what open source collaboration can achieve
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 68514 players
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we still have some way to go
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> did the donations pick up with the steam release?
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> lichess is good but i feel like its easier to succeed as open source since its just chess
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i am actually surprised server cost is already almost met and it's only april
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> people are backing this game a lot too
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> also there was that chess boom on twitch/youtube
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> doesnt konsti donate lots of money sometimes? i think konsti has some dodgy business going on.
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @lynn wait until deen adds the new NLD server there :d
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that one costs a fortune compared to the rest of our inventory
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the prediction margin line has never been as flat as on nld
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahh
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah that's true
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Konsti has donated a lot in the past
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think it was well within range of someone with an actual job 😉
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Im 'corneum gogo <https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Timeline> it needs timestamps im p lazy rn
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh another ddnet history event was the long painful process of removing RayB
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how do i add stuff
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> what was that
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> also add botters
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> RayB, jao and Welf used to be the 3 testing leads
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> RayB was the test leader and he had a war against jao iirc

02:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> Megaman had already rented a virtual server, but didn't know how to set it up. So I took over this aspect, implementing what we discussed in our group of 4: Megaman, Delo, .me' and I. We started out with just a few maps by .me' and Megaman. I'm not a mapper myself, so it's lucky that all the other 3 DDNet founders were. We also had a deal with Hitomi to host a server for him with his maps, among them of course the extremely popular HellGat

09:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> lmao drama in the timeline Ryozuki
10:55 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Yo anyone of you leet haxx0rs have good resources on getting into binary edits? Maybe our NSA supporter @Learath2? I wanna extend/edit some closed src software. Turns out its harder than objdump + paste in some blob and reassemble :D
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you patching or inserting new code?
15:50 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I was thinking about inserting new code. I think by patching you refer to in place edits without changing the length of the program. As far as I understood thats what an machine language guru can do easily with a hexeditor.
15:50 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> But I was more after getting some hooks in place where I can write some C code or something like that. Well idk thats why I ask for a starting point :D
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you want to achieve in the end?
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> frida is an interesting tool that lets you hook functions
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://frida.re/
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon[m]: ^
15:56 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> thanks
15:56 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I just want to mess around with closed src software I am forced to run to see how much I feel better when I manage to do basic edits
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, sounds like frida can help you achieve what you want
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> frida is very cool indeed, but if you want to insert assembly it is some work and idk if any tools exist to help you with it
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> true. with frida you can instead insert JS though, I used it to patch some RE challenge file
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> was quite easy
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The simplest way to actually insert assembly into a binary is to find a "code cave" somewhere already executable where you can fit your chunk and jump to it by some means
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't find one large enough you need to fiddle around with adding a new executable section to it which wasn't a fun experience the last time I tried
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not sure I'd call it the easiest way though (when inserting code). I think I find frida easier there
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh definitely, I meant easiest way to insert a chunk of native bytecode
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could use frida to do that too at runtime now that I think about it
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, just place your bytecode somewhere in memory, mark it executable with mprotect and call into it
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or just compile it into a shared library and dlopen it to reduce the annoying things you have to worry about
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or LD_PRELOAD
16:11 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh no need to insert assembly I am not trying to be as cool as possible but more like gaining control over closed src software in the easiest way possible. Like trying to add simple features or something. I will probably rage quit trying but whatever :D
16:12 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I always wonder how there are modding communities for closed source games
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well modding communities usually either rely on a modding framework already being there, or atleast a scripting framework in the game that is for the gameplay people to make things without needing to know to program
16:20 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> right but i feel like these modding frameworks are often community built arent they?
16:21 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> So I was wondering maybe there is some workflow on how to create such a framework. But anyways im currently looking into frida and it looks cool :)
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If they are using a scripting framework that's not exposed yes, usually some pioneers will by looking at how the scripting hooks into the engine create their own framework. An example of this is Cleo for GTA San Andreas
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but there are games where there is an official framework for modding, like witcher 3 or skyrim
16:24 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Interesting so witcher team wanted their game closed but still support the modding community
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 mind if I `typedef std::unique_ptr<sqlite3, CSqliteDelete> CSqlite3`?
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what should its name be?
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you look at even older games, where disk space and memory space was at a premium (think gameboy era) there it starts to become black magic to me how people managed to dissect these old games to create so much tooling to mod them. Look at GBA era pokemon if you want to see some of that magic
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I think that's fine, but would that not be a one off anyway?
16:25 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I feel like I miss out some things being in the tw open source bubble
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I was thinking about making it an IStorage function. maybe that's more controversial? ^^
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeeh? 😄
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> OpenFile, OpenDb/OpenSqlite3
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I don't think this fits in the scope of IStorage. Atleast not how I conceive it
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since you can only open sqlite3 dbs by path, you'd have to extract the full path from IStorage to get a DB
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I think of Storage (in terms of teeworlds) I really only think of files. Though maybe we could extend the concept? But I think it's scope is fine
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not just ask IStorage for the path using GetPath?
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can do that, but I thought this was the abstraction that is wrong 😛
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that was a quick ddnet hack because something didn't quite work
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I guess an argument could be made that no paths should leave CStorage
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about having IStorage open the file and pass that file handle along to sqlite?
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the thing that doesn't work. sqlite3 needs a path
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sqlite3 wants to create temporary files near the db
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, that's overreach by sqlite, but I get it
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think GetPath is the better way to do this than to make storage aware of some database implementation
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really want to re-do storage some day btw, it's quite a mess right now
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Amou_Martîn> Eh, I think that's fine, but would that not be a one off anyway?
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'm going mad
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something was working, I rebased something that should have been failing before but wasn't suddenly broke. I rebased again and it happened again
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> sounds like you having a fun saturday
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Eki> I open a new issue about restore players' state after ddos. Will this be difficult to achieve?
19:50 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> enable /r :D
19:51 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> detecting server lack and pausing game is actually an interesting idea. Might be a bit messy tho
19:51 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> "lack"
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Eki> enable /r is not enougt as i think xd. I think the most easy way is set the duration of Timeout Protection over to be long enough. Or change the way of trigger Timeout Protection over.
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Eki> but now it seem that the maxium of "conn_timeout_protection" is 10000 second which is not enough for this kind of situation
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> It's cool if you can implement this but ddos attacks can be unpredictable. I'm not trying to bash your idea, it's a good idea. However, Ddos attacks you want to prevent as far upstream as you can. I get we are on a budget but yeah.
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> What happens in you suspend while someone is hammer flying and it's a faily part? They fall and die?
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> What happens when you suspend while someone is hammer flying and it's a faily part? They fall and die?
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Eki> yeah it is hard to deal with that kind of situation. but i think when ddos begin, player should know they should stay in a safe place
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> P.s I doubt most players are doing faily maps when ddos happens and those who do can probably get there fast anyways
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If they in a team they can /save quickly. I guess your idea is more focused to team0?
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we could extend timeout protection automatically when a dos is happening
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Eki> yes, caz in chn server, we anyway play in a big team0 xd
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Eki> thx! that would be a good idea
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @Eki keep the ideas flowing!
