12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what was it about?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I needed a couple people to help me test teams
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did it work?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well i think it works but its hard to interact with yourself :D
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WeezMe> Dunno if this is the right channel but is something wrong with the german servers? I'm not sure if its my internet (Been having immense trouble connecting to servers lately). I'm located in sweden but a friend which is located in germany has the same problems. Barely any servers found and if you actually find something - you can barely connect
