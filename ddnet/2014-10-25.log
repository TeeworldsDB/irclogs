03:44 < KinG_> hi guyz ^^
03:44 < KinG_> deen: u here?!
03:44 < KinG_> laxa: u here?!!!
03:45 <@deen> hi
03:45 < KinG_> hey :(
03:45 < KinG_> deen: i ruined my windows while i was installing ubuntu what should i do?
03:45 <@deen> keep ubuntu
03:45 < KinG_> my Drive F doesn't load and MOST of things i had is THERE
03:45 < KinG_> :(
03:46 <@deen> windows starts but drive f is not there?
03:46 <@deen> maybe you installed ubuntu over drive f
03:46 < KinG_> windows doesn't start
03:46 < KinG_> yes i guess
03:46 <@deen> ah, can you select windows in grub?
03:46 <@deen> or did you overwrite your whole disk?
03:46 < KinG_> when i choose windows to boot it doesn't
03:47 <@deen> that's bad
03:47 <@deen> but i really have no idea what to do, you should ask someone else
03:47 < KinG_> also i'm on ubuntu live it's not installed in my pc it's on my flash drive
03:47 < KinG_> but also the same iso file extracted in drive f
03:47 < KinG_> but i can't access it to delete
03:47 < KinG_> ay ideas?!
03:48 <@deen> no
03:48 < KinG_> :((
03:48 < KinG_> for now how can i open .exe files? :(
03:48 <@deen> you can't on Linux
03:48 < KinG_> where is terminal?
03:48 <@deen> i don't know
03:48 < KinG_> how can i open terminal?!!!!
03:49 < KinG_> any hotkeys?!
03:49 <@deen> i have never seen ubuntu, i don't know how it works
03:50 < KinG_> bor said there is a program to run .exe files on linux u don't know what it is?!
03:50 <@deen> wine
03:50 < KinG_> okay new question how to install it? :|
03:50 <@deen> no idea. ask someone else please
03:51 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
03:52 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
04:08 < KinG_> i like linux but i really need my windows back i'm going to try booting it if i fail i go to sleep bye deen ^_^
04:14 < eeeee> this should be the topic: deen@> when sound is disabled, it doesn't work^^
04:15 < eeeee> made my day
04:15 <@deen> i mean, you can't even add sound files to your map
04:16 < eeeee> yeah i know, still reads somewhat funny
04:16 <@deen> ^^
04:16 < eeeee> like how you're debugging map sounds for a couple hours and then turns out that when sound is disabled the map sounds don't work
04:16 <@deen> yes...
04:17 <@deen> but there were 2 separate issues
04:17 <@deen> now they're both fixed
04:17 <@deen> and a few others as well
04:17 < eeeee> sounds like a fun friday night issue fixin
04:17 <@deen> definitely
04:18 <@deen> but we still need opus =/
04:18 <@deen> wavpack is way too big
09:09 < EastByte> deen: stop working during night
09:10 < EastByte> it's not good :P
12:12 < Nimda> Pentamine by Themix just released on Brutal at 2014-10-25 12:08
12:25 <@deen> oh, there are spammers on quakenet?
12:25 < EastByte> there are?
12:28 <@deen> i don't know, really weird person just messaged me
12:28 <@deen> sending me weird links
12:28 < EastByte> hm
12:28 <@deen> asking whether I'm philip (whois info of ddnet.tw)
12:28 <@deen> afk
12:28 < EastByte> hmkay
12:46 < EastByte> hmmm
12:46 < EastByte> deen: do you think my home dsl provider minds if I do some weak udp flooding?
13:05 < EastByte> hm 5mbit/s ssdp like packets just go through :(
13:37 <@deen> EastByte: i don't know^^
13:39 < EastByte> now I try permanent mitigation
13:40 <@deen> you think we should primarily run tournamen on GER2?
13:40 < EastByte> hm nah doesn't matter
13:40 <@deen> doesn't matter?
13:41 <@deen> it matters since the server we choose now will get ddosed
13:41 < EastByte> but players will switch server on laggs
13:41 < EastByte> so...
13:41 <@deen> but i want to see whether it works without laggs
13:42 < EastByte> the tournament would die if it happens though :P
13:44 <@deen> hm?
13:44 <@deen> why would it die?
13:44 < EastByte> people would stop playing if it laggs too much
13:45 < EastByte> I guess we should use eur and ger2
13:45 < EastByte> and the server you chose will automatically the main server
13:48 <@deen> i don't know how many servers we'll need
13:48 <@deen> i have 1 running on ger2 and 1 on eur now
13:49 <@deen> i can feel that you enabled firewall again
13:49 <@deen> connects take 10 seconds^^
13:50 < EastByte> I'm testing everything
13:50 <@deen> there are 60 players on EUR, don't kill them
13:51 < EastByte> even with permanent mitigation, sending 10mbit/s static packets I don't get dropped
13:51 < EastByte> that sucks
13:51 < EastByte> I'm only testing ip 37.
13:52 <@deen> 10 mbit/s isn't much
13:52 < EastByte> it already is way too much
13:52 <@deen> it doesn't matter for the server
13:53 <@deen> how would you tell legitimate 10 mbit/s from DoS 10 mbit/s apart?
13:53 < EastByte> if the mitigation starts only above 90mbit/s there will be huge laggs
13:53 < EastByte> well I would like to tell ovh that 10mbit/s is too much
13:54 <@deen> would be better to have a 10 gbit/s line :P
13:55 < EastByte> the attack has like an unlimited number of source addresses+ports with an average of 1mbit/s traffic per ip
13:55 <@deen> that should be easier to detect than a single 10 mbit/s
13:56 < EastByte> well, how
13:56 < EastByte> there already are like 300 different ips interacting with the server while tournament
13:57 <@deen> if there's a lot of traffic (>= 100 mbit/s), check what characteristics most of the traffic have
13:57 <@deen> then ban traffic based on that characteristic
13:57 <@deen> (only ingoing traffic counts, players create mostly outgoing one for map downloads)
13:57 < EastByte> well I hope it works like that
13:57 <@deen> i bet it doesn't^^
13:57 < EastByte> ^^
13:57 <@deen> or their characteristic heuristics are too simple
13:58 < EastByte> I bet it's more like ban x ip on >100mbit traffic
13:58 <@deen> hm, no
13:58 < EastByte> which is really useless
13:58 <@deen> they also banned me when i just reloaded ddnet.tw/status^^
13:58 < EastByte> they just need to search for 'HTTP' xd
13:58 < EastByte> yea some bad heuristic in there
13:59 < EastByte> atleast for eur there only is one kind of traffic
13:59 < EastByte> (from two sourceports when using dummy)
14:00 <@deen> three souce ports when using server browser^^
14:01 < EastByte> yea...
14:05 < EastByte> one thing I havn't tried yet
14:10 < EastByte> interesting
14:10 < EastByte> using the api I can request whether an ip is blocked
14:20 < EastByte> "Delay to wait before remove ip from auto mitigation after an attack"
14:20 <@deen> cool
14:20 < EastByte> dunno whether that's usefull
14:20 < EastByte> you can set up mitigation profiles but this is the only rule you can set xd
14:27 < EastByte> hmm, in the end the ovh api doesn't help me in ddos mitigation :/
14:27 <@deen> too bad
14:27 < EastByte> can't even enable game mitigation on my ips
14:33 < EastByte> oh 104 players
14:33 <@deen> yeah, ger2 looks laggy to me
14:34 <@deen> jumps from 20 to 40 every few seconds
14:41 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/OFoXdA
14:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 7a5935d def: Add BadAnqelMonster skin
15:01 < EastByte> deen: I got thrown out from eur the second time now
15:01 < EastByte> without timeout or anything?
15:03 < EastByte> strange
15:04 <@deen> wow, that's weird
15:04 < EastByte> just finding myself back in serverbrowser
15:04 <@deen> wow, China 30 players
15:04 <@deen> never seen that many
15:05 < EastByte> :)
15:35 <@deen> i don't know how how to add opus properly =/
15:37 <@deen> we should probably use opusfile, which depends on libogg and libopus
15:42 <@deen> should we add the compiled libraries? statically link? or require them on linux/mac?
15:43 < EastByte> hard question
15:43 < EastByte> statically linking would prevent most problems
15:44 <@deen> i'll try that
15:47 < EastByte> iptables -A INPUT -i venet0 -p udp -m u32 --u32 "28=0x48545450" -j DRO
15:47 < EastByte> neat
15:48 < EastByte> u32 allows simple deep packet inspection
15:48 <@deen> cool
15:50 <@deen> opus seems difficult to link statically
15:50 < EastByte> everything seems difficult to link statically :P
15:53 <@deen> opus seems really huge
15:55 <@deen> there should be an opuslite library =/
15:55 < EastByte> whoops just throw my self out of my test vps
15:55 < EastByte> glad I didnt use eur
15:55 <@deen> ^^
15:55 < EastByte> librarys always are a big problem
15:56 <@deen> can't i use the normal opus compilations stuff
15:56 <@deen> and compile a static library
15:56 <@deen> and link that into ddnet client?
15:57 < EastByte> well, try to compile opus statically
15:57 < EastByte> might be hard enough
15:57 <@deen> --enable-static?
15:58 < EastByte> maybe some features can't work with that
16:07 < EastByte> Oct 25 16:05:55 vps104832 kernel: [1870611.960170] ssdp-drop: IN=venet0 OUT= MAC= SRC=91.97.173.187 DST=92.222.181.74 LEN=111 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=55 ID=62564 DF PROTO=UDP SPT=43986 DPT=5000 LEN=91
16:07 < EastByte> I would want to do ssdp logging via iptables
16:08 < EastByte> it just informs about one packet per second (-m limit --limit 1/second)
16:15 < EastByte> okay rule works
16:15 <@deen> somehow i'm not motivated to add opus
16:15 < EastByte> :P
16:15 <@deen> but i think the way to go is dynamic libraries, same as SDL and freetype
16:15 < EastByte> how do you want to do that on linux/mac
16:16 <@deen> users have to install opusfile, just as they had to install sdl and freetype
16:16 < EastByte> well okay
16:16 <@deen> and for windows (and mac?) we add the dll
16:16 < EastByte> but it's a problem that e.g. ubuntu users (linux noobs) won't get notified about missing libs
16:16 < EastByte> only if they run from console
16:16 <@deen> yeah =/
16:17 < EastByte> what about runtime lib load?
16:17 <@deen> but they don't get notified about missing sdl now either, do they?
16:17 < EastByte> I dont think so
16:18 < EastByte> but loading external libs at runtime would provide great portability
16:23 < EastByte> grr, 130 players and eur won't give us usable information about cpu usage
16:24 <@deen> add the CPU% for each individual server^^
16:24 <@deen> should be about right
16:24 < EastByte> hmm
16:24 <@deen> something like 40% (of one core)
16:25 <@deen> no solution for the serverstatus script?
16:25 <@deen> can i run it as root, at least for the tournament?
16:25 <@deen> want to monitor the traffic
16:25 < EastByte> you can
16:51 <@deen> another idea: I'll check how rockbox does opus
16:51 <@deen> i really liked rockbox source code after having worked on linux for half a year^^
16:53 <@deen> seems like they managed to get it statically linked, like i initially tried
17:10 < EastByte> it's time to get fresh air
18:03 < Savander> hi!
18:03 < Savander> deen:  ! Wanna hear smth!?:P
18:03 <@deen> hi, sure
18:05 < Savander> join to me
18:05 < Savander> (if you can)
18:09 < Savander> hmm?
18:12 < Savander> :(
18:13 <@deen> oh, i thought you wanted to tell me something
18:14 <@deen> Savander: don't hear anything
18:15 < Savander> wait
18:16 <@deen> Savander: now it's 9 MB
18:16 < Savander> yup
18:16 < Savander> i forgot
18:16 < Savander> sound - 9 mbs ~~
18:16 <@deen> you should do a few tricks to get wavpack smaller
18:17 <@deen> set to mono
18:17 < Savander> maybe but its 5 minutes music
18:17 < Savander> :PP
18:17 < Savander> and its music maked by my friend
18:17 <@deen> and use hybrid compression (lossy)
18:17 < Savander> t4 years ago
18:17 < Savander> :D
18:17 < Savander> hoh?
18:17 < Savander> i only did smth
18:17 < Savander> like..
18:17 < Savander> Auda city ->
18:17 < Savander> Save as wav
18:17 < Savander> wavepack ->  convert to .wv
18:17 <@deen> in audacity make it mono
18:17 < Savander> nothing more
18:17 <@deen> and use wavpack -b25
18:17 < Savander> now you hear?!
18:17 <@deen> yes, but i don't like it^^
18:17 < Savander> ye i use wavpack -b25
18:18 < Savander> XD
18:18 < Savander> haha :D
18:18 < Savander> TeeWOrlds pro
18:18 < Savander> but
18:18 < Savander> why if i have sound volume set to 0
18:18 < Savander> i don't hear music?
18:18 < Savander> even i have music volume 100
18:18 <@deen> oh
18:18 <@deen> that should probably be separate?
18:18 < Savander> ye
18:18 <@deen> hmmmm
18:19 < Savander> i guess?
18:19 < Savander> i don't like teeworlds sounds
18:19 < Savander> e.g
18:19 <@deen> just disable "Enable game sounds"
18:19 < Savander> and a lot of people don't use music
18:19 < Savander> but still D:
18:19 < Savander> hehe, i think it should be seperate
18:19 <@deen> not sure, maybe it's fine
18:20 < Savander> love htis music
18:20 < Savander> it's old schoold Drum 'n' Bass
18:20 < Savander> ;33
18:20 <@deen> i don't think we should release any maps with music on ddnet
18:20 <@deen> sounds should be used for small effects, not music
18:20 < Savander> ye, i know
18:21 < Savander> i just tested! :D
18:21 < Savander> but hmm
18:21 < Savander> look, maybe music as background
18:21 < Savander> for example
18:21 < Savander> ambient
18:21 < Savander> this music is really climate
18:21 <@deen> then people would just disable map sounds altogether
18:21 <@deen> at least i would
18:22 <@deen> because i won't listen to some map music
18:22 < Savander> ye i know, but for some maps 
18:22 < Savander> (for example, halloween map)
18:22 < Savander> horror music would be great :D
18:23 < Savander> screams etc
18:23 < Savander> idea! :P
18:23 < Savander> or not, but idea
18:24 < Savander> When someone join, then you'll heard smth like "Welcome on DDraceNetwork Server!"
18:24 < Savander> XD
18:27 < Savander> nnice
18:28 < Savander> now music have only 4mbs
18:41 < PanArnold> deen
18:41 < PanArnold> are u here?
18:42 < Savander> hhaha
18:42 < Savander> i made it
18:42 < EastByte> deen: /var/log/messages is full of ddnet server segfaults
18:42 < Savander> XDD
18:42 < PanArnold> deeeeeeeeeeeeeen
18:43 < PanArnold> siema savander ;d
18:43 < Savander> Siema :O

18:43 <@deen> hi PanArnold 
18:43 < PanArnold> can i change nick in tw?
18:43 < PanArnold> i have 100 points
18:43 <@deen> no
18:43 < EastByte> I don't understand it
18:44 <@deen> EastByte: but only on EUR
18:44 < PanArnold> hmm
18:44 < PanArnold> why?
18:44 < PanArnold> i need to change nick
18:44 < PanArnold> but i wanna to take points with me
18:44 <@deen> EastByte: not a single segfault on GER2
18:44 < Savander> deen:  wanna hear "Welcome on ddrace network" xD?
18:44 < Savander> hahaha :P
18:44 <@deen> no^^
18:44 < PanArnold> deen, so can i?
18:44 <@deen> no
18:44 < PanArnold> meh..
18:45 <@deen> EastByte: but i never heard a complaint of a server crashing on EUR
18:45 < EastByte> maybe it's some kind of bug in empty servers
18:45 <@deen> maybe they segfault when i normally close them?
18:45 < EastByte> yea 
18:45 <@deen> let's try
18:46 <@deen> nope
18:46 < Savander> Woah, the best Welcome on DDRaceNetwork
18:46 < EastByte> oh I just noticed log level 0 isn't a good idea
18:46 <@deen> ^^
18:58 < Savander> Welcome on DDraceNetwork
19:09 < EastByte> no ddos yet
19:20 < EastByte> deen: anything from hallowed?
19:27 <@deen> he isn't sure if he can stream, since he's sick
19:28 < EastByte> deen: did yuo add BadAnqelMonster.png to autoupdate list?
19:28 <@deen> EastByte: i haven't released a new client since deciding to add it
19:28 <@deen> so no
19:30 <@deen> oh yeah, i should disable the livestream announcements^^

19:57 <@deen> but the limit is very high
19:57 < EastByte> o0
19:57 <@deen> needs about 20 minutes of shooting to reach it

21:08 < EastByte> deen: maggi just got the best time xd
21:10 <@deen> ^^
21:10 <@deen> yeah, i saw
21:10 <@deen> But this is final: http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/29/
21:10 < EastByte> yep, bad for him
21:10 <@deen> at least that proves that 1 hour was a good time
21:10 < EastByte> yes
21:10 <@deen> people were still able to improve best time after 1 hour
21:11 < EastByte> well maggi said he couldn't race because of all the spectators spectating him
21:11 < EastByte> made him unsafe
21:12 <@deen> haha
21:13 < EastByte> this map really is fun
21:13 <@deen> yes
21:14 <@deen> something new
21:14 <@deen> i imagined you could do something like this but no mapper wanted to do it
21:14 < EastByte> the beginning also was funny :P
21:15 <@deen> haha
21:15 <@deen> yeah, i should have tested that stuff
21:15 <@deen> first i forgot to upload the map^^
21:15 <@deen> then i set sv_team 0 and people could hammer each other
21:15 <@deen> and finally i reloaded so it wasn't a solo server anymore :P
21:15 < EastByte> haha
21:16 <@deen> Ama said "reload" and he confused me
21:16 < EastByte> hm at the beginning I thought you wanted to make hammering possible
21:16 <@deen> nono
21:16 <@deen> that would be terrible^^
21:16 < EastByte> well, beating out other players while racing can be fun
21:16 <@deen> haha, yeah
21:16 < EastByte> the map just has to be madee rfor that
21:17 <@deen> but then people would just go to an empty server
21:17 < EastByte> yep
21:19 <@deen> next tournament in 24 hours :P
21:19 <@deen> summer time -> normal time will confuse some people =/
21:21 < EastByte> normal time?
21:21 <@deen> "winter" time
21:21 <@deen> CEST -> CET
21:21 < EastByte> ah I got it
21:22 < EastByte> well the broadcast will count down I guess
21:22 <@deen> yes
21:22 <@deen> but some people just come for the tournaments
21:22 <@deen> and never play on ddnet otherwise
21:22 < EastByte> put a countdown in the servername :)
21:22 < EastByte> well wont help if they are coming too late
21:23 <@deen> most will think "20:00", that's like always
21:23 < EastByte> or we can add some kind of heading in the ddnet client saying "tournament starting in...", "running since..."
21:23 <@deen> ^^
21:23 < EastByte> hm yea
21:23 <@deen> don't think that's necessary
21:23 < EastByte> but it's neat
21:27 < laxa> !en-de I agree
21:27 < Nimda> Translation: Genau
21:28 <@deen> laxa: you want a tournament timer in client?
21:28 < laxa> no
21:28 < EastByte> why not
21:31 <@deen> the ranks were incredibly close at the end of tournaments
21:31 <@deen> exactly 1 second between top1 and top5
21:32 <@deen> oh, and i wrote a mail about the ping problems to nfoservers
21:32 < EastByte> let the players work like a neural network and they will figure out the most efficient way for everything :)
21:32 <@deen> well, i had to help a bit
21:33 <@deen> some poor players on small servers didn't notice the cheats =/
21:33 < EastByte> hmm
21:33 <@deen> they were just trying harder and wondering why everyone was 5 seconds faster
21:33 <@deen> so i broadcasted about the cheat :P
21:33 < EastByte> on teamspeak that was like the first topic after a minute
21:33 <@deen> yeah, these players had a huge advantage
21:34 <@deen> Chilean player was leading for some time!
21:35 < EastByte> yep not bad
21:35 <@deen> but they didn't understand how the cheat works
21:35 <@deen> english and all that
21:38 <@deen> nfoservers is trying to fix the ping issues
21:38 <@deen> i think with low ping they would be good servers
21:38 <@deen> (too bad there was no ddos attack today)
21:39 < EastByte>  might be different tomorrow
21:39 <@deen> yep, we will see
21:42 <@deen> nfoservers makes some dangerous guarantees
21:42 < EastByte> wut?
21:42 <@deen> they guarantee that their servers run at least as well as every other server in the city
21:42 < EastByte> in the city?
21:42 < EastByte> frankfurt?
21:42 <@deen> in the same city as their server*
21:42 <@deen> for any city where they host
21:43 <@deen> http://www.nfoservers.com/performanceguarantee.php
21:43 < EastByte> ah
21:43 <@deen> but it has so many rules that it won't matter much i think^^
21:46 <@deen> I think I'd try to go with 2 cores for nfoservers
21:54 <@deen> the cores are 3.5 GHz compared to 2.0 on GER1
21:54 < EastByte> is it a vps?
21:54 <@deen> yes, but seriously underloaded
21:55 <@deen> the 3 cores compile faster than 6 cores on GER1
21:55 < EastByte> the datafabrik vps was quite weak then
21:56 <@deen> about the same performance as the kimsufi
22:14 <@deen> i think i need a list of when the servers are running out^^
22:15 < EastByte> might be good
22:23 < Savander> terraz online
22:24 < EastByte> deen: would you rather use int64 time_get() instead of int time_timestamp() ?
22:25 < EastByte> hm I think time_get() is used everywhere in tw
22:26 < EastByte> it's just a little bit too precise in my opinion
22:26 < EastByte> but int time_timestamp() will overflow in year 2032 or so
22:27 <@deen> then keep using time_get()!
22:27 < EastByte> :)
22:27 <@deen> we need ddnet after 2032!
22:28 <@deen> just 18 more years
22:28 < EastByte> says the one who thought ddnet will die
22:30 < EastByte> meh it's too hard for me to keep out the space in conditions "if ("
22:33 <@deen> yes, i hate it as well
22:33 <@deen> maybe we should just do a big search-and-replace over the entire source code and change the standard we use
22:34 < EastByte> yea
22:36 <@deen> if, while, do
22:36 <@deen> anything else?
22:36 <@deen> -do
22:36 < EastByte> for
22:37 < EastByte> swtich
22:38 <@deen> mod authors will hate us^^
22:38 <@deen> they just learned how to use git to auto-merge
22:38 < EastByte> oh yea haha :D
22:38 < eeeee> clang-format it
22:38 < EastByte> the zclient authors will be pretty fucked
22:39 <@deen> so, should i still commit it?^^
22:39 < EastByte> well I would add a script for that
22:39 < EastByte> eeeee: clang-format?
22:39 <@deen> hm?
22:40 < EastByte> a script I can run before I do pullrequests
22:41 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/df9ed2c52dcf115fc19c783231a2219dde1ec1b1
22:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 df9ed2c def: Change coding style: 'if(' -> 'if (' and same for while, for, switch
22:41 <@deen> 7308 lines^^
22:41 < EastByte> not that much^^
22:43 < EastByte> I'm sure this will have conequences in some way
22:43 < EastByte> nvm :)
22:44 <@deen> yes, less annoying to read and write code
22:46 < EastByte> indeed^^
22:47 < eeeee> noo
22:48 < eeeee> holy shit how will you merge with anything
22:48 <@heinrich5991> deen: merge conflicts will appear everywhere...
22:51 < EastByte> when we really need to merge something huge, we can just fix the coding style before patching :)
22:51 < eeeee> that doesn't sound very wise
22:52 < eeeee> in any case you'd better use some automagic formatting fixer like clang-format
22:52 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: ask GreYFoX about this
22:53 <@heinrich5991> as long as TW development remains inactive, this will be fine
22:54 <@heinrich5991> but once patches hit, it's gonna be a lot of work
22:54 < EastByte> so forever?
22:54 <@heinrich5991> remember the time before 0.6? :)
22:55 < EastByte> yea, old coding style
22:55 <@heinrich5991> that was <=0.5.2
22:55 < EastByte> yes
22:56 < EastByte> hm there was a big merge by Oy iirc
22:57 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
22:59 < Learath2> +1 its a really bad idea to change coding style from upstream
23:00 < eeeee> force update to HEAD^ while it's not too late :P
23:01 < EastByte> deen: so, what are you gonna do?
23:01 <@deen> i was afk. you guys don't want the change?
23:02 <@heinrich5991> EastByte is at least indifferent, Learath2, eeeee and I however say that it's probably a bad idea
23:02 < EastByte> will lead into too much trouble I guess
23:02 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
23:02 <@deen> i don't think we'll ever merge with teeworlds again
23:02 <@deen> but ok
23:02 <@deen> hm, so if i revert it now does it cause trouble as well?^^
23:03 <@deen> or should i just hard-remove the commit and pretend it never was there :P
23:03 <@deen> ?
23:03  * eeeee votes for hard remove
23:03 < EastByte> do it HARD!
23:04 <@deen> done
23:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- force-pushed DDRace64 from df9ed2c to 7a5935d: http://git.io/-BwJ2w
23:04 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
23:09 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
23:10 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
23:10 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 316
23:10 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
23:10 <@deen> good player numbers tonight
23:10 <@deen> the tournament was great i think
23:11 < EastByte> yep
23:12 <@heinrich5991> my brother is talking about the ddnet tournament to me :)
23:13 < EastByte> what does he say? :)
23:15 <@heinrich5991> he likes it, he asked me whether I'll team up with him next tournament – had to say that I'm very bad at ddrace :)
23:15 < EastByte> the map was more like normal race
23:16 <@deen> and the next one, tomorrow, is solo with a dummy^^
23:21 <@heinrich5991> yea, asked me before the tournament was announced to be solo
23:21 <@heinrich5991> :)
23:22 < EastByte> deen: glc can't handle tw audio anymore :(
23:22 < EastByte> BeaR did bad things
23:25 < EastByte> oh my fault
23:26 <@deen> glc?
23:26 <@heinrich5991> glc?
23:26 < EastByte> it's a opengl recording tool
23:26 < EastByte> like fraps for linux
23:27 <@deen> ah, so it's your fault and everything is fine?
23:27 < EastByte> yep :)
23:27 <@deen> good
23:31 < EastByte> heinrich5991: https://eastbit.net/public/videos/rollercoaster.webm
23:31 < EastByte> if you wanna see the epic map
23:32 <@deen> ah, in demo viewer times don't show, instead there's just score numbers =/
23:33 < EastByte> hm yes
23:34 <@deen> nice video EastByte 
23:34 < EastByte> :)
23:34 < EastByte> hm the background looks a little bit too realistic
23:37 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
23:37 < laxa> !en-de People do we play again now ?
23:37 < Nimda> Translation: Menschen tun, die wir spielen jetzt schon wieder?
23:38 < EastByte> :D
23:38 < laxa> That's the only to catch the attention of all this people talking german on teamspeak :(
23:38 < laxa> only way*
23:38 < EastByte> laxa: use something like "Spielen wir erneut?"
23:38 < laxa> !de-en erneut
23:38 < Nimda> Translation: once again
23:39 <@deen> no, that was perfect german, use the nimda translation
23:39 < EastByte> but that's way too formal for gaming
23:39 < laxa> it's google translation, not nimda translation :p
23:39 < EastByte> xd
23:39 <@deen> laxa: only you and ms. fox don't speak german?
23:39 <@deen> ah, pause is there as well
23:39 < laxa> yeah
