00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> poor deen gets more and more work on his shoulders xd
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar ✪ deen is a legend!
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> he is
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Is there a way to change rcon console color / transperency of the background?
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Is there a way to change rcon console color / transparency of the background?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> <a:ismesad:758061540657201364>
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> change the .png file
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Yeah, managed to change the color atleast <a:isme:758048821946089572>
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> @deen give me a sec to fix the icon
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758269445004853308/Screenshot_2020-09-23-12-10-58-166_com.android.chrome.jpg
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The "Last Finishes" updates instantly, the lower ones every 30 min
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Epix shows in last finishes, but not in the finished maps on novice server - is that a bug, or just takes more time
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> thanks
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Since the calculation of your rank is kind of expensive
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it might take a few seconds to do it instantly for all maps someone has finished
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok, was just wondering
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Wollwolke  Thanks, fixed.
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu tested it again, takes 10-15 seconds to calculate all the info, a bit too slow:
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> select Server, Map, Points, (select min(Timestamp) from record_race where Map = record_maps.Map and Name = "deen") as FirstFinish, (select count(*) from record_race where Map = record_maps.Map and Name = "deen") as Finishes, (select min(Time) from record_race where Map = record_maps.Map and Name = "deen") as Time, (select count(distinct Name) + 1 from record_race where Map = record_maps.Map and Time < (select min(Time) from record_race where N
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Blade> Make home background a map showcase, nicest looking maps appear instead of the squares,  minecraft style I guess
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Blade> I had this idea for website background also
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @DR.3AM they are working on feature where you can set any map you want as background in menus
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Blade> Damn nice !!
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only i changed smth in the edtior recently?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> git log on the directory?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway its broken rn
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast for mind
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nvm he meant for the new streaming probably, but not the new dilate 😄
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> appearently same textures arent divisible by 16, that the editor uses
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah makes sense, bcs its just loading all textures as tileset too
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> appearently some textures arent divisible by 16, that the editor uses
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Q: I want to add 0.7 into the client version field, is that a bad idea?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't quite understand the question. which client version field?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the integer that the server keeps for each client?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or I'll add a `sixup` field to the status
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably okay. sixup to status would be nicer IMO
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you add it to the client version field, make sure it's a negative integer
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> RC has bug "only game layer rendering"
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/293493549758939136/757946207833292931/unknown.png
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is already a PR open for this I think
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fix is in the queue, thanks for the report
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean nightly build does not have this bug, should not we update RC ? Or am I missing smthing
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait, nightly doesnt?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea, I am confused. Pr is not merged?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2902 got merged, but I didn't think @deen rebuilt the nightly yet
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2902
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> idk, I just cant play on RC so I asked about updating RC to let me use it to normally play the game
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is the nightly built automatically? ^^
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay the point of a RC is that it might have bugs, it'll have less bugs than the nightly but you can't possibly expect it to be completely fine
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it was guaranteed to be completely fine, it wouldn't be a release candidate, it would be released 😄
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> sure, but we need time to test "updated" RC as well
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do we do the RC btw? it doesn't seem to be a branch
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my uninformed opinion says that rc doesn't bring anything new to the table
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we should just rename nightly to rc so that people feel it's more stable
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not sure its about "feeling"
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am ready to always play on RC`s but not on nightlies
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rc should have had a branch yeah the main difference is that rc should not get new features while we can freely add more to the nightly
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> if RC is really RC
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We need to adopt a more strict master branch policy if we want people to actually play on nightlies
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you imagine @Learath2?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the stuff that broke was stuff that didn't happen on dev's hardware, mno?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the stuff that broke was stuff that didn't happen on dev's hardware, no?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well RC doesn't catch those, but I don't think anything catches those
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we cached a big bug tho, the game layer only
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we are just far to relaxed with merging to master for master to be safe to play on
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc deen didnt want the branches cuz he doesnt want to deal with merge/cherry picks and conflicts
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I personally destroyed 5 configurations with my color patch while getting it right
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be good to have an example of how other open source games handle this
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill look at hedgewars
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont seem to do anything at all
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we want people playing on betas, the betas need to be things we are okay to release as is
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we don't want to bother with a RC, we should atleast make sure master is always at that state so the nightlies are useful as betas
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the rust project releases master builds as nightlies, and people do use them
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they have a better test suite though
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They have a massive test suite, we have no test suite
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> except for a couple unit tests
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have a "train schedule"
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it'd probs already help if all devs always rebase to the current state of master, maybe they find a bug here and there
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for anythiung else ddnet doesnt really have the manpower
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most ppl wont care about RC nor nightly
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why? I keep saying I am ready to subscribe to "DDNet pre-releases"
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1 /1000
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and u a dev too
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets be realistic, would u have found the skin prefix bug
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i forced spooky to install VS to find that bug
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he isnt even a programmer xd
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > 1 /1000
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar ✪ I dont know what this statistics comes from. But pre-releases would allow us to "show" game to small group of people to not affect everyone by critical/breaking stuff
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > 1 /1000
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar ✪ I dont know what this statistics comes from. But pre-releases would allow us to "show" game to small group of people first to not affect everyone by critical/breaking stuff
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> having new ddnet features earlier are good motivation to force people use it tho
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem is
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets say i create something.. then deen and heinrich test it, dont find any obvious bug, merge it
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now its completly broken for you, would u still call it not critical?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a nightly is actually the best
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nightly is too danger I am not gona use it
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually had a hunch prefixes were broken when I first reviewed that PR :/
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just couldn't put my finger on it though and I couldn't get it to break
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nightly is not more broken than rc
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs deen creates the RCs independent of testing
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if this RC is not buggy, its the next RC
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the thing is amount of people playing on the version. For single person there is no diff between nightly and RC
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I believe we can force people use pre-releases
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but with nightlies... I dont believe in nightlies
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean sure, sometimes i think about my prs afterwards and might find a bug a few weeks later
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but realistically, nightlies are never tested and get a RC, so the RC will be broken
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But RC is something we are willing to release as is
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't say the same thing about master at any given moment
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but do we have so many new features
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> indeed its some constant thing you can really test.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if we would make like 1 release every 2 months maybe
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Just count how many releases has just obvious dumb bugs...
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we just need some people to run it
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> instead of 5
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we just need some more people to run it (to smoke test it)
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just feel like, master merges are already mostly bug fixes
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so RCs wont really improve this
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok since steam release we had alot of features
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar ✪ I am saying about people who will use it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> that is the main concern
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes i understand this
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as deen said almost none use nightlies
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just dont see the positive things like u do xD
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> and I understand them
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes and nobody will use RC
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we have discord to force people
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> like "Hey! New features already there, use pre release! blahblahblah"
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i have mixed feelings about this
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this just delays bug fixes
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki the pr-15.0.5 is now the release branch
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd release 15.05 now, any complaints?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's fine, let's get the bugfixes in
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758344134020562974/hahameme.jpg
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we should only do a RC for larger releases?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In this case the RC found a bug, so it was good
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 1 day for testing RC?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (made with open source libre software gimp)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A RC would only be useful if we do back merges, which makes managing the project odd, no?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> are not you rushing with releases?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay This one just has bugfixes I think
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, so how long should we wait with a bugfix release until we can release?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can also create another rc2 and we restart the testing
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> master has this new untested pr tho <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/78040b31e514535139edc8f1c4ff0fcc7354f710>
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not releasing from master, I'm releasing from pr-15.0.5
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then ye looks fine
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do u have the new Don't rely on snapshot for ddnet gametype in?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758344859249016852/unknown.png
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2900>
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thought just bcs it said 9 h ago
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess that pr works and actually fixes the issue
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen we are not annoying you with these right? Not like we know any better, just testing new things to try reduce some of the issues we've been having with bugs and to encourage more testing
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> annoying me with what? rcs?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They are useful, so it's ok if I have to spend some effort to do them
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let me test if the fix works rly fast
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess the bigger worry is how many people are actually testing the rc. If I'm doing the work and no one tests, it's not very useful. (same as with nighlies atm)
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok looks like it works
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me u can release
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nightlies only devs really test, I always forward my master before doing any work
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For reference: rc1 was downloaded 8 times in total, but some IPs look so similar that they are probably the same person, so ~5 people tested
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I use steam pre releases
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i downloaded it
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and one of them was me xD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I was another one
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> louis and another one in bugs too
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in #bugs *
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen from the website?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you put it up on steam too?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Can we anounce next RC with instruction "how to use steam betas" maybe?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye it shows there
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but only today
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not about how to use steam betas, i think most ppl simply dont know there are other versions than what they get on steam by default
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea, that is why I ask to do so
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure how to see number of beta users on steam
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay sure
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well you can put an announcement in the ddnet servers like all the others we have
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> asking to help testing
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still most ppl wont care
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen announcing that a new release candidate is out on steam can also bring more testers
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that ofc requires work and time for every RC
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when are u downloading a RC of smth??
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs when a new feature was implemented u want to use
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u may want to get someone to hell u with "public relations"
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can have a template for that
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or whathever
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> offtopic: I would like to let steam always update my game to RCs if available. selecting "releasecadidates" in betas does exacly this?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> RC 15.0.5 is ready for testing and comments now. e.g.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hell -> help*
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the releasecandidates channel gets updated
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur game should get updated
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay yes
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the announcements in discord dont have a ping, so most ppl will probably not even notice it, what most servers do is create a role for the purpose of being tagged by that role
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they usually have a bot to manage that
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like subscribing to something
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe an opt out announcements role?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g a Map releases role would ping u
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every time a map is released
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should probably be opt in xD
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Many wouldn't opt-in though, would they
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> You won't know until you try doing that
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> RPCS3 just tags everyone for big releases
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758348044210012190/unknown.png
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> imo the idea with ping with new RC is out is really good idea
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> many ppl see the announcements tho
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still like nobody cared about nightlys and RC
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I honestly have #announcements muted because idc about map releases
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> announcements is the only not muted channel on this server for me xD
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Many wouldn't opt-in though, would they
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 many would just to have the role probs
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we Have new to introduce RC system
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we have news to introduce RC system
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> any bot to add/remove role based on reaction emote, and I'm in
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> even KoG has one like this
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ this server has nearly 2k ppl
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 500 online most of the time
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we just need to implement cool feature and delay with release, then people naturally will enable pre releases - easy
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758348526756429824/unknown.png
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well double that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but not everyone plays ddnet always
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> maybe you could just "borrow" their bot and adopt it with `ReleaseTester` role
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just for the possible ping
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there wont be always be a cool feature
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we shouldnt rely on that
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> About releases - Do them like in every Monday? unless there's hotfix needed?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> we just need an elegant way to let people know about it
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I mean, no release this Monday? np, expect in next Monday
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I would do releases based on amount of features, not timing
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we may have lot of things now
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but there are times where we do nothing
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyway, let's not overcomplicate things for now
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have RCs, we have them on Steam, next time I'll announce that. I'll also post a nice pic of the fancy background maps in start menu, then people want to try it out
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good idea xd
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758349445707726899/unknown.png
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sunday most productive day
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👀
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkey? 😄
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki can i get such insight for a person too, or just a repository
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on ur profile
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah, stats showed lots of players and I noticed some have ping > 100 on GER
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> New Steam downloads for last week
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758352943316467743/screenshot-20200923174330.png
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> wait what ? Germany is not even close to top of the list oO
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, Germany has lots of old players and on GER players from all of Europe
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also probably alot of ppl are leaving directly
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ hmm i cant seem to find it for users xd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki yeah nvm xD
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758353562786201680/unknown.png
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im not even github free user
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or that button is misleading
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> misleading iguess
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758354448824270848/unknown.png
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who should i give my account
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i die
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ur children
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Give it to me so I can cleanse it of all the shameful weeb stuff
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet they added this
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz corona
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen very constant

17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think he used his account to release maps automatically
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to git
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah xD
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> switched to its own account at some point
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but every day?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it was updating the votes.cfg every day i think
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> switched to only update when a new map is added/changes
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I could rewrite history to remove those changes, but then everyone who has ddnet-maps repo will be in pain
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or u create 1pr per day for a whole year and ppl will just think u onfire
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even tho u already come close to this anyway
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758357924724080660/unknown.png
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen no reason to rewrite the history
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im exactly 100 times lazier than deen xD

18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> how are you so inactive? Arent you contributing much to ddnet
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758359043378380850/Screenshot_2020-09-23_at_19.07.53.png
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have like 1-2 months per year where im onfire, rest im lazy
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All the larger chunks of inactivity is me just not even feeling like waking up
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758359351621976124/unknown.png
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u all have code review
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have 0% xd
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I dont even have this graph
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758359537882365963/unknown.png
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> show years
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @NeXus hm, couldn't find where you add it
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to know who has oldest account
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok probs learath
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what did u do there
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758359882986029066/unknown.png
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used to not use github intentionally and ran my own git server for many years
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mine is from 2014 i think
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758359943765819412/unknown.png
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice triangle
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :deIlluminati:
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so balanced
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i commit a lot to my repos
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i have 80% commit
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and less prs
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hate prs, thats why i try to only do big changes xD
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus do u make prs to ur own repos?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> no
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I'd guess that contribution in 2010 is the turkish translation for teeworlds 😄
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> old code from 2008 😄 https://github.com/def-/sxc
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah no, I didn't actually commit anything until 2011
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how old r u @deen
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on 2008 i was 8 years old
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> guess my year
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i was 12 xd
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ 30 I think
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I added logout to teeworlds and fixed a zoom issue in the ddrace client in as my first two contributions 😄
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "you think"
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with 18 already so active
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are u a cyborg deen
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how can u work so much
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .cxx extension looks so ugly tho
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oooh, my old website on sourceforge is also still around: http://ajaxwm.sourceforge.net/
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hackerman
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found u
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did sourceforge always made u wait 5 seconds to download?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so annoying
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDDDDD
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> http://ajaxwm.sourceforge.net/img/screen1.png
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hasslich ok
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hässlich
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ajaxwm, heh
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who would have thought deen did javascript in the past xd
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thought he hated it
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this is the reason?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but he already did c++ in 2008
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i started with c++, there already was c++11 xd
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did we change the UI again btw?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758362317661536346/Screenshot_2020-09-23_at_19.20.41.png
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was cleaned up
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw, I liked the darker background for the bottom filter part
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > Did we change the UI again btw?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2880
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also observe how cute the curves look on a highdpi display 😄
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like it darker too, but honestly this is still better then the white before
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like it darker too, but honestly this is still better than the white before
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> generally, white text  + white interface
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so ugly xd
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758363228148465785/unknown.png
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i honestly wonder why this failed soooo hard
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean not even close
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People like curves I guess
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but every modern GUI does not use round edges anymore
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well people here have a liking to the status quo
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not enough space here again, ddnet's growing too fast :D
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758363642567196802/unknown.png
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Observe any tiny change we have tried to do over the years
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> WTF
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i already increased it to 5 flags per row
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but there are like 4 new servers
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we should just make it scrollable xD
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else its too annoying xD
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the topic of scrolling, would anyone be interested in porting `CScrollRegion` from 0.7?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> People don't like totally square UI, but I guess making the rounded corners smaller would gain greater approval
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ Depends. Google's Material Design is gaining popularity and is has slightly rounded corners by default - they have started allowing customisation lately though
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://material.io/design/shape/about-shape.html#components-and-shape
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah less round sounds already good
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its also not that round edges are always horrible
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for example selecting a server in the server browser the white selection color is rounded too
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that looks just bad
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the rounded corners in the client are just a bit too round imo
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ yea
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie Maybe you'd do another sketch of how UI could possibly look, like you did with the start screen? ^^
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> idk there's way too much stuff to begin with, it's a mess
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie dont want to annoy u but have u tested the editor
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you mean that it looks sharper and not buggy?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes in my pr
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/1155561482
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah sry not about sharpness
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> about the new renderer
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for the editor
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it looks like ingame
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the sharpness will be fixed too
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah it looks like in game without the lod -100 fix
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it should look perfect if it gets the same treatment
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no i mean it uses 3d textures now for the editor too
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so all tiles are displayed like ingame 😄
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah I noticed
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's exactly like in game but without the blur fix
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah the blue fix is a new pr
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that will effect everything
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even weapons
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> every texture in the game will be sharper
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you're making my dreams come true
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/1155687243
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can test it here
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> weapons look a little too sharp, but I'm guessing it's either this or the blur
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i was thinking about the problem the whole night
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and came to the conclusion that a bias always makes sense like this
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even in 3D
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'll need to make a map with all weapons to compare, sec
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sure
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the laser looks the most pixelly definitely
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix did you write a 3D game or tested some 3D game engine, i don't really get away from thinking that trilinear filtering without bias just decreases the image quality, bcs it uses too much of the worse resolution mipmap
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> shotgun is still a little blurry but before it was a complete mess
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i only did the server part and that was in python. my friend did the js client
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its also about subpixels @Ravie
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it wont be perfect ever
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah I thought so
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's either sharp and 'jittery' when it moves or blurry interpolation
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, whose idea was it @deen?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's rather cute
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah noticed that too ravie, especially when u rotate ur weapon ingame
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure, it was actually an official graded high school project that we did because we couldn't ssh out of the school network 😄
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is it not possible to give them some subtle antialiasing or so?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix to tell you what i mean:
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets say the driver calculated mipmap 0.5
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it would use linear filtering from both mipmaps
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> while linear interpolation from mipmap 0(higher res) would be more than enough
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it decreases the quality of that pixel
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> somehow only the laser looks like it's shaking (when it's placed on a map, not in your hand)
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Jupstar ✪ nope, but the consent from several forum posts on the internet seems to be, that trilinear has better quailty than bilinear for mipmaps in average.
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> But for 0.6 the driver would use the lower res, which looks worse imo
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie possible that the texture coordinates of one of them arent really correct tho 😄
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @redix yes trilinear with bias looks amazing
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> in ddnet it's just unlucky that the driver uses level 1 for 1080p 😄
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> trilinear biased
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758377083461435423/Screenshot_20200923_190910.png

19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758377222230507589/Screenshot_20200923_190115.png
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if im much closer it looks worse
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh mathmatically that would make sense, just bcs linear filtering already uses 4pixels, so if u very close to a lower res mipmap, it should still mostly sample from high mipmap
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ✪ yeah it sucks that all images in teeworlds are scaled in a different way and not preserve the proportions they have in the .png's
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i want to fix this some day
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its alot of work
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so you get stuff like all weapons scaled in a different way, even individual parts of a tee
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont like that you cannot use any resolution u want
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and different scaling means different interpolation/blur
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but if you wanna fix this and keep the ingame sizes how they are then you need to rework all images in the game
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno the weapons should stay the same, except you already use a different resolution.. maybe 1-2pixels off
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> quads in the editor is smth different
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont use texel offsets at all
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if im not mistaken, they should be around 1 pixel bigger in total
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0.5 texels on each side
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok but streched to the whole image
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe less than 1 pixel xd
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hard to say, would need to think about it xd
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean this
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758379289308692511/unknown.png
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> on the left in game, on the right straight from game.png
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf are they not scaled the same
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> grenades have the same size
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and this leads to different amounts of blur
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's like this on all images in tw
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess the worst example is tee feet
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they look like they can all be 1:1 cept ninja
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait are that map entities?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe they are scaled different anyway
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Betz@lel-$h@l0m> in ninja game.png is smaller then the game
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we are talking about the ninja u will grap??
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like u see it on the map
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs its just scaled a bit too look bigger
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah those are the weapon pick-ups in game
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> imo they should have their size adjusted in the .png tho so they get scaled the same in game
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but tw be tw
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes :D, thats a different story then
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but generally, do you think the bias is ok @Ravie ?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> bias = how sharp it is?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it could be a bit less sharp, just how in the other version -1000 was too sharp but -100 perfect
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> btw
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758381012748206132/unknown.png
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> -100 should be like 0 in this case
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it always uses the nearest mipmap
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it looks different with -500 than with -100 then -100 is equal to 0 too
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (not for all textures)
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a bias... its applied on what the GPU calculates
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so tiles might look blurry
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well I have no idea what wizardry this is but -100 is simply much sharper than 0
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 0
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758382468495310868/screenshot_2020-09-23_19-37-46.png
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> -100
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758382492456583189/screenshot_2020-09-23_19-38-01.png
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well as said, some textures might already be affected
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if u have 1920x980 pixels, u might get the old result with -100 only
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> -500 is like a safe bet
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but will affect more textures
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> basically all textures will look sharper
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think I tried -500 as well, but then picked the lowest value that didn't look blurry
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> cause too sharp is also not nice
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can u give -500 in that pic
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. your weapon looks the same
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so -100 wasnt enough for that
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758383121078026240/screenshot_2020-09-23_19-43-31.png
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the screenshot doesn't say much, but when moving the camera around slowly the tile edges are a bit more jittery
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh u 100% sure?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it chooses the nearest mipmap rest is same
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if -100 looks different already -500 won't choose an even higher mipmap
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should be the same for tiles
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well I don't know, -100 just looks softer
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but not blurry
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i couldnt understand why
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also -100 has much less distortion when zooming
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its like not possible xD
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> like on zoom -1 it goes into blurry mode but when zooming it's good
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> default zoom is perfect tho
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, i understand why this happens
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just not why it should look worse
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sharper yes, but there is still linear interpolation happening
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ok actually maybe -500 looks the same as -100 on default
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but on some zoom levels this happens
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758383944520564756/screenshot_2020-09-23_19-46-48.png
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but shouldnt that have happened in ddnet 14 with old gl 3.3 too?
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> with -500 it onlly seems to happen at one certain zoom level, with -1000 a lot more and with -100 not at all
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah I would have noticed
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean it could be a very small difference
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the problem with floating points
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah the old one was always just perfect
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe -450 is already ok, even if its just 0.05 less xD
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I can try xD
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll try too
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> still happens
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> somehow -100 just goes into the blurry mode after even just 1 zoom out
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> like it's -1000 on default zoom and 0 when zooming
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but in this case the blur is desirable, it makes the tiles not look pixelly and bad
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah.. the problem is its also about the drivers impl, i try too with -500, zoomlevel 1 and it looks fine
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on full hd
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah on default zoom they're pretty much all good except 0
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> need to test a bit cant tell rn
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> do you need some gpu specs of my crappy laptop? does that help?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nah its ok 😄
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it could also be that i dont notice it bcs higher refresh rate monitor, so doesnt matter
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't think the refresh rate matters for a static image
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but maybe it's high res enough that you can't tell
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, i can reproduce that it takes a higher mipmap like u said
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the best would probs be trilinear filtering
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it would use a tiny bit of the lower quality already
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> biased trilinear, also best for 3d
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie can u compile stuff?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> oh, this DDNet x.x.x is out so annoying for me
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> icon in up-right corner would be better imo
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what version u using btw
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> im about screenshot in #announcements :kek:
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i think its fine there
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> not at all...
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes at all...
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> those buttons in down-left corner also "knock out"
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ...
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no...
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758392924995715192/unknown.png
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> make pr and fix it xd
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> don't make PR and don't fix it, wait for redesign idea by Ravie
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :bluekitty:
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> (I hope anyone will code it someday)
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I like this version better
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But if you can change my mind on this very subjective thing, I'll code it
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758395725960446011/92647569-5de75e80-f2e8-11ea-8aee-d0a97729fe16.png
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> news on left play buttons in mid
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> omg right side player stats
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but news need more space
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> eh
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rather have buttons in middle
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> else looks jank
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks good imo
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> if even I'd be for possible switch whether buttons are on left or right, and that's it, perfect one
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pls get designer soreu
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> on the right side maybe show the playername and skin and points
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and maybe like "5 friends online" or idk
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ it's Ravie's concept
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ravie pls get designer xd
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this bnut with map background

20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm actually is cuter than I remember
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Hmm, you're writing things are cute lately
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yo, @BannZay wanna code that look?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki oh yeah
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like the word cute, is there a problem with that?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The word cute is cute
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> make some cute code <a:woagcat:612700712693923892>
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> かわいいね
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh no
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nope, that's a cute change
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ugly code is sad
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he turned weeb :tear:
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the saddest thing ever
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my code is cute
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i defend my cute code with rudeness
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki what about mine
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur is ugly
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like u
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wtf!!!
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :justatest:
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jao vs Ryozuki cage fight when?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao the only cute thing is @DDNet
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :poggers:

20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie i dunno if trilinear will be enough, if you look very closely you'll see that trilinear is a tiny bit blurrier, i will just add the commit then you can test it

21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> looks really good in this one
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > yo, @BannZay wanna code that look?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Soreu no, its kinda the same. I better work on something significant. And I don't like news being in the middle either
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> q.q
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It's not the same. It's significant first impression for any newcomer
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it's the heart of the client, given to you on an open hand on first sight, creating an everlasting memory which you will remind again and again with ever next launch of the client
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> whether you send smile emote to a friend in the server you will see the startup page, because that's where you have clicked the Play button which started it all
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :justatest:
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> whenever you send smile emote*
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> jungle night will carry hard
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just such an awesome background map
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> standard bg forever
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imagine you open the game, have such a nice background, and maybe a nicer menu
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758420223127977994/screenshot_2020-09-23_22-10-43.png

22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yet @BannZay doesn't see its depth
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ddnet: 0.7 sux
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also ddnet: let's copy everything from 0.7
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just the menu
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean ravies menu has more style for sure
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> GO IMPLEMENT IT
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the 0.7 menu doesn't really work here imo
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> with all the ddnet things added to it
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and that offcenter update message xD
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think the images are the ugliest
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont fit the background map
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Do vote if people would prefer Ravie's menu style & additional box to see at start if any friend is online? :troll:
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that's what the little window on the right could be for
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> either that or player stats
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the update thing shouldnt be visible for steam
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and for autoconf it doesnt really matter, bcs u should update anyway xd
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does steam show if update is available? probs not
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anymore xd
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> autoconf  lmao
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ u live in the past
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why does it show me that its updated then
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without a download box
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont have autoconf
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but why does it even tell me the new version is out xd
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Ryozuki u live in the future
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i live with cmake
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> where catalandia has independence
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> by sooĺ ravie
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> by solo ravie
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ i think in cmake we turned off autoupdater by default now
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that escalated quickly xd
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was just joking cuz u mentioned autoconf
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki yes
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it clearly shows an update(NOT DOWNLOADABLE)
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok maybe it cached it somewhere
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so doesnt matter
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen will know
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Hey guys I am having a problem with ddnet right now. For the past 2 days, my frame rate has been horrid, and I don't know why. It's never been like this before. I have all of the extra graphics and other settings off, and I turned off download skins too, as someone suggested. 
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> 
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> So, two questions:
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> 1. Does anyone remember the bind to see your packages sent and fps and ping in the top let corner? I used to know it when I used the teeworlds client years ago, but I forgot it.
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> left*
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yes, steam versino shows update available, but no update button
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can we just not display it on steam maybe?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> 2. And is this a problem with ddnet or a problem with my computer? This has never happened before so I don't know.
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do u want it
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> With another special casing for steam?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just not show it at all else
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because we showed it for mac osx, since it doesn't have an autoupdater
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> idc
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i dunno
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @banana man even in the newest version?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @banana man ctrl-shift-d
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Thanks deen, and yes, I believe I am on the newest version Jupstar. Unless there's a newer update than the one a few days ago
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try 15.0.5 just in case
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no need hunting after bugs we fixed already
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Ok, do I update in Steam? I can't find a way to update it
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you restart steam it should auto-update
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it also shows the current version bottom right
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but if you have steam it should be most recent version actually
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> How do I check what version I'm on?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> f1, top right
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> ah 15.0.5
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> That's the one I'm on
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> other games work fine?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vasten100> which autoexec_server.cfg does the ingame launch server button look at? (im on steam version and the one in steamapps/common/DDraceNetwork/ddnet doesn't get selected
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it uses the one from config_directory first
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> let me check @deen
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen what changed in the sdl built btw?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> something that could affect anything?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah nvm its not in the current version yet right?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only the IME stuff: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-lib-update.sh#L144
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and yes, not in 15.0.5
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Yes @deen everything appears fine with other games
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vasten100> > it uses the one from config_directory first
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vasten100> @deen k thx
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @banana man just a few things:
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> older version worked fine?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what OS?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> new pc, old pc?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Also got the thing fixed with my wifi, I'm getting 50 MB now
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Old version worked fine, just yesterday and today it started happening. Windows 10. Newer PC, but I do need to check the hard drive soon. Only thing I can think that may be wrong with my PC
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well could always be a driver issue sure
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> 8 gigs ram, 440 gig hard drive. s500CA Asus, so not too old
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> driver or hard drive?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> normally the harddrive isnt used ingame, except for demo recording maybe, u can try turn it off
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u updated any driver or was there a windows update
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ur pc is fine for sure
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Hmm, haven't updated a driver in 4 months, I updated all at that time. I'll have to check if there was a Windows update, they love to sneak those in
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Last update was 9/9/2020, and that was a minor one. It's telling me I need to update now, but I don't update until I hear from the community that it's not a complete load of crap update, which is usually 50/50 XD
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can try rightclick your windows icon, then go over shutdown->restart
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that makes a clean windows restart
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its different from just restarting with the shutdown button
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> That's what I do every night
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Oh right click?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://home.bt.com/images/Start-menu-secrets-01.jpg-136399782088602601
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like this
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> That's different from left clicking and hitting restart?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Hmm, never heard of that. I'll try it
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> never heard of it too lol
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast on older windows 10 version it was like that xD
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> welp that fixed it
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Jupstar the magician
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe windows should do RC xdd
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh nice map background is in
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to all mappers
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use these tiles to get the map camera at a specific map position:
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6654924/93640516-fffafb00-f9fa-11ea-8154-010ee5630c76.png
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can get the positions from
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> src/game/client/components/menu_background.h
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mappers will start caring when we create the RC probably
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just wanted to post it here, so they'll know
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or atleast few ppl know
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that i dont need to tell them xd
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i dont need to tell them xd
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen do u want to rebase?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or should i
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can do it
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ additional info like IDs 35-43 & 51-59 would be better than just image, because it took me way too long to figure which ones do you mean xd
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no sry
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> all 25 work
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1-25
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just couldnt select all xD
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also, why CP1 to.... oh, ok, that makes it way nicer
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then just Checkpoint entities to set position, idk what it even means, but sounds like nice feature
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the backgroiund map camera moves when u click
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oooh
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah u'll see 😄
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but it won't move if no CP / only CP1 will be used?
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it will use default values then
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i jjust wanted the possibility for the mappers to control the camera
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so they can say ok ddnet tab is here, kog tab here
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Now that sounds like I start to really love your ideas
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> can't wait to test it
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu You can grab the artifact from here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/1157416621 or wait for the nightly next morning
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I have to wait until end of tomorrow's work anyway
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :c
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but thanks
