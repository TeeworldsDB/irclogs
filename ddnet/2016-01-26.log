14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> helloooo
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
14:57 < Sadale> just wait. you'll eventually get an answer if someone can answer you.
14:58 < Sadale> and you won't get the answer quicker by spaming here. Most of us keep silent because we don't know why.
15:01 < Sadale> BTW, expect to wait at least a few hours for an answer. IRC is a slow-paced world. In case you can't get an answer, maybe ask again tomorrow. If you still can't get an answer, it means that no one here can answer you. Then you should consider asking elsewhere.
15:09 <+o_be_one> Sadale: because we don't know why x) ?! Just to not feed trolls :p
15:09 < Sadale> o_be_one, well, apparently he's new here.
15:09 <+o_be_one> yes i've helped him yesterday, was ok
15:10 <+o_be_one> long time i havent read deen or EastByte 
15:10 <+o_be_one> are they alive :D ?
15:11 < Sadale> They won't beat certain user in another channel. He was an op. He had left for a year plus 15 weeks.
15:11 < Sadale> No one know why. No one can contact him. :p
15:12 < Hamid_Jigool> hello dear o_be_one 
15:12 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
15:12 <+o_be_one> Sadale: you talk about who ?
15:12 <+o_be_one> hello Hamid_Jigool 
15:12 < Sadale> Then the wikia page of that channel lists that use as an op. With a bracket saying "RIP"
15:12 < Sadale> o_be_one, another user in another network :P
15:12 < Sadale> you won't know who he is :P
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: i have a problem... when i type /points show me i have not any point so far... but when i type /rank show me my recored.. whats use of /points? :D
15:22 <@EastByte> the point system isn't related to the records, for each map you can specify a number of points which the players gain on map finish. ()
15:23 <@EastByte> oh hello Sadale 
15:23 < Hamid_Jigool> aha
15:23 <@EastByte> SushiTee: *
15:23 < Sadale> EastByte, hi! :3
15:23 < Sadale> oh :(
15:23 < Sadale> EastByte, I hate you now. baka! >///<
15:23 < SushiTee> hi EastByte
15:24 <+o_be_one> hey EastByte :)
15:24 <+o_be_one> you have time to see why ger2 doesnt work ?
15:26 <@EastByte> o_be_one: so ovh is still randomly blocking traffic?
15:31 <+o_be_one> EastByte: maybe a config issue cause i've no problem on same host with other servers like Ark or 7 Days to Die ..
15:35 <@EastByte> does the problem also exist when you are hosting tw servers outside of lxc?
15:38 <+o_be_one> on the same host ive TW in LXC
15:38 <+o_be_one> no problem
15:38 <+o_be_one> i think its eu2.r0x.tw
15:38 <+o_be_one> yes, its eu2
15:40 <@EastByte> any difference in the firewall configuration or setup of lxc?
15:52 <+o_be_one> no iirc i've open firewall for ger2
15:53 <+o_be_one> full open, no rules, not like for my services :p
15:53 <@deen> "ssh ger2.ddnet.tw" takes a few minutes for me
15:54 <@EastByte> then configure it exactly the way eu2.r0x.tw is configured
15:55 <@EastByte> WolfAlex told me the game firewall will block udp by default if no rule is configured
15:56 <@EastByte> could anyone try 51.254.92.231:8303 ?
15:57 <@deen> works
15:57 <@deen> but who said udp doesn't work?
15:58 <@deen> my problems were that ssh is buggy (takes 2 min to connect, disconnects after 30 min) and ddos attacks take down the servers easily
15:58 <+o_be_one> EastByte: you can tell game firewall to dont filter by desactiving, i did that for ger2. Well let me log in my account i'll check that
15:58 <@EastByte> so the problem that people cannot connect doesn't exist anymore?
15:58 <@deen> maybe i just forgot about it^^
15:59 <+o_be_one> well about ddos, without game firewall, thats normal ...
15:59 <+o_be_one> WolfAlex runs game firewall :/
15:59 <@deen> i know it's normal, but for DDNet it's normal to get DDoSed all day
15:59 <+o_be_one> and all my servers on this host use game firewall
15:59 <+o_be_one> no one get ddos ...
15:59 <+o_be_one> don't forget i was ddosed before ddnet exists :D
16:00 <+o_be_one> and i'm ddosed everyday too, less actually just cause rafael is doing all what i do
16:00 <+o_be_one> (he hosts what i host)
16:01 <+o_be_one> anyway i'm logged in
16:01 <+o_be_one> deen: you want game firewall ? what port i must open ?
16:02 <@EastByte> use some portrange like 8000 - 8100
16:02 <@EastByte> oh wait
16:02 <@EastByte> 8300 - 8400
16:02 <+o_be_one> ok my fault i see that game firewall is enabled but is opened for 8000 to 9000
16:02 <@deen> what does "opened" mean
16:03 <+o_be_one> what port you need to let players connect ...
16:03 <@EastByte> he is talking about game filter being enabled on that port
16:03 <+o_be_one> 8000-9000 : allowing connections
16:03 <+o_be_one> its the actual state
16:03 <+o_be_one> (8000 to 9000, UDP, i mean)
16:04 <+o_be_one> there's not TCP rule, it's full open
16:05 <@EastByte> and what does allowing connections mean? I thought you need to select a specifig game
16:06 < Hamid_Jigool> hi again my friends :D
16:06 <@deen> hi Hamid_Jigool 
16:07 < Hamid_Jigool> exuse me ... anybody have TeeBall Mod on linux amd64
16:07 < Hamid_Jigool> hi dear deen 
16:07 < Hamid_Jigool> deen: actualy i run a DDnet Sql by o_be_one help :P
16:08 <@deen> cool
16:09 <@deen> as I remember it was difficult to find the teeball mod. we only run the foot one from here I think: https://github.com/GreYFoX/teeworlds/tree/teefoot
16:09 < Hamid_Jigool> i run TeeBall on windows binary before .. but now i have linux Ubuntu 15
16:10 < Hamid_Jigool> deen: this is TeeFoot... its need a patch to convert TeeBall... TeeBall have sv_keepball
16:10 < Hamid_Jigool> keep time ball
16:10 < Hamid_Jigool> for vollyball and tenis
16:10 <@deen> well, the patch links don't work for me anymore
16:11 < Hamid_Jigool> yees :-( .. but in last year fun elephant website had linux and windows binary
16:11 < Hamid_Jigool> but now its lost
16:13 < Hamid_Jigool> i must creat a TeeBall :-?? 
16:13 < Hamid_Jigool> omm
16:18 <+o_be_one> EastByte: the game firewall has no "TeeWorlds" profile
16:18 <+o_be_one> so we select "other"
16:19 <@EastByte> okay, that's what I wanted to know
16:19 <+o_be_one> i think the other profile is like a really small filter
16:21 <@EastByte> well, might also be some kind of smart filter which tries to analyse the game protocol in order to track connections
16:24 <+o_be_one> mmh
16:24 <+o_be_one> we have to find why it blocks, i can host on other host but without game filter, so about ddos it will not be the best
16:30 <@EastByte> well and the problem with ssh is pretty strange
16:30 <@EastByte> looks like in the initiation process of an ssh session there is packet-loss
16:31 <@deen> oh yeah, it's not just ssh, the serverstatus for https://ddnet.tw/status/ also failed every day or so
16:31 <@deen> and couldn't reconnect
16:32 <+o_be_one> [M#??on the status page i cant see ger2
16:32 <@deen> yes, because i'm not running any servers on it anymore since it turned out to have so many problems
16:32 <@deen> RUS currently has similar problems btw
16:32 <@deen> can't connect over ssh to RUS, serverstatus stopped working, but ingame it keeps working
16:33 <@deen> and I know on RUS this is usually related to the DDoS protection firing up
16:34 <+o_be_one> ok
16:35 < Hamid_Jigool> Fucking DDos... in IRAN DDos like drink water :(  
16:35 <@EastByte> I don't get that comparison
16:35 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: i know, that's why we can't have a DDNet Persian server anymore :/ Was our most popular server after GER
16:35 < fstd> he means they drink their water real fast in iran
16:36 < Hamid_Jigool> fstd: actually yes :D
16:37 < Hamid_Jigool> a new method has been related for OVH DDos... this method of DDos can Fuck OVH Servers... you know? 
16:41 < Hamid_Jigool> o im sorry im drop
16:42 <+o_be_one> how Hamid_Jigool ?
16:42 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: how what?
16:42 <+o_be_one> EastByte: its like same config for ger2 and rafael blmapv3royal :/
16:42 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: how they can ddost and fuck ovh servers ?
16:43 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: some website give people DDos method that you can buy them by paypal or bitcoint
16:44 <+o_be_one> EastByte: the only difference is that he has the network firewall configured to open game udp ports, and block all
16:44 <+o_be_one> (no ssh port open Oo)
16:44 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: oh, ok
16:44 < Hamid_Jigool> any firewall cant block heavy DDos
16:45 <+o_be_one> it depends on how many bandwith it can handle, and how the algorithm is made
16:45 <@EastByte> o_be_one: you shouldn't share private information about anti ddos/firewall configuration in a public channel
16:46 <+o_be_one> EastByte: all informations are available on all ports scanners -_- ..
16:46 < Hamid_Jigool> DDos on heavy method supported 30-100 ip and server that attack to your server
16:47 <+o_be_one> deen: you got connection issue ingame too or it was just the monitoring who got dropped ?
16:47 < Hamid_Jigool> firewall can block 1 or 2 or 3 or 10 ip but when its going to 100 or higher than ... Booooommm... server has been fucked :(
16:47 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: no, it doesnt work like that ..
16:47 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: it depends on how big is your hardware too, btw
16:48 <+o_be_one> at OVH, firewall network doesnt depend on your dedicated server, so if OVH can handle ddos, no problem for your dedi
16:49 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: give me some test ip of OVH
16:50 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: i buy an OVH server for myself now :P
16:52 <+o_be_one> it seems that eu2 is not visible too
16:52 <+o_be_one> thats weird
16:52 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: the problem is if you want to host iran player, they'll just lag
16:54 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: yee.. i have some turkish and russen friends ... i use some IRAN VPN that change my ip and my ping in OVH going low :P
16:55 <+o_be_one> oh ...
16:55 <+o_be_one> normal
16:55 <+o_be_one> OVH is only in Canada and France :/
16:55 < Hamid_Jigool> but have good ping for all people :D
16:56 < Hamid_Jigool> my ping in OVH is 130
16:56 <+o_be_one> not bad
16:56 < Hamid_Jigool> its good for play :D
16:56 <+o_be_one> when i play in France from Canada, i have 100 to 140 ping
16:56 <+o_be_one> (i use VPN too, i dont trust TW admins)
16:57 < Hamid_Jigool> its good for Tee.. i play with this ping and have not problem with it
16:57 <@deen> o_be_one: monitoring
16:59 <@EastByte> Hamid_Jigool: so what about hosting/playing in the intranet you mentioned? How are the pings for other players? 
16:59 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna start a Football tournoment on Tee between German players and Iranian Players... is it good idea? :d
17:01 < Hamid_Jigool> EastByte: i have intranet host too.. its for other iranian people 
17:01 < WolfAlex> <o_be_one> and i'm ddosed everyday too, less actually just cause rafael is doing all what i do
17:01 < WolfAlex> <o_be_one> (he hosts what i host)
17:02 < WolfAlex> rafa is hosting @my host, and i've told him to not attack anyone, if you have proves, that he is attacking you, please give them to me
17:28 <+o_be_one> deen: is your monitoring only use the game udp port ?
17:29 <+o_be_one> WolfAlex: i was saying that he hosts what i host, not that he's attaks, but now you talk about that, we got things that show that its possible that he attaks my servers yes, i'll try to catch "proof".
17:33 <+o_be_one> but, its just expectation atm, we are investigating :)
17:33 <+o_be_one> to let you know, we got ddos just after rafael pepe server opened. It's not the first time things go like that.
17:46 < L337_SavagePRO> Need someone to talk who is responsible for the root/servers.
17:47 <@EastByte> talk to me!
17:47 < L337_SavagePRO> private, please
17:47 <@EastByte> so, what chat program do you prefer?
17:48 <@EastByte> isn't an irc query private enough?
17:50 <@deen> o_be_one: no, it runs over tcp: https://github.com/BotoX/ServerStatus
17:51 <+o_be_one> mmh TCP is open but you have issues with it
17:52 <@EastByte> really weird issues probably worth contacting the support
17:52 <@EastByte> (although the support will respond weeks delayed and cannot help anyway)
17:53 <+o_be_one> i'm the support :D
17:53 <+o_be_one> i confirm that ssh connection take time for me too
17:54 <+o_be_one> its like an issue with dns resolve
18:04 <@EastByte> It's not a problem with dns though
18:04 <@EastByte> Just analyse the traffic in wireshark and you will see a lot of tcp errors
18:10 <+o_be_one> interesting
18:10 <+o_be_one> EastByte: you did it already no ? what kind of errors you see ?
18:23 <@EastByte> tcp out-of-order, duplicate and there clearly is packet-loss
18:23 <@EastByte> I'm not experienced with tcp though
18:32 <+o_be_one> running DDNet in a Remote Desktop from RunAbove ahah x)
18:32 <+o_be_one> ok EastByte i'm trying with my serv too
18:32 <+o_be_one> just i'm installing the servstatus before lol ..
18:33 <@EastByte> do you have similar problems with RunAbove?
18:33 <+o_be_one> the previous ddnet can was on runabove
18:33 <+o_be_one> and it worked perfectly, just a little weak against ddos
18:38 <+o_be_one> lel .. http://screen.obeone.fr/sc_16-01-26_12-39.png
18:39 <+o_be_one> the test is not good ahah
18:40 <@EastByte> I've no idea what you are trying to do
18:44 <+o_be_one> i just wanted to list all servers to see visibility of eu2
18:44 <+o_be_one> and ger2
18:44 <+o_be_one> but with a remote computer that have never tried to ssh the host
18:45 <@EastByte> hm that might be a bit difficult this way
18:45 <@EastByte> why don't you use an ovh vpn instead?
18:53 < Para__> hi, jemand anwesend?
18:54 < L337_SavagePRO> hellou
18:55 < Para__> hola
18:55 < L337_SavagePRO> how are you?
18:55 < Para__> fine, wbu?
18:56 < L337_SavagePRO> too
18:57 <+o_be_one> EastByte: yes i'll try this at home
18:57 <+o_be_one> i lost ssh connection on idle too
19:10 <+o_be_one> lol botox client code ... 
19:10 <+o_be_one>     rm -f /tmp/fuckbash
19:16 <+o_be_one> ok http://149.202.166.56/stats/
19:17 <+o_be_one> we'll see if it get down
19:17 <+o_be_one> deen when down happened ?
19:17 <+o_be_one> with status
19:24 <@EastByte> look at the ddnet status and you will see
19:26 <@EastByte> but 149.202.166.56 and eu2.r0x.tw both are running at ovh so the connection between them might not be affected by ddos protection
19:26 <@EastByte> you will probably never notice your server being down from inside of the ovh network
19:27 <+o_be_one> you right
19:28 <+o_be_one> mmmh but ddnet.tw is hosted at ovh no ?
19:28 <+o_be_one> yes it is, is the serverstatus at ovh too EastByte ?
19:29 <@EastByte> website and ger2 are at ovh and we already noticed connection problem inbetween, so yea
19:30 <+o_be_one> ok i prefer to have same config to see
19:30 <+o_be_one> AHAH BotoX is so funny, really
19:31 <+o_be_one> html source from indeX.html : <strong>Enable JavaScript</strong> you fucking autist neckbeard, it's not gonna hurt you.
19:43 <+o_be_one> how you removed ipv6 status ?
19:43 <+o_be_one> or hide
19:44 <+o_be_one> checked sources and havent found the way you did this
21:13 < Ryozuki> Hi
21:13 < Ryozuki> you already saw that chile and ru is down?
21:13 < Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/status/
21:14 < Ryozuki> mhmm
21:14 < Ryozuki> but it is not down?
21:14 < Ryozuki> :s
21:36 <@deen> Well, RUS is unreachable over TCP, but works over UDP
21:36 <@deen> Chile is down rather often unfortunately, not sure what's up this time
21:50 <@deen> ok, this time the entire Chile hoster is down
