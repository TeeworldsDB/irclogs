03:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if apng is still being developed
06:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh it only shows afk friends as brown.. I think we can have some markings on the server info tab even if they're not your friend

10:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Common ms L
11:54 < bridge> <smetanolub> can you guys add custom flags download from community like for skins?
11:59 < bridge> <kebscs> this was discussed before and its not something people want
14:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want gay flage
16:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rainbow flag would be amazing
16:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think all flags in uncidoe should be added
16:46 < bridge> <teero777> they are called country flags.
16:46 < bridge> <teero777> not anything else
16:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> h8r
16:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we got 32 bits and we only use 9.96 of them
16:47 < bridge> <always> as a country?
16:47 < bridge> <always> or a ski
16:47 < bridge> <always> or a skin
16:48 < bridge> <always> its called player_country in the config
16:48 < bridge> <always> would have to be renamed to player_flag
16:48 < bridge> <always> and break configs
16:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its only used for their coutnry flag tho
16:48 < bridge> <always> i think gay flag skins would be fine
16:49 < bridge> <always> like the country ones we have
16:49 < bridge> <always> someone just gotta make irt
16:49 < bridge> <always> someone just gotta make ity
16:49 < bridge> <always> someone just gotta make it
16:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no ones stopping me from adding extra flags to tclient

17:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah yes i am the proud creator of a checkerboard
17:52 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Congrats on owning the checkerboard!!!
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hte modern seo
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like half of them are selling things called "cherkerboard svg"
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i found a not checkerboard generator, and to get it to produce a checkerboard y ou have to "go pro"
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i found lots of pngs, and sign up to download
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i had to scroll
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to get an svg

19:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> epic shading
19:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oke
19:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> is heinorich back?
19:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> seems liek it
19:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> I just saw one of his 3 months old prs being merged in some random github repo D:
19:23 < bridge> <vahemaaa> wouldnt they get bullied by LGBTQ+phobic players
19:24 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> people get bullied for all sorts of reasons in this game
19:24 < bridge> <vahemaaa> sadly
19:24 < bridge> <zhn> oh you are warhammer. i saw your mod on serverlist, is there anything you to check out? you were afk so i couldn't ask you straight
19:25 < bridge> <zhn> anything new*
19:25 < bridge> <zhn> compared to ddnet obviously
19:25 < bridge> <vahemaaa> oh it was a nodejs bot on the server
19:25 < bridge> <always> thats the gay flag?
19:25 < bridge> <always> i thought the rainbow was thge gay one
19:25 < bridge> <vahemaaa> and i worked on that mod to learn how to code teewolrds
19:25 < bridge> <vahemaaa> anything new üòÉ
19:25 < bridge> <zhn> ok got it
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that used to be *the* pride flag
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then they added more
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> people always called the pride flag the gay flag, but they weren't for the same thing
19:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anyway its in unicode and unicode calls it rainbow
19:28 < bridge> <vahemaaa> i added some effects (bloody confetti). some moderatings for admins (player_name-clan-skin [id] [new one]). modified weapons (explosive gun-spreadguns etc). and made an arena (/arena) which teleports you to a position and as long as you do not /leave; you respawn in arena
19:29 < bridge> <vahemaaa> something like that üòÜ
19:30 < bridge> <vahemaaa> and lastly i tried to add server dummies and screw up. then edited dbg_dummies and made them act like normal server dummy
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i managed to get it to work, i absed m,ine on ddnet-insta tho
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i didnt get to implementing any... good ai
19:33 < bridge> <vahemaaa> then i quit coding cuz i have to study for an important exam which is after a month. Then i will start to learn again and take a look at your dummies buniboni üôÇ
19:40 < bridge> <vahemaaa> and your discord-bot is awesome
19:41 < bridge> <vahemaaa> especially truth or dare
19:41 < bridge> <.kurosio> Tuning prediction, as I understand it, predicts based on the state of the data received from the map, and I think the implementation of bypassing direct tuning from the code is map generation?
19:44 < bridge> <.kurosio> I'm interested in almost every custom mod using all sorts of different crutches, but the implementations go as far as strategies, and all sorts of arkanoid, snake games, in fact this is the only direction that is developing on costume mods, implementations up to all sorts of puzzles that are not difficult to implement, the main thing is the correct use of crutches

20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> kagi is okay tbh
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i think the free plan allows some free searches for month so it's great as a backup if i can only find SEO bullshit from a search from ddg or w/e
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i think the free plan allows some # of free searches for month so it's great as a backup if i can only find SEO bullshit from a search from ddg or w/e

21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @kebscs the teleport prediction does not disable interpolation
21:03 < bridge> <gorp_tw> trans flag would piss so many people off, let's do it
21:04 < bridge> <kebscs> What does it mean
21:04 < bridge> <gorp_tw> @kuro_garci_78855 :0000 HIIII
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am not teleported in an instant
21:04 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i was trolled
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesn't seem like a good reason to do something
21:04 < bridge> <gorp_tw> @.kurosio
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But interpolated between wherre the tele and output is
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i think there was discussion abt this before and there was a vague conclusion that these flags should be reserved for geographical areas
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On 240hz you can see it with bare eyes
21:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> how am I supposed to find people from translandia to play with?
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> wherever you find them normally
21:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> hmmm okay
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> there's that LGBTee clan in the US
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> idk mang
21:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> geometry dash forums
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think the point was to be anti-expression
21:06 < bridge> <gorp_tw> personally just extremely disinterested in displaying my "country"
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> I have been messing around with my new identity card and I must say ISO7816-4 is absolutely vast. Smartcards are sooo hard to interface with
21:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if it takes up screen space I would rather show something else
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i put the luxembourg flag from day 1
21:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> doesn't have to be a pride flag
21:07 < bridge> <louis> identity card?
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just that the flags can tell a lot about the player in combination with their ping and stuff, but ppl don't really take it seriously
21:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'll put up my Social Security Card
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> Couldn't even get anything except the issuing country code out of the thing yet, it's so hard to work with a file system blindly
21:07 < bridge> <kebscs> I didn't notice when testing, do you know how to fix it?
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> got an electronic identity card
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In rs version I simply used a counter that advances everytime a tele is hit.
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If the counter of prediction and non-prediction mismatch the position is simply not interpolated
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno if it works that easily without adding it to the snap obj tho
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> from whom?
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Adding it to the snapshots would also fix it in demos
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So would maybe make sense in the long run
21:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I just saw the most based kid of all time
21:09 < bridge> <learath2> It's very likely that the data on this thing is completely encrypted too, so idk why I'm bothering with it, but I was curious if I could extract my name from the card üòÑ
21:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I work at a grocery store and there was a kid sitting on the ground, playing Minecraft on his Nintendo Switch
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> did your government issue it or someone else
21:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> he was making a giant "pillar" of TNT
21:09 < bridge> <always> why would u choose to play with trans people instead of normal people
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> and like which govt
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> arent you moving around all the time
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how this shit works at all
21:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> because they are more entertaining
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well to be precise, between prev snap and cur snap
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think that's how they are called in ddnet
21:10 < bridge> <learath2> tbf the government middleware can get the name out, so the encryption key must be in there somewhere, but I honestly cba to reverse the entire middleware to extract that
21:10 < bridge> <learath2> Also I have a suspicion that reverse engineering the middleware might be a one way trip to jail
21:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> and ofc I am cis-ist obviousleh!!!
21:11 < bridge> <kebscs> I see the CCharacter for prediction has vec2 m_PrevPos;
21:11 < bridge> <kebscs>     vec2 m_PrevPrevPos;
21:11 < bridge> <always> am i not entertaning
21:11 < bridge> <kebscs> Would this work?
21:11 < bridge> <always> am i not entertaining#
21:11 < bridge> <always> am i not entertaining
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno how exactly the interpolation works in ddnet tbh
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Normall it should be prev and cur pos
21:14 < bridge> <kebscs> I'll check later with these 2, but other than that no idea
21:14 < bridge> <louis> arent tees normally interpolated when they go thru teleporter anyways
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is just a visual bug
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is no interpolation
21:15 < bridge> <louis> even without antiping, u can see tee going across ur screen if they get tp
21:15 < bridge> <louis> ah
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes quite possible u see it even without prediction, dunno
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But now with the prediction I cannot unsee it xD
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It just feels different
21:16 < bridge> <louis> yeah i think teleporting always looked buggy / with some interpolation, maybe its more with prediction though
21:16 < bridge> <kebscs> Ok so not my pr issue
21:16 < bridge> <louis> havent tested ur pr tho
21:16 < bridge> <kebscs> It's merged
21:17 < bridge> <louis> oh ill swap off beta then
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But we have to fix it, it looks wrong to glitch through walls
21:18 < bridge> <louis> that's weird, with `cl_predict 0` i get weird interpolating visuals (not on pr)
21:19 < bridge> <louis> that makes sense actually nvm
21:19 < bridge> <louis> oh yeah i get the buggy behavior on nightly
21:20 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1376641141616676997/teletest.map?ex=68361078&is=6834bef8&hm=091e59eb6ca9b7604cc6450acd6e7df66cb0a1fe2c715b7259bdd94ee5491f5a&
21:20 < bridge> <louis> u can test with this, you shouldn't be able to see any of the spawn unhooks after you jump into the tele
21:22 < bridge> <louis> better testing map
21:22 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1376641557960069241/teletest.map?ex=683610dc&is=6834bf5c&hm=3cce68829a93c6bd273c7637fcf662112a3c3621483d7e53a8db761cb3516e27&
21:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> nah you are actually
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh even with `cl_predict 0` it shouldn't‚Ñ¢Ô∏è happen. ddnet client should simply know a teleporter is instant, the server should communicate it properly
21:23 < bridge> <always> does that mean im trans
21:24 < bridge> <louis> yeah i thought that toio
21:24 < bridge> <louis> maybe without prediction the base game always interpolates b/w positions?
21:24 < bridge> <louis> is what i assumed
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it generally always does xd
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont have a mechanism for not interpolating yet afaik
21:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Regardless of prediction the intra tick should cause interpolation between previous and current position. You can notice this in the demo player when play slowly while a player dies and respawns.
21:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Regardless of prediction the intra tick should cause interpolation between previous and current position. You can notice this in the demo player when playing slowly while a player dies and respawns.
21:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I suppose netobjs need a flag to tell the client not to interpolate them based on the intra tick
21:27 < bridge> <louis> cant it be done clientside?
21:28 < bridge> <louis> i don't get any interpolation on latest release on teletest.map with cl_predict 1
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I assume it's kinda luck
21:29 < bridge> <louis> definitely not
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The client always runs a few ticks ahead and since the snapshot arrives later it doesnt need to interpolate?
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well on a local server maybe ~1 tick ahead
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but snapshots only arrive every 2nd tick
21:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Would be very hacky if possible at all. Looks like players die and then the next tick they already respawn
21:31 < bridge> <always> woudl that break old clients?
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> They would just ignore it and work the same way as before, with incorrect interpolation
21:32 < bridge> <louis> i tried it on local and also trashmap with 180 ping and cl_predict 1 never interpolates
21:33 < bridge> <louis> not really sure how allat works but that makes sense
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It defs is instant in the old version
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But delayed
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> By your ping
21:34 < bridge> <louis> if intra tick is always interpolating though there must be some reason it does not interpolate with prediction on
21:35 < bridge> <louis> that broked with tele prediction
21:35 < bridge> <robyt3> The intra tick is also predicted separately
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When a snapshot arrives the client advances the ticks for the local character (to predict it)
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And thus you get the instant feeling
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's only instant by _luck_
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With a ping of 0 and prediction margin of 1 maybe it already doesnt
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This not, but I think the assumption above should still be right
21:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> I encourage that
21:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> I encourage only talking in this channel about tue resultd
21:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> the results
21:41 < bridge> <learath2> I guess if I go to jail the fact that I'm unemployed wouldn't matter all that much anymore
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. the debug ghost is interpolating. And the client is defs 1 tick behind the server and thus does a client side prediction.
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is probs enough to evade the interpolation

21:43 < bridge> <learath2> I did verify that it is authenticating with the card somehow, but it's using a challange-response algorithm that is not a identified by a standard identifier, the response size of 0x60 to a challange of 0x10 for some reason smells like elliptic curves to me, that's where I stopped messing around with it. I'd have to become very sure before I accidentally lock myself out of this thing üòÑ
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Snapshot arrives with pos before tele -> client did not predict tele => predicted position was inside tele.
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Snapshot arrives with pos after tele -> client still not predict tele(doesnt matter) => predicted position was after tele.
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. the debug ghost is interpolating. And the client is defs 1 tick(or better one snapshot) behind the server and thus does a client side prediction.
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is probs enough to evade the interpolation

21:49 < bridge> <learath2> Translandia first needs a ISO3166-1 or ISO3166-2 country code
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, does this fix the teleporter issue even?
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As soon as one obj has the flag active the client will simply not interpolate.
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The client side prediction ofc needs the same logic in place too
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why I'd find a counter better than a flag:
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - In worst case the flag is skipped somehow (e.g. a snapshot was lost)
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - The flag would need to be carried over potentially 2 ticks (bcs snapshot rate is only every second tick)
21:57 < bridge> <learath2> And I'm guessing you want to set it on the character object right after the teleport so the client doesn't interpolate? but the prediction will not get that flag soon enough
21:57 < bridge> <learath2> So we predict the flag too on the client?
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, that fixes it for e.g. the demo
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And the prediction will simply copy the same logic
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Prediction _can_ always be wrong by external factors anyway, but in most cases this would make it look like the demo then
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> If a flag is skipped, the update of the counter would also be far too late to not-interpolate, no? I guess the second point is still a nice benefit, it's sort of "self-resetting"
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well let's make an unrealistic extreme case:
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We hit the teleporter on the start line, play the whole map normally but all snapshots are lost and you end up in the finish line.
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Interpolation here _still_ makes no sense
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The teleporter was hit so these two positions have nothing todo with each other anymore
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ofc in this case it would suck either way
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah xd
22:53 < furo> @0xdeen What happened to the old entries in https://ddnet.org/stats/master/ ? I have backups of them, but it would be nice if they were still hosted there.

22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://tenor.com/view/spn-supernatural-dean-jensen-thoughtyouweredead-gif-7424266
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> Why did you close your GitHub account :cat_tired:
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> All your prs closed :(
23:02 < furo> @melo∆û Eh, it's whatever. Those PRs would never get merged any ways.
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> :/
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> are you selfhosting git now?
23:05 < bridge> <Ewan> isn‚Äôt furo already a bitbucketer? or some other service
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like ddstats repo wasn‚Äôt hosted on gh
23:06 < bridge> <kebscs> respect to roby for reviewing troll prs
23:06 < bridge> <kebscs> mod support for country flags pr
23:06 < bridge> <kebscs> definetly what ddnet needs üòÜ
23:09 < bridge> <learath2> Do our countryflag numbers even mean anything?
23:10 < bridge> <kebscs> most are iso codes
23:10 < bridge> <kebscs> but some are just random
23:11 < bridge> <learath2> I see
23:14 < bridge> <learath2> 900-999 seems to be left reserved for private use. So I guess we have more than enough space for extra flags, no need to break the 3 digit system
23:16 < bridge> <kebscs> and they dont need to be correct either
23:16 < bridge> <kebscs> in ddnet SS- south sudan has code 737, but real one is 728
23:16 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder why, perhaps a reassignment happened?
23:17 < bridge> <learath2> We wouldn't randomly pick a different number for no reason
23:17 < bridge> <kebscs> so theres basically like 900 slots bcs old ids wont be outdated to mantain compatibility

23:23 < bridge> <ai_ghial> what is going to happen in ddnet 2.0?
23:24 < bridge> <kebscs> teepocalypse
23:24 < bridge> <ai_ghial> :0
23:25 < bridge> <learath2> Teerapture
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he's alive
23:37 < bridge> <gorp_tw> okay but there's tons of devs and only 2 have bothered with the single most important issue in all of ddnet
23:37 < bridge> <gorp_tw> so calling X PR "troll" and many others working on features that are, well, nice but not needed also is just the same imo
23:37 < bridge> <kebscs> imagine if accounts werent in rust
23:38 < bridge> <gorp_tw> it doesn't even matter
23:38 < bridge> <gorp_tw> others know rust here
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> it does
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> all contributing devs do c++
23:39 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm pretty sure Ryo and milkeeycat know rust lol
23:39 < bridge> <kebscs> this is a classic example of senior dev starting something, only him knowing it, and then leaving company
23:39 < bridge> <gorp_tw> no it isnt lol
23:39 < bridge> <kebscs> and noone knows wtf is going on or wants to touch it
23:39 < bridge> <gorp_tw> like legit half the devs know Rust
23:39 < bridge> <kebscs> thats why its abandoned for years?
23:39 < bridge> <gorp_tw> and if it's an issue, well we should be having that conversation
23:39 < bridge> <gorp_tw> try 4 months.
23:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm not trying to sound like a bitch here really but what you're saying isn't really true
23:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> jupeyy was working on it in the last 4-5 months
23:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> would you work on accounts if they were implemented in C++ instead of Rust?
23:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> 
23:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> 1) yes, if we have the discussion now
23:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> 2) no, I'm still not interested
23:41 < bridge> <kebscs> ofc
23:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> then vote
23:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> we got a lot of devs at this point
23:42 < bridge> <kebscs> `from: jupeyy_keks quic`
23:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> check the repo, not everything happens on discord
23:43 < bridge> <louis> who u think is active and has the capabilities to finish accounts
23:44 < bridge> <kebscs> last real commits on quic pr are march 2024
23:44 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm not really sure who is active anymore, seems to be new faces that know C++ though
23:44 < bridge> <louis> rust has a pretty big learning curve compared to most other languages
23:45 < bridge> <louis> also making account framework is pretty technical compared to most easy features
23:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I don't agree that QUIC should be "blocking" the progress. plain UDP should be fine as PoC and when its vetted and someone has time it can simply be adapted to work with QUIC, then drop support for the old protocol
23:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> we already have zero security, its not like a step back or anything
23:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I've just seen a lot of things get shot down or dragged in the mud which obviously doesn't make anyone who is a dev want to try
23:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> we should encourage first model of it to be tested imo, as long as it works
23:47 < bridge> <kebscs> well, youre right
23:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> obviously the spec needs ro be finalizrd
23:47 < bridge> <kebscs> but quic is blocking
23:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> obviously the spec needs ro be finalized
23:47 < bridge> <louis> i dont think account system is smth u wanna drop a beta test for, u just do it correctly the first time
23:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but the transport is really unimportant for that...
23:48 < bridge> <gorp_tw> obviously the spec needs to be finalized
23:48 < bridge> <gorp_tw> people dont have to rebuild their entire website just because they want to use X509 certs
23:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> and I fail to see what implications QUIC has that would make it any different
23:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I think it can still be done "correctly" but the handshake would be visible, if you had someone's IP
23:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or replayable rather
23:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> which, yeah is an issue for sure
23:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but right now we have people TASing finishes for random people. how is that a concern
23:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but right now we have people TASing finishes for random people. how is that a concern in comparison
23:50 < bridge> <kebscs> records channel got removed = botting solved
23:50 < bridge> <kebscs> dont even ask about accounts
23:50 < bridge> <kebscs> üôÇ
23:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> wdym solved?
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl can‚Äôt see the fake ranks
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> progress!
23:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah I'm not sure what he means xd
23:52 < bridge> <kebscs> just laughing at how terribly this situation is handled
23:52 < bridge> <Ewan> QUIC is the modern web standard for transport (behind http 3.0)
23:52 < bridge> <Ewan> it has inherent NAT client dedup and such
23:52 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs good
23:52 < bridge> <gorp_tw> anyway, I feel kinda cringe coming in here and pretending to be some "representative" or cheerleader for accounts but, I don't really think anyone technical is taking up the conversation lately and it's constantly complained about
23:52 < bridge> <louis> i dont think removing records is bad
23:53 < bridge> <louis> it just looks bad cause long term solution has been sluggish in development
23:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i mean, I understand why QUIC is great dont get me wrong
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> every time it‚Äôs been brought up the consensus has been ‚Äúoh well too bad hein‚Äôs not working on it‚Äù or ‚Äúpick up where he left off‚Äù
23:53 < bridge> <louis> which is always the case for volunteer projects, if u hate it then go learn to code
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i don‚Äôt think talking about it more is going to do anything
23:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm just saying I don't think it has implications on how the spec is developed
23:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah but if we intend then to "pick up where he left off" we can make that decision. how badly do we want accounts?
23:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i can at the very least offer my limited network/spec experience to come up with that side of things
23:54 < bridge> <Ewan> the solution probably is not to redesign it
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> we have alternative implementation ideas already from jupstar and stuff
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> the accounts issue is very long and enlightening
23:55 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if it would be worth doing to write pseudocode or some spec page for how its currently implemented I can do that
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> nothin to it but to do it
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> jupstar has a reference impl working already iirc
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> in ddnet rs
23:55 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah, but if its a huge deal that its in rust or something xd
23:55 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm not even sure it is really
23:56 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but I understand a lot of the newer devs probably only know C++
23:56 < bridge> <gorp_tw> learned it for the game etc
23:56 < bridge> <Ewan> any knowledgeable dev can translate between the languages because it‚Äôs mainly just an implementation
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> if anyone wanted to just do it
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> if there was an MVP it would get reviews to a functional state
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> there just isnt
23:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i mean, stick basic UDP api onto Jupey's repo and its basically MVP no
23:57 < bridge> <kebscs> ppl dont even review prs here and u expect them to pick up rust code
23:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> at least that was my understanding
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it could tie in nicely since there‚Äôs already a bridge, if we wanted to bind networking logic and whatnot
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> but someone‚Äôs gotta Do It
23:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Accounts without secure networking would be meaningless
23:59 < bridge> <gorp_tw> afaic ranks are meaningless with so many people cheating
