02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yknow why cant we just, limit the amount of traffic on a server
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> none of the servers surpass a million in terms of packaging stuff
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1027012784300507258/unknown.png
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> none of the servers surpass a million in terms of packaging stuff except the ones being ddosed
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1027012784300507258/unknown.png
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> none of the servers surpass a million in terms of packaging stuff except the ones being ddosed, and even then it spikes to like **100** million
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1027012784300507258/unknown.png
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats what a ddos protection does
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If you would simply limit it the attack traffic would steal place for legitimate traffic
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh thats fair
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i can only assume now that distinguishing an attack from actual input with ddos protection would be costly
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'm currently talking to a good hoster, we'll see
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Stepfunn> :PauseChamp:
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then also your issue would be fixed @Stepfunn
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Stepfunn> :PogU:
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone want to join LTT livestream tomorrow and tell them to benchmark DDNet on Intel GPU? 😄 https://youtu.be/6T9d9LM1TwY?t=280
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://unicodebook.readthedocs.io/definitions.html#mojibake
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> french moment 😄
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how could the girl not realize she was writing gibberish?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least she meticulously transcribed the accents ^^
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> xD imagine Linus saying what's a hammerfly?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> uff didnt know its built on TSMC 6nm.. that makes these cards even worse than they already are
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I read that nm isnt everything
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Arent nvidia still 7nm
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it isnt, but thats not they latest nm
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 4090 release 3 days after these intel cards
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and is 5nm i think
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah like amd
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4nm even
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 5nm
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No its 5
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also i read that saying 3-4-5nm is a bit fuzzy
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And more a marketing strat
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> On wikipedia
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if both is from TSMC
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then the one will be at least a bit better than the other
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i only find 4nm sources
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The term "5 nanometer" has no relation to any actual physical feature (such as gate length, metal pitch or gate pitch) of the transistors. According to the projections contained in the 2021 update of the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems published by IEEE Standards Association Industry Connection, a 5 nm node is expected to have a contacted gate pitch of 51 nanometers and a tightest metal pitch of 30 nanometers.[3] However, in
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but in the end "increased speed and reduced power consumption compared to the previous 7 nm process."
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it sort of relates to the expected performance of an hypothetical 5nm node
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but other than that, that also makes it less attractive IMHO
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel is clearly worse than nvidia and amd
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if they dont even use their own fabs to produce them, then its not like u support compotition as much as if they would
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would have been more interesting if intel does it like with CPUs 😄
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Making another tmsc is such a complex thing
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its one of the most advanced techs
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U also need a place without much trembling, earthquakes etc
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but competition in that field is also important
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz it needs to be super stable
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The foundry
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there are workarounds to many issues. Where there is will there usually is a way. It's just that the investment required might just be too high for the other countries to ever catch up now
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> China is making huge moves to deprecate tsmc asap and even they are atleast 3 generations behind
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Russia is like 6 generations behind
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Japan is close tho iirc
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Samsung is japanese right
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They got their foundry
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Iirc
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because they have no choice, U.S. is blocking many high end exports to China now and TSMC won't be allowed to deliver much to Chinese companies
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Korea
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Samsung is so huge that it's 20% of South Korean GDP
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japan and eu are probably closer to 65nm. That's sooo far behind korea and taiwan
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But theybwill build a foundry on usa
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 17bln iirc
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And idk why, on texas
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> With their electricity grid that fails often
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, samsung actually does a lot more than people realize. They own hospitals, massive ships, chip fabs, consumer electronic fabs, they own apartments, graveyards
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And ssds
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Samsung and a handful other companies are like the entirety of korea
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mobiles, tv, fridges
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And my toaster was samsung btw
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, it'll still be owned by samsung. I think that's not the US moving forward in technology but just a safeguard just in case big bad china invades taiwan
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It has funding from murica
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I don't think they agreed on any IP exchange. It's just a US funded samsung fab in the US
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When open source 5nm?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's actually quite interesting that these handful of companies get to hide some of the biggest achievements of human kind under lock and key
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah sad
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a dozen or so years ago if china decided they didn't want taiwan to exist anymore we'd be plunged back 5 generations of tech almost
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like wtf is 65nm
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess intel has the secret sauce to 20nm, so we'd still have that
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> China has been actively recruiting TSMC engineers to build up SMIC, paying them double their old salary. So that's an easy way to get expertise. Happens in most fields like that.
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A leading tsmc engineer may get paid millions a year literally lol
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But there is no incentive in eu or us to do the same. They pay the money to tsmc and samsung so they build fabs in their regions instead
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There has recently been more incentive for national security, especially now with the oil and gas dependency from Russia and how that turned out
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But yeah, barely any semiconductor foundries left, and most don't want to compete for low nm because it's high risk and cost
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully domestic companies like stmicro will start innovating again
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think whatever secrets ASML keeps are more valuable
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> evidently the US government agrees because they're banned from selling stuff to china
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly don't think there are any entities rich enough that could risk it. Maybe government initiatives could, but you need to promise something in return to the public if you want to spend tax euros
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As far as I'm aware ASML makes all the EUV lithography machines. Including for china's SMIC
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though they can't buy them anymore, before the restrictions I think they got all their machines from ASML
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> well yeah ASML is the only maker of EUV
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> without ASML china has almost no hope of getting more EUV anytime soon
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One thing china does have is very deep pockets and some EUV lithography machines they can reverse engineer. I can see them making some progress
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Idk I would be skeptical of that, it took a hundred research papers on exploding tin droplets and there is only 1 supplier in the world who can make the mirrors that are precise enough.
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think the ASML ceo said something about it lemme see if I can find it
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> > “I think it unlikely that China would be able to replicate top lithography technology independently because ASML relies on relentless innovation and integrating components that are only available from non-Chinese suppliers. I am not saying it cannot be done|because I know the laws of physics are the same in China as they are here. Never say never. They will certainly try."
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> My DDNet just randomly crashed while playing 👍
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got a coredump?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, how
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am on release
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> windows?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I was assuming linux
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then look in dumps in config dir
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Aye, it crashed again while it's in background as I was looking into the dir
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont have any logs
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, the only reason i know which doesnt generate dumps is out of memory/RAM
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> r u using 32bit? xd
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, I have auto-updated it ingame
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (this has never happened before)
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you didnt get a dump in the dumps directory? That's bizarre
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what u mean by auto update?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> updater?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do u just mean u dont have 32bit bcs of it
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😄
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u tried to restart windows, that fixes lot of problems
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It crashed again, wtf
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ingame update
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what server?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats the ways to reproduce
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nightly or normal release?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 16.4, any server (happened on my & kog), no ways to reproduce.
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as i said, one time it happened while standing, other time while in background, and next time while actively playing
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> did windows update, did u update drivers?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are a 100% sure there is no dump, try running it in a debugger
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i did nothing and changed nothing
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh weird that %appdata%/teeworlds/dumps is empty then 😄
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Debug programs behave differently, especially when self compiled vs. cross compiled
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> last dump is from yesterday<
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say expected more crash reports from other ppl than u tho
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd have expected more crash reports from other ppl than u tho
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Time to try and reproduce for 2 rounds in fng in linux :gigachad:
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok don't run it in a debugger? Idk what sort of answer you expect here, I can only give ideas 😄
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I was just reporting it?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Time to try and reproduce for 2 rounds in fng in linux :gigachad: (meaning I will play 2 fng rounds while pretending to work)
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont have the time right now to debug this
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just wonder why it happened so randomly now
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean there wasnt a release in the last days
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and no dumps generated is also weird, why would that part stop working for no reason at all?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, I unplugged my graphics card today, but put it back in as usual. Also thats not the first time I did that, and never had issues like this so...
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think anyone touched any signals
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well that defs sounds like a possible reason xD
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it gets hot and somehow looses contact or smth
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> directly rip
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a friend had this too with a gtx 760
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> unplugged, cleaned all shit
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> randomly no more crashes
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But why does everything else work fine then xD
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can just say how it is, for him it also was teeworlds crashing
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and since i also had a gtx 760 at home and couldnt reproduce
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this solved it, after i tried everything else
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im not joking 😄
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 100% tru story
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why would it happen after I plugged it back in? You think it could be some kind of dust or smth?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont htink so, it should be clean
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did restart my PC, will see how it performs now
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno the exact reason, but maybe power cable not plugged in correctly
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like that
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I always double check that, also if it fits correctly inside
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the card itself*
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you maybe have %appdata%/ddnet?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Dumps would also be silently not generated if you are missing `exchndl.dll` for whatever reason or if the dll is outdated
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> outdated = a version without Jupeyy's changes
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> btw those changes (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/pull/26, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4759) should no longer be necessary, as the module offset is also printed on upstream drmingw
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nikce
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah he was inactive for over a year, suddenly he was back xD
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Yeah, he is very active right now. I'm just waiting for a release so we can use that and also resolve https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5877
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should i install gentoo
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it can be fun
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try nix
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you have some time at hand?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that also sounds fun ^^
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have my arch linux in a state i can wipe it all and dont care rn
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have time yeah
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what did you do?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just need at some point to have grub working to boot into windows
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz work stuff
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> backups xd
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> xd
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then it is fun configuring your own kernel and setting up use flags and stuff
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need that 1% perf improvement using native arch
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jupstar says so
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need that 1% perf improvement using native march
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also my arch linux is bloated with lot of packages i dont use
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i never installed stuff with -needed
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what i can remove
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> march lto ofast
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also get to remove use flags of features you dont use in software, you can get another 1% there
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also you can get your kernel very very very lean
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or you can try a bsd if you dont want to game ever on linux
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bsds are fun too
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dota 2 works on linux natively
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and proton is getting rly good lately
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proton is indeed very impressive. The only things I have to boot into windows for are extremely modern games and games with very intrusive anti cheat
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> noby's anticheat > Vanguard
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> It would be intersted to make anti-cheat system like noby's for 3D
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah lately i've been using too much windows due to ff14 but i think it can run well on linux
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i gotta correct myself here
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> It would be intersting to make anti-cheat system like noby's for 3D
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill install gentoo
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> embrace supremacy
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nix!
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk about nix
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> me neither
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are you using it?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hence I want you to try it out 😄
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does nix make you compile it urself
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im interested in compiling all myself
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I shouldn't have said that out loud
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can compile everything yourself in nix
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it probably doesn't have as nice customization as gentoo, not even sure how it looks like at all
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the good thing it has is reproducibility
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you can theoretically download binary artifacts for stuff where you didn't change anything. but I guess that's not too much of an upside
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> downsides are e.g. that it needs to fight a little to make everything conform to its world view
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you'll be able to downgrade your system to the working state it had before your upgrade ^^
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmmm
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how hard is it to make like ur own packages
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like aur
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok maybe ill try nixos
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have only time to loss anyway xd
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently people do this "arch -> gentoo -> nixos"
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I think NixOS is the logical conclusion of the Ports-like package management system pioneered by the BSDs and adopted by Gentoo and to a lesser extent Arch.
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's possible to make your own packages, but I don't know how hard
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the local hackerspace, I met someone trying to build firefox against musl using nix 😄
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Build_flags
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently nix uses some kind of haskell-ish functional language? xd
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gentoo has a lot of ease of use tools helping you compile things yourself. Local repos, epatches, use flags
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, "nix", I think 😄
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should try nix sometime, see how it fares
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> note that nix is the package manager
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nixos the os
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've come to appreciate how much of your experience of a distro comes down to the its package manager. Homebrew has really given me ptsd
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried for 1h and didn't get any results
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everything seems decent to me after homebrew
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also this time i wont bother using luks
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill let the cia see my hentai
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish dd showed progress
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> killall -USR1 dd
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `killall -USR1 dd`
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> makes it show progress
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, use `progress`
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (both work with an already running `dd`)
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1027286774474616922/unknown.png
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is gonna take a while xd
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wait
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not sure if i should try plasma or not
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ill try
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> self compiling takes so long, thats kinda annoying. Else i'd maybe do it. e.g. 
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want a debian optimized for ryzen 
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> all packages that are well coded, ofast lto. 10% perf  = 1 CPU generation skip 😄
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there should be distros targeting e.g skylake or smth atleast
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel clear linux
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> always wins in phoronix benchmarks
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish usb-4 was widespread or smth
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> transfering data through usbs is such a chore
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Ofast` makes correct programs incorrect
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it just bends the reality a bit
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u code well enough and arent doing like math programs that require extrem precision u can write anything that runs on ofast
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if your kernel is compiled using ofast
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its wrong
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u code a rly correct math program without it
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the kernel even using floats?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will it break?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kernels dont use floats iirc
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it will probs break bcs it relies on UB
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe usb3 speeds should be enough ^^ your disk seems to be really slow
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but linus doesnt even recommend o3
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which might get optimized 😄
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i connected the usb to a hub, it shows blue
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the linux kernel doesn't use any floating point registers
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont remember if the hub is connected to a usb3 xd
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem is not that it's not usb4
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the biggset "downside" of ofast
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rest is just interpreting UB differently
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> usb3 would have a faster speed
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "-ffast-math
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Sets the options -fno-math-errno, -funsafe-math-optimizations, -ffinite-math-only, -fno-rounding-math, -fno-signaling-nans, -fcx-limited-range and -fexcess-precision=fast.
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> This option causes the preprocessor macro __FAST_MATH__ to be defined.
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> This option is not turned on by any -O option besides -Ofast since it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do not require the guarantees of these specifications."
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if u want max perf, and dont need this kind of precision, its a nice optimization
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even for games
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ok it must be the usb drive that its bad
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a red usb port
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should be rly fast
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its the same
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not only precision
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> garantuees
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i use ddnet with ofast lto for example
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and also some other stuff
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also communication of errors, and assuming you never do stuff like 1.0/0.0, 0.0/0.0 etc
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which ddnet does
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes imho thats bad code anyway
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we dont generate NaNs anymore
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, cool
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't know 🙂
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well all we found
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbf
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is the shotgun bug not division by 0?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> shotgun bug is an exception yes
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but doesnt matter client side
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and we could™️ control it
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since we know the reason
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe codedev even fixed that
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant remember rn
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u wont like nixos
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses systemd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't use anything else?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant use else
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > systemd is an integral part of NixOS, because it makes extensive use of its features, such as cgroups, sandboxing, user units, and systemd timers instead of cron.
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nix = nixdorf?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do you think about gnu guix?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > > Guix is a fork of Nix and addresses the main issue that Nix didn't get right: instead of comming up with a homebrewed domain-specific language (DSL) with its own set of limitations and idiosyncrasies, Guix uses a full-fledged programming language.
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you use it with actual hardware?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like its aa improvement over it
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try guix
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just reading the first line
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Liberating. Guix is an advanced distribution of the GNU operating system developed by the GNU Project—which respects the freedom of computer users.
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all pray stallman
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I've never heard of someone using guix)
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1027291634007801907/unknown.png
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is not a contra but pro argument for ryo xD
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i've seen it on hn
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> KDE is missing 😄
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you need wifi on your device? 😛
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> god distros should provide torrents instead of http downloads
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> torrent is the best thing ever invented
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make use of it
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all that I tried do
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> arch, debian, ubuntu
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe even fedora
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki 
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Configurable Linux distributions / package sets like NixOS / nixpkgs make it possible to link a large fraction of their packages statically (for example, its pkgsStatic package set can provide all kinds of statically linked executables)."
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use that
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with LTO
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im gonna use guix
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in total it might consume more disk space tho
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not a problem
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd love to see as much static linking as possible in one distro and see how it performs
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what u think about https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it defs has disadvantages. os cannot cahce the .so obviously and other stuff
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the bianry in itself should be really optimized
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its gnu take on a init system
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can through out all shit ^^
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The GNU Daemon Shepherd or GNU Shepherd, formerly known as GNU dmd, is a service manager that looks after the herd of system services. It provides a replacement for the service-managing capabilities of SysV-init (or any other init) with a both powerful and beautiful dependency-based system with a convenient interface. It is intended for use on GNU/Hurd, but it is supposed to work on every POSIX-like system where Guile is available. In par
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can throw out all shit ^^
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://guix.gnu.org/en/packages/xf86-video-amdgpu-22.0.0/
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if i can use steam in gnu guix
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this exists
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with steam in it
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hope heroic games launcher will add steam some day
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it starts in 2 seconds vs 10-20 seconds epic slow launcher
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 10-20s steam slow launcher?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> epic games launcher
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but steam is also relatively slow

21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try nixos cuz steam works bad on guix i think
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hello from nixos
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see why this is all reproducible now
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was quick
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a weird way to install packages but i guess the value of reproducing ur whole linux in a new system is smth rly good
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh wow, that was quick
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i got a nvme m2 drive
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt u need to compile?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently not
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im now recompiling everything
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well then it was slow xd
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using znver3
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well cuz i was learning how to install stuff xd
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not as simple as a command
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> did u replace your arch for it btw?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i totally did not overwrite my efi removing the windows efi from there and totally didnt redownload the windows iso again to fix it
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> god i hate myself xd
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol rip
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all fixed now though
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lucky this happened before so i knew what to do more or less
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im an experienced system destroyer
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is one of the reasons I never use installers for any OS nowadays
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well it wasnt the installer fault
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use dism for windows and I install linux distros by hand (e.g. debootstrap in debian-likes)
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i knew the efi partition was there
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but my mind decided to remove it somehow xd
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is an absolute crime to call it that when you are locked down to systemd
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if ill stay with nixos though
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its nice to reproduce
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its rly pain
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like for example, i think u gotta configure neovim extensiosn from the nix thingy
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and vscode extensions
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> My brother uses Artix which is like Arch but providing init systems different than systemd. It feels like Arch though the absence of systemd feels very nice :D. You may want to keep that in mind if you want to try something systemd-free.
