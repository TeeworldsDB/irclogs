00:29 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yes this can already happen with http. You have to trust the site you connect to. If you connect to google they can collect your ip and share it with anyone they want. If they decide to redirect you it makes it only noticeable to you.
00:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: is this only a conceptual problem to you or do you have a specific case that could cause harm for anyone?
00:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I mean more harm than is already possible. If you say that Bombay can now redirect you to the china servers and tencent has your ip that is not a valid argument.
00:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> 
00:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Because Bombay probably already shares your ip with the Chinese government with some discord moderation tool. You just don‚Äôt notice it.
00:34 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> The only problem I see is that if you redirect users to US security agencies ips they might get a black van in front of their house.
01:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy shit why is it so complicated to do a http request in the ddnet codebase?
03:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> shouldn't be

08:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they cannot collect data in europe and just send it to china

10:12 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> already have a whole ram in it already
10:23 < bridge_> <totar> I think it's impossible for the ddnet client to violate GDPR, unless it automatically violates it by default. If a server redirects you to a non GDPR compliant server then it's the server who redirects that is at fault. Ddnet is the browser entity in this context.
10:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the ddnet licende included a non liabability thing doesnt it?
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, the point was more about that it makes it very easy
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> similar to how browsers dont prevent you to violate it
10:32 < bridge_> <totar> We are not the GDPR police
10:33 < bridge_> <totar> Any server can already violate gdpr trivially
10:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/gun-cop-fire-shoot-smosh-gif-5066095
10:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but there are ppl that have nothing better to do in their life
10:33 < bridge_> <teero777> not our problem right? xD maybe put a warning referring to legal reference
10:33 < bridge_> <totar> Just store and track ips who connect to your server for identification purpose and you violate gdpr. Anyone can do it already
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it's not a justice problem for us. but the few ppl that take GDPR very serious will probably complain here first
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but a server in the EU obviously has to not violate GDPR anyway, since EU laws apply here
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but sending your IP to USA is harder, bcs there USA laws apply
10:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so redirecting to a EU server is different than redirecting to USA server
10:35 < bridge_> <totar> It's not impossible to violate gdpr inside the eu, just send the ip to another server in usa
10:35 < bridge_> <totar> You don't need redires
10:35 < bridge_> <totar> You don't need redirects
10:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but then you obviously do it on purpose
10:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not by accident
10:36 < bridge_> <learath2> Or send the ip to a third party in the eu. That also violates it since the user didnt consent to that either
10:36 < bridge_> <learath2> You can argue joining the server is them consenting to us processing the ip, but they didn't consent to that third party processing it
10:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> are ips rly personal?
10:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i think here it depends on how they are processed, aka are they logged etc.
10:37 < bridge_> <totar> I don't think there's any reason to even be concerned about user tracking from a ddnet redirect.
10:37 < bridge_> <learath2> Anyway, I still maintain the position that this has nothing to do with us
10:37 < bridge_> <totar> It's not really possible
10:38 < bridge_> <totar> Tragically GDPR says yes
10:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Actually apparently doesnt. There was a legal theory that transient processing of personal data wasnt covered by gdpr, but I think it was tested in a german case
10:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant we put lile a accept redirect yes no popup?
10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not directly, but at least indirectly i'd say. bcs we give the power to redicrect but not the power to get a consent from the client
10:38 < bridge_> <learath2> We don't need to, but if we do we should make it opt in so people can still make seamless redirects for stuff like multiservers
10:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 we can do a allowlist
10:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like discord does with external links
10:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> aka remember i accepted this ip etc
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is different tho.
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the user actively clicks the link
10:40 < bridge_> <learath2> Problem is that allowlists use domains. This will be ips, which can change and make your experience less seamless again
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> discord just warns to prevent scam
10:41 < bridge_> <learath2> Again, not our concern imo. There are many ways to break gdpr with ddnet client and server
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but through our service directly?
10:41 < bridge_> <totar> yes
10:42 < bridge_> <totar> Well
10:42 < bridge_> <totar> Ddnet does not store user data so there is no violation from ddnet only 3rd party servers who can do anything
10:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Depends on what you mean by "our service". Our services as in the master server and the gameservers we host?
10:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> imho the client is not a liability for ddnet.org but services provided are
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if someone downloads unmodified client & server
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do these applications in itself violate GDPR
10:43 < bridge_> <totar> The client is never liable
10:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u accept the MIT license when usingnit
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well what does never mean?
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the client downloads a virus on purpose üòÑ
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet isnt even licensed under MIT üòÑ
10:44 < bridge_> <learath2> Why would they? Assuming they consent to sending their ip to the master server and whatever server they join, there is no other personal information being handled
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well that is my question
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do they or don't they
10:45 < bridge_> <learath2> They don't in my non lawyer opinion
10:45 < bridge_> <totar> GDPR is not about theoretical tracking its about actual tracking. You can send user ip to hundreds of server around the world as long as they don't track them
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the master server is hosted outside of EU you could maybe argue they do.
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then you could only argue that the master server is such an essential part of the game, that when u installed it and started it, u accepted that the client connects to the master server üòÑ
10:46 < bridge_> <totar> It doesn't matter if it's outside the EU because it's compliant already
10:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im in the dentist and i already wanna go away
10:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes but that's only partially the point. in USA the laws allow u to track whenever you want. so why would a USA hoster care about EU laws
10:47 < bridge_> <totar> That doesn't make sense
10:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not the task of the USA hoster to not violate GDPR
10:47 < bridge_> <learath2> They have to if they want to legally serve eu customers
10:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nope
10:47 < bridge_> <learath2> It is if they want to serve eu customers 100%
10:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since YOU connect to USA, the USA laws apply for the server hoster
10:48 < bridge_> <learath2> That's why a lot of US sites straight up don't allow you to browse the website if you are from the EU
10:48 < bridge_> <totar> connecting to hoster is essential part of your service so is exempt
10:48 < bridge_> <learath2> I think you are wrong on this one
10:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> afaik it is not, at least not if they didn't host a service that the user used directly
10:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> aka a redirect
10:48 < bridge_> <totar> Downloading fonts was deemed not essential because they can be hosted locally
10:48 < bridge_> <learath2> https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/application-regulation/who-does-data-protection-law-apply_en
10:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> downloading a font from google CDN is NOT googles fault
10:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Check point 2 at the statt
10:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Check point 2 at the start
10:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the website that has the HTML that tells the client to download from google CDN
10:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> assuming it's in USA
10:49 < bridge_> <totar> That's still allowed if it's essential download
10:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but google doesnt offer the service for a end user, but for a website hoster
10:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's the task of the website hoster to get the consent
10:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
10:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's 100% not
10:50 < bridge_> <totar> Source?

10:51 < bridge_> <totar> Do you think Google CDN is just illegal everywhere in EU
10:51 < bridge_> <totar> Fonts are non-essential
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> eng version:
10:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.cookieyes.com/documentation/google-fonts-and-gdpr/
10:52 < bridge_> <learath2> Let's return to ddnet. This would be the server hosters responsibility. Currently you can also break the gdpr even without any redirect functionality
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i agree with that, it's just the question if we want to make it easy to break GDPR
10:53 < bridge_> <learath2> It's already trivial
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but by accident
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is the question
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that it is easy on purpose is obvious xD
10:55 < bridge_> <learath2> I think I don't care, if you do a redirect you figure out whether it's legal or not
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but remember a developer wants to make a service easy to use
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and laws by nature are very hard.
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So in this case we'd make it easy to fuck up.
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And i also dislike this part about browsers btw.
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Downloading a font through google's API sounds completely sane as a developer
10:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs u don't directly trigger some annoying laws in your head all the time
10:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "annoying" - ofc it has a sense. it's just that it's too easy to break this law by accident
10:58 < bridge_> <learath2> It is easy to use. It's just MAYBE not easy to use legally. I don't want to code for the eu gdpr
10:59 < bridge_> <learath2> If it's very important for you maybe our info json can be used to force enable a "you are being redirected" prompt for eu players
11:01 < bridge_> <totar> You can make a check box that says "don't show redirect page again" and they only need to see it once
11:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Or maybe a prompt at startup that you consent to the transfer of your ip address to the master server, all servers you connect to and all servers that you might get redirected to
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since ddnet traffic is not encrypted, u could also say that it is even more important.
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine all chat msgs are sent through a server in russia or china which a very state controlled.
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But anyway, i am no lawyer and i also don't want to claim to be one. I could talk shit, but if i'd be 16 i'd 100% not have cared about some GDPR law and just redirect to whereever i wanted to.
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then some hobbyless lawyer could sue me and most probably even win
11:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Thankfully a 16yo has no reasonable way to pay any fines, so you'd get away with it even if you lose üòÑ

11:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> genesis + tank power combo even if some dude is messing around in my mouth
11:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Gas is a US thing. Completely illegal in Turkey for dentists, and I'm thinking similar in EU

11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how is it called
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> nitrous
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> where u pay monthly to be secured

11:45 < bridge_> <learath2> We get novocaine for local. They do a couple shots. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, you get general

11:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Insurance
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in spanish its "seguro"
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have no insurance
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i live in europe
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its only 140‚Ç¨
11:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> dentist still deemed non essential for a lot of super essential dental operations
11:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Dental is rarely covered in insurance anyway. Very few extremely rich countries have it in social security
11:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> so poor ppl still have to pay
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is dental specific insurance
11:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah, you need extra teeth insurance, crazy
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also its because i decided to do it private
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with the dentist i always go
11:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its covered by social security
11:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wouldnt pay anything
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> neat
11:47 < bridge_> <learath2> In italy there are a few operations covered by the state for dental. BUT even for those there are like 2 dentists in my city with a massive queue
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> i didn‚Äôt pay for my work
11:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just would need to wait way more xd
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> but my sister had to fork out a decent amount
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> i basically did it right before i turned 18 xd
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think wisdom tooth removal is covered
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if its needed
11:48 < bridge_> <learath2> In Turkey if it's needed, it's free
15:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Not all laws are enforced especially not in teeworlds. DDoS is also illegal. IPs are not confidential and shared everywhere.
15:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> If there is a court case against redirects we remove it. Until then I don‚Äôt understand why we talk about GDPR in a redirect feature.
15:52 < bridge_> <learath2> I have encountered the most INSANE way to define a datetime layout. In golang, datetime layout is defined using a string for the particular date `Mon Jan 2nd 15:04:05 2006`. You literally write out that date/time in whatever format you like, go runtime reverse engineers it to figure out how to write out your time
15:53 < bridge_> <learath2> I have no idea what flavour crack google engineers were smoking when they designed that
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> month at second. year in last

19:07 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Dear Developer Team,
19:07 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> 
19:07 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Following up on my earlier message, I am excited to propose a dynamic new game mode for DDNet that could function as a seasonal event or a regular interactive mode, facilitated by both staff and players. This concept focuses on creating a high-energy, competitive environment through brief, intense gameplay challenges.
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> 
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Game Mode Overview:
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Players begin in a lobby map to prepare. The map then switches to a challenge map, estimated to take 10-20 seconds to complete. The game will pause until all players have loaded and are ready. Participants will have 5 minutes to run the map as many times as possible to record the fastest time. After the timer expires, the game pauses to calculate rankings, awarding points based on order of finish (e.g., in a 10-player setup, points decrease 
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co>

19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> To continually refresh and enhance the map pool for this mode, I propose setting up a dedicated system on Discord. This would allow players to submit their map creations for consideration. Each submission must include:
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> 
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> A defined spawn point.
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> A clear start and finish line.
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Settings adjusted for sv_solo_server to ensure it is suitable for solo attempts.
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> The submitted maps could then be evaluated by a testing team or the event host before being approved for inclusion in the game mode.

19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> I initially tried to discuss this idea with Main Admin "deen" but he is away and suggested I bring this proposal here for further refinement and input. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated as I aim to make this engaging new mode a part of our gaming community.
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> 
19:08 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> I am open to any ideas and improvements that would enhance this game mode and look forward to collaborating closely with you to realize this vision.
19:09 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Dear Developer Team,
19:09 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> 
19:09 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> I am excited to propose a dynamic new game mode for DDNet that could function as a seasonal event or a regular interactive mode, facilitated by both staff and players. This concept focuses on creating a high-energy, competitive environment through brief, intense gameplay challenges.

19:09 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Game Mode Overview:
19:09 < bridge_> <∆§√ò≈¢ƒÄ≈§0Co> Players begin in a lobby map to prepare. The map then switches to a challenge map, estimated to take 10-20 seconds to complete. The game will pause until all players have loaded and are ready. Participants will have 5 minutes to run the map as many times as possible to record the fastest time. After the timer expires, the game pauses to calculate rankings, awarding points based on order of finish (e.g., in a 10-player setup, points decrease

19:26 < bridge_> <melo∆û> someone hit me with the TLDR pls
19:35 < bridge_> <Peakies> Yo Melon senpai
19:35 < bridge_> <melo∆û> @diariesvexar whassup peakerino
19:35 < bridge_> <Peakies> nothing special busy with work and ddnet src
19:36 < bridge_> <melo∆û> :pepeangryping:
19:36 < bridge_> <Peakies> can you compile ddnet on linux ?
19:36 < bridge_> <melo∆û> is that like a - "is it possible to compile ddnet on linux" or a "are !YOU! able to"
19:36 < bridge_> <melo∆û> because yes and yes
19:36 < bridge_> <Peakies> nice and nice
19:36 < bridge_> <Peakies> can you test it on linux https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8254
19:37 < bridge_> <Peakies> for switch ddnet between screen but not selection box but by using keyboard bind like win + shift + arrow on windows
19:37 < bridge_> <melo∆û> run fix_style.py under `scripts/` first :kek:
19:37 < bridge_> <Peakies> for switch ddnet between screen but not using selection box but by using keyboard bind like win + shift + arrow on windows
19:37 < bridge_> <Peakies> I did doesn't fix that error don't know why
19:38 < bridge_> <melo∆û> you're correctly using clang-format 10 ? - CI broken again :REEEEEEEEEE:
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> ```
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> PS G:\GitHub\ddnet> scripts/fix_style.py --dry-run
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> Found no clang-format 10
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> PS G:\GitHub\ddnet> scripts/fix_style.py
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> Found no clang-format 10
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> ```
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> oh
19:39 < bridge_> <Peakies> i don't have it
19:39 < bridge_> <melo∆û> :justatest:

19:41 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
19:41 < bridge_> <melo∆û> on most modern distributions actually getting hands on clang-format 10 from their respective package managers is meh
19:41 < bridge_> <melo∆û> do it like furo says i guess :kek:
19:42 < bridge_> <Peakies> he's linux user
19:42 < bridge_> <Peakies> I'm on windows 11 üò¶
19:42 < bridge_> <melo∆û> just place clang-format-10 somewhere in your $PATH
19:43 < bridge_> <Peakies> oh I got it
19:52 < bridge_> <Peakies> nope still get same error
19:53 < bridge_> <Peakies> nope still getting same error
