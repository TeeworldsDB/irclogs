01:23 < Ameb> Is there a command to show an interface to choose a tee to spectate?
01:30 < jxsl13> there is
01:30 < jxsl13> shift maybe?
01:31 < jxsl13> look in your settings
01:32 <@heinrich5991> right shift by default I think
01:34 < Ameb> +spectate, thanks
13:34 < Ameb> Hello
14:48 <+o_be_one> hello
14:57 < Ameb> There is a blocker on novice GER
16:35 <@deen> Ameb: none of the mods are on IRC i think^^
16:35 < Ameb> :(
16:35 < Ameb> they should!
16:36 < Ameb> im kidding
16:37 < Ameb> Ryozuki: do u want to play with this noob?
16:38 < Soreu> I am xd though I neither saw blocker nor ameb online (~5 mins after message)
16:38 < Ameb> weird
16:39 < Ameb> by sure i was online o.o
16:40 <+Learath2> i said that like 60 times they really should be here ..
16:41 < Ameb> whatever
16:45 < Soreu> in general more guys should be there xd
16:45 < Soreu> look, community wanted shoutbox on forum, but nobody's joining irc :P
16:45 < Soreu> (including me)
16:49 <@deen> I guess most would prefer a forum shoutbox over irc
16:49 <@deen> h, i wrote that before reading that soreu wrote about shoutbox as well^^
16:49 <@deen> ha*
16:51 < Soreu> ^^
17:34 < Ameb> irc widget might be a solution
17:41 <+Nimda> Safe Place by Blue just released on Solo at 2016-01-13 17:21
