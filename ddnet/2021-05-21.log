06:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> can you maybe build a ping simulator inside anti ping?
06:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> because im used to 45 ms delay and 0 ms delay is confusing me
07:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> @louis im not joking
07:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> there's probably other people who'd find it useful
07:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëÄ antiantiping
08:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what is my brain doing, i meant "NOT a big deal"

09:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> holy moly
09:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yesterday master data is 6.6gb
09:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> compressed its 140m tho
09:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mb*
09:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only 4 seconds, my multithreaded parser rocks

09:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/teemasterparser>
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 140M/day =~ 50G/year
11:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not awful I guess but we'll need to find a storage box somewhere
11:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is without using the new http master serverfeature were servers can put any info they like
11:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a limit not yet decided
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unlikely to cause much bigger files. If people start abusing it as storage we can always sanitize it
11:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw how much of the info do we want to make freeform? It'd be nice to keep some parts standardized so we can parse it easily
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think the standard parts will be defined by how the clients parse the info data
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u dont need to enforce anything
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they will have to put x things or the client will simply not show anything
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uuh, hm maybe we should think this thru?
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what heinrich has in mind
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there should be a free form part so people can innovate without relying on upstream
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But without a standard part it can be annoying to get accurate statistics
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, @heinrich5991 gimme a message when you are here
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 am here
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the standardization comes from the client ignoring infos that don't have complete data (in its view)
12:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> similar to how server info was standardized before
12:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll eat something @Learath2, but I'll be back afterwards
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, but why do we need such flexibility with all parts of it? The server only accepting valid serverinfo makes sure we can parse everything cleanly
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and we can have a "extra" field for anything else they might want to put in there
13:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like it because it's the way it worked before
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `{"max_clients":12,"max_players":8,"passworded":false,"game_type":"DM","name":"Teeworlds.Net - Duel 1","map":{"name":"dm1"},"version":"0.7.5","clients":[]}}`
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this would be the "free form data"
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> {"addresses":["tw-0.7+udp://2.10.9.128:8305"],"location":"eu"} this is the data the master server adds
13:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. maybe the nodes 0.6 mod would like to advertise itself on the master server
13:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (like in 0.6 times)
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it doesn't care about ddnet client compatibility, because the protocol is incompatible anyway
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it could choose its own fields
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everything that wants to be compatible with the client needs to adhere to a certain structure, I don't think we're going to see deviation from it
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (because the client will drop it otherwise)
13:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but wouldn't just an "extra" field allow this?
13:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see what having the entire thing free-form allows us except open us to abuse
13:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I guess we can just limit the size if people abuse it, and if they send data incompatible with the client there is not much benefit in parsing it anyway
13:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> limit the size, definitely!
14:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 just to be clear, on new SDL2 versions there were not so big issues with resizing anymore, can we just update it? SDL releases 2.0.16 very soon, mayb we could update, so there are less bugs on mac?
14:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs then i dont see any reason not to make gfx_resizable 1 default again
14:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be tested on windows, that's where we had the massive performance issue
14:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On mac if I link to 2.0.16 resize works very nicely. Just needs one patch to react to one more sdl event
14:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And maybe you might want to batch it so it doesnt do 2 resize calls quickly
14:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for windows we dont need to update tho
14:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since it works there already
14:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah, we could also test it on windows again, so we dont have an outdated version for ever üòÑ
14:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> where i can download MinGW cross-compilers
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> <distro-name> mingw package
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> into your search engine
14:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> ok
14:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> what am I doing wrong

14:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> installed ddnet-libs
14:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also u on windows, so if u want mingw, search for mingw-w64 if you didnt already
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> how
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> git submodule init
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> git submodule update
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or download from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and put them into the ddnet-libs in the ddnet-master dir
14:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> oh yeah it works
14:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> troubleshooting god

14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> smooth criminal
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> why does your message has sound
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ikr, you could dance to it
14:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> why?
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª you're apparently on a cheat client discord. please leave it, cheats are not acceptable on ddnet
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> what
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <! –Ø—Å–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª> what a discord channel
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can discuss specifics in DM, I added you
15:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ any idea why someone might get a completely black screen trying to record ddnet with obs?
15:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> on windows?
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep win10
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in obs there is window recording and screen recording, he should try vice versa
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont remember if desktop recording worked for fullscreen, but window recording did pretty sure, as i used it
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Told him to give it a try, I still don't understand what we do so differently that borks recording software
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think thats windows integration of opengl
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just like printscreen doesnt work
15:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could imagine with GL on DX12 it works
15:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can record doom 2016 just fine and thats gl too iirc
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe not "real" fullscreen?
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I never use real fullscreen, maybe that's it
15:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the performance wouldnt drop so hard on windows we wouldnt need it, dunno if the compositors just sucks so hard or what causes it
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok it also has other advantages, like minimize on META key
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, we also have desktop fullscreen now, maybe it does better on windows, but no idea what it does under the hood
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast 1 person said his game runs smoother with it, but no idea why
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> could also just be that his GPU reports wrong video modes and desktop fullscreen just uses what the desktop uses or smth
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. our client doesnt respect monitor refresh rate rn
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok tbf, KDE's compositor also drops quite alot^^
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ borderless window works fine, guess it was the real full screen
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add server VIP
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> wut
19:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> maybe also portal gun
19:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :kek:
20:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> wdym!
