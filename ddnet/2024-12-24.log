00:26 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> one day you will get unlucky and the bleeding edge repo updates will brick your system
01:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can handle being unlucky once a decade, especially as I can fix it without doing anything special because it's such a delightfully simple distro to manage
01:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The days of rolling a D6 to see if your Xorg will break when you update ended forever ago
05:31 < bridge> <ceogran> After I am home I will add to the ai that it will be able to learn ddnet so at the end it would be possible to play ddnet
05:31 < bridge> <ceogran> After I am home I will add to the ai that it will be able to learn ddnet so at the end it would be possible to complete some maps
05:32 < bridge> <ceogran> If its not against ddnet rules :)
07:38 < bridge> <learath2> I've been hearing decent things about fedora for a long time now. But as it's the first distro to unleash the cancer that is systemd out into the world I will not be giving it a chance

09:39 < ChillerDragon> @0xdeen so sometimes the mouse is fully lost and i can not get it back in by moving it onto the screen then moving it onto the screen and toggeling the console helps you said it should happen every render? I assume closing the console does one  more thing that really helps
09:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That's really cool ASCII art, I think the weird angle is super neat
10:27 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes, closing the console refocuses the mouse
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse
10:50 < bridge> <animepdf> How to properly deal with utf8 inside ddnet code? I want to encode players' nicknames into ddnet-web like string, where special characters are being replaced with `-number-`, but I'm getting errors because my chars are obviously wrong
10:56 < bridge> <animepdf> Okay I think I got it
11:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> sorry, it's my own format, I think I should have used something standard instead
11:09 < ChillerDragon> @0xdeen what do you suggest i do here? try to patch ddnet to force refocus? or downgrade gnome?
11:10 < ChillerDragon> i wonder why i am the only one with this issue
11:10 < ChillerDragon> no other gnome arch users with multiple screens?
11:23 < bridge> <louis> ChillerDragon: what is your issue
11:23 < bridge> <louis> i think i have a related issue
11:24 < bridge> <louis> using mouse inside ddnet menu basically moves the cursor on my desktop and it'll freeze when it hits screen borders
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm is adding a type sanitizer
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a487b792e2da
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > C/C++ have type-based aliasing rules, and LLVM's optimizer can exploit
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > these given TBAA metadata added by Clang. Roughly, a pointer of given
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > type cannot be used to access an object of a different type (with, of

11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think ddnet does type punning
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is why we cant do lto iirc
11:48 < ChillerDragon> @louis i dont get freezes but my mouse escapes the ddnet window onto the second screen 
11:49 < bridge> <louis> yeah, i think i got that behavior if i connected multiple monitors, but i can re-test it later
11:49 < bridge> <louis> i'm using gnome on fedora with nightly ddnet but i don't think this occured before (the issue with single monitor)
11:49 < bridge> <louis> i wonder if you'd also get the issue using one monitor
12:03 < ChillerDragon> i think my issue is impossible with one monitor and fullscreen because then the mouse cant escape anywhere
12:04 < ChillerDragon> it might mess up your aim tho if the mouse can move freely instead of only the max mouse distance radius
12:05 < ChillerDragon> @louis i dont think its a new ddnet bug but a new gnome bug
12:07 < ChillerDragon> is halloween'ipo on this discord? or does someone know how to contact him?
12:22 < bridge> <louis> yeah, my issue was that the ddnet menu cursor would freeze when the desktop cursor hit the edge of the desktop.
13:17 < bridge> <0xdeen> I sometimes had this issue on macOS, maybe DDNet client should acquire mouse focus when we get the SDL event for window focus
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tbh relative mouse mode is simply a mess. Every backend behaves different on it.
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I do not understand why the OS itself doesn't simply ungrab the mouse if the window is inactive. Who needs relative mouse mode on an unfocused window realistically
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In fact I once tried to upstream it to sdl:
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/4683
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But seems they don't care that using relative mouse mode just sucks xD
13:39 < bridge> <louis> this just recently started happening for my ddnet
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah probs a gnome issue
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just use kde, all other window managers on linux are simply bad xD
13:40 < bridge> <louis> gnome better
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and wayland also still feels unfinished
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use it daily now, but always some annoying bugs xD
13:40 < bridge> <louis> how recent can the gnome issue be though? i can't remember this happening any more than a month ago
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you use arch?
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw
13:41 < bridge> <louis> fedora
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and was there some update last month?
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait do you use steam version or website?
13:41 < bridge> <louis> steam
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah tbh i think our steam version for linux is broken rn anyway
13:42 < bridge> <louis> 😟
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9242
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this only happens for me on the steam build
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so most likely the shipped sdl is broken
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @louis.place do you use wayland?
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with gnome
13:43 < bridge> <louis> yes
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they changed some protocol again lmao
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @louis.place can u try to see if website verison works
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then we'd at least know if it's sdl related
13:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Should I start building my own DDNet?
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean yes
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> program your own ddnet
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need competition
13:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I like the Steam playtime tracking but installing into steamapps/common seems somewhat annoying
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i solved the issue by only playing ddnet <30 min
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
13:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess I could just change the launch command
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9242#issuecomment-2483391370
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that guy even said a solution
13:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I played over 200h in a month because I'm mentally ill
13:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> For like my first two months
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the first years of teeworlds are addiction
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we all been through that
13:46 < bridge> <louis> but im lazy
13:46 < bridge> <louis> ill try
13:48 < bridge> <louis> hmm the website download has whole other issues
13:48 < bridge> <louis> i can only play 1440x960 although i'm on double that with 200% scaling
13:49 < bridge> <louis> can't seem to reproduce the cursor bug though
16:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok apparently sveltekit can bite you in the ass if you don't understand exactly how runes works
16:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
16:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> spent two hours rewriting most of my pages. a lot of search results are still for sveltekit 4. it's a bit confusing
17:28 < bridge> <zhn> thats why smushed default eyes are good, you always know what emotion it is
17:28 < bridge> <zhn> fuck fsf lol
18:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> half the db skins have default eyes
18:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if we make one default crying eye we can make a tool that replaces all the default ones
18:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and if i get bored enough i could help replace the rest
18:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> so: 
18:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 
18:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Angry: :signs: :fury: 😠

18:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Hurt: :sorry: :ouch: :oop:
18:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> dunno what we can change to a sad face
18:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or if we were to add more emotes
18:23 < bridge> <animepdf> @jupeyy_keks Anyway I can do CUi::DoButtonLogic with my own mousepos? I added component that uses remapped screen resolution and ui's mousepos is like 1/4's of my component's screen. I don't want to duplicate code for such minor stuff
18:26 < bridge> <animepdf> Also what is HotItem and ActiveItem, I couldn't understand purely from usages in code
18:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I kinda wish I could use the shocked emotes without changing my eyes... Maybe make emotes and eyes separate?
18:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 💀😑 and 💀😱 are very different in tone
18:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> theres a command for that
18:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> /eyeemote i think
18:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ah, I guess I should rtfm

20:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> magnificent
20:58 < bridge> <zhn> add mute and ban buttons with in place duration and reason fields
20:58 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
21:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> protocol expers here, what does sequence mean in the vital chunk header?
21:07 < bridge> <Sans> this needs to be merged holy
21:07 < bridge> <Sans> man you're making me want to rice up ddnet on my own
21:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> smash but the colored icons feel off fsr
21:48 < ChillerDragon> oof not being able to scroll while the demo menu is hidden is crazy annoying
21:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i wish there was a tile like speeders but it sets your speed to a specific amount
21:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> and maybe something to tp you to a direct coord
21:58 < bridge> <animepdf> white looked a little too plain to me, but yeah, im not very good with colors and stuff
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Every chunk header can contain a vital flag (MSGFLAG\_VITAL). Note that one teeworlds packet can contain multiple chunks. If said vital flag is set to true the receiving party has to increment a counter. This counter is called the sequence or acknowledge number. Client and server will send the amount of vital chunks they received as sequence number in the packet header
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/fundamentals.html#sequence_numbers
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In the packet header its amount received and in the chunk header its amount sent
22:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> thank you, i got it working by trial and error, but wasnt sure what i was doing
22:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> pretty much the connection part up to the EnterGame packet is done :P
22:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice
22:14 < bridge> <animepdf> @jupeyy_keks Any way I can do CUi::DoButtonLogic with my own mousepos? I added component that uses remapped screen resolution and ui's mousepos is like 1/4's of my component's screen. I don't want to duplicate code for such minor stuff
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i honestly dunno, maybe robyte can help.
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> havent touched ddnet ui code in like 2 years
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean there is always a way ig xd
22:43 < bridge> <teero777> F4 I don't want my mouse unlocked while looking at the scoreboard
22:43 < bridge> <animepdf> i kinda just made implementation myself, referencing emoticon menu, and for some reason sometimes clicks don't count lol, but i didn't debug this yet
22:44 < bridge> <Sans> It's pretty inline with other games I play ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
22:44 < bridge> <animepdf> don't worry, i don't think i will pr this, also it's locking/unlocking with key
22:44 < bridge> <teero777> Ah ok
22:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg the server is working
22:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1321232256576258119/image.png?ex=676c7ced&is=676b2b6d&hm=ecedc6141a914743ec8b1683bd806bcfeb9fa1efab8f6bed1a200c6d73b8832f&
22:45 < bridge> <Sans> To be fair, it would be nice to have a hotkey to toggle the mouse on tab, that way you don't loose the freedom of looking around with tab open, and if you want those nice and juicy quick actions you can toggle ur mouse, and do whatever
22:45 < bridge> <Sans> kinda like in shooter games (cs2, val)
22:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh god thanks heinrich i love u for libtw2
22:45 < bridge> <Sans> nooo, pls do, it's too good
22:45 < bridge> <animepdf> tf2 was insipration xd
22:46 < bridge> <Sans> nice
22:51 < bridge> <robyt3> You can't use most UI functions outside of components that update the UI (menus and editor). I think the first step towards a clean solution would be to also use separate `CUi` instances for emoticon/spectator/scoreboard and update those like the menus/editor UI.
22:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> Just having this in a custom client would be sick
22:55 < bridge> <robyt3> The hot item it the top-most UI element that was hovered in the previous frame. The active item is the UI element that is being activated in the current frame. Only the hot item can become the active item.
22:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1321235555459006508/image.png?ex=676c7fff&is=676b2e7f&hm=0e4331745b11a3ded1ab05aa8ed64f217c384422a690b301d1b80abd8e5ff301&
22:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> why it do that
22:59 < bridge> <animepdf> the 'top-most' factor aka z-index is calculated just by render order or I can manually specify what should be on top?
22:59 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, the last UI element being rendered at that position
23:00 < bridge> <animepdf> oki, thanks. can't think of usage tbh, but will kow it exists
23:00 < bridge> <animepdf> oki, thanks. can't think of usage tbh, but will know it exists
23:01 < bridge> <robyt3> It's for example to handle popup menus where UI elements in the popup are rendered above those in the regular UI
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Of you only looked at the position then you could activate UI elements below the active popup menu
23:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> can this be patched or something
23:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> happens when i just go afk
23:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> and do nothing
23:04 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> monitor was off but idk if it affects anything
