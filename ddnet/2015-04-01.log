11:49 <@deen> Hm, we have no April's joke for today
11:49 <@deen> Last year I enabled pistol to make damage in ddrace
11:52 <@deen> I also had a client with multi-mouse support, so you can aim weapons with 1 mouse and aim hook with another, that was fun
12:26 < fstd> take all server offline, declare ddnet is rakt
12:26 < fstd> rekt, too
12:28 <@deen> yes, would be soo funny!
12:34 < fstd> >.>
12:34 < fstd> then launch in-app purchases or pay2win or something
12:35 <@deen> At least we have a new logo now: http://ddnet.tw/
13:09 < laxadedi_> deen: are you kidding ?
13:09 < laxadedi_> I just bought a t-shirt with the logo !
13:09 < laxadedi_> ah
13:09 < laxadedi_> it's april first joke :D
13:13 <@deen> haha
13:13 <@deen> I guess you could buy one with the new logo too?
13:14 < Nimda> Brown Suger by  just released on Solo at 2015-04-01 13:11
14:39 < laxadedi> Hey, do you use an IDE for programming ? Which one or what text editor if you don't use one ?
14:53 <@deen> vim
15:14 < o_be_one> hi
15:23 < Learath2> tad bit late but sublime text laxadedi
15:37 <@deen> Hi Lady
15:37 < Lady> hi deen
17:16 <@EastByte> vim++
17:16 <@EastByte> laxadedi: that makes two votes for vim
17:17 <@EastByte> deen: I mixed up vim and nim so many times now
17:29 <@deen> should have stayed with the name vimrod
17:29 < Learath2> i tried vim has a way too big learning curve with all the buttons
17:30 < Learath2> used to have a vim cheatsheet taped on my desk
17:46 < fstd> the learning curve isn't that steep actually; you can do everything with only a handful of keys
17:46 < fstd> everything beyond that makes you do things faster, but isn't strictly required
17:47 < fstd> so just get familiar with the basics, then learn the rest one bite at a time
17:47 < fstd> plus you're already comfy with hjkl, as i know for a fact ;P
17:55 <@deen> Lady: you spying here?
17:55 < Lady> yep but shhh
17:58 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

18:19 < fstd> ^ they know how to april fools!
18:19 < fstd> although needs javascript, as usual >.>
18:55 < Learath2> i should get back to playin nethack 
18:55 < fstd> ping me if you do ;P
18:56 < Learath2> fstd: highly addictive tho not sure if i want to get stuck with it again
18:57 < fstd> actually i'll have to, too
18:57  * fstd recently discovered that he has been kicked off his #1 throne on https://un.nethack.nu/highscores
18:57 < fstd> but i'm not sure if i want to play unnethack again, my last game ended in repeated segfaults + manual recovery by octe
18:58 < fstd> and at some point, it wasn't recoverable so i was SOL
18:59 < fstd> wow i can't believe i have played over 1k games there
19:01 <@deen> jente sounds like another TW guy
19:03 <@deen> ahaha
19:03 <@deen> this guy
19:03 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1273&p=12500
19:14 < Learath2> lel nico the best
19:14 < Learath2> in mood to finish up the updater but im just not sure how to handle this dll thing
19:15 <@deen> hm
19:15 <@deen> rename dlls?
19:15 < Learath2> we run in the same problem 
19:15 <@deen> deprecate windows support and suggest to use linux instead?
19:15 < Learath2> :D
19:16 < Learath2> idk why windows releases the process handles before completely cleaning up ....
19:16 < Learath2> windows is so inconsistent that it looks like it was made by me
19:17 <@deen> Write that into your application to Microsoft
19:17 < fstd> so that's why you use it.. i always wondered
19:17 < Learath2> fstd: i have no idea why i still use this thing 
19:17 < Learath2> i think its something about the 750$ gfx card that becomes a toaster on linux
19:18 <@deen> Lady: like this:
19:18 <@deen> !en-de deprecate
19:18 < Nimda> Translation: missbilligen
19:19 < Lady> !en-pl deprecate
19:19 < Nimda> Translation: potępiać
19:19 < fstd> Learath2: onboard graphic chips tend to work okay and not become toasters
19:19 < fstd> although now that linux is becoming more and more shitty anyway, probably not worth to switch in the first place
19:19 < Learath2> fstd: what to do with my expensive gfx card then
19:19 <@deen> Learath2: sell and play TW instead!
19:19 < fstd> idk, use it in a windows box?
19:20 < Lady> hat Nimda was mit Nim zu tun? deen 
19:20 < Learath2> well its my birthday tomorrow so ill just ask for some moniez and complete my linux box 
19:20 <@deen> Lady: no
19:20 <@deen> Lady: it's written by noother
19:20 < Learath2> !decide i belong to deen or i belong to noother
19:20 < Nimda> Learath2: i belong to deen
19:20 < Learath2> see 
19:20 < Lady> whaat

19:21 < Lady> I like him
19:22 <@deen> !wtf lady

19:22 < Lady> wtf
19:22 <@deen> !wtf wtf
19:22 < Nimda> The World Taekwondo Federation. WTF, holds many competitions throughout the world.
19:22 < Nimda> Example: WTF, as far as i know, remain blissfully unaware of the other meaning of WTF. Or maybe they just don9t feel like changing.
19:23 < Learath2> !decide !decide or !decide 
19:23 < Nimda> Learath2: !decide
19:23 < Lady> !wtf deen
19:23 < Nimda> Arabic word for religion, faith. There are several meanings of Deen. One meaning is honour, government, empire, monarchy and rulership. The second meaning is quite opposite to it, i.e. subordination, obedience, slavery, servitude and subjection. Third meaning is to account, to give judgment, and dispense reward and punishment of actions. The word Deen has been used in the Qur9an in all these three meanings.
19:23 < Nimda> Example: "Deen with Allah is al-Islam" and | "And whoso seeketh as Deen other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him."
19:23 < Lady> wtf is that
19:23 < fstd> >.>
19:24 < Lady> !wtf jola
19:24 < Nimda> meaning "no way" or "ha, not" or "joke"
19:24 < Nimda> Example: "Are you going to the game Friday?" | "Jola! I9ve got better things to do."
19:24 < Learath2> !wtf Lady
19:24 < Nimda> Something most Men don9t treat right.
19:24 <@deen> Jola!
19:24 < Nimda> Example: I know how to treat a lady.
19:26 < Lady> !wtf ddnet
19:26 < Nimda> ddnet has no definition. Feel free to add one at http://www.urbandictionary.com/add.php?word=ddnet
19:26 < Learath2> deen: a sleep(100) should make it work 92.8% of times
19:26 < Learath2> !wtf ddrace
19:26 < Nimda> ddrace has no definition. Feel free to add one at http://www.urbandictionary.com/add.php?word=ddrace
19:26 <@deen> Learath2: =/
19:26 < Learath2> it used to have a definition
19:26 <@deen> !wtf teeworlds
19:26 < Nimda> teeworlds has no definition. Feel free to add one at http://www.urbandictionary.com/add.php?word=teeworlds
19:26 <@deen> maybe they are like wikipedia and remove irrelevant stuff
19:27 < Learath2> <sarcasm>totally not madeup statistics</sarcasm>
19:27 <@deen> !wtf tee
19:27 < Nimda> T-shirt - casual wear for all ages.

19:28 < fstd> !say foo'bar
19:28 < fstd> !decide foo'bar or foo'bar
19:28 < Nimda> fstd: foo'bar
19:29 < fstd> http://penenen.de/
19:29 < fstd> http://penenen.de/index.php
19:29 < fstd> didn't it use to announce the title when a link it posted?
19:31 < Learath2> might be disabled on this channel
19:32 <@deen> I've only seen it with YT links
19:33 < fstd> http://goo.gl/BskHE1
19:33 <@deen> otherwise it would be fun to break nimda with a 140 MB GIF: http://ddnet.tw/prince.gif
19:33 < fstd> heh.  some bots do it only for shortened links
19:34 < fstd> well w/e.  interesting bug anyway
19:36 < Learath2> fstd: your small hack does work
19:36 < Learath2> can cast handle to unsigned char
19:37 < fstd> oh that.  yeah that's because every object's representation can safely be accessed through an unsigned char *
19:38 < fstd> i guess that's why it doesn't break, i believe it's still UB though
19:38 < fstd> in your particular case
19:38 < Learath2> why ?
19:39 < Learath2> HANDLE is just a void *
19:39 < fstd> don't remember the exact code
19:40 < fstd> maybe i'm mixing it up and it was allright, too:)
19:40 < fstd> s/ll/l/
19:49 < Learath2> fstd: will play nethack
19:49 < fstd> on NAO?
19:49 < Learath2> yep
19:52 < fstd> erm is my terminal fucked or are the messages somewhat messed up to you too?
19:53 < Learath2> yep messages are fucked up fstd 
19:53 < Learath2> no idea why
19:53 < Learath2> april fools ?
19:53 < fstd> ah, duh
19:53 < fstd> why didn't i think of that myself :D
22:13 <@deen> Learath2: hm, so the autoupdater doesn't work on winxp now, does it?
22:14 < Learath2> deen: doesnt
22:14 < eeeee> should autoupdate the windows first
22:14 <@deen> =/
22:15 <@deen> so i should probably not release a new client version yet?
22:15 <@deen> because we really need it for a tournament
22:31 < Learath2> how many winxp users do we even
22:31 < Learath2> at max they'll need to download 2 manually
22:32 < eeeee> if they don't care enough to update their windoze, i think they will never update their ddnet client either
23:18 <@deen> well, it's a few more i think
23:18 <@deen> i got about 5 complaints about not being able to update
23:18 <@deen> all on winxp from what i can tell
