00:18 < ChillerDragon> which servers are you even intrested in @mJ2P7Wuf ? btw all the data from my vanilla ctf5 servers is public here https://github.com/chillavanilla/TEMdata/blob/master/tem.db but it only tracks the amount of kills not the game over scoreboard
00:20 < ChillerDragon> but ddnet has a `cl_auto_csv` @mJ2P7Wuf which claims to "Automatically create game over csv" i never used it but it seems to do exactly what you want. And the headless client can do that too. with this branch you can join to 0.7 servers with ddnet https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949
01:00 < bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks yo why tf is the hammer centered while looking left and offset a little while looking right? :thonk:
01:01 < bridge> <Patiga> I do like the right-looking hammer better tho
01:01 < bridge> <Patiga> fight me
04:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Hi
04:38 < bridge> <TheDominator> what developers do on ddnet ?
04:38 < bridge> <TheDominator> i play ddnet for sometime and i didn't see developers do anything
04:38 < bridge> <TheDominator> i play ddnet for sometime and i didn't see developers do anything useful
04:39 < bridge> <TheDominator> or change something in the game all credit goes to map builders
04:39 < bridge> <Ewan> what do u expect them to do
04:39 < bridge> <TheDominator> like add more features to the game maybe ?
04:39 < bridge> <Ewan> they do add new features
04:39 < bridge> <Ewan> compare to vanilla
04:39 < bridge> <TheDominator> where ? i didn't notice any changes
04:39 < bridge> <TheDominator> i compare it to ddnet from 1 year ago
04:40 < bridge> <TheDominator> and nothing really changed only skins and some new maps
04:40 < bridge> <Ewan> how are they gonna make new changes relevant to you if 95% of the maps are too old to use the new features
04:40 < bridge> <TheDominator> i mean i've suggested a feature like while ago
04:40 < bridge> <Ewan> what is it
04:40 < bridge> <TheDominator> and you guys didn't even know how to do it
04:40 < bridge> <TheDominator> to increase maps to 128 instead of 64
04:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they add new map features when mapper wants it
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> 128 what
04:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for player count
04:41 < bridge> <TheDominator> for ex there is servers for multieasy gets maxed from 6 to 10 pm
04:41 < bridge> <TheDominator> and people can't join
04:41 < bridge> <TheDominator> 128 player of course
04:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's just old code base
04:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not worth doing it for breaking up with teewolds
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it wouldn't be hard to do
04:41 < bridge> <TheDominator> i asked someone here he said it's too hard
04:41 < bridge> <TheDominator> to change it from 64 to more
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it would make a big rift between older versions of the game
04:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes
04:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but they don't work across clients, only on ddnet
04:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> of course if you can do it backwards compatibly, you can submit pull request
04:42 < bridge> <TheDominator> we should make a change  i think why you expect all people to play with old clients they should update !
04:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this is a open source game, no dev is actively working for ddnet
04:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's not possible for teeworlds
04:43 < bridge> <TheDominator> i know but how many contributors on github ?!
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> have u ever played a vanilla server on ddnet… the amount of backwards compatible code written specifically to support that is insane. why would they just throw that away
04:43 < bridge> <Skeith> Sitting / running animation, strong nameplates, new hud? Weren't these all added around a year ago
04:43 < bridge> <Skeith> There are some notable changes
04:43 < bridge> <TheDominator> maybe you can make like a version selector like minecraft ... ?
04:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> he just want the 128 player esrver
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> whyyy
04:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if he care about client features he wouldn't be here
04:43 < bridge> <Skeith> 128 player servers would be a shitshow, no?
04:44 < bridge> <TheDominator> because if they want to select the newest version and u can put all nice updates to it
04:44 < bridge> <TheDominator> add more weapons and mods
04:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> never gonna happen
04:44 < bridge> <TheDominator> make the community skin as standard
04:44 < bridge> <TheDominator> so everyone can see it
04:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have community skin
04:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also skins.tw exists
04:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it is standard
04:44 < bridge> <TheDominator> but it's disabled by default
04:44 < bridge> <Ewan> dont think so
04:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is disabled by default. but does it matter
04:44 < bridge> <TheDominator> no i swear it comes disabled a lot of people don't see my skin
04:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> only you want to see them
04:44 < bridge> <Skeith> It is, but it's easy to see and enable
04:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you enable them
04:45 < bridge> <TheDominator> yeah but why everyone have to go to settings and try to find it and then enable it specifically to see my skin ?
04:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not everyone wants them
04:45 < bridge> <Ewan> if u want 128 players u just need to change a few instances of array access and a slightly beefier host. if it’s so easy you can do it
04:45 < bridge> <TheDominator> it should be enabled by default if u guys are adding more skins
04:45 < bridge> <TheDominator> That's not what the other guy said he said it's too hard
04:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm pretty sure ddnet skins are being added alongside with community skins.
04:46 < bridge> <Skeith> Because it has a lot of skins that are out of place for the game, it's understandable
04:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> speaking of beefier hos
04:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> speaking of beefier host
04:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it
04:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not free tho
04:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be hard to keep compatibility. not to add the feature
04:47 < bridge> <Ewan> if u want 128 players u just need to change a few instances of array declarations & accesses and a slightly beefier host. if it’s so easy you can do it
04:47 < bridge> <TheDominator> you should make some statistics and see which players play that maps and that mod
04:47 < bridge> <TheDominator> if most of players play new maps and new ddnet then u can just go ahead and remove backwards compatibility
04:47 < bridge> <TheDominator> or make it as old version ..
04:47 < bridge> <Skeith> If it were up to me, I'd have a less strict system for skins, and just make disabling a specific skin easier, if you dislike it
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also you can never expect a free community to do everything nowadays. even open-source contributors for libraries has salaries now
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet contributors has nothing
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and people have lives to live
04:48 < bridge> <TheDominator> you can just go to chatgpt and say how can i do this
04:48 < bridge> <TheDominator> boom
04:48 < bridge> <TheDominator> u got the solution
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can do it
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and contribute
04:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> please
04:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you want something, just do it and submit
04:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not that hard
04:49 < bridge> <TheDominator> but if the github repo owners are old minded they not gonna accept my pull requests !
04:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but you haven't even submit a draft yet
04:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you do know pull request goes through reviews and changes right?
04:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it is so easy, wouldn't take you so much effort to begin with anyway
04:50 < bridge> <TheDominator> yes ik but if i know they think like that so why would i even try to put some hard work into that thing btw
04:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> again
04:50 < bridge> <TheDominator> i don't have any experience or previous knowledge with teeworlds or ddnet
04:50 < bridge> <TheDominator> codebase
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> fair
04:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't either, and I rewrote the entire text renderer engine just to let teeworlds display CJK languages
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> others have added this functionality already. fokko’s does 128 iirc
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> just look at what they do
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> backport
04:51 < bridge> <TheDominator> and also there is a good feature u can add in the feature and it's not gonna break anything it's like i can mark some people as enemies and others as friends or team mates and when i hit X or whatever button it goes into xray mode and show me friends in blue and enemies in red and others in black or any color 
04:51 < bridge> <TheDominator> 
04:51 < bridge> <TheDominator> and tells me where is my enemy coming closer to me like  a meter counter or something
04:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @Ewan Green btw you really are a ddnet player now huh
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> common fred W
04:52 < bridge> <TheDominator> like ur enemy is 55.m away from u
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah LOL
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> 1200 points as of yesterday
04:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh
04:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet doesn't have emenies tho
04:52 < bridge> <TheDominator> why you don't have the dev role ?
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> I don’t maintain ddnet
04:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz he is not a dev for ddnet?
04:53 < bridge> <TheDominator> k i thought he is a dev or smnth
04:53 < bridge> <TheDominator> k i thought he is a dev or smth
04:53 < bridge> <TheDominator> k i thought he is a dev or smth here
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i dev ddnet but i dont dev for ddnet
04:53 < bridge> <TheDominator> wtf ?
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> if u know what im saying
04:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can make fun stuff with ddnet
04:53 < bridge> <TheDominator> are you a millionaire ?
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> im a bit of a philanthropist
04:54 < bridge> <TheDominator> wtf is that it's first time to see this
04:54 < bridge> <TheDominator> wtf is that it's first time to see this word
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> im just kidding
04:54 < bridge> <TheDominator> we didn't take it at class
04:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @Ewan Green gotta go back to work now btw. have fun
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> peace
04:54 < bridge> <TheDominator> cheers for the work u don't get paid for have a good dayt
04:54 < bridge> <TheDominator> cheers for the work u don't get paid for have a good day
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody here gets paid for this
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> donations go to ddnet server costs
04:55 < bridge> <TheDominator> that's because you are not thinking with a business mindset
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s bigger than me buddy
04:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet is not a business period
04:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm closing discord lol
04:55 < bridge> <TheDominator> you can make perks and roles and stuff in game and people can buy it
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like hell
04:55 < bridge> <TheDominator> and make some money to pay for the costs
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i would not play that game
04:55 < bridge> <TheDominator> and then also pay for devs and develop a great community
04:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also not possible
04:56 < bridge> <TheDominator> u can even make ur own separate version from teeworlds
04:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just make a new game
04:56 < bridge> <TheDominator> yes money can do anything for you
04:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh i think i'm stuck here lol
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> this convo going nowhere anyway
04:57 < bridge> <TheDominator> there is billions of people play fortinet and csgo and they pay $$
04:57 < bridge> <TheDominator> why not for ddnet
04:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 1/10000th of ppl play this game
04:57 < bridge> <TheDominator> you have to market it then !
04:57 < bridge> <TheDominator> and add more features
04:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 1/10000th of the amount of ppl who play those play this game
04:57 < bridge> <TheDominator> and then people will come
04:57 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
04:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> again
04:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do it yourself
04:58 < bridge> <TheDominator> That's not my game to do it but i would do it if it was my  game
04:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the MIT license allows you to commercialize the game
04:58 < bridge> <Ewan> ya man nothings stopping you from doing it
04:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you don't call it ddnet
04:58 < bridge> <Ewan> thus is nobody’s game
04:58 < bridge> <Ewan> this is nobody’s game
04:58 < bridge> <TheDominator> this is dan game
04:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can fork it, add new features and IAP, submit to steam
04:58 < bridge> <Ewan> deen is the honcho but he doesn’t have the power to do that kind of pay to win shit
04:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> boom
04:59 < bridge> <TheDominator> what does honcho means ?
04:59 < bridge> <Skeith> He could
04:59 < bridge> <Ewan> ehhh
04:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well ye technically he can
04:59 < bridge> <Ewan> he would need new code
04:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nap
04:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah
04:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the license allows for it
05:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i mean he can’t do it with ddnet codebase
05:00 < bridge> <Ewan> non discriminatory foss license
05:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think he can tho?
05:00 < bridge> <Skeith> He owns ddnet
05:00 < bridge> <TheDominator> what is the language that ddnet working on ?
05:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I though we are not copyleft
05:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I thought we are not copyleft
05:00 < bridge> <Ewan> he prolly have to fork… irrelevant anyway cuz nobody would buy into it
05:00 < bridge> <TheDominator> is ddnet made with python ?
05:00 < bridge> <Ewan> no
05:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> C++
05:00 < bridge> <Ewan> cpp
05:00 < bridge> <TheDominator> oh
05:01 < bridge> <TheDominator> that's hard bro
05:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> python is for some codege
05:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> python is for some codegen
05:01 < bridge> <TheDominator> how to do all that graphics and animations with cpp
05:01 < bridge> <Ewan> in a few years maybe u can do some meaningful stuff in rust
05:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> c++ is hard lmao
05:01 < bridge> <Ewan> but atm it’s all cpp
05:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not standard
05:01 < bridge> <Ewan> in ddnet it’s raw rendering
05:01 < bridge> <TheDominator> ik u took some stuff from teeworlds
05:01 < bridge> <Ewan> textures and shit
05:01 < bridge> <TheDominator> and developed on it
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet has existing abstractions
05:02 < bridge> <TheDominator> what about directx ?
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> naw
05:02 < bridge> <TheDominator> i heard that directx 13 is better than opengl
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> so what
05:02 < bridge> <TheDominator> it's supported on gta v
05:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you should know that teeworlds was developed with cross-platform in mind. directx does not exist on linux
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesn’t make it magically supported in ddnet
05:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also vulkan is basically the same as dx12
05:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> dx13 does not exist btw
05:03 < bridge> <Ewan> very similar api and perf
05:03 < bridge> <TheDominator> i mean seriously linux is just for development who would want to play games on linux ?
05:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also why would a 2d game need tessellation and compute shaders and stuff anyway
05:03 < bridge> <TheDominator> imagine running fortinet or csgo on linux that shit is broken
05:03 < bridge> <Ewan> >3/4 of ddnet devs
05:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> most ddnet dev run linux. and it was originated as a hobby project of a swedish man who developed it on linux
05:04 < bridge> <TheDominator> idk i'm just sayin maybe it has some features for 2d games also
05:04 < bridge> <Ewan> just quads brah
05:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> graphics libraries really does not have any fancy features. everything compute shader can do, a cpu can also do
05:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can do everything modern graphical features on cpu and it would still be fine for the scope and the intensity we are rendering things
05:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can do most modern graphical features on cpu and it would still be fine for the scope and the intensity we are rendering things
05:05 < bridge> <Ewan> generally speaking
05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> you’d need to cache way more for it to perform
05:06 < bridge> <TheDominator> linux is just not for games it's not compatible with a lot of programs and games from windows
05:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also we are already on vulkan anyway
05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> software rendered ddnet would probably chug
05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> huh
05:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so? that's not he point
05:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so? that's not the point
05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> who installs an OS just to play games
05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> there are many other reasons to use linux
05:06 < bridge> <TheDominator> everything thing has it's own benefits don't just put everything in one basket
05:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> exactly?
05:07 < bridge> <Ewan> which is what we are doing by keeping ddnet cross platform
05:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so we support like 4 OSs
05:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well maybe 6, i lost tracks
05:07 < bridge> <TheDominator> windows is good for programs and games it's supported by most of the companies world wide 90% of people use it
05:07 < bridge> <TheDominator> only 10% use linux as desktop experience
05:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Okay
05:07 < bridge> <Ewan> And
05:07 < bridge> <TheDominator> and that's why linux is just for development not for gaming
05:07 < bridge> <TheDominator> it's not designed for gaming
05:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so?
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> So what
05:08 < bridge> <TheDominator> u can have both windows and linux
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> What if I have it installed for development but wanna play a game now and then
05:08 < bridge> <TheDominator> u can then switch to windows
05:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah idk at this point
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> Just laughing
05:08 < bridge> <TheDominator> most of the games are not supported on linux
05:08 < bridge> <TheDominator> how would you play fortinnet for ex
05:09 < bridge> <Ewan> Where have you been the past 18 months
05:09 < bridge> <Ewan> Have u not heard about proton and steam deck and shit
05:09 < bridge> <TheDominator> i heard about something broken starting with wine thing
05:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
05:09 < bridge> <TheDominator> xD
05:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> anyway. it doesn't matter how you think about linux
05:10 < bridge> <TheDominator> proton is a vpn ?
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
05:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have people use linux, we can't drop them for YOUR convenience
05:11 < bridge> <TheDominator> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1099532922404487228/image.png
05:11 < bridge> <TheDominator> i didn't say don't use linux i said use everything depending on it's uses cases
05:11 < bridge> <Ewan> I think he just wants to argue anyway because all of this was only brought up when he proposed DirectX as a long shot
05:11 < bridge> <TheDominator> everything has it's own benefits
05:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> vulkan is identical to dx12
05:12 < bridge> <TheDominator> can we add ray tracing to ddnet ?
05:12 < bridge> <TheDominator> :3
05:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Literally how
05:13 < bridge> <TheDominator> lmao yes i want to talk i'm alone and i don't have friends and i'm broken
05:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Go find somewhere else to argue about nothing
05:13 < bridge> <TheDominator> that's why i'm talking with devs
05:13 < bridge> <TheDominator> :V
05:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 1cc might be a good place for that
05:13 < bridge> <TheDominator> i only have 1 friend
05:13 < bridge> <TheDominator> she is a yellow duck
05:13 < bridge> <TheDominator> :V
05:14 < bridge> <TheDominator> when i make any mistake in a code or i'm stuck i go ask her
05:14 < bridge> <Ewan> This is off topic now
05:14 < bridge> <TheDominator> wtf really i thought the yellow duck is related to devs :3
05:15 < bridge> <TheDominator> btw i want to ask you some questions like for real
05:15 < bridge> <TheDominator> how long is the ddnet player chain ?
05:15 < bridge> <TheDominator> if someone hook in a wall and we pull him it exapnds
05:15 < bridge> <TheDominator> can it go all the map ?
05:15 < bridge> <TheDominator> i'm just curious to know
05:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> infinite
05:16 < bridge> <TheDominator> oh okay ty
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Some maps u can see
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Older maps that let you outside bounds
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Jet pack at end
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> W/e
05:16 < bridge> <TheDominator> if it gets so long sometimes i see it disappear
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Weird
05:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw, all conversation in #developer are logged. I hope you know that you are contributing to future AI trainings
05:16 < bridge> <TheDominator> on multieasy if someone hooked long distance in spawn the chain disappears
05:17 < bridge> <Ewan> xddd
05:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i love to see those logs
05:17 < bridge> <TheDominator> all discord messages are logged
05:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://ddnet.org/irclogs/
05:17 < bridge> <Ewan> Not the same
05:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean publicly available to all search engines
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> omg they are logged oof
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> xD
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> why are they being logged ?
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> i made history mum yayy
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> i'm on ddnet logs xD
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> they are across a bunch of platofmrs now
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> it will be there for years
05:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think it's a irc tradition sinc irc does not have logged built in
05:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think it's a irc tradition sinc irc does not have log built in
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> they are across a bunch of platforms now
05:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just for irc people to find information
05:18 < bridge> <TheDominator> if i remove a message here will it be removed there ?
05:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this channel is not discord only
05:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nope
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> No

05:20 < bridge> <Ewan> It’s day by day
05:21 < bridge> <TheDominator> ye i see
05:21 < bridge> <TheDominator> why people still mention irc
05:21 < bridge> <TheDominator> i think that expired 2000 years ago
05:21 < bridge> <Ewan> sum ppl chat there
05:21 < bridge> <TheDominator> that's like from windows xp
05:21 < bridge> <Ewan> chillerdragon is either irc or matrix i dont remember
05:21 < bridge> <Ewan> and he talks here a lot
05:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> some people does not like non foss softwares
05:22 < bridge> <Ewan> crazy how matricks doesn’t use matrix for this…
05:22 < bridge> <TheDominator> what does "non foss" means
05:22 < bridge> <Ewan> proprietary
05:22 < bridge> <TheDominator> as an AI i cannot understand that term
05:22 < bridge> <TheDominator> xD
05:22 < bridge> <TheDominator> *i should not tell him that i'm an AI remove the message*
05:22 < bridge> <TheDominator> i didn't take it at class
05:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Closed source software
05:23 < bridge> <TheDominator> oh okay
05:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> has anybody seen matricks all these years
05:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah he has chatted a little recently
05:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Here
05:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wtf when
05:23 < bridge> <Ewan> U can search from
05:23 < bridge> <TheDominator> how to use the irc chat ?
05:23 < bridge> <Ewan> U can search from: matricks
05:23 < bridge> <TheDominator> so i can chat here also ?
05:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Get irc client
05:24 < bridge> <Ewan> Connect to chatroom
05:24 < bridge> <Ewan> Chat away
05:24 < bridge> <TheDominator> only 3 steps
05:24 < bridge> <TheDominator> that's too easy to do
05:24 < bridge> <TheDominator> i will just chat here
05:24 < bridge> <TheDominator> i only take hard missions
05:24 < bridge> <Ewan> U can get matrix and go hard mode
05:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> basde
05:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> based
07:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> chillerbot.github.io has something very similar. You can mark names in the colors green, black and red
07:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@TheDominator)
07:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dunno. Maybe because the feet also are a bit offset
08:14 < ChillerDragon> daily jopsti ddnet code base quiz! Is the string "We like bacon" in the ddnet/ddnet git history @Jupstar ✪
08:22 < ChillerDragon> I added like one or two additional ddnet messages. Combined with the new kill msg I exceed the PACKER_BUFFER_SIZE ._. i assume this will happen to ddnet soon too then
08:51 < bridge> <Voxel> has voxel's shitty pull requests gone too far?? more on that later after 5. back to you, charlie.
08:52 < ChillerDragon> xd
08:52 < ChillerDragon> in case it isnt obvious. You broke nothing :)
08:53 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah but still
08:53 < bridge> <Voxel> at least this gives everyone more of a chance to make teeworlds safer
08:53 < bridge> <Voxel> i said that wrong
08:53 < ChillerDragon> Actually i havent even seen the new stuff yet. I played with the new kill msg stuff all day yesterday and didnt see it i guess its only if teams are in use right?
08:53 < bridge> <Voxel> it's only in teams, and only is a team started
08:54 < bridge> <Voxel> it's only in teams, and only if a team started
08:54 < ChillerDragon> yea cring teams
08:54 < ChillerDragon> well now im curious xd
08:54 < bridge> <Voxel> i didn't like how the killfeed was just spammed with names when a large group died
08:56 < bridge> <Voxel> Chiller look at top right

08:57 < ChillerDragon> yea im not downloading this mp4 from discord xd
08:57 < ChillerDragon> ima just go in game sec
09:05 < ChillerDragon> how often are official ddnet servers updated? 
09:06 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1099592064515199086/image.png
09:08 < bridge> <deen> when i feel like recompiling, not automatically
09:08 < ChillerDragon> so unrelated to tags etc and not on restart or empty
09:08 < ChillerDragon> here u go @Voxel some unpaid deen slave has to rebuild servers first xd
09:09 < bridge> <deen> building it now
09:09 < ChillerDragon> poggies
09:09 < bridge> <Voxel> LOL thanks
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: hopefully not, so i say no
09:23 < ChillerDragon> wrong xd

09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😭
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> teetow, explain yourself
09:25 < ChillerDragon> axaxax
09:25 < ChillerDragon> to his defense back when this was done half of the ddnet playerbase was not born yet
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru story
09:27 < ChillerDragon> it was before woke vegan movement. Nowerdays advertising bacon would not be brand safe.
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now u say bacon-like
09:28 < ChillerDragon> yes
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hipster jupstar
09:28 < ChillerDragon> xd
09:36 < bridge> <Огурец> Hi, do I need to change the dll files to create a client? If yes, then how, there are just signs and numbers scattered
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u need to know c++
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u never coded before i guess u shoudl start watching tutorials on youtube xd
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or take programming classes
09:38 < ChillerDragon> what client do you need?
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u can also be an alien, and modify the dlls and .exe directly
09:39 < ChillerDragon> s/alien/top g haxor/
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a.k.a. Learath
09:39 < ChillerDragon> china style
09:40 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/MageDelfador/DDNet-show-points-in-game
09:45 < bridge> <Огурец> I just don't understand how to change the client itself, I'll figure out programming. Which files need to be changed and so on
09:46 < bridge> <Огурец> Are these files that need to be changed?
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well if u dont understand programming thats obvious.
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd need at least 1 month to explain it to you
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for scoreboard u need to change scoreboard.cpp
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> etc.
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u also have to understand compilers
09:48 < bridge> <Огурец> типо intellij IDEA?
09:48 < bridge> <Огурец> intellij IDEA?
09:49 < bridge> <Огурец> like this?
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can use it probably yeah
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it works for cpp too
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they call it differently, i dunno
09:50 < bridge> <Огурец> OK, thanks for the answer
09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clion is the one from jetbrains
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> @Огурец Here is a quick rundown of the steps you would need to take in order to change the client
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> 1. Get the source code from <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet>
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> 2. Edit the source files in a way that gets the custom behavior you want (this is obviously the challenging part)
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> 3. Compile the source code into a binary which you can run on your computer (it presents itself as an .exe with accompanying .dll files on Windows)
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> 
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> The game client you download has already been compiled. While it is possible to edit the final binary as you suggest it’s not practical; that is not typically how you go about editing existing software unless you are really desperate
09:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not alwayus
09:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i added telegun because i wanted
09:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nobody asked
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so the reason is:
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> be a developer, and do it because you can
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> if it’s cool and well made then it’ll probably be merged
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> that is the law of da land
09:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
09:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a bit more info
09:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did you test it with a map
09:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye?
09:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how else would i know it works
09:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you are a mapper then :troll:
09:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am a mapper
09:59 < bridge> <Ewan> 200 iq
09:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have 2 maps
09:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/mappers/Ryozuki/
09:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:

12:01 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1682244068.png
12:01 < ChillerDragon> xd
12:01 < ChillerDragon> sus
12:21 < ChillerDragon> yo @Robyt3 you look into the buffer size thingy right? I slowly have the suspicion that `PACKER_BUFFER_SIZE` is set to a too big value.
12:22 < bridge> <Robyt3> yes, I'm fixing the teehistorian tests. there is not reason to use `CPacker`, we can use a dynamic size buffer
12:22 < bridge> <Robyt3> no*
12:23 < ChillerDragon> like how can a message payload buffer be `2048` bytes while the max packet size is `1400` those messages should be dropped anyways?
12:23 < ChillerDragon> @Robyt3 i think there is because the chunk header contains a size field
12:23 < ChillerDragon> which has a fixed amount of bits
12:23 < ChillerDragon> imo nothing should work as it is right now xd
12:24 < ChillerDragon> im super confused
12:24 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/7885c99974ee445ce13297b72ae3e7c6ea3b969d/doc/packet.md
12:24 < ChillerDragon> FFss ssss  PPPP ssss
12:24 < ChillerDragon> which is 10 bits for size?
12:25 < ChillerDragon> ``1111111111`` -> `1023`
12:25 < ChillerDragon> in my brain the maximum size that can fit in the chunk header is 1023
12:25 < ChillerDragon> so `PACKER_BUFFER_SIZE` is way too big
12:25 < ChillerDragon> but also nothing is breaking currently so im clearly missing something here
12:25 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> To which CNetMsg should i listen to in order to get the scoreboard ?
12:26 < ChillerDragon> snap
12:39 < bridge> <Learath2> He has been here lately a couple times :Celebrate:
12:39 < bridge> <Learath2> We even did a vc with like 30 people and listened to gamedev stories from him 😄
13:30 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Which snapshot should i record ?
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do you even record snapshots? Why don’t you just use the ddnet Client to generate the game over csvs for you?
13:42 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> I have access to snapshots through the npm.js teeworlds project but there are lots of them and idk how to filter for final scores and gameover event
13:43 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Idk about the csvs, do they include the final scoreboards ?
13:54 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Are you referring to this ?
13:54 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/754/files/80737e9c572838e49892a5d9eae6a45e272edd84#diff-510b2ab72d0f0ccb0d055e95e85da9f7827453173bec16bf4e1976c58be423ca
13:56 < bridge> <Chairn> why did @TheDominator erase all his message?
13:58 < ChillerDragon> yes 
13:59 < ChillerDragon> the help text says "Automatically create game over csv"
13:59 < ChillerDragon> so im pretty sure this is what you want
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Read in IRC xd
14:05 < bridge> <Chairn> how do you think i know it was him?
14:05 < bridge> <Chairn> Found nothing about that reason though
14:14 < ChillerDragon> wait discord doesnt show who deleted the message?
14:14 < ChillerDragon> cring
14:14 < ChillerDragon> matrix does
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ikr
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now if matrix client would get good there is no need for discord anymore xd
14:14 < ChillerDragon> i dont see that ever happening
14:14 < ChillerDragon> element is so broken
14:15 < ChillerDragon> anyways there is no need for discord or matrix since irc is 10/10 gaming messanger

14:18 < bridge> <Chairn> comment:
14:18 < bridge> <Chairn> > Your mom's so fat, she sat on a binary tree and turned it into a linked list in constant time.
14:28 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:30 < ChillerDragon> > Yo mama so FAT, she has to be stored in files of 4 GB
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats not a lot xd
14:32 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:33 < ChillerDragon> are you making fun of the comment or are you saying 4gb is small?
14:34 < ChillerDragon> its a filesystem joke because FAT32 has some kind of 4GB limit
15:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm so jealous
15:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> matricks is the 3rd most important swedish person who shapes my life.
15:10 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> recording the scoreboard is not interesting anymore
15:11 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> no one plays vanilla and score limits are set to 500+
15:13 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> whyy
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what r u talkn bout bro
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now leak top2 too
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is notch in? XD
15:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> notch and pewdiepie
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
15:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> duh
15:26 < ChillerDragon> magnus > notch > pewdiepie
15:26 < ChillerDragon> change my mind
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean magnus is latin for "big"
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it must be bigger than most stuff
15:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> magnus carlsen?
15:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> omg it's happening
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic gamer moment
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> china gaming
15:32 < bridge> <Robyt3> we need to upgrade SDL for the candidate window though
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do they offer a API for that now?
15:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is there a reason blocking us from upgrading
15:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> no, but somehow the Windows API is broken on the SDL version that we are using
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> weird af
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the other SDL bug u mentioned?
15:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you sure it is the version?
15:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe they use the Windows API improperly so we can't get the candidate list for the current window
15:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we modified SDL to have windowed candidate work
15:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, I tested with several SDL versions
15:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> it works perfectly on 2.0.18 and 2.0.20
15:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok
15:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> later versions also work, but there is a minor bug with the composition cursor movement
15:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> man, SDL is jank
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😆
15:35 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/7616 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/7639
15:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we need more chinese contributors in such libs
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie 🙂
15:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or japanese
15:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4537
15:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although i think neither of them are really good at contributing to open source project in general
15:37 < bridge> <Chairn> will it work on win 7 ?
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> win7 lmao
15:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I believe so
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chairn the necromancer
15:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think windows changed their IME stuff that much
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doubt chinese ppl use win7 xd
15:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i can be wrong tho lol cuz i don't really know
15:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs they only got rich in the past years
15:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bro
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so they all have pretty modern hardware
15:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> The Windows API should work even with Windows XP, assuming you have a working IME itself
15:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i started with win95
15:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when I was 4
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u were rich before
15:39 < bridge> <Chairn> jupstar once again living in a rich world
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chairn, win10 works for u too
15:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wouldn't consider my family rich at all
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u just lie to yourself
15:39 < bridge> <Chairn> well, i don't really care about IME, as long as your update doesnt break the game on win 7 😉
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u are different tho, u even access discord XD
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unless SDL broke win7, you should be fine
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> doesnt matter tbh
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> win7 is dead
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> accept the truth
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I mean I am different
15:40 < bridge> <Chairn> i accept it, doesn't mean i gotta change
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~I'm smarter~~
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think they even claim to be winxp compatible
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i don't think we are the only few family who has win95 lol
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the whole word should wait for an egoist?
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the whole world should wait for an egoist?
15:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I do want to know why people still use win7 tho
15:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> win11 looks pretty nice if it is just the look.
15:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> IMO
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but tbh, most new players are probs kids and not some old grannies like us 😢
15:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but they might have win7 infected parents
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply dont use windows, if u dislike newer windows
15:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but they need STEEEAAAMM
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> better than using a dead OS 😄
15:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and fortnite
15:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not sure if EAC on fortnite worked for proton now tho
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> valve did so much for their steam deck release
15:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also I lied
15:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> china doesn't have fortnite
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs gambling?
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or addiction?
15:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> tencent got the license
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> china is the best
15:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I think they didn't get a publishing id
15:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so they can't commercialize the game
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> china will soon be the biggest economy in the world
15:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they can technically just release it for free with no monetization at all, which is technically legal
15:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i don't think any company would do that lol
15:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although technically legal does not mean safe
15:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> china is weird lol
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i still wait for chinese revolution
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> has to come any time soon
15:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think china is still struggling to survive at all
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> covid protests were a slight hint xdd
15:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think we are running out of jobs
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the educated jobs?
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well ye
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they taught up to not be workers
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> now they only need workers
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they taught us to not be workers
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> office jobs are running out
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well germany has a similar problem, just that we are already very rich
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lend me some money to make a game
15:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i need it
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok how much do u need
15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk. 100k usd?
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah ez, i have that flying around
15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
15:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i probably would do a crowdfunding if i need to make my own game
15:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I need a marketing team to do the crowdfunding cuz i sure am not qualified to market my game
15:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so i need a money to get the team to fund more money.
15:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> business!
15:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
15:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so i need money to get the team to fund more money.
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, so what u saying is, u either need lot of luck, or be rich
15:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean
15:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yeah
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's how I see video games nowadays
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or be famous i guess
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah its kinda true. there are few exceptions but mostly yeah
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what exceptions
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think the exceptions you are thinking might fall into the luck category
15:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. i'd say stardew valley was hard work, and it was obvious it has a target group (harvest moon). so maybe not so much luck.. but maybe still luck
15:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye that make sense
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but apparently he worked on it for 6 years
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also not that ez xD
15:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
15:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well maybe depends on where you live
15:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in china no way in hell you can survive 6 years without stable income
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wish i didnt waste the time between me being 18 - 25 so much xD
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that were the golden ages
15:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> who doesn't
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw, any thoughts about unrecord ?
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> about animations, or graphics, or gameplay?
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk, anything
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> animations are insane, look real af.
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> graphics are insane too, on mobile i didnt really see any problems. on desktop u see some lighting bugs and some assets arent high LOD
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gameplay.. well i guess it wont be the most epic game tbh, maybe the story will be good, we'll see 😄
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I saw the teaser last year, I always thought unreal 5 did all the heavy lifting and the post processing stack of limited dynamic range (which is not that hard I imagine) and animation (which is time and hard work) is the main part of the development I think.
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> first time i saw it on mobile i thought its really rather a video and some editing for the hud stuff 😄
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> people seems to give too much credit about the rendering
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's what I thought anyway.
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean he did a clever trick
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a body cam is like a 480p video xD
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doesnt need to be perfect to feel real
16:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, it's hell of a nice approach
16:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just don't think people commenting about it understand what is really at stake
16:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i'm jealous
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what really is at stake? 😄
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i really want standalone VR to have better graphics, but in VR you can't fake lower quality to simulate a higher quality
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah true
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lots people are saying this might change VR
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and they have no idea what they are talking about
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
17:15 < bridge> <Learath2> https://newsroom.eclipse.org/news/announcements/open-letter-european-commission-cyber-resilience-act
17:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hi @Learath2
17:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how are you
17:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Excellent
17:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> good to hear
17:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:nekospin:1039804721378111548>
17:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> better than last time we talk?
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how are u is the question most people lie when answering
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> change my mind
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for me its bothersome to say bad and proceed to explain shit
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so just say good
17:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2: who also lied
17:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh wait i read that wrong
17:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think most people want a explanation anyway
17:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I tried to explain what was going on once and the guy said I didn't really ask
17:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2: but do want to know how Learath2 is doing
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> I’ve been banned from having bad vibes, so I’m permanently happy now
17:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol what
17:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> where can i get banned too
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a girl told him
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he had no chance
17:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
17:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what
17:35 < bridge> <Learath2> U missed your chance, if only you were in off-topic when bad vibes were banned
17:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's why i'm gay man
17:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> men are always happy
17:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> *in front of others
17:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminded me of this comment
17:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yy2rcv/men_who_encourage_other_men_not_to_open_up_to/iwsae0r/?context=3
17:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> good read
17:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess i'm not a man
17:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it was sarcasm
17:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also I realized this last month, if I can't look at others when i'm talking
17:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> does that mean i might be autistic
17:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
18:09 < bridge> <louis> it means ur interested in cs, math, or engineering
18:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
18:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why
18:13 < bridge> <louis> do u know the joke
18:13 < bridge> <louis> how do u tell an introverted engineer versus an extroverted engineer
18:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really
18:16 < bridge> <louis> the extroverted one looks at the *other's\* shoes when having a conversation
18:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
18:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't get it
18:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i googled it and i get it know
18:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i googled it and i get it now
18:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have to go to bed now
18:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> gn
18:44 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, I wanna request a change in using PNGs, since not all PNGs are rendered. I want a request, because we can optimize the images (thus shrinking resolution) to a degree, where it's not visually noticable change, but the size can vary between 20-80% improvement, which is big, considering, that we work with little Assets.
18:44 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> 
18:44 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> This is a 60kB Asset, optimized manually

18:45 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And this is a near 16kB Asset, optimized by an argorithm

18:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @Ryozuki
18:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
18:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i missed it
18:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
18:46 < bridge> <Chairn> damn ping
18:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm sorry
18:46 < bridge> <Chairn> should be off by default
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm not sorry
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> she must be insanely fat
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> speaking of python
18:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
18:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we dont do that here
18:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> stop
18:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when I was interviewed at google
18:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :MonkasGun:
18:48 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> ok I'll just make a report on github
18:48 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> bruh
18:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> one interviewer asked me how much memory it consumes to have a dictionary with 1 million keys
18:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have zero idea
18:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
18:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sounds like a dumb thing to ask but maybe it was important
18:49 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> weren't you allow to experiment with using code?
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did he also tell ya
18:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nope
18:49 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> xd
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
18:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the size  of the stored object, the size of the hash of the key, maybe something more there,
18:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> white board coding interview
18:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> he probably did, i couldn't care less and can't really remember anything from the interview
18:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> would python just store all things as pointers since "everything is an object"
18:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not tho i guess
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> storing as pointer  doesnt mean it doesnt take memory
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the pointee uses memory
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, but I mean it probably doesn't matter how much the stored object take?
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if they are all pointers that is
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I highly doubt that tho
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a dictionary uses hashes to store the keys
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the question implied everything has the same size to me
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> into buckets
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i actually neveri mplemented a dict
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i read one in c#
18:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but that's about it
18:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still, feels like a weird question to ask
18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whiteboard is stupid anyway
18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and u cant know how good a dev is in a high pressure environment like a interview
18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i often get blank when asked
18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz im nervous af
18:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> even at simple stuff
18:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think I was asked a robot path finding algorithm, a common tree parent set thing, a python dictionary memory usage thing and possible something else that I don't remember
18:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and obviously I failed
18:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> robot path?
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u mean a*
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
18:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just path finding but with no prior knowledge about the graph
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wouldnt know them by memory honestly
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> weird stuff
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know any existing path finding algorithm with no graph
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> building a graph as we path find doesn't sound great.
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its just that
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then the interview turns into just conversation about how hard robot path finding is
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i failed
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the key here is probs data structures to use
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> looks like k-d trees
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Occupancy grid maps discretize a space into square of arbitrary resolution and assigns each square either a binary or probabilistic value of being full or empty. Grid maps can be optimized for memory by storing it as a k-d tree so that only areas with important boundary information need to be saved at full resolution.
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > k-d tree grid
18:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1099740634350366821/robot_kdtree.png
18:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just weird that you need to path find with a robot rather than just doing local avoidance and traverse the whole graph
18:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> path finding implies getting from one point to another i think?
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go to sleep
18:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok dad
18:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no worries son
19:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ghost typers
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1099757596203815083/gee133y8jlva1.jpg
20:38 < bridge> <Chairn> in C? Who are you and what did you do to @Ryozuki ?
20:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> If he was banned then you can opt to delete all messages (either all time or from the past 24 hours)
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> IDK if he was
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> Hi Fred
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> Fun
22:02 < bridge> <GutZuFusss> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=20833
22:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @GutZuFusss\: yea the guy is famous. He posted in this channel a lot. And on YouTube etc but I think he is inactive again
22:48 < bridge> <GutZuFusss> well that is because HE FOUND THE MAN FOR THE JOB
22:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?xd
22:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Go from A to B, you don't know where A is, you don't know where B is, nor do you have any information about any paths? Ill defined question, I'd leave the interview
23:05 < bridge> <Learath2> The only thing of note here is that the memory usage would be on the order of the element count. If he cares about the specifics of exactly how many bytes hit them with the "it's implementation defined"
23:06 < bridge> <Learath2> but even if you knew the specifics of the implementation the key size and the bookkeeping overhead is negligible with respect to any sizable data, mostly a silly question unless they intended to have a discussion about this
