00:00 < o_be_one> well yes that could happen for some of us :/ ... I think its not a problem to stop but we must inform about this, thats normal ... We sponsorize to offer something, it's not to do bad thing after
00:02 <@deen> i know i know
00:02 <@deen> but it's trouble when the server suddenly disappears, without warning
00:04 < o_be_one> yes, sure ..
00:12 <@deen> or when the sponsor decides to take over the server and fuck with it
00:13 <@deen> always have to trust the sponsor, not so with donors
00:18 < o_be_one> TW is like a jungle ...
00:19 < o_be_one> sometime tees ask why i trust nobody ... I answer that i just trust nobody in TW, there is just like 5 peoples that i cant trust in TW, no more.
00:19 < Learath2> that must be the best description of TW i have ever seen
00:19 < Learath2> so true
04:11 <@deen> I like Savander's blog: http://savander.pl/
05:10 <@deen> I think I'll try posting http://ddnet.tw on HN later today
05:23 <@deen> even though we still don't have any tutorial =/
06:03 < asdf> zuuuuiiuu
10:48 < laxadedi> Learath2: I am not using brew to install things, I avoid package manager when I want anything up to date
10:57 < Learath2> what i got working was sdl from libsdl.org and freetype from brew plus Xcode ofc
11:06 < laxadedi> couldn't get it compiled, I'll try again later, I am at work now

13:17 <@deen> laxadedi, Learath2, EastByte, heinrich5991: Hope that's fine ^
13:18 < laxadedi> dunno what it is use for
13:19 <@EastByte> maybe some professionals see potential in the game so they make a startup
13:19 <@deen> haha
13:19 <@EastByte> honestly I'm not sure either^^
13:19 <@deen> Well, TW was on HN as well, and they seemed to like it: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7042348
13:21 <@EastByte> we really need some introduction videos
13:21 <@deen> yes
13:24 <@deen> I also think it's a bit sad that DDNet is known nowhere
13:24 <@deen> Basically only old TW players know it
13:26 <@EastByte> you could also add the webclient to your post
13:26 <@EastByte> maybe some want to try
13:26 <@deen> I did, didn't I?
13:27 <@EastByte> oh
13:27 <@EastByte> Cross-Platform: Mac, Windows, Linux, Web ( http://teewebs.net ), Android (spectating mostly): http://ddnet.tw/downloads/
13:34 <@deen> and on ddnet.tw there is now a "Try it out in your browser" link
13:38 <@EastByte> hmm easy to overlook
13:43 <@EastByte> eeeee: I have a question relating your websocket implementation (libwebsocket)
13:45 <@EastByte> well I mean a question relating the way your are using libwebsocket (more clear^^)
14:02 < Learath2> playing around in nim made me notice how i missed not having to do everything myself
14:08 <@deen> Learath2: what do you mean?
14:10 < Learath2> was mainly writing stuff in c which lacks any and all handholding 
14:23 <@EastByte> :D
16:05 < o_be_one> hi :)
16:10 <@EastByte> hi
19:32 < eeeee> EastByte: so what's the question?
19:48 <@EastByte> it's about libwebsocket_write(), the doc says there can be the case where less bytes are written then specified
19:48 <@EastByte> but that doesn't make sense when using websockets as a frame based protocol
19:48 <@EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/shared/websockets.cpp#L123
19:49 <@EastByte> what if less than `len` bytes were written
19:49 <@EastByte> it would split the chunk into two frames
19:49 <@EastByte> or not?
19:52 <@EastByte> eeeee:
20:15 < Nimda> Hopeless II by Juandissimo & IRGNW just released on Solo at 2015-07-07 20:14
20:33 < eeeee> EastByte: i dunno lol
20:33 < eeeee> libwebsockets is very low quality in general
20:33 < eeeee> so i don't think this is the biggest issue there...
20:34 < eeeee> i only checked that it seems to work and is valgrind clean, didn't try to dig deeper into that kind of potential issues
20:41 < eeeee> EastByte: https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets/blob/master/lib/output.c#L508 seems relevant
20:47 <@EastByte> eeeee: so the frame can be completed later?
20:48 < eeeee> yeah i think so
20:48 < eeeee> notice how it tells you to manually reserve space for buffer paddings
20:49 < eeeee> i guess it stores frame metadata there
20:49 <@EastByte> makes sense
20:51 <@EastByte> well I like the implementation because of its asyncronous design
