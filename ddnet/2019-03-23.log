08:22 <@heinrich5991> @fokkonaut: not possible ­— the vanilla shotgun has different curvature from the ddnet bullet tiles, you can't display both in the client at the same time
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But i also did it with Grenade, a straight, and a curved at once.
13:51 <@heinrich5991> hmm. but then the prediction of the grenade was missing, right? i.e. it jumps from point to point, every 40ms
13:51 <@heinrich5991> (and the smoke behind it doesn't appear?)
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it does, its all working fine :)
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my only problem with the gun is, that it it has a direction
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so the bullet, it has a direction (for the image). the grenade doesnt, its spinning all the time
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plexigras> what about section time so i can know if i'm ahead or behind my record?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991, so i now double checked my grenade bullet in demo on x0.25. they are disappearing for a little moment every yea, probably 40ms, is that "fixable"? otherwise my straight grenade works fine :)
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obama3games> :monkaS: rocket launcher leaked :monkaS:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, i have dropable flags and weapons which can use speedups, and now ive added support for colliding with STOPA, how do i add collision with a CDoor?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rofl, the entities are sinking through the stopas xd
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> slowly
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok, so i got the gun working, but as you said heinrich, its jumps from point to point... why tho? can i do something about it? because otherwise its working fine
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just that shaky animation is ****
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean, its also there for the straight grenade, but not that obvious as for the gun projectile
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ??

18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> invalidated?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut no, that's what I ment with "not possible"
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, ok
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the gun speed is there to make the client properly predict the projectiles
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, can anyone help me get SQLite into ddnet?
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have absolutely no clue how that works
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut porting the current thing to sqlite instead of mysql is probably more work than getting mysql to work on your computer
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i dont host my server on my computer, i host it somewhere else, is that a problem?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean like i have 00000 clue
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably easier to install mysql on whatever server you're using than to port ddnet to use sqlite
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can i make new entries in MYSQL?
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can add more tables if you need different schemes
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont have a root server, is that a problem?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can of course also insert new entries into the tables (ddnet does that when you finish a race e.g.)
