00:11 < bridge> <blazulite> why is that posted on "NoStupidQuestions" üíÄ
00:36 < bridge> <cyberFighter> free storage god damn
00:36 < bridge> <cyberFighter> linux has: linux only games
00:36 < bridge> <cyberFighter> windows has: window only games
00:37 < bridge> <cyberFighter> also that looks like a karma farm lol
01:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> linux has: wine and proton
01:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> windows has: wsl and wslg
01:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> macos has: final cut pro
01:39 < bridge> <learath2> If you value your sanity, don't touch that
01:41 < bridge> <teero777> the entity system already dragged me into the pits of hell
01:41 < bridge> <learath2> macos also comes on machines that you can show the general public and be proud of
01:42 < bridge> <learath2> The person you want to talk to is trml, only they know, but the tiniest order changes will change behaviour if you are not careful as prediction has to be perfectly in sync with the server

03:06 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wait how do i install this and test it
04:04 < bridge> <blazulite> is there a way to host a server without using docker?
04:04 < bridge> <blazulite> maybe there's a node js port or smth??
04:04 < bridge> <blazulite> idk
04:05 < bridge> <blazulite> I straight up can't use docker for some reason
04:06 < bridge> <blazulite> sorry if this question is kinda stupid(?

04:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i wish there was a way to cell-shade normal mapping in godot
04:15 < bridge> <blazulite> holy moly
04:16 < bridge> <blazulite> normal maps my beloved
04:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> true
04:30 < bridge> <blazulite> @_voxeldoesart sorry for the ping but, do u know if that's possible? üëâüëà
04:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont
04:33 < bridge> <blazulite> oh
04:33 < bridge> <blazulite> it's okie, thx anyway ^^
07:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yikes what made you think you need docker? For teeworlds/ddnet servers you totally do not need docker to host it.
07:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
07:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What trauma did you go through to even think that? In which situation were you forced to use docker?
09:48 < bridge> <peacereaperr> does someone knows how to modify speed, weapons, gravity and things like that when i host a trashmap server?
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tune zones
09:50 < bridge> <peacereaperr> without modifying the map
09:50 < bridge> <peacereaperr> like with commands
09:50 < bridge> <peacereaperr> or rcon
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not sure if you can do that tbh
09:52 < bridge> <peacereaperr> i just saw someone does it
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the command would be called `tune`
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in rcon
09:52 < bridge> <peacereaperr> wait lemme see
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tune gravity 0.25
09:53 < bridge> <peacereaperr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169559916038594560/image.png?ex=6555d88d&is=6543638d&hm=325ab7a69630468c49834a06aab6bdfce9708ca1fab96e7080dcadc5cdf5bb50&
09:54 < bridge> <peacereaperr> theres no tune gravity
09:55 < bridge> <patiga> 1. git clone the repository
09:55 < bridge> <patiga> 2. run cargo build in the rust directory
09:55 < bridge> <patiga> 3. in the godot editor, open the godot folder as a project
09:56 < blazulite> > <chillerdragon> What trauma did you go through to even think that? In which situation were you forced to use docker?
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh then i assume it's not possible on trashmap servers. i don't know how others did it. you can always host a local server and do it there
09:56 < blazulite> I mean
09:56 < blazulite> That was my logic
09:56 < blazulite> üò≠
09:56 < blazulite> I'm just new at this
10:00 < bridge> <peacereaperr> i found
10:00 < bridge> <peacereaperr> its tune gravity, not tune_gravity
10:00 < bridge> <peacereaperr> i'm dumb
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh glad you got it working

12:54 < bridge> <learath2> Governments are getting bored of this fog of war. It's only a matter of time
13:02 < bridge> <teero777> Vulkan vs OpenGL or what? Xd
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> OpenGL is cool too xd.
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Vk vs dx
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> haha when do we get dx11 in tw?
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When you were done with it probably
15:03 < bridge> <blazulite> I'm gonna make a gh account to add suggestions and stuff

16:57 < ChillerDragon> blazulite are you comfortable with linux? I recommend just getting a linux vps and host the game server there by just running it :) 
16:57 < ChillerDragon> @blazulite
17:01 < bridge> <levitador> Yeah Linux is awesome.
17:01 < bridge> <levitador> But when you wanna dilate something you have to run it in terminal XD
17:02 < bridge> <levitador> also with all other tools taht come with DDNet itself
17:02 < bridge> <levitador> also with all other tools that come with DDNet itself
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> not true
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> just depends on the file manager
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> most of them support drag and drop like windows explorer
17:07 < bridge> <levitador> Huh? Then it's nautilus
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> how do i show the lag graph
19:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Ctrl+Shift+D, Ctrl+Shift+G
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> ty
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> how do i diagnose net microlags
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> it's super irritating
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like the game just skips a beat
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> so it's mostly playable but i get a small lag and i'm not where i thought i was
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> this is new as of today
19:43 < bridge> <_gwendal> packet losses ?
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> I think we just don't have the tooling for this. External profilers don't have enough context and they slow down execution immensely maybe making the lags disappear
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> what would cause this
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Wifi interference or faulty networking equipment are the only 2 you control
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Barring some bizarre software issue. Too unlikely to even mention imo
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not on wifi
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> I'm free from my shackles finally. Barring some bureaucracy and acquiring my diploma I won't ever have to step foot in that place again
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> Assuming I passed that exam üòÑ It felt fine tho
19:52 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
19:52 < bridge> <Ewan> what degree
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> A mere bachelors in computer engineering for 7 years of my time üòÑ
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
19:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i suspected ce
19:53 < bridge> <Ewan> bachelors tho damn
19:53 < bridge> <Ewan> what happened
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> Covid + Lost interest + mild depression
19:54 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
19:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah covid messed me up too
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> I basically spent 2 years as a vegetable. 0 credits earned. So it's more like 5 years in reality
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> I lost interest when the degree became too much engineering too little computer. Idk just not my thing. I should have been more careful in picking
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> that is good to know
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i probably would have wanted to do ce
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> but am not rly interested in other fields of engineering
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and the whole fundamental part of it
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> just the computers
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> If stuff like multivariable calculus, control theory and electromagnetism don't sound interesting to you, you might prefer a cs degree or look at the courses in the ceng ones you find
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> Also lots and lots of electronics too
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't sound not interesting
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> just something i haven't the slightest idea about
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> and i am bad at learning
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> if i don't already know a little bit it's way harder for me to care
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Well interesting is the wrong word. They are extremely interesting to me, but I'd rather learn them on my own time, when needed
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> that's all the stuff i'd like to know one day
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> back burner
20:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and then i would never get around to it on my own time
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> One drawback of a CS degree I heard is that they are much heavier on math and theory. Partially why I went with CE instead
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if i would hate that
20:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :justatest: I am a ghost so I hope that doesn't count
20:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ghetable
20:36 < bridge> <louis> math and theory is fun
20:38 < bridge> <louis> in theory
20:47 < bridge> <levitador> XD
20:47 < bridge> <levitador> I do like math
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> I used to love it before it was forced down my throat
20:52 < bridge> <zogtib> I feel similarly, but I don't think it's about the content of the lessons but the way they are supposed to be done.
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly. Most of the stuff I hated this year, I probably would learn on my own, just in a much different way
20:54 < bridge> <zogtib> Being forced to learn stuff in a way just to pass an exam is very unproductive.
20:55 < bridge> <zogtib> I've passed "Linear Circuit Analysis" but don't remember even the basics (for example).
20:55 < bridge> <zogtib> While I haven't passed others that even requiring my presence in the lab etc.
20:55 < bridge> <levitador> I'm just the opposite. I need to be forced because I have no discipline. I wanna learn many languages, but I'm waiting to be able to select them as a subject next year because I simply can't stand learning them from myself
20:56 < bridge> <levitador> The best way to learn something is practising
20:56 < bridge> <levitador> If you learn only theory, although it's cool, you'll probably forget about it.
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> Pro-tip: Go above and beyond. Uni level of language teaching is rarely adequate
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> This was my hack for linar circuit analysis. I just kept building out the circuits on breadboards so I could observe too
20:57 < bridge> <zogtib> The problem is that you are not asked to "practice" on a topic rather being able to answer some questions.
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> Technically wasnt required for the course but I would never be able to focus without
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly. And as exams loom closer and closer, no matter how strict you are with yourself, you will become exam minded, studying possible questions, memorizing answers to common theory
20:58 < bridge> <levitador> I'm still at Secondary school and I don't talk really good english, but I can have a conversation! I am from Spain
20:59 < bridge> <chairn> true, but that's because uni teachers have very few time and freedom in their courses
20:59 < bridge> <levitador> You see? My father also learned that way
20:59 < bridge> <levitador> It's almost the perfect way
20:59 < bridge> <levitador> Well, nothing's perfect
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> I was learning control theory properly, all the way until the end, then I panic'd, then I spammed exercises of exam style until I got used to it
20:59 < bridge> <chairn> setting up a lab work is quite time consuming and then the class is often split in several groups that all need to be taught by a teacher
21:00 < bridge> <chairn> you also need an available room for each lab class
21:01 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly. If time is an issue, they just need an extra prof. All my lab classes had 2 profs so one could handle practicals and another the theory. Though budget might become an issue depending on the uni
21:01 < bridge> <chairn> "just need an extra prof"
21:01 < bridge> <chairn> sure, the state has plenty of money to throw at education
21:02 < bridge> <chairn> at least in France, that's a huge problem
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> I mean most western european states technically have infinite money glitch. They just don't allocate enough to education sadly
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> In less developed countries money does become a serious issue though, every extra dime spent on education is less spent on crucial infrastructure and health
21:03 < bridge> <chairn> they used free money glitch for covid, now there's huge inflation
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> That's true. Need to be careful for a bit üòÑ
21:03 < bridge> <chairn> and free money always comes at a cost, in general, it ends up in private sectors
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> Though if you think european inflation is huge I invite you to a year in Turkey. 80% official inflation üáπüá∑
21:04 < bridge> <chairn> too much free money ?
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> Nah, awful monetary policy of decreasing interest rates at all cost
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> I've gotten so used to inflation that I didn't even notice how much extra I started spending in EU until I calculated

22:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> just gotta clean the code now ;)
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u know that u can create a triangle with shaders only xdd
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```GLSL

22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who needs vertices anyway
22:53 < bridge> <ar1gin> triangler?? from scratch?? woah gj
22:54 < bridge> <ar1gin> thats bascially the first thing you see about shaders in wgpu introduction
22:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I figured that was possible from the cool stuff you can do with shaders but I'm really not at that level
22:54 < bridge> <ar1gin> a lot of cool stuff on the shaders actually wastes a lot of gpu time üòÖ
23:03 < bridge> <learath2> Shaders so powerful nowadays
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in older opengl versions u can actually even create quads xd
23:08 < bridge> <learath2> Btw isn't `(x<<1)&2 == x&1`? I'm very drunk so maybe not üòÑ
23:10 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, no nvm
23:11 < bridge> <learath2> They are only equivalent cast to bool
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> hey fellas
