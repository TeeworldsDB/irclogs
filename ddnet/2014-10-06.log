09:49 < mr_pause> Hello 
11:31 <@deen> hi
11:38 < mr_pause> What'up in DDoS valley ?
11:38 < laxa_work> a lamer wanna release a client that can ddos any teeworlds server
11:39 < mr_pause> How is that even possible ?
11:39 < laxa_work> No idea, but it is
11:39 < mr_pause> And who's this guy ? =D
11:39 < laxa_work> a complete retard
11:39 < mr_pause> Where is the cooode
11:39 < laxa_work> who think ddosing with no aim is fun
11:39 < mr_pause> He probably found a vuln in server code
11:39 < laxa_work> this client is closed souce
11:39 < laxa_work> and isn't released yet
11:39 < mr_pause> Otherwise, hard to DoS...
11:40 < mr_pause> It's probably some retard with a big mouth then, no ?
11:40 < laxa_work> Yeah
11:40 < laxa_work> But I don't think he wanna talk much about how he does it
11:40 < mr_pause> He came here to tell you this ? =D
11:40 < laxa_work> I "tested" his client
11:40 < mr_pause> Well once he releases his shit it'll be easy to fix hopefully
11:40 < laxa_work> We hope so :p
11:41 < laxa_work> I wrote ingame on a server he was : !crash -p 1000
11:41 < laxa_work> server went down 10 seconds later
11:41 < mr_pause> Wtf ?
11:42 < laxa_work> server lagged than connexion interrupted
11:42 < mr_pause> He accepts !crash commands ? oO
11:42 < laxa_work> Well, it's how you crash servers with his client at least
11:42 < mr_pause> Well usually you don't expose such commands to other players...
11:43 < laxa_work> It removed the access to other players after, so I couldn't test anymore :p
11:43 < laxa_work> but apparently, any teeworlds server is vulnerable
11:43 < mr_pause> How did you learn about the command ?
11:44 < laxa_work> some guy said he was crashing server with that command :p
11:44 < mr_pause> You should have taken precautions before typing that
11:45 < mr_pause> Like, running some TCPDUMP on the affected server
11:45 < laxa_work> it was a random server
11:45 < mr_pause> Now, good luck to find how he did that =D
11:45 < laxa_work> no acces to it
11:45 < mr_pause> Well, prepare to get handed a lot of coredumps hahah
11:46 < mr_pause> If i have time i'll review server code, and come crash your server laxa =P
11:46 < laxa_work> I mainly run old ddrace server
11:46 < laxa_work> only 2 ddnet servers
11:46 < mr_pause> Ogre CRUSH !
11:49 < mr_pause> I hope you don't care too much about those servers =P
11:49 < laxa_work> well, no one play on them, crash them, they'll just reboot
11:49 < mr_pause> Making this crash is fun =D
11:49 < mr_pause> things*
11:49 < laxa_work> and I know you : you say a lot about what you will do, but don't do much afterwards!
11:50 < mr_pause> Shit, i wanted to trade bugfixes for dates with your sister =(
11:50 < mr_pause> My hopes are utterly crushed =(((
11:51 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Well, i don't have much time, but if you want to put bounties on ddnet bugs, i'll come =P
11:51 < laxa_work> xD
11:51 < laxa_work> Why everything resumes to money for you ?
11:51 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Money is not the problem, it's time =(
11:51 < laxa_work> I am pretty sure you don't even need that much
11:52 < mr_pause> But time equates to money, so...
11:52 < laxa_work> Hum yeah !
11:52 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Well, i need money now !
11:53 < mr_pause> Those music courses won't pay for themselves lol
11:53 <@deen> still getting ddosed all the time
11:53 < laxa_work> music courses aren't that expensive, are they oO ?
11:53 <@deen> lastone ended 2 hours ago
11:53 < mr_pause> deen: It's crazy those people spend so much time on you. You should be flattered xD
11:54 < laxa_work> !fr-en craquer
11:54 < Nimda> Translation: crack
11:54 < laxa_work> Hum...
11:54 <@deen> mr_pause: i don't think it's us, they're after every server that has players
11:54 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Want some crack ? You can buy some near where i work =D
11:54 < mr_pause> deen: But for what purpose ? They own servers ?
11:54 < laxa_work> mr_pause: now, I wanna say this in english : Ne craque pas
11:55 <@deen> mr_pause: yes, and they made them one of the most popular ones by ddosing all others
11:55 < mr_pause> deen: What's their name ?
11:55 < laxa_work> deen: dont know if you heard, but ddracemax is down, noother wont host it anymore
11:55 <@deen> don't know about the gameserver-attacks, ddnet doesn't seem to be affected
11:55 <@deen> we only get regular ddos attacks
11:55 <@deen> laxa_work: i know, probably my fault, because players went to ddmax after ddnet went down, sorry
11:56 <@deen> i thought theirs are the AKK servers, but they mostly also seem to be down now^^
11:56 < laxa_work> I don't think it's a big deal, and if tsin really cares about it, he'll rent a VPS for it I guess.
11:56 <@deen> at least i always saw them playing on these servers
11:57 < laxa_work> mr_pause: how would you translate this to english : Ne craque pas.
11:57 <@deen> laxa_work: or we fuse ddmax and ddnet
11:57 <@deen> laxa_work: "Don't break"?
11:57 < laxa_work> won't work out, tsin won't like that idea I think
11:57 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Don't know
11:57 < laxa_work> ok
11:57 < laxa_work> then
11:57 <@deen> well, better than being down completely?
11:57 < laxa_work> deen: don't break over ddos please :p
11:57 < laxa_work> unlike this week-end
11:58 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Stay frosty xD
11:58 < mr_pause> Keep cool !
11:58 < mr_pause> Something like that
11:58 <@deen> well, it's a bit disappointing that i get 50% packet loss for over 30 minutes even on "ddos protected" ovh server
11:58 <@deen> but it's way too easy to circumvent the protection
11:59 <@deen> These may have better ddos protection: https://www.kms-hosting.com/rootserver/
11:59 <@deen> but we'd need the 30 € version
11:59 < mr_pause> laxa_work: And yes music courses are kinda expensive
12:00 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Around 100 euro per month, a bit more
12:00 < mr_pause> And i'm not even counting orchestra, which i'm joining next saturday =D
12:00 < mr_pause> And if i want to buy my own instrument someday, i'd better keep some money =P
12:01 < laxa_work> you finally found german host with ddos protection !
12:03 <@deen> i guess i should just try it out for a month
12:05 <@deen> great, their payment website doesn't work!
12:05 < laxa_work> Have you looked for feedback ?
12:05 <@deen> feedback for?
12:05 < laxa_work> their ddos protection
12:05 < laxa_work> review is maybe a better word
12:06 <@deen> nope, best to try it out
12:54 < mr_pause> win 1
12:55 < mr_pause> whoops

14:00 < EastByte> hello there
14:01 < EastByte> deen: "lots of random ips connecting, all with port 1337" might have been piko
14:01 <@deen> yeah
14:02 <@deen> new GER server running, seems to be fine but a bit higher ping
14:02 < laxa_work> wow deen 
14:02 < EastByte> oh cool
14:02 <@deen> and the cpu is pretty weak, looks like they're overselling
14:02 < laxa_work> take a break to eat something :p
14:02 < EastByte> I go for lunch
14:02 < laxa_work> oh, it's not a dedi ? :(
14:02 <@deen> can't pay for dedi
14:03 < laxa_work> I really hope for you than the cpu is strong enough on a 30 euros vps.
14:09 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Bon ap
14:09 < laxa_work> Already ate
14:09 < laxa_work> same thing than friday, it was so good :p
14:10 < laxa_work> sauce roquefort :p
14:10 <@deen> hm yeah, i hope it can take the load of tournaments =/
14:16 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Do you play minecraft ?
14:20 <@deen> wtf
14:20 < EastByte> mr_pause: ah it's you
14:20 <@deen> something is wrong with the pings to the new server, never seen something like this
14:20 <@deen> ah, or just a client bug, mybad
14:21 < EastByte> It sometimes shows pings of ~4
14:21 <@deen> yes
14:21 <@deen> i think when i update the serverlist.json
14:21 <@deen> and the client somehow gets the entries twice
14:21 <@deen> then the server is requested twice
14:21 < EastByte> oh
14:21 < EastByte> that's interesting
14:22 < EastByte> but I think I saw it in favourites aswell
14:22 < EastByte> hm can't reproduce, nvm
14:22 <@deen> hm, noone is coming on the new servers
14:23 < EastByte> guess how many people even notices the ddnet tab :P
14:23 < EastByte> noticed*
14:23 <@deen> =/
14:23 < laxa_work> You should replace GER server with the new server, that way, people will come :p
14:23 < EastByte> deen: theoretically a ddos protection is a bad idea of teeworlds
14:24 < laxa_work> mr_pause: nop.
14:24 < EastByte> I hate that ovh is forcing mitigation
14:24 <@deen> oh, fra getting ddosed^^
14:24 < EastByte> much better to set hardware firewall rules to block everything that's not tw
14:24 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
14:25 < mr_pause> EastByte: Well, yes it's my, why ? Feared i was replaced by my evil twin ? =D
14:25 < mr_pause> me*
14:25 < EastByte> ye
14:25 < EastByte> mr pause sounds much more serious
14:26 < laxa_work> So far from winter and already so cold ousite, it's not good being a smoker :x
14:27 < mr_pause> EastByte: Yes, it's my work avatar 
14:27 < EastByte> laxa_work, mr_pause: I don't care about whether you are working or not ^^
14:27 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
14:27 <@deen> I'm moving everything to the new GER
14:28 <@deen> want to see what happens when it gets ddosed
14:28 < EastByte> good luck
14:38 <@deen> hm
14:39 < laxa_work> my computer at home has 2 months uptime currently
14:39 < EastByte> laxa_work: irc bouncer or via ssh / irssi / weechat
14:39 <@deen> these servers seem to be shit^^
14:39 < EastByte> these?
14:39 <@deen> this*
14:39 < EastByte> meh
14:39 <@deen> 6 players on a server, 12% cpu load and lags
14:39 <@deen> ...
14:41 <@deen> that was a short test...
14:43 <@deen> i guess creating a ticket about the servers being shit won't be productive
14:45 < EastByte> hint: vps mostly are oversold :/
14:45 < laxa_work> except the data-fabrik one xD
14:45 < EastByte> and that was like the last vps at datafabrik
14:45 < EastByte> my ping to the new ger one is pretty stable though
14:45 <@deen> yeah, but ingame it's laggy
14:46 <@deen> the prediction margin is a lot less stable
14:48 <@deen> i don't know, i have pretty good experience with kvm
14:49 <@deen> they all don't lag, except this one
14:49 <@deen> I'm trying to return the server now, let's see what they say
14:51 <@deen> for reference, the difference between normal kvm and their server: http://ddnet.tw/good.png http://ddnet.tw/bad.png
14:52 < EastByte> not sure whether a virtulization software can prevent to be overused on one cpu
14:52 <@deen> nope
14:55 < vali> hello
14:55 < EastByte> hello vali 
14:55 < laxa_work> Hello lamer :p
14:55 < vali> is savaner here
14:55 < vali> ?
14:55 < EastByte> nope
14:56 < Ama> you could read the list on the right and see that he is not here
14:56 < vali> i cant
14:56 < vali> im with handy online
14:56 < vali> you are so funny
14:56 < Ama> handy isnt a english word
14:56 < vali> handy is handy for me
14:56 < vali> mobile phone gay
14:57 < EastByte> hm I forgot the command to list the users in channel
14:57 < laxa_work> ./name
14:57 < EastByte> just tried /list and now I'm getting flooded
14:57 < EastByte> ah thanks
14:57 < EastByte>  /names for me
14:57 < vali> list command disabled
14:57 < mr_pause> handy, dis moi oui
14:59 < vali> is  o_tee_one here? o_be_one
14:59 < vali> whatever
15:00 < EastByte> o_be_one is in this channel, afk I guess
15:00 < vali> -_-
15:00 < vali> he is 24/7 afk
15:00 < laxa_work> find his mobile phone
15:00 < laxa_work> and call him
15:01 < laxa_work> easy
15:01 < vali> sure, i wont his number
15:01 < laxa_work> let me find it
15:02 < vali> if you want i can dox you and than we can call
15:02 <@deen> vali: where to get good ddos protection?
15:02 < vali> i like u more than o_be_one
15:02 < vali> deen i wouldnt answer about it
15:03 < vali> if it know 1 guy, than do.it all guy
15:03 < vali> guys*
15:03 <@deen> and what would be so bad about that?
15:04 < vali> very much
15:04 < EastByte> we just need a 10gbps hardware firewall that's all
15:04 < vali> 10gbs firewall wouldnt help
15:04 < EastByte> it would
15:04 <@deen> the only cheap ones i can find are ovh, online, blazingfast and kvm-hosting
15:05 <@deen> ovh doesn't work, online doesn't seem to work, blazingfast seems expensive and high ping, kvm-hosting has low performance
15:05 < vali> this arnt the best nd the cheapest server
15:05 <@deen> exactly, that's why I'm asking you
15:05 <@deen> you probably know that your friends are still ddosing us
15:06 < vali> friends???????
15:06 < laxa_work> lamer aren't friends between them ?
15:06 <@deen> captain teemo and nazar?
15:06 < vali> tell me who
15:07 < vali> nazar is not my friend or enemy
15:07 < vali> he is neutral
15:08 < Ama> but i guess your the only one that can really talk to him i guess
15:09 < mr_pause> Oh, ddosers are here ? =D
15:09 < mr_pause> Run for your life !
15:09 < EastByte> I still don't believe he is ddosing
15:10 <@deen> EastByte: the big ddos attacks started 5 minutes after i talked to him for the first time
15:10 < Ama> and vali if we would get a good protection i dont think many other servers would get it most people dont have the money to put into a teeworlds server 
15:10 <@deen> and went on for the entire night, attacking every single ddnet server
15:10 <@deen> EastByte: so i'd say it's him or his friends
15:10 < mr_pause> deen: What did you say to him ?
15:10 < mr_pause> To send him into a DoS frenzy
15:11 < laxa_work> mr_pause: those kids ddos for fun, they aren't looking for something or whatever apparently.
15:11 <@deen> good question, can't remember, have to look up
15:11 < vali> deen es liegt daran dass du blocker server auf deinen servern hast
15:11 < laxa_work> Nooo germannnn please
15:11 < vali> am besten wir reden mal
15:11 < EastByte> ^yep, I recommend to take them down
15:11 < laxa_work> !de-en deen es liegt daran dass du blocker server auf deinen servern hast
15:11 < Nimda> Translation: deen it is because that you have blocker server to your servers
15:11 < vali> hab kz zum schreibn
15:12 <@deen> mr_pause: ah, i asked him if he's the one ddosing and his response was "deen: gay"
15:12 <@deen> i asked if they want to talk about the reasons
15:12 < vali> nazar wollte seine eigenen blockerserver machn
15:12 <@deen> and they just said they attack for no reason
15:13 <@deen> i invited them to help with ddnet instead and left
15:13 < mr_pause> deen: Wow, i would have never thought they were so low oO
15:13 <@deen> vali: so i need to stop all block servers we run worldwide?
15:14 < EastByte> deen: blocker seems to attract criminal minds like a magnet
15:14 < EastByte> even fisted taught me that
15:14 < vali> true
15:14 < mr_pause> EastByte: What's blocker ?
15:14 < Ama> vali at least leave the chile servers 
15:14 < EastByte> mr_pause: tw mod like ddrace
15:14 < Ama> the latinos never did anything bad :D
15:14 <@deen> guess i have to pay for more servers then
15:14 < laxa_work> stupid game mod on teeworlds with relly simple (and boring) gameplay
15:15 < mr_pause> EastByte: What's the fuss about it ?
15:15 < laxa_work> gameplay is simple, noobs like that
15:15 < Ama> we all dont like blocker servers XD
15:15 < laxa_work> the aim is just to block others in freeze
15:15 <@deen> it's agreed that i run blocker servers for people and get the free servers for ddnet for that
15:15 < EastByte> mr_pause: it's about blocking other people; betray and being betrayed
15:15 < mr_pause> laxa_work: Well if people want to play that, what's the harm ?
15:15 < laxa_work> You loose my friendship
15:15 < Ama> deen i guess just european servers 
15:15 < laxa_work> same if you play LoL
15:15 < mr_pause> I don't understand why people care so much about what other people do
15:16 < Ama> save if you play dota 
15:16 < Ama> dota players are such noobs
15:16 < laxa_work> Ama: sure.
15:16 < mr_pause> Same with people eating pasta, such noobs !
15:16 < Ama> im joking :D
15:16 < mr_pause> I don't even talk about those breathing air !
15:16 < laxa_work> Stop flooding, I can't work
15:17 < Ama> laxa you dont need to work
15:17 < laxadedi> Yes I need lu;z
15:17 < EastByte> mr_pause: please stop breathing :)
15:17 < mr_pause> EastByte: My body won't allow that !
15:18 < laxadedi> Ama: even if most people would say the opposite, I have a life !
15:18 <@deen> also, we've been running Sergio's blockserver since forever
15:18 <@deen> he's a nice kid, i wouldn't give up his block server
15:18 <@deen> he even has weekly tournaments with his friends
15:19 < mr_pause> I cant swear he does not.
15:19 < mr_pause> can*
15:19 < laxadedi> mr_pause: fuck off lol
15:19 < mr_pause> laxadedi: =D
15:20 < Ama> we should just do whats best for ddnet i guess 
15:20 < laxadedi> Ama: what would it be ?
15:20 <@deen> i just started the block servers on request
15:20 < mr_pause> laxadedi: I think i'll have some time this week-end for vuln hunt on ddnet server, wanna help me ?
15:20 < laxadedi> mr_pause: how ?
15:20 < mr_pause> laxadedi: Well, code audit
15:20 < EastByte> mr_pause: I'll help you
15:20 <@deen> oh, and ddnet persian is also getting attacked recently, but i guess that's not by vali's friends, but by the other persian servers
15:20 < Ama> i dont now get a 2 euro server and let blocker server run on that 
15:21 <@deen> mr_pause: awesome
15:21 < mr_pause> laxadedi: You can start by `grep memcpy|strcpy`
15:21 < mr_pause> (Not sure if applicable here since there is a lot of custom functions)
15:21 < mr_pause> But you get the idea
15:21 < vali>  im back
15:21 < EastByte> mem_copy
15:21 < laxadedi> We will see that next week-end
15:21 < EastByte> strcpy isn't used
15:22 <@deen> EastByte: in ddnet it is^^
15:22 < EastByte> well
15:22 < Ama> im the only guy that cant code in this channel freaking nerds
15:22 <@deen> in the sql_score.cpp
15:22 <@deen> Ama: and the only person not running a teeworlds server!
15:22 < laxadedi> Ama: IRC is main place for developpers to discuss !
15:22 < mr_pause> deen: It's a pleasure to help you guys, you get enough dos, vulns on top of that would be hardcore =D
15:22 < laxadedi> deen: mr_pause doesn't run anything, his own server is down.
15:23 < mr_pause> laxadedi: LOL true =D
15:23 < EastByte> mr_pause: server vulns are really rare
15:23 < Ama> and laxas servers are like dead servers 
15:23 < laxadedi> they were not this week end !
15:23 < laxadedi> and my teamspeak is used...
15:23 < mr_pause> EastByte: In ddnet or in general ?
15:23 < EastByte> general
15:23 <@deen> there's a lot of strcpy in sql_score.cpp, doesn't really look attackable, but should still be fixed
15:23 < Ama> yeah your teamspeak is awesome :D
15:24 < mr_pause> EastByte: Heatbleed !
15:24 < mr_pause> In one of the most used libs in the world
15:24 < EastByte> tw doesn't use ssl
15:24 < EastByte> oh
15:24 < EastByte> I was talking about tw in general
15:25 <@deen> i replicated the database to GER again
15:25 <@deen> so ranks should work on GER even when FRA is ddosed
15:25 < mr_pause> I'm sure there's things to find in ddnet =)
15:25 <@deen> (removed it before because i thought GER would stay down indefinitely)
15:26 < laxadedi> deen: would'nt it better to get a really cheap server to serve as master server for the DB ?
15:26 < mr_pause> EastByte: laxa told me about some guy with a working vuln this morning
15:26 <@deen> there's also https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues if someone is bored
15:26 <@deen> laxadedi: it would have high latency all around the world and probably even packet loss
15:26 < EastByte> vali claims to have some kind of vuln
15:26 <@deen> long time packetloss for the db server would mean that records are not saved
15:26 < laxadedi> that's I was talking about mr_pause.
15:27 <@deen> so i think the database should run on each server
15:27 < laxadedi> deen: hum ok...
15:27 < EastByte> deen: also you should use ipv6 between the servers
15:27 < mr_pause> vali: Be a player, tell me about the vuln !
15:27 <@deen> EastByte: i want to, but most servers don't speak ipv6
15:28 < mr_pause> vali: Or don't actually, i'd rather find that by myself
15:28 <@deen> mr_pause: i think it's just a flooding vulnerability, but should be fixed in ddnet
15:28 < mr_pause> deen: That should only crash by resource depletion then, and even that shouldn't really crash, just slow massively
15:29 < EastByte> so he is able to cause big ddos attacks and has some flooding vuln on normal servers
15:29 <@deen> i'd guess they have their own botnet, since they don't seem to pay for ddos attacks
15:29 <@deen> don't have any other explanation for how they ddos for hours at 4 am
15:29 < EastByte> and what about amplification?
15:29 < EastByte> much faster to control
15:29 <@deen> haven't actually checked if it's amplification
15:30 <@deen> servers are down too quickly to check
15:30 < EastByte> even too much traffic for ovh?
15:30 <@deen> yes
15:30 < EastByte> hm
15:30 <@deen> had 90% packetloss for 10 minutes before
15:31 <@deen> as i said, it's pretty easy to get around ovh's ddos protection
15:31 < EastByte> I thought ovh throws away everything if it gets too hard
15:32 <@deen> no
15:32 <@deen> they seem to filter by source-ip
15:32 <@deen> and ips get accepted again after a few minutes of no attack
15:32 < EastByte> why does kimsufi not allow firewall rules...
15:32 <@deen> because you should pay 100 € for a proper server
15:33 < EastByte> well I have the ddos protection pro on my kimsufi
15:33 <@deen> yeah, but you don't get that anymore
15:33 < EastByte> also the vps provide it
15:33 < EastByte> what about soyoustart?
15:34 <@deen> same
15:34 <@deen> no, vps doesn't provide it either i think
15:34 <@deen> (anymore)
15:34 < EastByte> deen: I tested it yesterday
15:34 < EastByte> have one ovh vps right now
15:34 <@deen> newly bought one?
15:34 < EastByte> yes, for testing
15:35 < EastByte> so I wasted my todays coffee money for a vps
15:35 < EastByte> nvm
15:35 <@deen> weird that you get ddos pro
15:35 <@deen> it says you only get it for "professional servers"
15:36 < EastByte> hm dunno whether it's pro, but I can enable permanent mitigation and firewall rules
15:36 < EastByte> maybe ddos protection pro something even different
15:37 <@deen> nope, that's what pro is
15:37 <@deen> i guess it's because you have a kimsufi server from long ago
15:37 < EastByte> maybe^^
15:38 < EastByte> would be funny if it works on further kimsufi servers aswell
15:38 <@deen> the ovh vps also lags i think
15:38 < EastByte> oohh yes
15:38 < EastByte> it's damn horrible
15:39 < EastByte> seems to be the most oversold shit
15:39 <@deen> because at some point i thought you could just get 10 of them and run them as ddnet europe
15:39 < Savander> hi :)
15:39 <@deen> hi
15:39 < EastByte> deen: I also like this idea
15:39 < EastByte> liked*
15:39 <@deen> it has many problems though
15:39 <@deen> you generally don't get unlimited traffic, so one server would end up going over traffic
15:39 < EastByte> 10TB
15:40 <@deen> same for cpu resources, when 1 server randomly fills up, it starts to lag
15:40 <@deen> can't just push players over to another server
15:41 < EastByte> unfortunatly
15:41 <@deen> vali: also, GER wasn't running any block servers and still gets ddosed
15:41 < EastByte> this feature would be overkill for tw
15:43 <@deen> I'll try to close the 3 FRA block servers, but keep sergio's running
15:46 < vali> deen
15:46 <@deen> yes?
15:47 < vali> when you have time to speak with me
15:47 <@deen> i have time right now
15:49 < vali> i havnt time
15:49 < vali> im not at home
15:50 < laxadedi> deen: I would personally not negotiate with terrorist
15:50 <@deen> laxadedi: you mean i should keep the blocker servers running?
15:50 < vali> stupid????
15:50 < laxadedi> Do as you want, I am just saying that I think
15:51 <@deen> laxadedi: well, we could run them on your server :P
15:51 < laxadedi> I don't care of blocker servers, it's just a general opinion
15:51 < laxadedi> My server is too weak :p
15:51 <@deen> they're not connected to ddnet stuff anyway
15:52 < Savander> so.. close blocker
15:52 <@deen> Savander: done already
15:53 < Savander> if it can prevent ddos..
15:53 <@deen> they say so, but i don't believe it
15:53 < Savander> you know
15:53 <@deen> GER gets ddosed without running any block servers
15:53 < Savander> better for all
15:53 < Savander> but it was ddnet
15:53 < Savander> i guess?
15:53 < Savander> just ddnet
15:53 <@deen> what?
15:53 < mr_pause> Yup, i would send drones on terrorists instead =P
15:53 < Savander> doesn't matter maybe if its ger or fra?
15:54 < Savander> Amazon Drones
15:54 < Savander> xd
15:54 < mr_pause> No, Hellfire-sending drones =D
15:54 < Savander> btw!
15:54 < Savander> TERRORISTS
15:54 < Savander> LOOl
15:54 < Savander> :D
15:54 < vali> i heared you want beginn war with me savander????
15:54 < Savander> What!?:D
15:54 < Savander> Ye, sure
15:54 < Savander> :(
15:55 < Savander> WTF
15:55 < EastByte> vali: are you able to crash my server without ddosa?
15:55 < Savander> ?
15:55 < vali> than lets begin
15:55 < vali> sure
15:56 < EastByte> vali: I wanna see
15:56 < vali> savander i hope you will have fun in next time
15:56 < vali> eastbyte if im at home
15:57 < vali> than ye
15:57 < EastByte> okay
15:57 < Savander> vali: ?
15:57 < Savander> what you want doo?:c
15:57 < vali> you will see
15:57 < Savander> i don't want
15:59 < vali> your own fault
16:01 < Savander> hmm?
16:03 < mr_pause> He DoSed himself !
16:03 < mr_pause> Victory !
16:03 < Savander> xD
16:03 <@deen> nah, he just realized that he didn't use aproxy
16:03 <@deen> a proxy*
16:04 < mr_pause> Well it seems he used webchat, so =/
16:04 < EastByte> or he just went out of a phone cell
16:04 < EastByte> mr_pause: the webchat mirrors the ip I think
16:05 < EastByte> it's from quakenet itself
16:05 < EastByte> (the webapp)
16:06 < laxadedi> Fucking terrorists...
16:06 < EastByte> so now I'm curous what happens when he tries to crash my server

16:12 < laxadedi> Savander: I'll earn my own entry in wikipedia during my life, believe me.
16:12 < laxadedi> deen: xD, nice !
16:12 < BeaR_> what happend to the ranks ?:
16:12 <@deen> just not sure sure if that's useful in the long run, since the new host will also be oversold after some time
16:12 < vali> -_-
16:13 <@deen> BeaR_: what ranks?
16:13 <@deen> hmm, should i accept or not?
16:13 < vali> accept what
16:14 < laxadedi> deen: I personally don't think you'll find good ddos protection in GER, especially from the first experience you had, they are thief, and their ddos protection might be cheap shit.
16:14 <@deen> hm =/
16:14 < laxadedi> but, then again, it's your decision !
16:14 < BeaR_> deen: seems like the sql crashed or whatever, as server doesnt output points and ranks
16:14 < mr_pause> So much people joining !
16:14 <@deen> BeaR_: what server?
16:14 < vali> laxa you know nothing
16:14 < BeaR_> ddnet GER port 8320
16:14 < laxadedi> vali: sure, I am a fucking noob and I know nothing, please enlight us of your knowledge

16:20 < BeaR_> deen: usually dont use ddnet client :d
16:20 <@deen> BeaR_: why not? =/
16:21 <@deen> BeaR_: when you are moderator you must use it, otherwise attackers can take over rcon
16:21 < BeaR_> ok good to know
16:21 <@deen> attackers can spoof ip and use rcon
16:21 < BeaR_> Not so good for playing vanilla imho /:
16:21 <@deen> and they find out your ip because you request their server over the masterserver
16:21 <@deen> BeaR_: really? why not?
16:22 < BeaR_> minimum fps is pretty low
16:22 <@deen> i always thought you can use ddnet client exactly like vanilla
16:22 <@deen> how low?
16:22 < BeaR_> goes down to ~200fps 
16:23 < BeaR_> prefer 300fps+
16:23 < vali> im back again, sry my english is bad because i have 5 languages
16:23 < EastByte> your german is fluent
16:24 <@deen> BeaR_: hm, I'd use vsync. should not affect ping at all in ddnet client
16:24 < laxadedi> EastByte: mine isn't :p
16:24 <@deen> BeaR_: but if you want the old fps back i guess you could set gfx_threaded_old 0 and gfx_asyncrender_old 0
16:24 < vali> you can block it easy
16:24 < laxadedi> BeaR_: you screen display more than 140 fps ?!
16:24 < EastByte> laxadedi: nah
16:24 < vali> with ip spoofing
16:25 < BeaR_> It's more about input delay and prediction as they are coupled to the fps
16:25 < BeaR_> which is noticeable
16:25 < laxadedi> Oh ok
16:25 < BeaR_> deen: thx, gonna give it a try
16:25 <@deen> BeaR_: i thought they aren't in ddnet client
16:26 <@deen> i couldn't play in old vanilla client either because of vsync increasing ping by 20
16:26 < EastByte> and I still play without async
16:28 < EastByte> deen: wouldn't it be cool to have some packetmanager which runs in usermode/nonroot?
16:28 < EastByte> no matter what distribution just portable
16:28 <@deen> EastByte: i think there are a few
16:28 < EastByte> I would like to stick multiple vps together to a cloud
16:28 < laxadedi> homebrew for Mac runs in usermode
16:28 < EastByte> well great
16:29 <@deen> yeah, let's get mac servers!
16:29 < laxadedi> Worst idea ever xD
16:29 <@deen> EastByte: and then?
16:30 < EastByte> later it can make hosting much easier
16:30 <@deen> how?
16:31 < EastByte> for example if one vps is not stable at the moment
16:31 <@deen> i think i'll never be able to find a server like the one at datafabrik again
16:31 < EastByte> just move the specific server software on another server automatically
16:31 < EastByte> stuff like that

19:07 < EastByte> laxa: give me an ts channel pls
19:07 < laxa> xD
19:07 < EastByte> but I can't find a good name
19:07 < laxa> Everyone wants his own channel !
19:07 < laxa> Oh, I remember now, you asked me for that long time ago but you had no name right ?
19:08 < EastByte> actually you told me that I'm allowed to ask you
19:08 < laxa> Yeah
19:08 < EastByte> and I said I don't have a nam
19:08 < laxa> Everyone is
19:08 < EastByte> hmm east's world
19:09 < laxa> Where do you want it to be sorted ?
19:09 < EastByte> east's area
19:09 < EastByte> hmm
19:09 < EastByte> east's place for non laxas
19:09 < EastByte> hm dunno
19:09 < laxa> Teeworlds ?
19:09 < EastByte> you can put it after yours
19:11 < EastByte> or am I not important enough? :P
19:11 < laxa> I would rather have a new root category :p
19:11 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
19:11 < laxa> linux's world / developper's place
19:11 < laxa> something like that 
19:11 < EastByte> yay
19:12 < laxa> choose one :p
19:12 <@deen> great, next ddos
19:12 < EastByte> and only users can go in who are able to asnwer the "1 + 1 = 10" question
19:12 < EastByte> deen: which server?
19:12 <@deen> GER
19:12 < laxa> I am afraid I can't do that lol, but you'll have the rights on your channel and will be able to modify it
19:12 < EastByte> so the vps
19:12 <@deen> 19:11 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
19:12 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
19:12 < laxa> to set password or change codec / sound quality
19:12 < EastByte> ya I saw it
19:12 <@deen> oh, weird
19:12 <@deen> it's back with all players
19:13 <@deen> maybe just FRA acting up
19:13 <@deen> nope, ddos
19:13 < EastByte> or the ddos is being blocked
19:13 < BeaR_> rip server ):
19:13 <@deen> nothing is blocked
19:13 <@deen> so much for the whole "it's the blocker servers!"
19:14 < EastByte> it's the blocker servers!
19:14 < BeaR_> screw them!
19:14 < BeaR_> btw some1 is logging this channel?
19:14 < EastByte> me
19:14 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
19:15 < laxa> BeaR_: me on windows + my dedicated
19:44 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
19:45 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
20:02 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
20:04 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!

20:56 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
20:56 < EastByte> c'mon
20:57 <@deen> they won't leave FRA alone
20:59 < EastByte> 5.1.80.43:8303
20:59 < EastByte> is this the new vps?
20:59 <@deen> yes
21:02 <@deen> no wonder they ddos FRA all the time, it's the fullest remaining block server in teeworlds
21:02 <@deen> they must be ddosing everyone if players even come to FRA
21:02 <@deen> all these ddos attacks make more block players come to ddnet and fewer ddrace players
21:02 <@deen> it's sad
21:09 < EastByte> on which server is the db running right now?
21:14 <@deen> every one
21:14 <@deen> except persian
21:15 <@deen> i guess ovh wouldn't care that their ddos protection doesn't work?
21:15 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
21:15 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
21:15 <@deen> Traffic graph for today: http://ddnet.tw/traffic.png
21:17 < heinrich5991> btw
21:17 < heinrich5991> do you know how much traffic a tw server consumes?
21:17 <@deen> i had numbers but i forgot them
21:17 < EastByte> when I connected ~64 dummies to a server I had about 3mbit/s down
21:18 < EastByte> all I know :D
21:21 <@deen> we always had about 2 TB / month on GER
21:22 < EastByte> deen: so can you find out what kind of traffic ddosed the server?
21:22 <@deen> EastByte: i'm too stupid^^
21:22 < laxa> EastByte: so, any idea between VGA -> Displayport | VGA -> HDMI ?
21:23 < EastByte> deen: I would love to know how the traffic looks like
21:24 < EastByte> the worst case would be that they are using a botnet which attacks using tw like udp packets
21:24 < EastByte> ban everything else could be blocked using an ip firewall rule (in ddos  pro)
21:24 < EastByte> and*
21:25 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/A1isxg
21:25 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 66d0e3f savander: Skin name in skin selector
21:25 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3875741 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #51 from savander/DDRace64...
21:25 < EastByte> laxa: dunno
21:27 <@deen> Savander: thanks for the patch
21:28 < Savander> :)
21:34 < EastByte> heinrich5991: do you think it's possible to simulate an unreliable datagram protocol over multiple tcp streams?
21:34 < heinrich5991> yes, pretty sure
21:34 < heinrich5991> why do you ask?
21:34 <@deen> that doesn't sound like a good idea, EastByte 
21:35 < EastByte> IT IS :)
21:35 <@deen> why would you want to do that?
21:35 < EastByte> usable like a fallback protocol since udp doesn't pass ddos protections anyways
21:35 < heinrich5991> mh
21:35 < EastByte> also for making multiplayer games using html5/websockets
21:35 < EastByte> well I know there is webrtc
21:35 <@deen> don't think the ddos problems with OVH have anything to do with that
21:35 < heinrich5991> I agree with the latter
21:36 < heinrich5991> (with the wbsockets thing)
21:36 < EastByte> ^
21:36 < laxa> ok, finally reserved VGA to HDMI, will get it tomorrow, hopefully it'll fix my problem.
21:38 < EastByte> anyways, ddos protections can hardly support udp game protocols since they don't know how the handshake is going on
21:38 < EastByte> in tcp it's a standard
21:40 < XXLTomate> deen: can you splitt the traffic graph into up and downstream?
21:41 <@deen> XXLTomate: that's only downstream
21:42 < XXLTomate> ah ok bad
21:42 < EastByte> would be interesting if that wouldn't be the case^^
21:50 < XXLTomate> yea 
21:51 < heinrich5991> deen: how do you get those graphs?
21:52 <@deen> from the kimsufi manager thing
21:55 < laxa> deen: I have a question for you
21:55 <@deen> yes
21:55 < laxa> well, others could say what they would do
21:56 < laxa> take this simple scenario
21:56 < laxa> You helped one day a member of your family (exclude parents and childs) like a taunt.
21:56 < laxa> You cleaned her computer from malicious shits like pubs, explorer bars etc...
21:57 < laxa> but then, 6 months later (or any amount of time), she asks you to do the same
21:57 < laxa> what would you do ?
21:57 <@deen> "I haven't seen Windows for 10 years, no idea how to fix that."
21:57 < laxa> imagine you could fix windows :p
21:57 <@deen> i can :P
21:57 < laxa> Lol !
21:58 < laxa> So you would lie
21:58 <@deen> it's not a lie, i have no idea
21:58 <@deen> i could google
21:58 <@deen> and would probably solve it
21:58 < laxa> I just told her that now I am a computer engineer and I am not a technician anymore
21:58 < laxa> but my parents are like real mad
21:59 < laxa> I don't wanna spend my entire like helping them solve their shit...
21:59 < laxa> especially the only good thing would be to educate them, I don't wanna do that
21:59 < laxa> especially since
22:02 <@deen> yeah, common proble
22:02 <@deen> m
22:05 < laxa> I am just hoping they won't bring this shit anymore :p
22:06 < laxa> apparently mr_pause wanna hunt bugs tonight, we might do that !
22:06 <@deen> so they gave me a non-oversold vps now
22:06 < EastByte> yaay
22:06 <@deen> i think it's still lagging, even with 2 players...
22:06 < laxa> thought you wanted to terminate the contract
22:06 <@deen> i wanted, they didn't let me
22:08 < EastByte> !twp east
22:08 < Nimda> east is currently playing Kobra 2 on server : DDNet FRA - Novice [DDraceNetwork].
22:14 < Savander> http://www.ovh.com/us/anti-ddos/surplus-network.xml
22:23 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
22:24 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
22:25 <@deen> ok, the new server sucks as well
22:25 <@deen> terrible lags all the time
22:26 < EastByte> deen: check out the qz clan server
22:33 <@deen> EastByte: even their root servers are pretty cheap, can nearly compete with kimsufi
22:33 < EastByte> of datafabrik?
22:33 <@deen> no, proplay
22:33 < EastByte> ah
22:33 < EastByte> forgot they have dedicated servers
22:33 <@deen> datafabrik starts at 90 €
22:35 < EastByte> I think minus once hosted one of the master servers at proplay
22:35 <@deen> probably before they were attacked
22:35 < EastByte> and that was were the attacks took down all the masters
22:35 <@deen> now they're at OVH i guess
22:35 < vali> this was vunny
22:35 < EastByte> yes, now
22:35 < EastByte> but proplay seems to be useless when it comes to ddos
22:37 < EastByte> vali: what was funny
22:37 < vali> and that was were the attacks took down all the masters
22:37 < vali> it was last year
22:37 < vali> was very vunny
22:37 < EastByte> ah
22:37 < vali> :3
22:38 < vali> 4 days without master server :)
22:38 <@deen> vali: you wanted to say something to me?
22:38 < vali> nope
22:38 < vali> not now
22:38 < vali> im calling with teemo, pwnd and silver
22:39 <@deen> any complaints if i ban vali from this channel?
22:39 < vali> you cant ban me
22:39 < vali> this is the problem
22:40 <@deen> just stop coming here then
22:40 < vali> nope, im everywhere
22:41 < laxa> we can prevent you from coming here at least
22:42 <@deen> hm, that didn't work^^
22:42 < heinrich5991> now you need to /kick #ddnet vali
22:42 < heinrich5991> currently he just can't talk, join
22:42 < EastByte> I give him 30 seconds to come back
22:42 <@deen> yeah, i know it's useless
22:42 <@deen> but heinrich5991 asked me to do it
22:43 < laxa> you can set specific modes for the channel deen
22:43 < heinrich5991> thanks for doing this
22:43 < laxa> I don't know IRC very wall
22:43 < heinrich5991> you can make the channel invite only
22:43 < heinrich5991> but I don't think this is what you want
22:43 < vali> vunny
22:43 < laxa> but you can do like : password protected chan / invite only mod
22:43 <@deen> heinrich5991: obviously not
22:43 < EastByte> vali: you took way too long
22:43 < vali> cool
22:43 < laxa> I'll make a test
22:44 < heinrich5991> kick him
22:44 < EastByte> would be easier to create a second "ddnet private" channel
22:45 < asdjhasdk> No
22:45 < heinrich5991> yea
22:45 < asdjhasdk> No
22:46 < laxa> deen: https://www.quakenet.org/help/general/what-channel-modes-are-available-on-quakenet
22:46 <@deen> and as expected we're getting ddosed now
22:56 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
22:57 < laxa> deen: to get rid of vali, there are 3 solutions so far that I have found
22:57 < laxa> I guess the best is to use mode +r, that'll only allow AUTHED user in the channel
22:57 < laxa> then you just ban every account he makes
22:58 <@deen> great solutions, laxa
22:58 <@deen> then you can watch the servers getting ddosed
22:58 <@deen> how can i make you guys channel operator?
22:59 < laxa> https://www.quakenet.org/help/general/how-do-i-addremove-someone-on-a-channel
22:59 < laxa> but that works only with AUTH user
22:59 < laxa> or you can do temporary OP or VOICE
23:01 < laxa> Thought vali stopped the ddos, who is doing it then oO ?
23:02 < EastByte> why would he stop it?
23:02 < laxa> those kids don't ask for anything or make threats, they just ddos, I don't get it...
23:02 < laxa> Well, block servers are not hosted anymore
23:02 < laxa> why would they ?!
23:02 < EastByte> they are like trolls
23:02 < EastByte> you know how it works
23:03 < laxa> well, I guess, if they have a botnet and wanna trolls us
23:03 < laxa> it's never going to end...
23:03 <@deen> laxa: when the ddos starts right after i ban vali, who do you think it ddosing?
23:03 <@deen> is*
23:03 < laxa> hum right
23:03 < EastByte> and why does he ddos fra?
23:04 <@deen> because there is 1 player on a FRA blocker server
23:04 <@deen> or because FRA is the main ddnet server
23:04 <@deen> so he basically banned me from irc :P
23:04 <@deen> because my bouncer is sitting there too
23:04 < EastByte> hm yes
23:05 <@deen> anyway, i don't know how to give you guys @ before the name
23:05 < EastByte> xd
23:05 < laxa> that won't change anything
23:05 <@deen> well, you seem to have ideas about what to do with the channel, feel free to do that
23:06 <@deen> i just returned the new (laggy) server
23:06 <@deen> worked after all :P
23:06 < EastByte> where was it hosted?
23:06 <@deen> KMS-Hosting in Frankfurt
23:06 < EastByte> k
23:06 < laxa> ./msg Q CHANLEV #ddnet user +o
23:07 < laxa> if you want automatic op, you need to add the flag "a"
23:07 < laxa> so +ao
23:07 <@deen> i guess he'll ddos them all now
23:07 <@deen> now GER is goingdown
23:07 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
23:08 < ochristi> just lost connection :'(
23:08 < laxa> heinrich5991: you are the allmighty now :p
23:08 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
23:08 < ochristi> but it was GER
23:09 < EastByte> deen: I'm authed now, gimme OP :)
23:09 <@EastByte> thanks
23:09 < laxa> EastByte: it's not permanent xD
23:09 <@EastByte> not?
23:09 < laxa> +o = temp
23:09 < laxa> +ao = auto op
23:09 <@EastByte> no
23:09 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
23:09 <@EastByte> oh
23:09 <@EastByte> okay
23:10 <@heinrich5991> I thought +o would be permanent, but you wouldn't get it on join
23:10 <@heinrich5991> (you have to ask Q for it)
23:10 <@EastByte> he is gone
23:10 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:10 < laxa> is everyone registered on the channel ?
23:10 <@heinrich5991> it's permanent
23:10 <@EastByte> kay
23:11 < laxa> hum
23:11 <@heinrich5991> no, you're not e.g.
23:11 < laxa> yes I am
23:11 < laxa> or I should be
23:11 <@heinrich5991> oh yes
23:11 < laxa> I am on laxa, not on laxadedi
23:11 <@heinrich5991> you're just not cloaked
23:12 <@deen> i guess their approach is working pretty great
23:12 <@deen> they have the most popular servers in europe now
23:12 <@EastByte> who?
23:12 <@deen> AKK
23:13 <@deen> vali, teemo, nazar, pwned
23:13 <@EastByte> ah
23:13 <@heinrich5991> ah
23:13 <@heinrich5991> that's their incentive
23:13 <@heinrich5991> that makes a little more sense
23:13 <@deen> their server isn't even ddos protected
23:13 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
23:14 <@heinrich5991> deen: has he ever said that he's performing the dos attacks?
23:14 <@deen> heinrich5991: of course not
23:14 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
23:15 <@deen> the attacks just randomly happen right after talking to hi
23:15 <@deen> him*
23:15 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
23:16 <@heinrich5991> laxa: mh, do you have some evidence?
23:16 < laxa> well, they talked german on my teamspeak, apparently they said they were doing it
23:16 < laxa> or at least implied
23:17 < laxa> but since I don't really understand german well enough, I can't say
23:17 < laxa> and there is no record
23:17 <@deen> they always just imply it
23:17 <@EastByte> he tried to let the people believ it's his client causing the ddos
23:17 <@heinrich5991> that doesn't sound true IMO
23:17 <@heinrich5991> I mean
23:17 <@deen> lol
23:17 <@heinrich5991> what can you do on your local line
23:17 <@deen> ddnet fra is getting so much ddos that OVH believes the server physically failed
23:18 < laxa> xD
23:18 <@heinrich5991> wow
23:18 <@deen> they're sending someone out to repair it^^
23:18 <@EastByte> botnet definitly
23:18 < laxa> tell them their ddos protection just sucks
23:18 <@EastByte> xd
23:18 <@EastByte> too weak for a small opensource game
23:18 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
23:20 <@EastByte> well there is no way to get out of this situation
23:20 <@EastByte> it's way too dangerous to debate with such people
23:20 < laxa> I feel the same, but you should not let them "win"
23:20 <@heinrich5991> mh
23:21 <@EastByte> I would
23:21 <@heinrich5991> ovh advertises ddos protection
23:21 <@heinrich5991> how much is the attack approx?
23:21 <@deen> not much
23:21 <@heinrich5991> ca.
23:21 <@deen> it's just clever i think
23:21 <@deen> since GER only goes down for a short time I'd say less than 10 gbit/s
23:21 <@heinrich5991> have you looked into the logs of the tw server?
23:21 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
23:21 <@heinrich5991> uhm no
23:21 <@deen> tw server? they are not affected
23:22 <@heinrich5991> mh
23:22 <@deen> Dear Customer,
23:22 <@deen> On 2014-10-06 23:14:02, we noticed a fault on your server and we have
23:22 <@deen> scheduled an intervention in order to fix this fault.
23:22 <@deen> However, on 2014-10-06 23:19:04 our monitoring system did not detect any fault on
23:22 <@deen> your dedicated server ns336037.ip-176-31-125.eu
23:22 <@deen> We did not intervene on your machine. We do not know the origin of this
23:22 <@deen> fault.
23:22 <@heinrich5991> I wonder where the first failing part is
23:22 <@deen> The scheduled intervention has been cancelled from our list.
23:22 <@deen> heinrich5991: the network connection is overloaded
23:22 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
23:23 < Forris> hey
23:23 <@deen> welcome to the ddos watchers channel, Forris
23:23 < Forris> ?
23:23 < laxa> !wiki DDOS
23:23 < Nimda> In computing, a denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Although the means to carry out, the motives for, and targets of a DoS attack vary, it generally consists of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet. As ... ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDOS )
23:23 <@heinrich5991> hey :)
23:23 < Forris> these are the ddosers? :OO
23:24 <@heinrich5991> no
23:24 <@EastByte> okay maybe it's not a botnet
23:25 <@EastByte> 100mbit/s isn't much traffic if you can bypass the firewall
23:25 <@deen> now USA getting ddoes
23:25 <@deen> ddosed*
23:25 <@deen> but they don't get much traffic through to USA
23:25 <@deen> just 10 mbit/s
23:25 <@heinrich5991> lol
23:25 <@deen> :P
23:25 <@deen> so nothing ever happens
23:25 <@heinrich5991> and I wonder
23:26 <@EastByte> deen: analyse the traffic, now xd
23:26 <@deen> EastByte: how?
23:26 <@EastByte> just make a short tcpdump
23:26 <@heinrich5991> tcpdmp
23:26 <@deen> ah, it's growing to 40 mbit/s
23:26 <@heinrich5991> make sure to quit it soon enough
23:26 < laxa> I am on USA to see if any lags are present
23:27 <@EastByte> ^ since you live in france, yes there are
23:27 < laxa> Not currently
23:28 <@deen> tcpdump just seems to hang
23:29 < Forris> Maybe if there are too much ips coming in short window of time, you cant let any ips connect for some minutes, so players that are already on ddnet can play and the others are not able to join
23:29 <@deen> Forris: stop dreaming :P
23:30 <@deen> ah, now i have it
23:30 < Forris> ye my english is not the yellow from the egg
23:30 <@EastByte> did you dump it via -w ?
23:30 <@heinrich5991> sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w packetdump
23:30 <@heinrich5991> please
23:30 <@deen> yeah
23:30 <@deen> did that
23:30 <@heinrich5991> (or the right device)
23:30 <@heinrich5991> 1) that thing could contain sensitive information
23:30 <@deen> these look like TW packets
23:31 <@heinrich5991> (think rcon passwords)
23:31 <@heinrich5991> 2) could you give it to me anyway?
23:31 <@deen> ^^
23:31 <@EastByte> I need it 
23:31 <@heinrich5991> don't post it in the channel though
23:31 <@EastByte> maybe ip spoofed tw packets
23:31 <@heinrich5991> give it to everyone who wnats it individually
23:31 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:31 <@heinrich5991> (there's actually an attack possible with TW server)
23:32 <@deen> i think USA only went down once
23:32 <@EastByte> yes might be too late
23:33 <@deen> that was pretty late in the attack
23:33 <@deen> only receiving ~3 mbit/s there i think
23:33 <@heinrich5991> how long did you run the command?
23:33 <@deen> a few seconds
23:33 <@heinrich5991> then the ddos was over
23:33 <@heinrich5991> it's only 2.2MB, the file
23:34 <@EastByte> hm 6280 packets in a few seconds?
23:35 <@deen> 370 KB/s, that's about 20 times of what's usual for the number of players on USA
23:35 <@deen> right now it's 20 KB/s
23:35 <@heinrich5991> oh ok
23:35 <@deen> IP 92.242.167.124.adsl-pool.sx.cn.35663 > v-74-91-114-132.unman-vds.internap-dallas.nfoservers.com.8303: UDP, length 600
23:35 <@deen> these look suspicious
23:36 <@EastByte> they ARE!
23:36 <@deen> coming from china and all
23:36 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/06_Oct-14-23_35.png
23:37 <@heinrich5991> those packets do look suspicious
23:37 <@heinrich5991> they only contain ascii uppercase letters
23:37 <@EastByte> that must be the kind of flooding vali is doing
23:38 <@EastByte> lol they are always the same
23:38 <@heinrich5991> no
23:38 <@heinrich5991> different IPs use differnt packets
23:38 <@EastByte> yes
23:38 <@EastByte> so are the ips spoofed?
23:39 <@heinrich5991> oh right
23:39 <@heinrich5991> that's a possibility
23:39 <@EastByte> that would explain everything
23:39 <@heinrich5991> why?
23:39 < mr_pause> Back =D
23:39 <@EastByte> the packets bypass the ovh ddos protection
23:39 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
23:40 <@EastByte> because they are like tw packets
23:40 <@EastByte> well they aren't
23:40 <@EastByte> but it's some kind of random data
23:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Wohoo-GC opened pull request #52: SHIFT+TAB invert completion order in console (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/8umvdQ
23:40 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
23:41 <@deen> next one on FRA
23:41 <@deen> i think it was an HTTP one this time
23:41 <@deen> but haven't looked yet^^
23:41 <@heinrich5991> how long this time?
23:42 <@heinrich5991> SYN flood
23:42 <@deen> ah
23:42 <@deen> right
23:43 <@deen> don't know how long
23:43 <@deen> i can't really record at the peak of the attack
23:43 <@deen> since i can't enter anything
23:46 <@deen> bigger one this time, 5 seconds, 60 MB
23:49 < mr_pause> deen: For now it's regular DoS right, no vuln ?
23:49 <@EastByte> I guess they are doing both
23:49 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
23:49 <@EastByte> the mitigation blocks udp at some point
23:49 <@EastByte> and tcp still comes through
23:49 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
23:49 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
23:49 <@EastByte> yes, there are the strange udp packets again
23:49 <@EastByte> interesting
23:49 <@EastByte> about 5000 http requests
23:49 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
23:49 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
23:50 <@deen> i just got a record of chile right before it went down
23:50 <@deen> just have to wait for it to come back now
23:52 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/7YKotQ
23:52 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 200fc35 Wohoo-GC: SHIFT+TAB invert completion order
23:52 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3a2f078 Wohoo-GC: SHIFT+TAB invert completion order
23:52 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 b0fdc16 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #52 from Wohoo-GC/DDRace64...
23:52 <@EastByte> we might count the number of source ip addresses of the http flood
23:52 <@deen> bastards, taking down Chile
23:52 <@deen> I have to pay for every GB there =/
23:52 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
23:52 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
23:52 <@EastByte> that's bad
23:54 <@EastByte> any ideas how to block a 3 vector attack like that?
23:54 <@EastByte> ovh wasn't even able to block a simple http flood
23:55 <@deen> hm, this is going to take some time, getting the chile dump to FRA
23:55 <@deen> 1 hour approximately
23:55 < mr_pause> EastByte: These things cost money (a lot usually)
23:55 <@deen> mr_pause: the attacks?
23:55 < mr_pause> deen: No, the DoS protection
23:55 <@EastByte> the mitigation
23:55 <@deen> yeah
23:55 < mr_pause> The attacks are probably free =/
23:56 < mr_pause> Or cheap at least
23:58 <@deen> guess we can close down
23:59 <@deen> they're not stopping on chile because there are so many players
23:59 <@deen> with GER, FRA and Chile down ddnet is kind of dead
23:59 <@EastByte> yep
23:59 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
