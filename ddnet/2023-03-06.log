00:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Even funnier the uefi implementation of mbr read it just fine, even as corrupted, which is hilarious to me
00:01 < bridge> <jeti 🐍> hi @Learath2
08:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Good said learath
08:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Windows bad
08:55 < bridge> <Iza> and how is that a bad thing?

13:14 < bridge> <AssassinTee> therefore God is 0
14:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Technically god is falsey
14:13 < bridge> <RafaelFF> The release changelog doesn't fit the client's News page, causing some lines to simply not being shown. Also the News doesn't seem to be scrollable. Is it expected?
15:37 < bridge> <deen> Looks fine to me
15:37 < bridge> <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082310907893391530/Screenshot_2023-03-06_at_15.36.58.png

15:39 < bridge> <deen> Looks fine to me, what is wrong?
15:39 < bridge> <RafaelFF> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082311584128454737/Captura_de_tela_de_2023-03-06_11-39-39.png
15:40 < bridge> <RafaelFF> The last lines are cropped from the News screen
15:40 < bridge> <deen> They are intentionally left out, it says "highlights"
15:40 < bridge> <deen> and yes, they wouldn't fit
15:41 < bridge> <deen> I did it like this since forever
15:52 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Ok, so it is expected. I just now notice this, so I thought it would be better to make sure.
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> @Ravie your profile picture is fking clean bro
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Does anyone know if some parameters in the server config file could be multiline ?
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> 
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> like ```
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> sv_name "eadad
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> adead"
15:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> ```
16:02 < bridge> <deen> I think you can put \n in there
16:17 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Another possible irrelevant thing: When starting a local DDNet Server via the Client's UI, the server output log shows `chatresp: No such command: sv_events.` when reading `reset.cfg` in data folder — which is provided by the ddnet-maps repository.
16:18 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Server works fine, though.
16:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> The changelog in the client could also be made scrollable, but then there would be too much text for old clients. Or does the server know the client version when sending the changelog so it could send less text that in that case?
16:45 < bridge> <deen> We send the version as identifier, so could do that
16:46 < bridge> <deen> but I think it's fine as fixed size
16:46 < bridge> <deen> let me fix that
16:48 < bridge> <Soyler> Hi, would be nice if you can add a feature that adds a button that can run a test server for you with the map you are in
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Also, I noticed that voting random maps (using ddnet-maps maps and configs) doesn't work using the server started in the client UI, but works if I run the server manually. Any idea why?
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> I see these logs:
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> ```
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 2023-03-06 12:56:13 I chat: *** 'RafaelFF' called vote to change server option 'Random Novice Map (Reason=Stars)' (No reason given)
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 2023-03-06 12:56:13 I chat: *** Vote passed
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 2023-03-06 12:56:13 I sql: [4] random map done on read database 0
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 2023-03-06 12:56:13 I chat: *** 'RafaelFF' called vote to change server option 'Random Novice Map (Reason=Stars)' (No reason given)
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 2023-03-06 12:56:13 I chat: *** Vote passed
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 2023-03-06 12:56:13 I chat: *** No maps found on this server!
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> ```
16:58 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Choosing any map from the list works just fine, though.
18:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not a bad thing. I'm just saying it's not really a signal
18:56 < bridge> <murpi> @deen the bottom part of the photoshoot map seems to be cut off?
19:05 < bridge> <deen> yes, you can't s croll down there, map is too small
20:15 < bridge> <Chairn> would it be possible to add tee's name as text in the photoshoot so that we can ctrl+f people?
20:16 < bridge> <louis> oh oops i guess the game layer didn't reach down there
20:17 < bridge> <deen> I can send you the dataset if you want
20:17 < bridge> <deen> We use dzi files:
20:17 < bridge> <deen> https://openseadragon.github.io/examples/tilesource-dzi/
20:18 < bridge> <deen> You'd have to extend the code for that to support search
20:18 < bridge> <deen> we have a json with all locations of player names
20:18 < bridge> <deen> so could be mapped from that
20:18 < bridge> <Chairn> hmm, i can try, when i'll have time (aka probably never)
20:19 < bridge> <deen> I thought so 😄
20:19 < bridge> <deen> it's possible, but I think no one will care enough to build a whole feature in dzi for that
20:19 < bridge> <Chairn> i don't know anything about web technology, but i can probably rebuild it in python
20:19 < bridge> <deen> please don't rebuild it
20:20 < bridge> <deen> In the plugins here I see annotations: https://openseadragon.github.io/#plugins
20:20 < bridge> <deen> hm, not close enough
20:22 < bridge> <Chairn> don't worry, ill never do it because i'll forget it anyway
20:22 < bridge> <Chairn> but from the plugins, should be easy to add annotation that can be searched by browser
21:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wish all these engines would have existed 10 years ago xD
22:32 < bridge> <Chairn> what are good universities in Germany besides KIT?
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> good by what measure?
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wikipedia.de
22:44 < bridge> <Chairn> slightly known should be enough
22:44 < bridge> <Chairn> slightly known internationnally should be enough
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> best xd
22:49 < bridge> <deen> depends on the subject, Uni Saarland, RWTH Aachen, TU München, FU Berlin, TU Berlin come to my mind for CompSci. ETH Zürich is probably better known, but in Switzerland. For medicine Heidelberg is well known. I think much of the top research is happening at research institutes like MPI though
22:51 < bridge> <deen> Trying to apply for some?
22:56 < bridge> <Chairn> looking for postdocs
