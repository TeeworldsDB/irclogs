10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The claim: Room temp (~300K) superconductor exists and we got it!
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The replication attempts: The production method is so poorly documented only a fraction of the samples being made shows any interesting properties. And among those interesting ones, results varies. Very few, if any, attempt actually completely shows the entire spectrum of properties and behaviors of a true superconductor at room temperature yet. But those kinds of experiments take time so it isn't an indicator of problem.
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > My take: It is probably something interesting but not well understood. Best case scenario, the original sample in the Korean lab probably won the synthesis lottery and is actually a true room temp superconductor. Worst case scenario, we got another class of high temp (warmer than liquid nitrogen but cold enough that applications are limited) superconductor but nothing revolutionary since at this point, it is pretty conclusive that there is somet

10:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> at least the generic_unhookable one probably shouldn't be in normal. that's for normal-shaped tees ^^
10:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure about the hooded one, depends on whether the eyes work I guess?
10:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> gold doesn't really have an intrinsic value, similar to bitcoin
10:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the intrinsic value is a loot lower than the current prices
10:34 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro why my game still in 10-20fps wtf
10:34 < bridge_> <yakupie> its says issues fom opengl
10:34 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i fix that
10:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> How does it say this to you? Screenshot please
10:37 < ChillerDragon> > normal-shaped tees
10:37 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 please stop using exclusive body shaming language
10:37 < bridge_> <yakupie> stfu you re hacker xd
10:37 < bridge_> <yakupie> do you remember me?
10:37 < bridge_> <yakupie> I FIX THAT ERROR BUT ITS COME AGAIN
10:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ah yeah
10:38 < bridge_> <yakupie> but now says your opengl doesnt support bla bla
10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I told you, you have no OpenGL driver at all. Use the software rendering, buy new PC or try Linux, win 64bit etc
10:39 < bridge_> <yakupie> or download opengl
10:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That is using software renderer
10:39 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea i did not check the numbers but sure there is a high chance that based on the current value a btc has its overpriced given on how much it is used
10:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I hope u trust my link more than whatever u found in the internet
10:39 < ChillerDragon> jopsti is known scammer
10:39 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro u say you cant download it but you send me link
10:40 < ChillerDragon> i clicked his link once and now my search engine is stuck at ecosia
10:40 < ChillerDragon> i can not change it
10:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was talking about the value of gold, not bitcoin, Chillerragon
10:40 < ChillerDragon> a
10:40 < ChillerDragon> but btc too maybe
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I downloaded it
10:40 < ChillerDragon> heirich predicting da gold bubble?
10:40 < bridge_> <yakupie> can i download opengl?
10:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller D. Ragon
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You can download a OpenGL driver
10:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: do not make unfounded accusations btw
10:41 < bridge_> <yakupie> so why you tell me buy a new pc wtf
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Your GPU seems to not have one. So I gave u the fastest cpu OpenGL driver

10:41 < ChillerDragon> :justatest:
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I told you multiple things wtf
10:41 < ChillerDragon> sori heinrich
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Stop troll
10:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ^

10:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> See here
10:42 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i dwnload  it
10:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I explained everything but you stopped when u had to download 7zip
10:43 < ChillerDragon> doesnt windows do zipping out of the box these days?
10:43 < bridge_> <yakupie> i only need opengl not a zip

10:43 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro i have stil 7zip
10:44 < bridge_> <yakupie> i can extract files
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well no use to further explain it. Do what I say or don't do it.. I told you it will give u OpenGL
10:44 < bridge_> <yakupie> im still think abt its scam but i dont have lose anything nvm
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In fact it even gives u Vulkan
10:44 < bridge_> <yakupie> who is vulkan
10:45 < ChillerDragon> xd
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah u have no money, so nothing to steal from
10:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan is OpenGL big brother
10:45 < ChillerDragon> @yakupie what do you think is a scam?
10:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @jupeyy_keks has the developer role, he's not a random
10:46 < bridge_> <yakupie> bro my chrome crushed wtf
10:46 < ChillerDragon> cloud
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes I'm no random hacker
10:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'm the hacker
10:46 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye you re porfiessinelsiwos

11:16 < bridge_> <yakupie> its not working
11:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You are lucky they still have Win7 support btw. They wanted to remove it for more performance

12:16 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks um, are you sure he really doesn't have any opengl at all, like even 1.1? What is he even on? An IBM mainframe?
12:17 < bridge_> <yakupie> what
12:17 < bridge_> <yakupie> no im on a toast maker
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> He has OpenGL 1.1 over Microsoft's software renderer
12:17 < bridge_> <yakupie> i dont understand this
12:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, I can see a toaster not having gl
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In x86 u see .dll files right?

12:19 < bridge_> <yakupie> i use opengl 1.10
12:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think it's a PC with GPU integrated into the motherboard
12:19 < bridge_> <yakupie> its don
12:19 < bridge_> <yakupie> e
12:19 < bridge_> <learath2> He should be glad he gets invited to parties to begin with
12:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And apparently they often don't have compatible drivers
12:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nice, now start ddnet press f1 and show purple text

12:38 < bridge_> <yakupie> i think i can  run like this
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> My internet is slow tho. Takes 20 minutes
12:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> it simply puts everything where its supposed to be
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Will probably also not work then. But go ahead
12:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> try to run ddnet as admin? 😛

13:03 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i make low grapis all
13:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lower resolution in: settings -> graphics
13:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Inside client
13:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I get around 90 fps on this laptop
13:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>

13:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It should be higher
13:07 < bridge_> <yakupie> idk how to make lower
13:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Choose smaller resolution from the list xd
13:07 < bridge_> <yakupie> how can i change color of blocks or something
13:07 < bridge_> <yakupie> its can be lower
13:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno

13:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Mom I’m on TV https://youtu.be/JrUw8I6izJY
13:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Click you will not regret
13:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> That’s a 180k YouTuber doing free ddnet ads
13:36 < bridge_> <screeeny> i regret
13:44 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:07 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ sos how to make skins not black n white #5660
14:07 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5660
14:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Render order
14:18 < ChillerDragon> ah i think im onto something
14:19 < ChillerDragon> the sprite i render seems to be all black 
14:19 < ChillerDragon> i assume setting colors on a black sprite has no effect?
14:19 < ChillerDragon> ah no i get it in all white at the end ou wat
14:21 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1691065285.png
14:21 < ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
14:28 < bridge_> <devinci24> It... does? That's one of the reasons the value is so stable
14:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Most gold only exists on paper anyway
14:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U rarely buy gold and put it in your house
14:32 < bridge_> <Voxel> that looks cool
14:35 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ same for euro and dollar :p
14:35 < ChillerDragon> im about to rage quit this fakin skin rendering drives me nuts
14:37 < bridge_> <Voxel> are there any good svg editors like inkscape for android
14:37 < bridge_> <Voxel> i tried boxy svg but it was mega jank
14:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'm surprised there is no inkscape for Android tbh
14:47 < bridge_> <Voxel> wish there was
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 😬
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c++
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 😬
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 😬
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Wow u can say CPP without moving ur teeth
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And lips xd
14:52 < bridge_> <Voxel> cant wait to go back to my windows device
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> #📬submit-skins it's a bit annoying that the same skin can be applied twice
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The latest was already posted few weeks ago
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe we should do a rule to prevent that
14:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hash check but probs easy to dodge
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe some image diff distance algo
14:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The second last skin now xdd
14:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> im gonna x it anyways LOL
14:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> until they make it more tee like and make the likes twice as much as the dislikes then i cant add it in
15:04 < bridge_> <learath2> How do you even make a plosive without moving your lips?
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ☝️🤓
15:06 < ChillerDragon> jopsti if you ever have any gfx related questions feel free to ask me

15:06 < ChillerDragon> im now certified gpu developer
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok thanks
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I guess with some training u could abuse ur tongue. Somehow ventriloquist do it I guess
15:46 < ChillerDragon> omg i take it back i did ``git reset --hard`` and cant get my colors back omagawd hate my life
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Just blame this weird Naruto among us skin you use for testing as seen in your screenshot

16:18 < bridge_> <Iza> Hostile
16:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no. the intrinsic value of gold is not what it's worth today. today it's basically just physical bitcoin 😉
16:21 < bridge_> <learath2> What is the intrinsic value of gold even? Steel might have more intrinsic value due to it's vast use
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> doesnt smth like plutonium has more value rn
16:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's a good conductor
16:21 < bridge_> <Iza> Then cement would have the most intrinsic value
16:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion-resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use).
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess so
16:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (wikipedia)
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Browsers are bloated anyway. Time for cleanup xd
16:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lk-99 is good conductor (potentially) 😬😬
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> superconductor
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or high temp superconductor
16:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki when news
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> latest news i seen is 13h ago
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i already sent it
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The channel to stay up to date with anything
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> #developer
16:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00698
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So much oxygen in it xd
16:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://beijingtimes.com/china/2023/08/01/breakthrough-in-superconductivity-huazhong-university-scientists-report-first-successful-replication-of-lk-99/
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki in 27 minutes Baldurs gate 3 releases xd
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> News from me
16:41 < ChillerDragon> ``    cmd=$(sed -n "/$label:/{:a;n;p;ba};" $0 | grep -v ':$')``
16:41 < ChillerDragon> ``    eval "$cmd"``
16:44 < ChillerDragon> thats cruel
17:07 < bridge_> <__admin> does ddnet store the zoom value as an int or as a float
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> There was some drama and that's why it's not stored as float I think xd
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> #5894
17:09 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5894
17:13 < bridge_> <__admin> bruh thx
17:19 < bridge_> <devinci24> You can use gold whereas you can't use bitcoin.
17:19 < bridge_> <devinci24> And there's not only jewelry, it has many useful properties (albeit very expensive) for industrial purposes.
17:19 < bridge_> <devinci24> You can't really compare gold and bitcoin. Bitcoin could lose/gain A LOT of value literally from speculation alone. You need a bit more than that for gold. As i see it it's more of a "safe way" to store money
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know but im at work
17:24 < bridge_> <totar> @ryozuki whats your chance that the super conductor is real?

17:35 < bridge_> <reitw> Harold, best meme
17:55 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this
18:30 < mem> hi!!
18:47 < bridge_> <murpi> hellou!
18:47 < bridge_> <murpi> whattafak
18:57 < bridge_> <Iza> ChillerDragon: i can confirm your users api works 👍
18:59 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Pog leaking user data to ddnet staff. Don’t tell sp someone he will never let me in someone clan .\_.
18:59 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@wvvv)
19:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> somepeople\*
19:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I rather use mold than gold
19:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@devinci24)
19:10 < bridge_> <totar> whats the reason for this PR? does QUIC improve something?https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6961
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think cloudflare can protect quic
19:11 < bridge_> <totar> oh
19:11 < bridge_> <totar> thats nice
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its more resistant to spoofing too iirc
19:11 < bridge_> <totar> is that the main reason?
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its cool
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk ash him
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i forgot
19:12 < bridge_> <totar> @heinrich5991
19:19 < bridge_> <sergeyshukhyan> @essigautomat hey progress have?
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> hey.. its me again.. the guy who cant code at all but tries anyways:
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i am using void IDbConnection::Accounts(char *aBuf, unsigned int BufferSize, bool Backup)
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> to create a table for "Accounts", since its not defined.. how.. do i define it >:_:<
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
19:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thanks in advance

19:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i remember doing it before with ease, im just having a blackout for hours now
19:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thanks in advance
20:19 < ChillerDragon> @blaiszephyr feel free to yoink it from ddnet++ https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/c1f1e12584c07689c85ba80ada2b69f6936d09ee/src/game/server/ddpp/accounts.cpp#L873-L1006
20:20 < ChillerDragon> I just created this CreateTableThread thingy and called it in GameContext::OnInit()
20:20 < ChillerDragon> or use ddnet++ as code base if you want ddnet with accounts 
20:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thanks a lot chilli, lieb dich
20:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thanks a lot chiller, lieb dich
20:22 < ChillerDragon> UwU
