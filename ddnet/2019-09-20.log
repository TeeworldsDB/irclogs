00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Ouh thats nice
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @triki you can sellect multiple layers with the editor
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hold shift and select all layers you want to select. Or select a whole group at once.
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> nubo, someone replied him ðŸ˜‚
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @archimede67 u
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Better reply on discord for people who almodt dont use github:pepeH:
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but he opened the issue on github :greenthing:
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> True
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But i don't have dc
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But i don't have github
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> create account then ðŸ˜„
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol is that a ddnet Feature @n000b ? And since when? Thatâ€™s epic
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon since months
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sick
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well tbh i probably didnt open the editor since months xd
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but still i remember copying maps and it took me ages
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This still takes a while, remembering to re-select the correct layers in the new map
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just a bit less work
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it should be way easier to lower BlmapChill a bit ðŸ™‚
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what fir
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for*
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @ChillerDragon since always
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shifting big maps is always a thing because they got big and then you reach the 0,0 limit
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no way @archimede67 ? are you sure you know your numbers? xd
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea rip on maps with multiple groups tho
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, why?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just do the same for 3 times
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was not able to select multiple groups
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Need to repeat the copy process some times
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or, move everything in one group and later split it again
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 200IQ
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @ChillerDragon ja
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> different para groups
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon reep
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Its here since ages
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my ddnet client doesnt even have kog tab and it works xd
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bojidar made it some months ago
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ehreman bojidar
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Which version
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> For me its pretty old xd
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we even have brush presets ðŸ˜›
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> *n000b - 2019-09-20 08:38 +03:00*
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> ```
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> Hold shift and select all layers you want to select. Or select a whole group at once.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> ```
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> i mean groub.not layers
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @n000b
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hold shift and click on the group
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> same effet
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> same effect
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> I can't schoose 2 or more group
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Don't get your hopes up for something that works. This is just what I made of the code I and and to explain the idea behind TMLP https://youtu.be/sJ6R6zFMhE4

18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you okay with #1915 getting merged?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon it already since a year at least i guess
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay this brush bug with speedups is just sad
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @bob_fasul here?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> why?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm trying to dig into some editor code
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> ask away
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought it'd be best to ask you as you last touched it
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The branch at editor.cpp:2599 looks unnecessary to me
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> why?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The cast with the branch above causes speedup layers to be handled with standard tiles code
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is destroying the speedup values
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> ouch
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> well, if line 2605 is made the same as 2609?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that'd be more correct, but doesn't fix the issue I'm trying to debug sadly :/
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the brush is getting destroyed before it ever makes it to brushdraw ðŸ˜¦
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> so, removing the branch won't fix the issue either
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> however the ui has no trouble displaying the brush correctly so it cant possibly be actually destroyed...
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, that branch is an issue
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the other one is layer_tiles.cpp:1381
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @bob_fasul ^^ any idea why this one is as is?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The editor setting doesn't match the brush so it destroys the data and puts editor settings in
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only greyfox was here to ask
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao any idea why this is the behaviour?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> don't think that makes sense
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does "if the brush has settings, use them, if not use the editor settings" make sense?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea that's how u add values to them in the first place?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant have an empty speedup tile
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @Learath2 I guess, it is so that you can select a group of tiles, change editor settings, then place all of them reoriented
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> it is pretty useful when editing large swaths of speedup or teleport tiles
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that's a rare case imo
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe only apply the editor settings if you have an empty speedup tile at hand?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @jao for speedups, it is useful when testing out a large area -- allows you to instantly change all the speedups instead of changing them one by one
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd break the edge case @bob_fasul mentions, so maybe key that you can hold down to override all?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @bob_fasul u can use fill selection for that too
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> for teleports, it allows changing a bunch of TOTELE tiles,while preserving their shape
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i cant think of many cases where u would a large area of speedups that isnt strange
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe a button to apply editor settings to the brush at hand?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> well, maybe changing the editor setting should change the brush
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> but not the brush automatically changing itself
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> but not the brush automagically changing itself
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i cant think of many cases where u would a large area of speedups that isnt straight
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u can do this all with fill selection
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its probably faster too
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> true
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> my question would be why does the condition break only in certain cases
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> (could it be related to snapping or some similar nonsense?)
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i cant think of many cases where u would change a large area of speedups that isnt straight
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very interesting
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The brushgrab sets the editor settings to the bottom rightmost tile and the layers settings to that aswell
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> exactly
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> so the condition should never be true
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> yet it manages to mess up mid-way through pasting the brush
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> pointer arithmetic gone loose?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> l->speedupangle seems messed up
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh figured it out
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is a mess
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> layer_tiles.cpp:274 shoves a short into an unsigned char
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> and it manages to bug out because of that?
21:05 <+Ryozuki> hello ddnet discord
