14:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d4f5b6a Dennis Felsing: Remove redundant code
14:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Learath2
14:53 <+Learath2> yay
14:53 <@heinrich5991> I'll add autorestart to the bridge
15:36 <+Learath2> !decide symfony or lumen
15:36 <@Nimda> Learath2: symfony
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Lumen? Why Lumen
15:38 <+Learath2> Savander: Laravel is just too much :/
15:39 <+Learath2> it does so many things it confuses me
15:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> use symfony 4 I guess
15:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I heard, that they made it much simpler and lighter
15:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and choosing between Laravel and symfony looks funny
15:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> since, these communities fight with each other
15:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
15:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> pretty hard
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> If I had the time I'd write it all meself tbh
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think You should use packages..
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and just make your own "framework"
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> with stuff you need to have
15:46 <+Learath2> Symfony seems light enough for me to give it a try
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's worthless to make your own package, since symfony devs and community take enough effort to make it as much secure and fast as they can
16:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> sry wrong channel
16:51 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> @Learath2  any good ideas for my last day tomorrow?

16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> @Learath2 yeah xd
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> @Learath2  Madrid is not bad but I am normally go to so sports, like cycling walking canoeing kayaking climbing. Enjoying nature instead of enjoying culture.
16:54 <+Learath2> well I ususally go for the food so I spent a lot of time tracking down food :P
16:56 <+Learath2> spent 2 hours at mercado san miguel, lots of cava, lots of seafood, 10/10 oysters
16:57 <+Learath2> there is a segway place right next door, got a segway tour of the city, I usually get bored in tours but the segway made it quick and painless to figure out places I wanted to go
16:57 <+Ryozuki> how much time you are/was there?
16:57 <+Learath2> 4-5 days
16:57 <+Ryozuki> was it sunny?
16:57 <+Learath2> yes
