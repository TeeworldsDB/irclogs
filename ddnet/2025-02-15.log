01:21 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon: Voldemort client dev played on your name and got banned lol
01:21 < bridge> <teero777> We do automated name bans
01:23 < bridge> <teero777> You're unbanned now. If you make an account only you can play on your name
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> sry for the inconvenience we'll change some stuff in the future
01:31 < bridge> <kdaniel> That is a good Point i will Change that as soon as possible
01:32 < bridge> <kdaniel> Which error message?
01:37 < bridge> <teero777> The ban message xd
02:01 < bridge> <kdaniel> Oh yea we could be more specific...
02:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> less\*
02:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you ban for cheat then don’t name the client brand
02:01 < bridge> <kdaniel> But thanks for your feedback @chillerdragon this will help us to improve 🙂
02:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea the automated name bans sound dangerous
02:04 < bridge> <kdaniel> It's like dual linked... Every IP is connected to nickname and every nickname to IP and the second link is kinda dangerous as i see the last time that alot of people get banned for using the name '.'
02:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo ip and name should have to match both
02:23 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> agreed
05:51 < bridge> <totar> so they should be able to change their name and log back in? :lol:
08:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes better that than allowing every player to name ban whoever they want
08:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean ideally cheaters wouldn’t be banned at all.
08:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If there are no bans then you do not have to worry about ban bypasses. Most of the ban bypass protections affect legit users negatively.
08:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There should be automated anti cheat which kicks and does not ban. That does not exclude players from the server permanently that try cheats but force them to switch to a legit client.
08:05 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> agreed
08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also where is the downloaded maps stored on linux
08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait nvm i dont need to know acsualy i read my code wong
08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> (for context im going to fuzz the map parser
08:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> (for context im going to fuzz the map parser)
08:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @davidlovesmath: do you play the game?
08:09 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yes
08:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> some
08:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> why?
08:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just curious
08:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> fair.
08:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also how are you talking though a bot lol. oh wait probs slack or whatever the outer comunicatson methed was
08:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Doing fuzz and not knowing the map downloads sounds like some casual who never played the game and does not intend to play the game. But instead is a security researcher who fuzzes all open source projects. I want to know if someone doesn’t care about the game and doesn’t intent to stay around.
08:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am on matrix right now and sometimes irc
08:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fuzzing the map parser has been done already btw in case you didn’t know
08:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not that it hurts to do it again it’s nice that you do it
08:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Might be interesting for you if you don’t know it already https://mmmds.pl/fuzzing-map-parser-part-1-teeworlds/
08:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Now that I think about it that blog might fit into the ddnet wiki blog collection
08:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea i saw that from the docs about the code on the website
08:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> im also planning on fuzzing the server connects but in a difrent way from them
08:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> but yea i play the game some
08:16 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> though im quite bad at it lol
08:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Make sure to sell me some 0days before you publish the results. I need to install permanent anti cheat software on the machines of my fng player base
08:16 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> lol
08:17 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> its my first time fuzzing funny enough
08:17 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> so dont exspect much
08:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you are real gangster you get fuzzing integrated into the official GitHub CI
08:18 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> nah i dont feel like lerning how GitHub CI works
08:18 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> mabey someday though
08:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But tbh not sure if I actually want slower CI runtimes. Maybe some external project with scheduled CIs for ddnet would be nicer
08:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> what does CI stand for here anyways
08:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> never used it
08:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Chiller Intelligence
08:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Apple stole my slogan
08:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> jk continuous integration
08:20 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> makes sence
08:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> it does some checks when pushing right?
08:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And CD is ChillerDragon
08:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
08:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The syntax is easy to learn
08:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s yaml engineering
08:22 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> and yea im gonna copy a lot of https://mmmds.pl/fuzzing-map-parser-part-1-teeworlds/ 's code lol. at least for the map fuzzing
08:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You just put a Linux command into a text file and it runs. If it exits non zero pipeline fails
08:22 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> will likely make my own for the network fuzzing though as i have a difrent idea on how to do it
08:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay i collected enough ideas for my antibot now i am finally starting the repo. Any suggestions for a badass project code name?
08:28 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> hmm hacker-catcher
08:28 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> or hacker-catchers
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sry but thats not badass enough
08:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think its time to use a LLM
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> Here are some badass name ideas for an anti-cheat for DDNet:
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> 
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     Teeguard – A mix of Tee (from Teeworlds) and Guard, simple and effective.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     IronTee – Like Ironclad protection for your game.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     TeeShield – A strong, straightforward name that conveys protection.
08:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats the only thing they can do :D generate text
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     SentinelTee – Inspired by vigilant guardians.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     GhostTrap – A reference to catching invisible cheaters.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     AegisTee – Aegis means divine shield, combined with Tee.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     TeeStrike – Because cheaters deserve a swift strike.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     PurgeTee – Cleansing the game of cheaters.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     OverwatchTee – Keeping a watchful eye on players.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath>     ShadowSentinel – A silent yet unstoppable force against cheaters.
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> 
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> Let me know if you want something more unique or themed differently! 🚀
08:29 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i already did lol
08:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks

10:49 < bridge> <vahemaaa> how can i change someone's skin by server? help me on gamecontext.cpp
10:49 < bridge> <vahemaaa> i added player_name and player_clan, which changes player info by admin or server
10:49 < bridge> <vahemaaa> but stuck at player_skin
10:52 < bridge> <vahemaaa> ```cpp
10:52 < bridge> <vahemaaa> bool CServer::SetClientSkinImpl(int ClientId, const char *pSkinRequest, bool Set)

10:53 < bridge> <vahemaaa> }
10:53 < bridge> <vahemaaa> ``` 
10:53 < bridge> <vahemaaa> -# i connected this codeblock to gamecontext.cpp and call it, but when i enter `player_skin` command, nothing happens

11:07 < bridge> <robyt3> They also wrote a blog post on fuzzing the Teeworlds network: https://logicaltrust.net/blog/2020/07/socketfuzzer.html
11:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Fuzzing the map format isn't really worth it unless for learning, you'd should easily find crashes everywhere because the format is mostly unchecked at the moment

11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn when russians say "soft" they mean cheat right? Is it short for software? I have seen sentences such as "ddnet is not software" which really confused me
11:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Imagine using parser generators
11:55 < bridge> <zhn> chillerdragon: yeah, they often refer to cheats and bots as soft, like a short of software
11:57 < bridge> <zhn> @animepdf worths a try for you? :justatest:
12:22 < bridge> <animepdf> https://tenor.com/view/silly-cat-silly-car-car-stare-10-thousand-yard-stare-10-thousand-yard-gif-14200271775968563996
12:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How is software not ambiguous? How do you call non cheat software then?
12:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> "cleanup" is crazy :L(
12:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> "cleanup" is crazy :(
12:56 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @animepdf 🫃
13:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> smartest russian player
13:03 < bridge> <zhn> we don't call software "software" in regular life
13:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn weird stuff ngl. how do you call software then? program?
13:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am so fucking unhappy with test output
13:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its full of spam i spend half day scrolling to the failed tests and half of my debug logs just get swallowed wtf
13:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> GTEST is the most useless shit writing a better test framework can be done in 10 lines
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok the log swallow i take back that was me editing the wrong file but i still hate GTEST
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i should probably blacklist client/prediction from my file finder i keep editing client code when i search for server file names
14:06 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yap
14:18 < bridge> <Solly> `1 warning and 20 errors generated` ah i thought sdl3 and sdl2 were similar enough xd
14:18 < bridge> <Solly> seeing as its 1 to 1 enough to make a compat library
14:19 < bridge> <Solly> that might actually be a good way to do conversion
14:20 < bridge> <Solly> wacky pr
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller completely drunk again
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> gah sdl3 has missing docs
14:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> did chillerdragon click on one of those scam links and they stole his github account instead of steam 😬
14:30 < bridge> <kdaniel> @chillerdragon isnt there antibot for fng by n** already?
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kdaniel i do not have permission from onbgy to use it so i have to reinvent the wheel yay time spent wisely
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon>  @Solly which docs missing? I found sdl3 docs pretty good last time i tried and that was before official release xd
14:34 < bridge> <Solly> to do with joysticks
14:34 < bridge> <Solly> most of the changes are simple renames
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ew sticks
14:35 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but it doesnt compile...
14:35 < bridge> <Solly> if i dont fix it
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``git log -S`` is your best friend
14:35 < bridge> <Solly> i want sdl3 so i can copy files to clipboard
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who needs docs of changes when u can do this
14:35 < bridge> <kdaniel> im working on a teehistorian antibot for gores currently in rust based on tee-hee by @zwelf2  what is based in tw-game by @patiga
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL;cd SDL;git log -S$FuncNameYouMissFromSDL2``
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> y
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> ah
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> very cool
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so not real time but can be applied to teehistorian files @kdaniel ?
14:38 < bridge> <kdaniel> yep. i think using antibot.cpp could be also interesting but with that you can improve the detection and rerun it on all runs again.
14:38 < bridge> <patiga> twgame is from Zwelf! ^^
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea ddrace can really be done after the fact
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> yet again i am cucked by window being hidden from everywhere
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its more about removing ranks
14:39 < bridge> <kdaniel> did i messed up and switched the repos?
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in pvp modes you want real time otherwise enemys suffer
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yes interesting approach maybe i should start recording teehistorian too never did that
14:39 < bridge> <kdaniel> you only host block servers, correct?
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you can have automated testes for antibot without having to test it in production
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kdaniel incorrect
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> zillyhuhn incorporated conglomerate hosts an array of different gamemodes since decades
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is what is running on my vps right now
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1739626873.png
14:41 < bridge> <kdaniel> i dont do auto bans... the final approach is to write demos out of "sussy" gameplay and anonymize it to show it to legit players and trusted ones.. and they can get the demo or just a file with extra info and the demo itself to watch and say if they thing it a bot or not (kinda like in cs2/csgo the overwatch)
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea sounds fun @kdaniel 
14:42 < bridge> <kdaniel> isnt the antibot based on teehistorian interesting for ddrace server hosted by yourself?
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have no cheaters in ddrace at least none i care about
14:43 < bridge> <kdaniel> thankfully
14:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't even need to deal with demo files necessarily, could have a server just replaying the events
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i think it would be cool for fng too just to have something you can throw antibot against  
14:43 < bridge> <kdaniel> you can host and provide like a website where they can do the overwatch and can vote... but this idea only work with active playerbase who support it
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i havent even started to write antibot not sure if i will ever do haha but i will start with live stuff and maybe one day ill look into teehistorian
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my fng playerbase is 99% botters
14:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm just saying that manually dealing with demo files is more effort than connecting to special overwatch server
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> i need sdl_window m_pWindow from backend_sdl everywhere, should i 
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> 1. weezel it thru some init like other places do
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> 2. just expose it in IGraphics
14:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though it's obviously a lot fancier on the server end
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> i need sdl_window m_pWindow from backend_sdl everywhere, should i 
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> 1. weezel it thru some init like other places do
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> 2. just expose it in IGraphics
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> (its not like theres gonna be another backend any time soon)
14:45 < bridge> <murpi> CS's Overwatch stopped working after this "area" was also botted :)
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kdaniel i would never trust players with saying who is bot or not
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> people throw out cheating accusations way too much
14:45 < bridge> <kdaniel> since teeworlds dont support dynamic tiles you cant trap like players for 1 tick to a freezebox to check they behauvior.. like every normal person shouldnt see big diff and just press "a" for example but every bot would trigger all there things to prevent to go into the freeze xD
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kdaniel interesting
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> i thought u could do something with the map in real time
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> like how infclass does the seelction wheel
14:46 < bridge> <kdaniel> like place freeze block under someone and if they insta jump and they do it multiple times you can say for sure they use avoid freez
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> also youll just get urself into a war if your detection methods are not stealthy
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki ```rust
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let program = Program {
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> infclass selection wheel uses client exploit based on map file format and live patches the client to support custom protocol

14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         functions: vec![Function {

14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>                     place: Place::Register(0),
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>                 }],
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>                 terminator: Terminator::Return(Some(Operand::Place(Place::Register(0)))),
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>             }],
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>             params: vec![],
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>             ret_ty: Ty::I8,
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         }],
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     };
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I can finally generate assembly for dis
14:47 < bridge> <kdaniel> yep
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> noice
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> you have to do something heuristic probably
14:47 < bridge> <kdaniel> but since i dont implement it in realtime i dont do it...
14:47 < bridge> <kdaniel> hahahahha i waited and think about this like 1min and just say ahh dont care... you can improve and changed the logic all the time
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> if you want to stop the spread of hacked clients maybe ban the voldermort client message /:
14:48 < bridge> <kdaniel> its always a war between antibot and cheaters
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i censored it on my servers
14:48 < bridge> <kdaniel> yea i will now hide my thoughs in silence
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> new trend now is to kick players and the vote reason is a bot ad 
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> fair, but if you are doing things where you are testing clients, youll start impacting normal players and not stop anyone for very long (a direction detection would be instantly fixed)
14:48 < bridge> <kdaniel> even my ddos protection approach was public telled by me all the time.. nobody was interessted so i done it myself and it kinda work
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> never works tho
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the best protection against ddos is empty servers
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> 5h into a playthrough, *gets ddosed*
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> damage is done
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> \;
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> \\;
14:49 < bridge> <kdaniel> since you dont impact them since its based on some ticks and you teleport them back to the old state its okay... you can even trigger if they on plat or whatever...
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> many servers with equal players works yeah, but rarely do multiple of the same map appear
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> except linear ):
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> itll flash peoples screens which is slightly annoying, although if you have some less good detection beforehand
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> will be lessso
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> try it and see how many complaints you get
14:51 < bridge> <kdaniel> yea the ban messages will be changes today... but the kick instead of the ban will done in the next days
14:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you read https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-migration.md ?
14:52 < bridge> <kdaniel> if you get flashed only if you sus and only sometimes its okay. even if you standing on plat or whatever
14:52 < bridge> <kdaniel> okay time to play some geogeussr
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> now i have, but not very useful
14:52 < bridge> <kdaniel> if something is interesting with antibot i would appreciate a ping
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> theres lots of functions which require the window object but previously didnt
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> and uhh
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> no one has the window object
14:53 < bridge> <Solly> modularity and all that, but everywhere is either implictly using the window or squirriling it through so i dont see the reason to keep it modular when its just a facade
14:53 < bridge> <Solly> ^ cry about it
14:54 < bridge> <Solly> i mean i could dynamic_cast
14:54 < bridge> <Solly> might be considered witchcraft tho
14:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Which functions?
14:56 < bridge> <Solly> settings mouse mode
14:56 < bridge> <robyt3> You could look at https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl2-compat and see how that uses SDL3
14:56 < bridge> <Solly> i assume it just keeps the most recent window
14:56 < bridge> <Solly> or first
14:56 < bridge> <Solly> whichever was the bheaviour in sdl2
14:57 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that's why I said to look at the code, then you don't have to assume anymore
14:57 < bridge> <Solly> it doesnt make any difference, it has to store the window somewhere
14:57 < bridge> <Solly> and ddnet only uses a single window
14:57 < bridge> <Solly> it doesnt make any difference, it has to store the window somewhere (because it has to call the equivilnat sdl3 func)
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Which function exactly? These don't take a window
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> extern bool SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(bool enabled);
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> extern bool SDL_GetRelativeMouseMode(void);
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
15:00 < bridge> <Solly> they do now?
15:00 < bridge> <Solly> `bool SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode(SDL_Window *window, bool enabled)`
15:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like it previously used the Window returned by `SDL_GetKeyboardFocus()`
15:03 < bridge> <Solly> that still works, but it would be better to use just the window
15:03 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess the graphics backend just has to expose the window (as a `void *`) and then you cast back to `SDL_Window *` to avoid the dependency on SDL in the engine API
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kdaniel nice!
15:04 < bridge> <Solly> i was thinking to dynamic case the graphics backend
15:04 < bridge> <Solly> then error if its not sdl (which it wont be)
15:04 < bridge> <Solly> so if there *is* another backend it wont segfault
15:04 < bridge> <Solly> dynamic cast*
15:05 < bridge> <Solly> (and also doesnt require squiriling sdl_window thru a bunch of inits which is ... messy)
15:05 < bridge> <robyt3> `dynamic_cast` is usually wrong if you don't know what you are doing
15:05 < bridge> <Solly> all backends created will always be of sdl3, if its not then that should be an error
15:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Better not expose the window pointer at all, add a function to the graphics backend to call this SDL function
15:05 < bridge> <Solly> rather than ssuming it is
15:06 < bridge> <Solly> thats fair
15:06 < bridge> <Solly> but there are so many sdl things called
15:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Same as `Graphics()->SetWindowGrab` which is probably similar
15:06 < bridge> <Solly> that it would be ... massive
15:06 < bridge> <Solly> and rather be done in a seperate pr
15:07 < bridge> <Solly> (its kinda wack to just make the things which require window into graphics)
15:07 < bridge> <Solly> (instead of all sdl stuff)
15:07 < bridge> <Solly> (but then id avoid dynamic cast which u dont like)
15:08 < bridge> <Solly> (but there still alot of methods)
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, changing to SDL3 would be a massive change anyway, it's not going to be done in a few hours. we also have a PR already: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9624
15:08 < bridge> <Solly> and id rather be it done in a seperate pr
15:08 < bridge> <Solly> ive got that pulled
15:08 < bridge> <Solly> there are an innumerate amount of errors
15:08 < bridge> <Solly> which im slowly going through
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd rather have all SDL3 migration in one PR though, but separate commits
15:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Ideally all the automatic changes with the renaming scripts from the migration guide would be separate commits
15:09 < bridge> <Solly> how would i add to the pr anyway since i cant write to it
15:09 < bridge> <Solly> make a pr to the source branch?
15:10 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, possible
15:12 < bridge> <Solly> rememeber when ddnet changed Id to ID
15:12 < bridge> <Solly> sdl has done the upposite
15:12 < bridge> <Solly> sdl has done the opposite
15:12 < bridge> <Solly> rememeber when ddnet changed ID to Id

15:38 < bridge> <Assa> I am not
15:38 < bridge> <robyt3> ok, maybe only maintainers can do it, I restarted it
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> merci ❤️
15:42 < bridge> <Solly> it works
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 did you guess the commit here? or is it in the rtp? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9674#issuecomment-2659622079
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg yes its in the file name i see it now aaaaaaaaaaa
16:14 < bridge> <robyt3> The commit hash is in the crash dump filename
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye but not inside the rtp right? 
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got trolled looking into the file
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the trace confuses me
16:14 < bridge> <robyt3> No, the author of Dr.Mingw was against adding a function for this I think
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> troll ngl
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c51ef72e59b4c962bba70936c16d5240e3dc2a79/src/game/server/save.cpp#L19
16:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how is line 19 reached without crashing in 16 17
16:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe 17 already died but UB moment did not let it crash yet?
16:15 < bridge> <robyt3> The lines don't seem to match exactly
16:16 < bridge> <robyt3> It crashes in the `str_copy` call on line 17
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see okay that makes sense
16:19 < bridge> <kebscs> ive fixed few hot reload crashes with <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9160>
16:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs can you consitently reproduce the crashes you fixed? maybe you can reproduce the issue in the version he reported and if it was fixed we can close it
16:33 < bridge> <kebscs> yes it consistently crashed before my pr
16:33 < bridge> <kebscs> dont know what that issue did so idk if its the same
16:34 < bridge> <kebscs> crash 1: join team, join another team, hotreload = crash
16:34 < bridge> <kebscs> crash 2: dummy join team 1, main character join team 2, hotreload = crash
17:10 < bridge> <Solly> @chillerdragon how does team colors nameplate no worky
17:11 < bridge> <Solly> [it works?]
17:11 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1340354869600583803/image.png?ex=67b20e3f&is=67b0bcbf&hm=b0cc4365175a20e9c4b5441ceaf3df4c432f9d9f19ff0b6345315d5756150ab2&
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which client is that?
17:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I linked a chillerbot-ux bug not ddnet
17:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Updating arch did not go so well

17:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Updating neovim plugins didn't go well
18:21 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon was #9021 fixed? i cant reproduce
18:21 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9021
19:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it might have been fixed yes
19:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs yes its fixed!
19:16 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess that hotreload pr, or resetting persistentdata in persistent whisper pr fixed it
19:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> very nice kebs
19:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> arch is unstable they say but i have to admit reading the arch wiki was super smooth but getting a kernel panic on debian is more scary

20:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Why am I suddenly getting several valgrind and ubsan errors regarding uninitialized variables (`ERROR SUMMARY: 4166 errors from 21 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)`) from seemingly unrelated changes? :pepeW: Could changes in the overall memory layout cause this?
20:15 < bridge> <sakurai9310> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/930547618000547973/1018367397935206440/ezgif.com-gif-maker_4.gif
20:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @Discord Mod
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe valgrind and ubsan can detect new things
20:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like the new branches and old branches use the same versions of clang and valgrind though
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Ohh, I added a `CGameClient` constructor. Maybe the default when no constructor is used defaults to zeroing the memory?
21:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Ok, looks like a lot of variables are only initialized due to `CGameClient`'s value initialization because there is no constructor
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: epic fixes
21:28 < bridge> <kebscs> ty 😄

21:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> does this add automap selection*
21:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> no :santatrollet:
21:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> but someday i'll find a way to add it
