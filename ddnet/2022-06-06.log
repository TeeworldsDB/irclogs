01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> can you add color_entities_text?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i want to make this text black
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest: so many reopen
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar the gfx lord send brain on what are possible traps when rendering text? I got this boi here https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/blob/d2f9f6dc2350112cc712d484af60c9835aac833b/src/game/client/components/chillerbot/playerpics.cpp#L210 and seems like the text got really blurry after a while
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> on fresh client launch it looks crisp :)
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rebuild it on rezoom i guess
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno but the normal nameplates are build on normal zoom, did you disable that?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `RenderTools()->MapScreenToWorld(CenterX, CenterY, pGroup->m_ParallaxX, pGroup->m_ParallaxY, pGroup->m_OffsetX, pGroup->m_OffsetY, Graphics()->ScreenAspect(), m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom, Points);`
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> replace `m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom` with a additional parameter and use 1 for the textcontainer creations
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `RenderTools()->MapScreenToWorld(CenterX, CenterY, pGroup->m_ParallaxX, pGroup->m_ParallaxY, pGroup->m_OffsetX, pGroup->m_OffsetY, Graphics()->ScreenAspect(), m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom, Points);`
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> replace `m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom` with an additional parameter and use `1.0f` as zoom for the textcontainer creations
10:31 <+ChillerDragon> yea that sounds smart
10:31 <+ChillerDragon> yet i can not reproduce the blue when generating the text container while being zoomed out
10:32 <+ChillerDragon> it should behave same to nameplates its like additional info
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/videos/users/chiller/blurry_nameplates.mp4
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah apply the patch i told ya
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> reproducing is too random too debug this. I copied random refactors from ddnet and be done with it. Thanks anyways Jupjapjupsartr
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> trollodragon
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i tell u how to reproduce it
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> get the song choice?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u make default zoom vvery far out
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> restart client
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> cuz lyrics is blurry
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> reset zoom manually
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> but i never touched default zoom how did i get it 
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> zoom out
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> resize window
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> zoom in
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also works now that u have resize listener
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> also is it even possible to set default zoom far out?
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> min 0
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that is far i guess
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> which is like normal zoom
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok how about u just do what i said xd
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> never
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> zoom out
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> resize window
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> zoom in
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> how to even resize
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its good tutorial
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> change resolution
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best is u work with a debug config while debugging
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah nvm
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u reset all configs everytime anyway
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i remember
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> bitte helfen sie mir
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654506408.png
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> resize is always bad idea
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is that the broken SDL2?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or does ur WM just suck
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> gnome masterrace
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> btw the text is still not blurry
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> i think i patched it
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> did u add another commit
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> than the one u tagged me in?
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> by using RenderTools()->MapScreenToWorld() insead of homebrew
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> no the 2nd after
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> the "trollordragon" one is prolly fix
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the rendertools one takes zoom extra probs
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> lucky me i bound all my graphic configs to the key "7"
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> so i can unbreak all of this madness
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> most useful bind ngl
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but be careful u also use MapscreenToGroup for some flag rendering or smth like that
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not sure what it actually does
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but that might require the zoom parameter
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> watafak
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> flag?
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> ah you mean the countryflags :D
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> const CPlayerPic *pFlag = GetByName(pName);
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> ye
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> i should test that ur right
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> aw fak that broke indeed
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> oamagwd
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just add
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> m_pClient->m_Camera.m_Zoom
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to the parameters there
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> what is a paramter?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> function call parameter
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> MapscreenToGroup
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> how can u stay so chill?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am chillerdragon
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> oof
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> then im japstur the juppinger
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> ou optional parameter
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> u know diff between arg and para?
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> no googling allowed!
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> an argument is in a discussion
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a parameter is something psychic
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> WTF
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> stop trol
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> btw it worked
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> thanks babe <3
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> what would i do w out u
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654506929.png
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> look at this perfectly zoozed dragon image
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> reminds me of some rayman image
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gonna search
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> ray wat
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR3W-A4NfHqZ2aXmBHfr03UvZu_U0fOW8FC6g&usqp=CAU
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> is this the nerdy superhero of u gfx guys? the raytracing man!
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> gstatic.com
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's ubisofts super hero xd
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> ._.
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> HOW
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> DA FAK DOES
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> THIS
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> LOOK
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> ANYTHING
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> LIKE
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> OMG
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> not even
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> like wat
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he also has one foot closer to you in a perspective
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> clearly the same
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> wow
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> jesus
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my brain works like that bro
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> i can see your more on the technical side of visuals...
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> completly random connection to other dimensions
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> i break this thing so many times
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should look into the gfx ci that deen mentioned
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> and do some tests with opencv :D
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh interesting thought, the problem is
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd rather trust a linux software renderer than any windows driver xd
11:20 <+ChillerDragon> uhm
11:20 <+ChillerDragon> why u talkin windows now?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean u want gfx correctness?
11:20 <+ChillerDragon> if windows ppl report bugs from my client i tell them to install linux
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or do u just want to have some renderings look the same for ever? xd
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> i just want my client not to break on my system
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> and i use arch BTW
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> nobody else uses these player pics anyways xd
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nobody uses ur client in first place
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😉
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> yea
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice commit message tho
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> but there are actually some users nowerdays due to my heavy chat ads
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> ty
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno how useful a graphical CI is, but maybe a nullbackend that acts like vulkan backend is 😄
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> well in my case it would be useful
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but your bugs werent inside the backend
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> because i can tell you it wont take a year until some random merge w upsream either removes the playerpics totally or breaks zooming
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> and i only figure out when i want to show off the feature to a hot one night stand
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ur chillerdragon puppy?
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> da
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah right u dont even own it, u just have a pic of it
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> da
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> yo jupi do u even play tw?
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i invented tw
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> or wait ur the nameleess tee guy
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> disgusting
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> my client marks nameless tees names as enemys and filteres all chat messages from them
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> only toxic people hiding behind fake names or noobs use this name
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i currently dont even play as nameless tee 😄
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> nice
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> wats ur nick?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://ddnet.tw/players/-94-pDetektiv-32-Keks/
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> flex
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> u know flummi right?
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, u too xd
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the muinch gang
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> leak
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> umm can you guys just tweak the mobile version a bit and then put it to play store
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> pretty sure the shit would go viral
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> tw is too hard as it is and not going viral
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> on mobile its even harder
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> pretty sure it can be tweaked
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> y'all somehow got the crossplay working
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> novice raid gang stares angry at u
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> but @Twig ur lucky our android dev is online right now @Jupstar is the one u want to ping all day
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i only made it build for android
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> official ddnet android developer
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i clearly said i have no interest in adding features for it
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> when new feature
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my mobile phone is some trash 32bit phone from 2015 xd
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> https://tenor.com/view/angai313-spongebob-sad-spongebob-crying-gif-21679826
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> omg tenor
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> @Twig seems like its on u now
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but vulkan works great for android
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can default to that for the 64bit phones hehe
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> linux > android
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> android = linux + trash
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i run arch on my phone btw
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but on a trash phone
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> well its manjaro but still close enough
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> its cheap tho
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> what about controller support on pc?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> before ur phone starts. i can ride with my bicycle form anywhere in my town to my pc and still be faster xd
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> isnt there?
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> maybe only in vanilla
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> but iv seen plenty of issues and prs of joystick staff
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar lol
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> but playing flappy bird is actually fun
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> wait im sure i got footage somewher ei alr posted it here
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ask @Robyt3 
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he did controller support for vanilla.
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> And he might be more motivated for such quality of life stuff than me
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also android also relies on IME(even tho its just a virtual keyboard there). So can aswell cleanup that ^^
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> if your pc is faster why dont you get an emulator
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Twig> idk if that would work
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i tested it on the google emulator indeed
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> google
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i can only run x86 and x64 there
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> arm and arm64 are broken
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> besser arm dran als arm broken
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess what, google made android xd
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> guess what, thats why android sucks
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it sucks bcs somebody felt clever putting java on top of everything
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer duckOS
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> i somewhere heard that sim cards run java
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> :D
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with every android release more and more stuff is backported to the ndk xD
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> didnt make much sense to me
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs nobody likes this shitty java interface
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I'm a bit hesitant to port Joystick and IME from upstream because there already exist some Joystick and IME implementation on ddnet that I'm not sure about how well they work and how much they are used. Especially joystick controls seems to be implemented much differently on ddnet than on upstream, so if anyone is currently using them as they are right now, they wouldn't be able to play like that anymore with the upstream joystick implementa
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> How to play demo recorded by server? I tried to play it from ddnet client but it doesn't work.
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think you need to have the map file
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Robyt3 No joystick users, I think they use remapping tools atm
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> So basically nobody is using `inp_joystick 1` right now?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Robyt3 IME is being widely used on DDNet, but it has doesn't work in fullscreen apparently. Maybe you can check with @TsFreddie @sirius1242 
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have an issue for that: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4397
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Never heard of anyone, I even forgot we have this
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> and likely nobody is using the OUYA console xD
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> IME sucks hard in ddnet
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> don't make me try to compile it for mine
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Robyt3 IME is being widely used on DDNet, but it has doesn't work in fullscreen apparently. Maybe you can check with @TsFreddie @sirius1242 if the TW 0.7 would be fine as it is.
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have an issue for that: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4397
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it opens the keyboard randomly when starting the client or when pressing ESC to open the menu, bcs that calls the SDL start input call
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> But when I record demo from client it works
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> But when I record demo from ddnet client it works
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client demo integrates map file. what error do you get?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> No error
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> Console log
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/983311358567268402/unknown.png
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Guess what, that's wrong
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Google bought android
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's weird, I think no one has tried server demos recently. Can you open a bug on github?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> Yes, I will do this
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> whats so wrong about it?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> google works on it since the beginning. Just bcs they might not invented it themself
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pretty much all tools sdks etc are by google
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, it can't be too bad since if it were chinese people would be complaining :D
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we probably don't interact with the chinese community enough to notice
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i also dont mean use wise, but program implementation wise
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and as deen said it doesnt even work in fullscreen
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so even use wise it sucks hard
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'd hope @TsFreddie would let us know if they were in an outrage
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> omg, these windows dark patterns are soo bad
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt any game really has this, it works fullscreen but it obv can't render over our screen
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I think it works for blizzard games
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it works on vanilla
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I switched my windows to japanese so I can learn some, but it's really hard to figure out how not to install windows 11
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vanilla somehow lets IMEs render on top of actual real fullscreen?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it just renders it ingame
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> itself
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tsfreddie made that iirc
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or robyte or both
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ingame? As in getting candidates from the ime and rendering a box themselves?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or do you just mean the running input. We render the running input too though
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no with suggestions
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or candidates
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll have to check that out. I did dig quite a bit into IME documentations and there wasn't reallt any API for this except for a pretty limited one on windows
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> really*
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well 99% of our players are on windows
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so i guess thats fine
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on every other OS the IME candidates will work on fullscreen
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs not every OS sucks like windows
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Ctrl+V clipboard history also doesn't show in ddnet in fullscreen but it works in upstream for some reason
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, macOS can't render IME on top of fullscreen either. I haven't tried on linux since it's a PITA to get an IME working
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I did the selection support and TsFreddie did the IME implementation using windows API
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, nice, windows replaced my bootloader
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't had a dual boot machine in a longer time I guess
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On a regular update?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I think so?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then macos sucks too
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not entirely sure due to this
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is no excuse for this
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on kde it works
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if KDE can do it, billion dollar companies can too
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use refind and have my efi boot order set to it and windows never managed to replace it yet
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on android it works too btw
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also used refind (for the first time, used efistub before)
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it really the DEs job to handle this? I'd think it'd be the job of the WM. I'm actually not even sure how they handle drawing over exclusive fullscreen
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok then kwin
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not WM, the display server I meant
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So X/Wayland?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh yeah possible
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does windows even split that
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean Windows is their DE, WM, whatever
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but anyway, i dont really see why it should not work
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://ykarroum.com/2022/05/30/true-cost-list/
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh only thing i would criticise is, that he didnt mention the size of the element in the datastructure
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he seems to only use list<int>
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this isnt really real world scenario
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> at least not always
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "The remaining difference can be explained by the size of the list node (32 bytes), a cache line can only hold 2 nodes while it can hold 16 integers."
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok he mentions it but could go into more detail, bcs thats the interesting part 😄
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon:
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 149.202.127.134:8303 has 6 bots registered as players
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that true? it seems to be your server. that would be against the rules
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 what happened to #4691?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4691
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u deleted ur fork
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since when do they close prs then?!
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no fork no pr
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before it saved it and said fokkonaut:unknown as source
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its new to me that they get closed lol
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it possible to reopen this?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> create a new pr
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> button is greyed out
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hovering shows the reason that Jupstar gave
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why do you even delete it so "often" XD
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk i dont care about my fork and if things get messed up i just create a new one
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://xkcd.com/1597/
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The phone number in the txt file is mine
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and mine as well
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel like everyone always just wants me to fast forward to the part I tell them the commands :D
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> forwarding to the part with the commands doesn't have to be a bad thing. but do still teach them to help themselves, preferably by understanding the problem
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, I found a nice xkcd by clicking the random button once: https://xkcd.com/2224/
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> how to register bots as non players tho?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't show them in the server info
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> can't find server info here https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> also why don't dummies don't count as bots?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it your server? have you accidentally logged in with the wrong account?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or do you host some other server with the same problem? @sone
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> no I am just wondering because I also host a server.
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> which allows many ips per player (thus dummies)
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's fine
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: I found a tw yt video without a comment from you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WixRWjyqm1o

18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's the point of `extern "C"` in `base/system.{h,cpp}` ?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `extern "C"` specifies how the functions get called
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but why is it needed?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it compiles fine without it
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently, it's only needed to support the antibot library written by noby that we're using
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i was adding templated `mem_zero` according to my comment in github on POD struct issue, so i removed it 🙂

18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i have 1k fps xd
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does it render all of them?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> doubt since snapobject is limited
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what renderer did u test on btw?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least the non rendered explosion still apply push
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only gl 3.3 & vulkan have particle batching

18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> cant on my laptop
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rip
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not even 3.3?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ill try on the windows machine later
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wait a linux machine without opengl 3.3?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does such thing exists?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not my fault if default is opengl 3 😄
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but if u can still try it out
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just for the sake of knowing
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i have better fps, but it still doesn't render all
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah

19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> @ jupstar since youre into render and vulkan. i was wondering is it possible to "port" to directx/windows
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes is possible, but what would be the need?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan is industry forged
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> no need
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> just curious
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can do anything with ddnet
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its open source xd
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but is it easy?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> depends
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> porting it to dx12 is probs similary "hard" like vulkan
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> why are those different anyway
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u need good understanding of the concepts of the graphical computation model
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs windows wants a closed ecosystem
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and opengl in the past sucked
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> isnt there a "cross plattform" gl
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but since opengl 3.3(4.0) this changed quite a bit
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> OpenGL
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> works on any system
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> no i mean
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> code once, choose any renderer
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u mean a higher abtraction level
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes there are plenty
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so ddnet/tw is lower level? it uses opengl directly, as opposed to using a lib, that is before it using opengl or vulkan or whatever? what is sdl2 doing then after all?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes ddnet uses vulkan and opengl directly
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought tw is an"sdl2" game
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> SDL2 integrates DDNet into the window managers
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so i dont have to care about window creation etc.
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd say sdl2 is relativly easy to replace
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought i had read something about it also. .. do smthn with graphicd
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought i had read something about it also. .. do smthn with graphics
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> aha
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u want to know the reason why vulkan/opengl directly
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont want to learn any gfx lib, bcs:
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1. if i would use higher abstraction anyway, i'd directly chooose some overpowered engine like godot
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2. more dependencies for a "relativly" easy/small backend
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3. slower probably
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought sdl is like a core, because i thought without sdl no tw, i kind of pit the game in this category. sdl, lwjgl... whatelde
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought sdl is like a core, because i thought without sdl no tw, i kind of pit the game in this category. sdl, lwjgl... whatelse
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> SDL2 has a very basic rendering engine, but its not enough for ddnet
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it can draw quads and stuff, but with rather bad performance
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nice, i feel the same, but one triangle or something with opengl and i quit xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> too long way for a nice thing to play with like core opengl game
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> xd aha, on windows with thinkpafbt420 i was on opengl2
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> xd aha, on windows with thinkpadt420 i was on opengl2
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> thats how i came up with the question
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rip
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i also found a guy who ported mesa to windows
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but didnt make it run
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes works quite ok actually
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opengl 3.3 on dx12
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://gist.github.com/Jupeyy/ca2ac80fb9765a9c4370bb9a6b88fb32
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> what?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats a mesa driver written by microsoft
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> is like opengl on top of directx?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opposite
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess thats how u say it
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but not mesa
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opengl on dx12
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah 😄
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and not opengl2 xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> well ok
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it can also do opengl 2 already i think
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> im not on windows now anyway
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> yes
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think only RADV is actually working on windows
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> as "native" driver
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ddnet worled
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it doesnt actually work xd
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> dont know it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/issues/103
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok nvm
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it was removed
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i also dont know if vulkan is the solution
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it was avaiöable on windows ddnet. but i couldnt render alacritty minecraft blenderbcause theybrequirebopengl 3.3
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so...
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> vulkan support?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd say dropping everything else except vulkan would drop a lot of bloat all over the industry
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they can focus on one product
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> instead of 10
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> well
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean i see so many driver bugs
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its insanly annoying
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> competiton
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what is the competition to vulkan?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> xd
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> directx 12 is basically the same, maybe bit higher level
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> metal is higher level and less powerful
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> the other stuff and people not wanna "move on" idk
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just apple's and microsoft try to create an ecosystem
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> dont know metal
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> remember vulkan = AMD + NVIDIA + Intel
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> that sucks
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> + qualcomm
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> valve also relies heavily on it already
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and valve is the biggest player in gaming industry
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u ignore mobile gaming xD
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> adapting to ecosystemb/ filling ecosystem instad of. .. one emerges bybgood stuff thatbpeople wanna use anyway
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i do
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i still dont get it with vulkan. im not intobgaming andbhardware. but i would think like software that dont work with opengl work with vulkan
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but what popular software is using vulkan mainly? (opensource)
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> quake raytracing xd
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> is for me same category as wayland. new but gay, cause new 😅 😅 :troll:
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean dxvk obviously uses vulkan
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and that's used to run any game on linux(from windows)
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> dont know it
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its the best
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u ever run an old dx9 game, use dxvk and have more FPS
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok i only know wine
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah its usually used with wine
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> aha
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> well...
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> since i am buying an nvidia laptop + using proproetary drivers and nvidia is  vulkan, i might just go for all the newbstuff like wayland and whatelse
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> rust go
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> kotlin
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hi guys
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wayland has forced vsync
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> lol for some reason i tried out debian, wanted to install with net install image. didnt have iwlwifi with it, so no wifi, hdd wiped, only phone. and im not at home. oops
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also i already warned u
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i am nice guy, i warn u again
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> first thing to search. can i disable nvidia optimus
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i told you i make it work. i read most people use proprietarybdriver. few use nouveau
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and disable... i dont really understand what should prevent it on linux?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe proprietarybdriver?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not linux related
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its a hardware limitation
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if ur nvidia card is not connected to the laptop monitor everything runs over the intel GPU
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> well idk i dont care if it sucks ill sell itborbsuffer
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so nice delay and nice FPS cap
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but i dont want new thinkpad, no tower, no mac
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> someppl send me things about my issues in GitHub, i want just say i don't remember anything about this issues, just do what ever you want guys, right now i super busy with final exams
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> bbye bye
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe use wayland inside x and gameboutside
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good luck, ez for u
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wayland is epic, gives good stable fps

21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more testing to do
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Much like the original M1 chip, the new M2 uses Apple’s custom Arm silicon, and it’s built on a 5nm process complete with 20 billion transistors — 25 percent more than the original M1. All of these transistors should boost performance, and Apple is promising a 18 percent faster CPU, and 35 percent faster GPU inside the M2 compared to the original M1.

21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> @deen Another bug report, cuz you love those! (don't bother asking for any github reports cuz you know I cannot xd)
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> 
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> In map editor: Shift + holding left click causes a selection as you expect with normally holding left click, but as long as you release the left mouse button, it crashes.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Possibility can be that it tries to do another method involving Shift which cannot be executed duo to left click dragging.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :PepeLaugh:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> no need to say, latest version, nightly, bla bla bla
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Oh, seems like it only happens, whenever you enter the map editor without doing anything else in the first place, it triggers a crash within those conditions
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> First launch: open up editor and only using Shift + left click to interact | Second launch: open up editor, but use normal left clicking first, then Shift + left click

22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nais
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Cellegen | HU why is it that you cannot create a github account? ^^
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> i have a github account, just github won't let me log into it
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> somebody knows, tool used here for convert map to png picture is private or public?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> I want to find some map in https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/maps
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> and by picture it can be more easy
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> one less python2 file yay
