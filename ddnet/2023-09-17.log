00:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I try to keep chillerbot-ux legit and approved on all servers. Features where I am not sure if they would be okay I usually discuss in this channel and or with ddnet admins before release.
00:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
00:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I assume you want a statement to this message https://matrix.to/#/!bt2V3zaafkRdPhuo9k%3Addnet.org/%24bhsu9eX588XppoakqPkC3boa5rh_iFrM8LsPaKdngBY
00:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
00:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The one running on multeasy is not chillerbot-ux but chillerbot-zx. The rules of this channel prohibit me from going into details about what the z stands for. And yes it is bannable and has been banned multiple times from multimap and other servers.
00:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do I need a lawyer?
01:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t feel comfortable speaking in this channel anymore since I got my messages deleted .\_.
01:03 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
01:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it sucks
01:04 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1152741808443502753/IMG_3628.png
01:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Is it possible to fish out if any player is AFK with `m_ppServerlist->m_Info`?
01:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Or just, in general? I'm trying to tweak the friends menu so that it's yellow when a friend is online but is also AFK
01:07 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not
01:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Sad
01:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Well I DO want to do an update to this game, but I don't know which of the 500+ issues i could choose
03:54 < bridge> <Iza> Do #6030
03:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6030
03:54 < bridge> <Iza> I think itâ€™s not that hard to code but very impactful to gameplay
03:58 < bridge> <Iza> I think itâ€™s not that hard to code but a great quality of life improvement
06:52 < bridge> <Ewan> how was this solved upstream? i had a fix that was working for a while but it seems to not cooperate in my new setup
06:52 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1152829521276436500/image.png
08:47 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> Yes, afk state is available through the master. But you would have to add the reading of `Client["afk"]`  as it's currently not used anywhere. You can take a look at <https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json> to see all the available variables.
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> hey that's awesome
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess next time he gets banned using that client, they should ban you instead ðŸ˜‚
10:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> chillerbot-zx is not available to the public. Only itâ€™s legit brother is.
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> closed source
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> shame
10:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait he got banned? Maybe I red the wrong part in the questions channel
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no no
10:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Closed source and closed binary
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he asked me if he gets banned
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but in pm
10:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs he thought asking it is not allowed.. and i think he did good here xd
10:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> with ux i only know of one ban and that was a confused Bombay staff
10:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably using the wrong rust toolchain for MSVC, or you switched between Debug and Release
11:30 < bridge> <nouaa> didn't ban anyone, just asked to change client
11:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> KonfuziusðŸ¤¡
11:55 < bridge> <ultrakeker> My friend had this problem and I just added ntdll into linking libraries in CMakeLists.exe
11:55 < bridge> <Ewan> same but itâ€™s not working anymore
11:56 < bridge> <Ewan> well, ntoskrnl on mingw, but same effect
11:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i think in the case of it being the wrong toolchain itâ€™ll silently fail & the build fails when going to link the libddnet engine shared lib
11:59 < bridge> <robyt3> https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-compiler-error-when-linking-with-windows-dll/98504
11:59 < bridge> <robyt3> This also suggests adding ntdll
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> and it didnâ€™t work
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
12:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i have my rustup toolchain on gnu anyway so idk what the deal is
12:02 < bridge> <robyt3> GNU toolchain + MSVS is not going to work
12:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yeahâ€¦ Im not using vs
12:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i pretty much never use vs or msvc
12:02 < bridge> <Ewan> only when making sure my code works on both
12:02 < bridge> <robyt3> What's the screenshot from, then?
12:02 < bridge> <Ewan> Qt Creator
12:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like MSVC errors to me
12:03 < bridge> <robyt3> So maybe Qt just uses that internally...
12:03 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
12:03 < bridge> <Ewan> Itâ€™s a whole IDE, they have extensive configuration for which tools to use
12:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Which toolchain are you using in Qt creator then?
12:04 < bridge> <Ewan> MinGW
12:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Have you tried building release instead of debug (or the other one)?
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> No. Why would that change anything
12:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Because it did fix exactly this issue the last time someone asked IIRC
12:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Although they go those error messages in MSVC I think
12:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Although they got those error messages in MSVC I think
12:07 < bridge> <Ewan> In MSVC sometimes different DLLs are linked for debug symbols
12:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Iâ€™ve not seen this with any other compiler
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> I donâ€™t think a dll of this nature would have a separate debug version anyway. It being basically user/kernel mode glue and whatnot
12:08 < bridge> <robyt3> It could be a transitive dependency in any other library
12:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Where one of the debug/release versions includes it but not the other
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> I could try it
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> Iâ€™ll let you know but itâ€™s 4 am
12:10 < bridge> <robyt3> :justatest:
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I know
12:15 < bridge> <Ewan> :monkaStop:
13:08 < bridge> <astramast> i have
13:08 < bridge> <astramast> a PROPOSITION !
13:08 < bridge> <astramast> `console_page_up 5` will scroll up 5 pages instead of 1
13:08 < bridge> <astramast> `console_page_down 5` will scroll down 5 pages instead of 1
13:09 < bridge> <astramast> `console_page_up -5` will scroll down 5 pages
13:09 < bridge> <astramast> `console_page_up -5` will scroll down 5 pages (i.e. equals to `console_page_down 5`)
13:09 < bridge> <astramast> `console_page_up 0` will do nothing
13:10 < bridge> <astramast> wadda ya think
13:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Also proposition to change value of rcon movement by a set amount
13:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Example:
13:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> `rcon right 1` - move 1 tile to the right instantly
13:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> `rcon right 4` - move 4 tile to the right instantly
13:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> `rcon [movement key] [amount]` - Move the Tee a certain amount of distances towards the prefered direction. If no value is set, it is set to default (Value: 1) .

15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> capitalism at its glance
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont want to know how hard godot currently explodes in usage count xd
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> it reached all time high in steam
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> most ppl dont use steam
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i mean it was always UE vs unity
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i doubt everyone just switches to UE permanentially ðŸ˜„
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> because ppl dont value open source
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> the good thing about godot
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it can never happen
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> now they woke up
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> fck around find out
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> depending on a company is bad bad
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> embrace godot
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> embrace vulkan
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> embrace rust
15:14 < bridge> <melon> rust!
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> delete directx
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> delete windows
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> delete propietary
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i hate apple more
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/brain-linux-firmware-linux-users-when-proprietary-gif-22937891
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> their OS is the fcking worst shit for developers xD
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> slightly better than windows tho
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> atleast the cli is zsh
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> and not winshit cmd
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's easier to use maybe
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but windows allows most open source tech
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> apple is basically u do it apple way or u done
15:15 < bridge> <melon> apple is made for adult's who handle tech like kids
15:16 < bridge> <melon> change my mind
15:16 < bridge> <melon> (i preordered the iphone 15 btw)
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i use qalculate! btw
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://qalculate.github.io/
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> such peak linux software
15:28 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> ^ @astramast @cellegenrih
15:30 < bridge> <mamad3725> hi guys, i am using vscode as my editor and i do the steps in here for windows build https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet . it does not work (cmake error:   could not find any instance of Visual Studio.)
15:31 < bridge> <mamad3725> so what can i do ?
15:31 < bridge> <melon> cant use visual studio code, you need the visual studio compiler version 2017 iirc
15:32 < bridge> <mamad3725> i don't wanna install visual studio cus it's heavy and i don't really like it
15:32 < bridge> <melon> try using wsl/dual boot
15:32 < bridge> <melon> for DDNet development linux >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> everything else
15:33 < bridge> <mamad3725> i know
15:33 < bridge> <mamad3725> but in the past i compile the ddnet on windows command line with gcc or something i don't really remember
15:34 < bridge> <mamad3725> i see the instruction on readme file on source file or something
15:35 < bridge> <melon> either use MSVS, or use WSL if you wanna stay on windows
15:35 < bridge> <melon> everything else would take you twice as much time as it would just swapping over to linux
15:37 < bridge> <mamad3725> i really love linux but no with the nvidia card. it's such a pain in the butt to install the driver and i have expensive one. so i dont wanna over heat it or something
15:37 < bridge> <mamad3725> stupid nvidia
15:37 < bridge> <mamad3725> i really love linux but no with the nvidia card. it's such a pain in the butt to install the driver and i have expensive one. so i dont wanna overheat it or something
15:38 < bridge> <melon> nvidia has linux driver's?
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ofc
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they are quite good quality even
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> from pure perf perspective
15:38 < bridge> <melon> my questionmark was confusing, i know they have it, and they have worked like a charm for me
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> either install msvc or mingw-64
15:39 < bridge> <mamad3725> ok
15:40 < bridge> <melon> nvidia has linux driver's
15:41 < bridge> <mamad3725> i remember once i had a nvidia graphic card and i was new to linux. it took me a whole day to install the driver and after installation i found out the fan on the graphic card was melted
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i doubt that but ok
15:42 < bridge> <mamad3725> nvidia gforce gt 240
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> uff
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's middle ages
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @deen can u include the color mapping for teams in the #announcements post, then a few ppl are aware
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> else it's annoying to tell everyone
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for next release
16:59 < ChillerDragon> TIL teeworlds servers can send empty packets with only the packet header but with no actual content. Seems like a design decision and not like a bug o.O
