00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> uhm just wanted to say and correct that I loved the idea to see your own crosshair depending on the weapon you're holding in freeze (it's minimalistic and helpful), but seeing others weapons is way too messy
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Ryozuki you talked like I totally hated the idea
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your opinion
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you totally hated the idea of what i was making
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not wrong there
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's extremely important to add statements like "this is true" "I'm not wrong here" to your opinion. it's a fact
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night ðŸ™‚
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i still want crosshair in pause mode back
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> its been deleted some client versions ago. Before u had crosshair when enabled showall.
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Its such a mess now to aim in spec for example tele urself when testing maps but also figuring out which line to fall
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @noby is the biggest troll
04:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How does fast download work in ddnet server? is it only available for ddnet clients? how can i implement it for my 0.7 server? i have been trying a while now, but nothing really worked
08:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https based with fallback to the old ddrace fast dl
08:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> from maps.ddnet.tw
08:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but we just inherited the ddrace fast dl, i never read the source code
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> git gut at noscoping @pinkrat
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> @deen so maps have to be hosted at maps.ddnet.tw to support fast dl? And server could also be a vanilla server huh?
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut rls BlmapChill on ddnet lmao
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> They have to be hosted to heinrich5991
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/DDRace/teeworlds/pull/196/commits/cae8c68d8782dfd31017c12915065a68c72729cc
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just sent chunks before being asked
10:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (you should probably implement it the new way, send a lot of chunks when requested, instead of this weird way of sending them in pumpnetwork)
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually looks like ddnet broke fastdownload long ago
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/b510db9ee9478c89aec7de6c376a7d34b4732ad2
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't this only send mapwindowmany chunks at the start then fall back to sending the chunks slowly?
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also looks like it wouldn't work well at all, when you send the chunks, the client will send requests for +1 of each, the old implementation dropped these requests
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Chunks :O :gras: :gold: :emarald: :dia: :Holzaxt: :iron: :red:
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uf, I see what you did, sort of tricking the client into asking for (mapwindow + 1) chunks at a time
10:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks prettier but I think it's much more convoluted than what we had before
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm? what is it you don't like about the new implementation?
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we always send n chunks ahead
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where n is the map window
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Used to be that we just sent the chunks, now we rely on the client asking for them
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see, now we're relying on one specfic download implementation
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that always sends requests for (n+1) when receiving n
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's a fair assumption, not as easy to read
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž> should we make ddnet minecraft server?
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> Wait for Hytale :poggers:
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> chillerdragon had one
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> dont know if its still running
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> sure lgl.zillyhuhn.com is the official teeworlds minecraft server :D
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> latest vanilla version and ofc no rules or admins as any good game server
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is griefing
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> the cycle of life @heinrich5991
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> spawn also tends to get a bit destroyed but due to the low inactivity the server is still chill https://zillyhuhn.com/img/lgl.png
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is this huge mountain?
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> manual work?
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> lavacast
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> spill sume wadda and then some lava then start over
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, nice idea
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2b2t is the endgame of lawless wastelands
14:59 <@heinrich5991> 2b2t?
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2b2t
15:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shows you that anarchy, truly is the most idiotic way to govern anything
15:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't even work in the smallest of scales, a minecraft server
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> no 2b2t works
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u dont have to worry about hackers getting an unfair advantage
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> 2b2t isnt too small its bigger than teeworlds @Learath2 and it works well
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/735130284483411998/Action_21-07-2020_16-44-40.mp4
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yes, that's how I'd define working well. The entire server is a desolate wasteland for tens of thousands of blocks, anything built that can survive past 3 days is considered a success
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I long yearn for the day that we use anarchy in my country so that people can vandalise my house
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> just walk out far enough
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 well u dont have ur life at stake on a minecraft server "anarchy"
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure real world anarchy would be pretty different
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i imagine it like full of mafias
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe not
16:37 <+Learath2> it'd end up reinventing proper societal rules again
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw did u know catalonia in its 30' is one of the closest examples of anarchy
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Homage to Catalonia written by George Orwell (the same as 1984) explains some of it iirc
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz he went to catalonia to fight in the war
16:38 <+Learath2> As long as there are groups of people that have advantages over others, you end up creating something the sorts of modern government
16:39 <+Learath2> Hm, don't know much about the 30s, should be interesting to read
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its spain/catalonia history
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so probs nobody knows it outside here
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always find it amazing that George Orwell came here
16:41 <+Learath2> it's interesting to read about others history
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I tried the way of heinrich, I found that commit too. But for me the errors error sending data or too weak connection happened
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The discord debugger is out of commission, please try again later
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> irc debugger works 24/7
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 quite nifty gdb extension https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah already have it everywhere
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh nice
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> any other nice stuff you have?
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pwntools is quite useful
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea, I use that for exploit devel, too
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's quite annoying though, destroys your terminal, checks online for updates if not opted out of
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, the downfall of overambitious projects
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> > "Yeah already hav it everywhere"
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> busted didnt u yell at me for having a gdb extension while not doing exploits? :D
17:38 <+Learath2> I disable it when I'm not doing debugging at the assembly level
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was searching through the wikipedia and i found this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve, i searched a bit and if i understand correctly this can be used for tilemaps to know the render order of tiles? i also found this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would you need a space filling curve?
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's good for cache performance
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that gdb extension looked fine for source based debugging as well
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i found it being used in a tilemap implementation of a game engine
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the disassembly and the register view take up a lot of space that's usually not very useful
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fair
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you seen the `heap bins` command?
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks very cool for developing heap exploits
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.msg1173956#msg1173956 this is what I thought of when I first saw the hilbert curve
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw this devlog is an absolute goldmine, the guy is seriously brilliant
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 heap bins does look useful, didn't get to use it yet though.
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh another interesting gdb plugin is "exploitable"
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used it quite a bit when trying to fuzz squirrel
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link?
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does it do it though
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> couldn't find anything specific in the readme
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you get dozens of crashes from afl, it's nice to get an initial filter
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> "exploitable iterates over a list of ordered "rules" (lib/rules.py) to generate a Classification (lib/classifier.py). If the state of the application running in GDB matches a rule, exploitable adds a corresponding "tag" to the Classification."
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It obviously is as good as it's rules
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have an example of what it outputs?
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uuuh, if the vm still works I can get you an example
