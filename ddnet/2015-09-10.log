19:27 < Nimda> Planet Mercury by Aoe just released on Novice at 2015-09-10 19:24
19:28 < Henningstone> !twp Aoe
19:28 < Nimda> Aoe is currently playing likeOldschool on server : DDNet GER2 - Brutal [DDraceNetwork].
22:10 < Learath2> go on a planet mercury server do /top5 says 11335 i think it should be 1122334455 incase a position has multiple people in it
22:12 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: (?)
22:13 < Learath2> when you do top5 and there are teams in the top5 it looks weird
22:13 < Learath2> and if teams finish maps in top5 in a given position 1-5 there will be more then one people 
22:13 < Learath2> and i propose we actually display them all
22:32 <@deen> Learath2: nope, i like it as it is
22:32 <@deen> think of it like this:
22:33 <@deen> when you finish with the same time, you have the same rank
22:33 <@deen> so both are first, everything else would be unfair
22:33 <@deen> but the next one shouldn't be 2nd, they should be 3rd
22:33 <@deen> because there were 2 players who were better
22:33 <@deen> so they're the 3rd best
22:38 < Learath2> well thats true but maybe you should atleast display the fulll teams
22:39 <@deen> sure, try to implement it
22:40 < Learath2> will pr tomorrow
22:40 < Learath2> you still didnt pull in the dll fix btw
22:40 <@deen> yeah, i'm not really motivated to work on DDNet currently
22:40 < Learath2> what happened ?
22:41 < Learath2> real life ?
22:41 <@deen> that and lots of negative feedback about ddnet
22:42 < Learath2> unconstructive ?
23:00 < fstd> well maybe that is becoz ddnet sux!
23:00 < fstd> (j/k)
23:23 < devnull> ddnet ger went down
23:23 < devnull> is*
23:24 <@EastByte> huh?
23:24 <@deen> devnull: only from some locations
23:25 <@EastByte> what happened?
23:25 <@deen> devnull: i can't reach it from the OVH network, all other locations worldwide are fine
23:25 <@deen> but i see no DDoS warning, so probably a network problem
23:25 <@deen> i'll report to our hoster
23:26 <@EastByte> ah now ddos warning
23:27 <@deen> and back
23:28 < devnull> the ts status on ddnet.tw/status is wrong
23:28 <@deen> devnull: how so?
23:29 < devnull> oh wait
23:29 <@EastByte> devnull: you were not in a ddnet channel :P
23:29 < devnull> how often does the statuspage refresh?
23:30 <@deen> every 2 min
23:30 < devnull> okay
23:30 < devnull> so nvm :D
