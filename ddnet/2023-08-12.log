02:13 < bridge_> <getsaamusic> guys, do y'all know where the hook system is on the source code? I'm doing a DDNet fangame and I wanna take the original code as a reference for some things
02:44 < bridge_> <solayer> @chillerdragon
02:44 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon
02:47 < bridge_> <totar> src/game/gamecore.cpp ``CCharacterCore::TickDeferred()``
02:47 < bridge_> <totar> also check src/game/server/entities/character.cpp for other things
02:50 < bridge_> <getsaamusic> tysm
02:51 < bridge_> <totar> also ``CCharacterCore::Tick()`` in gamecore.cpp
03:48 < bridge_> <Voxel> :justatest:
04:16 < bridge_> <totar> ?
05:00 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> cant connect to server. router wont let me port forward on ipv6 so i used sv_register ipv4 and i port forwarded on the right port. firewall is set up to let me and i cant think of anything else that would cause me to not be able to connect
05:01 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> cant connect to server. port forwarded on ipv4 but router wont let me on ipv6, used sv_register ipv4. firewall is set up to let udp on said port.
05:39 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> cant connect to server. port forwarded on ipv4 but router wont let me on ipv6, used 'sv_ipv4only' 'sv_register ipv4'. firewall is set up to let udp on said port.

05:54 < bridge_> <yekrm> your connection is CGNAT?
05:54 < bridge_> <yekrm> ur connection is CGNAT?

06:16 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> it works over vpn though ðŸ˜¦ i just dont wunna have to use one every time just to port forward
06:24 < bridge_> <yekrm> If you have access to enable DMZ you could try 
06:24 < bridge_> <yekrm> With that you will see if you are missing any port configuration
06:29 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> i cant even login to default gateway lmao
06:29 < bridge_> <yekrm> :kek:
06:29 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> and the app doesnt have shit
06:30 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> and when i asked for an IT representative each person said they dont have any which is super hard to believe as a fucking isp
06:31 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> its the newest spectrum router if you wunna look up how bad it is
06:42 < bridge_> <yekrm> This reminds me of my bad experience with an ISP blocking any configuration
06:43 < bridge_> <yekrm> But I connected via ssh and I solved it
06:43 < bridge_> <yekrm> <a:pepefireworks:1064029892104175687>
06:52 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> it wont let me connect with ssh either i wish this was cisco xd
13:25 < bridge_> <coke1465> cool
13:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice idea
13:43 < bridge_> <patiga> I have a blog post coming up which is about embedding pixelart into maps ^^
13:50 < bridge_> <marmare_314> how do you do it?
13:51 < bridge_> <patiga> I'll try to finish and publish the blog post today
13:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> wont this bloat up the filesize
14:23 < bridge_> <patiga> depends on the size of the pixelart, and the amount of colors in the image (with that approach)
14:29 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I think it depends more on the colors than on the size of the image, but it should be fine if both are reasonably small
14:29 < bridge_> <marmare_314> An image with 8000 colors and 1024 x 1024 pixels is about 6 MB

14:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hot plasma for 8 minutes
14:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> After successful recommissioning in autumn 2022, the Greifswald nuclear fusion experiment has surpassed an important target.
14:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > In 2023, an energy turnover of 1 gigajoule was targeted. Now the researchers have even achieved 1.3 gigajoules and a new record for discharge time on Wendelstein 7-X: the hot plasma could be maintained for eight minutes.
14:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > articularly heat-resistant divertor baffle plates are used to dissipate the largest heat flows at Wendelstein 7-X. They are part of the inner wall, which is now cooled by a system of 6.8 kilometres of water pipes since the completion of the device. No other fusion facility in the world currently has such a comprehensively cooled inner wall. The plasma heating consists of three components: the newly installed ion heating, the heating by neutral p
14:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
14:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Within a few years, the plan is to increase the energy turnover at Wendelstein 7-X to 18 gigajoules, with the plasma then being kept stable for half an hour.
19:25 < bridge_> <patiga> in a blog post, would you write "color" or "colour"? ^^
19:26 < bridge_> <learath2> Pick british english or american english, use it consistently?
19:27 < bridge_> <patiga> would you have a preference?
19:28 < bridge_> <learath2> I like the ou version of words
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i like US version
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> z over s
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> customization
19:35 < bridge_> <patiga> I love ties :p
19:36 < bridge_> <patiga> but I do agree with z over s, so maybe I'll just go US
21:16 < bridge_> <teero777> im having an issue with huge maps like this one. you can load and edit them fine in the editor but playing them freezes and it feels like a memory leak to me since a 12000x 12000 map should not take over 32 gigs of ram.

21:17 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> jesus 22 mb
21:17 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no images right?
21:17 < bridge_> <teero777> y
21:17 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> xD
21:18 < bridge_> <teero777> just a big maze generation.
21:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> maze?
21:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> can u screenshot it
21:18 < bridge_> <teero777> sure
21:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i wanna see
21:18 < bridge_> <patiga> in memory, that is half a gigabye per layer
21:19 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1139986485047726110/1139988114627121343/image.png
21:19 < bridge_> <patiga> *gigabyte
21:19 < bridge_> <teero777> wtf why?
21:19 < bridge_> <teero777> there is only 1 layer sooo
21:19 < bridge_> <patiga> 12000 * 12000 * 4
21:19 < bridge_> <patiga> in bytes
21:19 < bridge_> <teero777> yea ok
21:19 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :justatest:
21:20 < bridge_> <teero777> still it shouldnt overflow my system with 32 gigs free
21:20 < bridge_> <patiga> ah, and if the gpu buffer is also stored in the cpu, then its also much more than that
21:20 < bridge_> <patiga> per tile
21:20 < bridge_> <patiga> I would suggest you to stay with maps less than 8000 tiles large, even better would be below 4000
21:21 < bridge_> <teero777> 25 mil seems to work for me
21:21 < bridge_> <teero777> so 5000x5000
21:22 < bridge_> <totar> what do you need such a big map for btw?
21:25 < bridge_> <tomek0923> hello hello hello
21:25 < bridge_> <tomek0923> there is a spammer spamming 'chillerbot headless something' in multeasymap RUS
21:28 < bridge_> <tomek0923> like this:

21:33 < bridge_> <betonoxpa> coming april fools maze
23:51 < bridge_> <h.kaan> how do you generate ddnet maps from script?
23:52 < bridge_> <exosphere_endosphere> ?
23:52 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm? just modify the src? check in editor.cpp how the other things under Tools are made
23:53 < bridge_> <teero777> idk just in theory. am exploring gores map generating rn
23:56 < bridge_> <h.kaan> where is Tools
23:58 < bridge_> <teero777> @h.kaan https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/255092ff92113da016717b57bfecd4b41173ea1b/src/game/editor/popups.cpp#L149
