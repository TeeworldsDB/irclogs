02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i would like to have this feature on
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this would be kinda useful for mappers
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> It has too much text for my tiny brain, what do u want:ww:
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> did you check the picture too? ðŸ˜„
03:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i guess its a little obvious for mappers cuz they actually experiencing it all the time
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like manually filling up all the spaces with unhook or hook entities which are suppose to be
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> should be automatic tho with one button for each layer's tile windows.
10:09 <+bob> hwid/mac address is easily spoofable
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially in an open source game ðŸ˜„
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> we close the src
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> !!!
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought mac addresses are only interesting for routers etc and not send over to servers
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah but i guess you could tell the client to check for the hardware addr and send it to the server
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> interesting idea
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. but then the client can sedn you anything
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but not everybody will do that
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the client always lies ^^
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, only the ones affected by the ban
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ^^
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "google: how to get around ddnet permaban"
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> first result "download haxxor client mac sppofer for ddnet bans now!"
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @ChillerDragon you are dumb asf, but i think everybody know...
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how does this relate to the conversation?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> ```i thought mac addresses are only interesting for routers etc and not send over to servers
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> ```
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah

16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont bring up my rq
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u did -.-
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> disrespectful
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> men i had to go
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i came too late still
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not that we had any chance anyways
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you were the one not bringing anybody as a backup
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no friends
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but okay this conversation is not going to continue here
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> it continues at my home
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> threesome
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh hell no
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @FluffiexD what ChillerDragon said was true oO
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can still be dumb while saying true things tho
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i already knew it and fluffie did as well i just repeated what he said in a weird way
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "lets integrate hwid, mac adress, etc into tw/server network" as he said they have to be implemented. So me pointing out that they are not there yet might be true but not of value.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @heinrich5991 have you ever considered how the big game companies ban people when they've hacked?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they make them pay for the game again
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's about it
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> they user every information of ur pc and ban it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it's ineffective
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> na, lets talk about fortnite or cn tencent games
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> people buy new pcs for it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know how fortnite does it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> to play again legit
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> bios etc
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> its very funny
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> buy new pc to play fortnite lol
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> true
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> most people do it
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> thats funny asf
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd presume it's something similar to Denuvo where they hide the identification code inside the regular game code so that you can hardly separate them. But that doesn't mix well with Open Source etc
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's denuvo?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 anti piracy shit
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> monster hunter was denuvo protected
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its pirated
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anti piracy solutions are usually in place to delay the piracy, not stop it
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :toptri:

17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah :/ sounds like an annoying piece of software
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 all these anti hacks software also harm linux in a bad way
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nowadays
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use proton
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to play windows only
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the hack software shit
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is not cross compatible
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it doesnt let u play usually
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I suggest something like a fast dummy change mode, when u activate it ur hook, hammer, key doesnt keep pressed when change to dummy, would be really helpfull for hammerhit with dummy and hookfly
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tried to fix that once
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> why ger servers down?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they should not be
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we got DoS attacks so the DoS filter might be blocking legitimate ip addresses now
