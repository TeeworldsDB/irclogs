02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Not sure if this is right place to talk about this, but I just found out that 0.7 has 1 frame delay -- this means that on top of needing antiping, it needs anti-frame-delay
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> So let's say someone like Cammo, who plays with 8 ping, plays on a 60Hz monitor -- that's at minimum ~300% delay
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> So everybody plays worse and have no idea why
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Not to mention significantly lower FPS
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Not to mention significantly lower FPS (though I don't think most people would be affected by this)
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 0.7 :kek:
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> 0.6 > 0.7
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pathos try gfx_finish 0  and gfx_vsync 0, then 0.7 should be as good as ddnet old renderer
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> is there a size limit for audio files
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> > @Pathos try gfx_finish 0  and gfx_vsync 0, then 0.7 should be as good as ddnet old renderer
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @Jupstar ✪ Already have those settings
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Thanks for looking out though
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Pathos what graphics card are you using? 0.7 has the async rendering turned off by default. You could try `gfx_asyncrender 1`. Might help but it can also make it worse =\
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> For me both ddnet and 0.7 feel good in terms of latency
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Why are there no odd numbers on ranks?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1000 / 50 = 20
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so 20ms per tw tick
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> ah
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> can we have a command /teamranks [name] [times x] ?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it should list all teamranks from a player on this map
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen how do you add the translation texts, have a script for it?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we should add an option to disable graphic warnings in the graphic settings tab and maybe
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2676
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> remove these instead
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen yes, build with -DSTEAM=ON for the steam releases (for windows/macOS it doesn't matter right now, but it doesn't hurt either)
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> what this sign mean?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/749991503832809533/unknown.png
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> seems like background texture was not initialized or something
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> reproduced in 100% with old OpenGL
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i think i looked that up some day it was blob.png or some debug texture
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant remember rn
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> correct
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think blob without blending
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> correct (its blob.png)
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i remember correctly, i just enabled glblend default in 3.3
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's maybe why its not there
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> should I open an issue for this?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> this thing here for a looong time
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if its fixable, dont have a profiler that works with < gl 3.2
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i can try later
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `m_State.m_BlendMode = CCommandBuffer::BLEND_ALPHA;`
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you try that @BannZay in graphics_threaded.cpp
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sadly i barely see the loading screen
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> your compucter is too fast
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or i have to take screenshots automtically to test 😄
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes I will try
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I used obsstudio to catch it
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah ok 😄
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the constructor btw
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> you are genius my friend 🙂
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it helped
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok nice, you can create the pr if u want 😄
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know why would u use a single element tuple `(x,)` instead of just x (in langs that support them)
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👀
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, maybe to keep an API consistent?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 apparently haskell doesnt have them
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they consider them useless
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> single element tuples?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does indeed sound like an oxymoron to me
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u think about this?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has cmake support
17:21 <+Learath2> hadn't seen it before
17:21 <+Learath2> very skeptical, there have been attempts at a c/c++ package manager before, there is a reason none stuck on
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 10k stars
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:22 <+Learath2> is it a popularity contest?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 well, i think it is more good for windows than linux
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since distros have their own package managers
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but windows not
17:26 <+Learath2> one issue I see is that it uses the cmake toolchain file, many projects use that for setting up cross compilation instead (including ddnet)
17:27 <+Learath2> Even in linux c/c++ library management is quite awful
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 😆 😆 😆
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750013850623016971/unknown.png
17:27 <+Learath2> No good way to pin versions being the major issue imho
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i got it
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> my dummy couldn't connect because dummy didn't have name
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its just was empty
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it just was empty
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also, i could enter to other modes
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> with dummy
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also, i could enter to other mods
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is this can be releated with steam name update?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can we have a visual clue in the leaderboard when a team is in practice mode?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum I was going to add this, but it requires a rather tough patch to replace netobjects in snapshots
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont know what that means but i hope you get it working
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It requires a motivation boost and some extra time 😄
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Learath2 i believe in you!!!❤️
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ... now you only need some extra time
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> send time
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 🕘

21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750078005543698502/unknown.png
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is it performing with that many people around?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i had 128 players at once already :D
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for some minutes, 2 days ago
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> works quite good
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also regarding the 0.7 side of the server, seems to work good after i updated the algorithm
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 when i tried to send more than 64 players in the client count, like 1-2 years ago it wasnt possible, only the max clients, now it also works for the num clients
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut btw, why not add 128 players to official DDNet? Did we have that discussion already?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <le> 8192 characters when
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in theory its not hard @deen, you have the algorithm already basically, for me it was only hard because i have to handle 0.7, which uses net msgs, not snapshots
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, we also support 0.7
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, true, lol
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, i have no client-support
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its all based on the id-maps
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just like ddnets 64 player version in 0.6
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If you are interested, I could add it, my algorithm isnt perfect tho and I do think that it can cause micro laggs, but I think your servers are better anyways
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wrote my own UpdatePlayerMaps algorithm, to handle some things slightly easier and to have it a bit more improved (i hope, never actually checked, but by feeling its better :D)
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Personally I think it's interesting, not sure if @Learath2 and @heinrich5991 agree
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i needed to improve stuff, such as all players from one ip having the same faked ids among them, to make sure hammerfly and stuff with dummy works fine
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The initial commit bascially has everything already but ofc i fixed some smaller bugs with time
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 any tips/ideas on finding protocol bugs which leads to 0.7 client freeze?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> First one I've found was CNetObjPickup which had different size on 0.6 and 0.7
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750096251961344130/Screenshot_from_2020-08-31_23-53-12.png
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've fixed it like this and it worked like a charm
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But it was easy to fix because I knew the pickup will appear and what is causing it to appear.
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Now I have some different network protocol packet which only being sent after a warmup end and it hangs 0.7 client only.
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And I don't know what it could be.
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm lemme think
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Client freezes or hangs due to invalid snapshot?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Seems like that
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you open menus like settings, f1?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If yes, its invalid snaos
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> snaps*
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, that's not client itself freezes
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then make sure to use correct Sizes
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for all snap objects
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it just seems fail to parse correctly snapshots
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I forgot to adjust one size, then the snap was invalu
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> invalid*
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but client doesdn't disconnects so it at least thinks it doing something useful and sends packets to a server
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, its exactly that
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Fix all sizes
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Any thoughts on how to get info from client itself?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe add some debug line somewhere
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just check all your snaps in the server
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/116af771d0366da7ff069748b386bcd0ebe3d2cc
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I forgot this one, after I fixed it it worked.
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Check all snaps you send
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> first one was HEARTH pickup yeah
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but now I have only 2 clients in snapshots and idk what could be wrong
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> tbh I don't know what is in snapshots ofc
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it just game don't have anything besides 2 characters
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and a map ofc
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, do you have any own custom snap Objects?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> plenty of them
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then fix all of them
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The sizes need to be correct
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but they're not spawn at the start of a game
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no custom object is in game
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do you have a github?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes but the project is closed source for some period
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> at least while there is a threat of playerbase segregation
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> at least while there is a threat of clone server
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> at least while there is a threat of clone servers
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't want players to split on servers
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so no
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it is something related to characters I think
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its exactly what I said :)
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The netobj translation is just not there :/
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> any tips on what could be added to client itself to raise exception on invalid snapshot state?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> turn on debug mode and check console
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should say failed delta unpacking
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with information on what object
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... I could build a client with debug on... right
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just f1: debug 1
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then check console window
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt get printed to f1, just to the console window
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> wow thanks
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so much info
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and hud is really nice
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it prints some net packets errors which is awesome
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```[2020-09-01 00:07:11][game]: invalidated index=7 type=-1 ((out of range)) size=8 id=0
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> [2020-09-01 00:07:11][game]: invalidated index=8 type=-1 ((out of range)) size=8 id=0
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> [2020-09-01 00:07:11][game]: invalidated index=9 type=-1 ((out of range)) size=20 id=0
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> console is full of this
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and a ```[2020-09-01 00:08:31][client]: prediction time reset!
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> [2020-09-01 00:08:32][client]: prediction time reset!
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> [2020-09-01 00:08:33][client]: prediction time reset!
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> [2020-09-01 00:08:34][client]: prediction time reset!
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think this is something I can work with
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why dont you listen? :/
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It is the snap sizes, because they differ in 0.6 and 0.7
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You have to send the correct objects to the specific clients
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I add a dbg_break to delta unpacking failed while testing the bridge
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also add a dbg_msg printing out every object in the snap in delta unpack and one in snap new item
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Why dont you listen? :/
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > It is the snap sizes, because they differ in 0.6 and 0.7
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > You have to send the correct objects to the specific clients
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've listened, still want to know which exact packets are wrong. And this debug info helps me to find.
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't have the whole project and type sizes in my brain @fokkonaut far from that
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> me neither, but you can use sizeof
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because ddnet has both protocols
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I probably still should add a script to check netobj differences between the protocols and only auto translate if they are the exact same
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> To use sizeof I should know what to examine, don't you think?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck what's the issue here?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are sending an invalid object thats breaking the client?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am sure "I" do.
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Invalidated index is normal, its the extended protocol objects which get dropped by vanilla
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but network errors in hud is a useful sign?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The better way to diagnose this is to first determine how it hangs
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> they're not many but they are there
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm....
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> The better way to diagnose this is to first determine how it hangs
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > The better way to diagnose this is to first determine how it hangs
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> sure, just I don't know how it is happening
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What kind of hang is it, can you just disconnect and reconnect
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> My steps to reproduce are:
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 1. Start a server

23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> My steps to reproduce are:
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 1. Start a server
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 2. Connect with F-Client to the game
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 3. Connect a dummy
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4. game entering a warmup stage
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 5. vote to change map
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 6. map changed
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 7. I am on new map w/o dummy
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 8. I click on connect dummy
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 9. All 2 chararacters are stopped reacting 
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 10. If I connect with DDNet client to this game it looks fine for 0.6 client
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oooh f client, i wouldnt know, it could be an fclient issue too
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should ask fokkonaut
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Lol
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> vanilla 0.7.5 is handing before drawing a map 😄
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> even w/o other characters
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so F-Client does it better
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though the problem is there
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 its the snap sizes...
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But that's nice. At least a bug that fails very early
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not a big bug, really
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Snap sizes doesnt make sense, do you mean netobj sizes?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just check all your Snap items and make sure to send the Protocol7 version to IsSixup clients and the normal version to non sixup
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe this will be easier.
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Do inspect evevry invocation of NetObjAnything in code
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, thanks. I've got more than I've expected to unstuck myself in investigating this.
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f00cab1b5585858117e2d815e3be0ed738475356/src/game/server/entities/pickup.cpp#L165
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 you can use sizeof(protocol7::CNetObj_Pickup) here
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and at all the other places where its hardcoded by timakro
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I knew I forgot some
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> basically also the hardcoded Types @Learath2
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2, 3, etc
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> protocol7::PICKUP_x
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So it's 12 bytes for 0.7 protocol and variable sized for 0.6?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> for pickups I mean
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> depends on what object
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Use sizeof
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it automatically does that
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will try that Thanks
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Good night
