00:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also could be done with a macro `#define Localizable`
00:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe i dont know if that works
01:24 < bridge> <cherryex6> Ok so finally I found something.
01:24 < bridge> <cherryex6> Actually the prediction issue was caused by accidentally sending a valid `m_FreezeEnd` in `CNetObj_DDNetCharacter` which is weird.
03:41 < bridge> <cherryex6> So basically the client will continue to predict an unfreeze for any tee with no respect for the gametype UNLESS you tell the client that the character is deep frozen and can't be unfrozen by a laser or hammer.
03:43 < bridge> <cherryex6> And this also seems to be correct maybe insta has its own player.cpp which does not include sending a `CNetObj_DDNetPlayer` and as a result the client does not render a pause button.
03:46 < bridge> <cherryex6> I didn't really check the code for insta tbh.
03:46 < bridge> <cherryex6> But I think the client prediction needs some changes.
03:46 < bridge> <cherryex6> And maybe add a feature flag for pause/spec? I mean getting a net object doesn't mean the server has pause and spec commands available.

03:57 < bridge> <cherryex6> And maybe add something like a feature flag or maybe gameinfo fkag for pause/spec? I mean getting a net object doesn't necessarily mean the server has pause and spec commands available.

09:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** pyson issue
09:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** should rewrite in bash
09:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it can get stuck if the client crashes i guess
09:12 < bridge> <Assa> but the client is already connecting and sending info, is there another message to check if the client is connected on client side?
09:14 < bridge> <Assa> I believe I can check this as well `client: got pong from current server`
09:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do you know it‚Äôs connecting?
09:16 < bridge> <Assa> I can send the full test
09:16 < bridge> <Assa> it's on map switch

09:17 < bridge> <Assa> currently running the test again, waiting if I can get the pong message
09:18 < bridge> <Assa> but probably the server doesn't send a pong or the client crashes, but I can't check if the python thread running the client is still running, can I?
09:18 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder why we don't use pytest with fixtures here :/
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you add a test or add a bug?
09:19 < bridge> <Assa> the smoke test was failing, so I added a smaller test checking for only the behavior I want
09:19 < bridge> <Assa> the smoke test was failing, so I added a smaller test checking for only the behavior I want, e.g. map switch
09:19 < bridge> <Assa> my problem is I can only reproduce this in pipeline
09:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea idk much about the python stuff sorry go ping Heinrich
09:32 < bridge> <Assa> I even get the pong message :monkaStop: it's like the client is happily connecting the the server just doesn't log
09:34 < bridge> <Assa> can it be that I missed it? can the client enter before?
09:37 < bridge> <Assa> > client.wait_for_log_exact("client: connected, sending info", timeout=10)
09:37 < bridge> <Assa> This one also shouldn't work because it doesn't get that message on mapswitch
10:24 < bridge> <Assa> I let the test print all client and server logs, it appears that something hangs after mapswitch :justatest: it doesn't crash, it just hangs. I wonder if it's actually just really really slow or does truly hang

11:56 < bridge> <pilonpl> I wonder what happened
11:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oops
12:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> L tos btw why are we still on discord?
12:09 < bridge> <kebscs> you arent :nouis:
12:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillor did u add ddos command
12:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea like you requested .\_.
12:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But murpii says it‚Äôs bad
12:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> nooo :(
12:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> discord is a no fun zone
12:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> mr murpi is scared for his runs
12:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Discord sucks I agree
12:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We should migrate all conversation to DDNet in-game chat
12:34 < bridge> <melon> i think the issue is that the bot handles hexand octal vals

12:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Emotes and wiggling your mouse are way better than reaction emoji
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> the ddos command was just this
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```ts
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> else if (cmd === 'ddos') {
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato>     if (args.length !== 1) {

12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```
12:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> why murpi mad
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> you could totally build a ddnet <-> discord dev bridge
12:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you disagree with someone's engineering decisions you throw them into a kill tile to convince them
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> hmm need to watch out with player count
12:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We can have a cross server chat bridge
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> omg, you could make a city map where each room is another discord chat üòÆ

12:44 < chillerbot> ddosing game server 1.1.1.1 ...
12:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> But for chat logs we need to log in game emoting and body language, which basically means teehistorian
12:47 < bridge> <murpi> Can you stop
12:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It probably isn't searchable by chat history, and isn't indexed either...
12:48 < bridge> <always> that wont get the server banned
12:48 < bridge> <melon> oh yeah eh - that may automatically flag our server as malicious
12:48 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon: can you rm -rf that pls.
12:48 < bridge> <murpi> Do you think the Discord support team is sharp enough to recognize that this is "just a joke" similarly how they treat it people for joking about their age?

12:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh wait really
12:49 < bridge> <melon> do you think they check that manually? :p
12:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> no i didnt know they check it at all
12:50 < bridge> <melon> i wish they'd check stuff even harder
12:50 < bridge> <always> the biggest discord bot had a /hack command which would "hack u"
12:50 < bridge> <melon> their automated system flagged my entire ISP as spam before
12:50 < bridge> <always> i doubt that would ban but whatever
12:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (for any discord employees reading this, I'm 26)
12:50 < bridge> <melon> my messages didnt go tghrough because of it d
12:50 < bridge> <melon> my messages didnt go tghrough because of it xd
12:50 < bridge> <melon> our "bot" isnt a bot tho, its an IRC bridge with custom js
12:50 < bridge> <always> its a webhook
12:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> one more reason to dislike discord
12:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> so what if the server gets flagged as malicious?
12:51 < bridge> <always> they do
12:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> will there be a warning for members
12:51 < bridge> <always> if a server gets falgged
12:51 < bridge> <always> they pause invites
12:52 < bridge> <always> for a while
12:52 < bridge> <always> if a server gets flagged
12:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf discord sucks
12:52 < bridge> <melon> oh you were banned?
12:52 < bridge> <melon> just join their discord to appeal!
12:52 < bridge> <melon> 
12:52 < bridge> <melon> **this server has been closed for malicious activity**
12:52 < bridge> <melon> ah gg
12:52 < bridge> <always> yep
12:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> how long has this been a thing
12:53 < bridge> <melon> idk but we should respect murpi saying we shouldnt do it.
12:54 < bridge> <melon> idk but we should respect and trust murpi saying we shouldnt do it.
12:54 < bridge> <always> yeah sure
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> probably until sb sued or said or wrote to the mods that he would
12:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> would be nice if he mentioned why first
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> probably until sb sued or wrote to the mods that he would
12:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> or i didn't see the message
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> good that I used my throw-away-mail for discord
13:00 < bridge> <murpi> Ah yes, programming DDoS commands under the assumption that it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable and not criminal, surely Discord will have no difficulty distinguishing satire from intent. What could go wrong? :justatest:

15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> now if my kernel stack overflows it leads to a double fault instead of triple fault pog
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder how a arm kernel would be, probs much simpler
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> and riscv
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> random info bit:
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> If you stack overflow, how can the kernel handle the interrupt if just pushing the interrupt stack frame would lead to hitting the stack guard and faulting again, trygering a double fault, which in turn would trigger a triple fault?
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> x86 solves this by allowing to swap to a valid stack by specifing it in the TSS (task state segment) for the given fault handler, in this case the double fault handler

18:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** seems like the bridge got bugged i just got some messages about aoc 2021
18:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I was joking lmao. But I actually dont see them on matrix lol
18:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: any updates on merge rights?
19:02 < bridge> <kebscs> @learath2 if chiller gets merge rights, what can I do to get collaborator to be able to close very old issues
19:03 < bridge> <kebscs> I sometimes go through issues to find smth to code and a lot are outdated
19:03 < bridge> <kebscs> Since so many are open
19:07 < bridge> <louis> oh i didnt know there was a role in between
19:24 < bridge> <kebscs> Chiller has it currently
19:24 < bridge> <kebscs> Can just add labels and close issues afaik
19:24 < bridge> <kebscs> Would be useful bcs we added a rule to contribute md to only work on labeled issues
19:41 < bridge> <Assa> where can I apply to this in between role?
20:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: commenting what you would like to do worked well for me. Some maintainer will probably perform the action for you. And eventually someone gets annoyed and gives you more power :D
20:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Road to 666 issues and 69 prs
20:19 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea already commented on few issues and Roby closed them
20:19 < bridge> <kebscs> But it would be way more handy
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> poggers
20:19 < bridge> <kebscs> With less work
20:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The role is quite op actually. I can reopen my own prs that got closed by maintainers. And can also close prs.
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1 - I love chiller
