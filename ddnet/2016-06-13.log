03:25 <+ScottKevill> deen: You don't necessarily need to acccess the phpBB DB directly. You can mirror username/PW changes to some other form of DB.
03:26 <+ScottKevill> I only looked at pbpBB briefly many years ago, so I don't know how clean the code is.
03:27 <+ScottKevill> Single sign-in is a pretty common use case.
03:29 <+ScottKevill> Replicating the auth data to something custom would probably be a good idea for performance reasons as well.
03:30 <+ScottKevill> I'm not really familiar with how DDNet works, so I'm not sure where the auths would happen.
09:41 <@deen> Hm, I wanted to use mp4 videos for an article but they cause 100% cpu if they autorun. Meanwhile gifs of the same size work perfectly fine at 10% cpu.
