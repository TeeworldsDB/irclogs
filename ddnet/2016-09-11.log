00:54 <@deen> don't need more than 5 â‚¬ / month to send 50 Mbit/s of legitimate looking traffic from spoofed ip addresses
03:01 <@EastByte> deen: keep in mind that legitimate looking game traffic is about 60 bytes per packet, so 50mbit/s would be about 100k pps and you certainly can't do that with a cheap virtual server
03:02 <@EastByte> to run such attacks you probably need multiple dedicated servers which additionally are not monitored by the provider, otherwise you would get kicked pretty fast
03:40 <+xandaros> Hmm, I didn't take spoofing into consideration. That makes things a fair bit more complicated.
03:41 <+xandaros> If they aren't actually spoofed, you could probably tally up the number of packets from a particular source and filter them out that way. If they all come from random addresses, however, that wouldn't work
03:42 <+xandaros> I suppose you could stop taking new connections, which would limit the damage to players joining servers and existing clients could continue to play, but I'm not sure how feasible this is (and that is still some pretty great amount of damage)
12:40 <+Learath2> EastByte, still cant connect is it b/c of nfoservers or is the server still getting hammered ?
12:41 <@EastByte> both
