00:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> very good issue IMO
00:03 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it should be configurable, like all things
00:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> I honestly feel like that was the default once xD
00:05 < bridge_> <louis> yeah arrow sjould be above
00:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> they were once when i did it by mistake, before that they were below
00:05 < bridge_> <louis> or maybe even better,  beside the tee based on which way its moving yk
00:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it should be able to be placed below also, idk
00:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah that too
00:06 < bridge_> <louis> configurations are bad
00:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> just give a million options xd
00:06 < bridge_> <louis> pls find a good default
00:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> wtf why
00:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Best is no nameplates or directions
00:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ofc good default
00:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 100% experience
00:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but still option
00:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @fokkonaut
00:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> youre very adament that nameplates have no layout shift, just curious why. some people prefer them above
00:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i would pose that most people have their font sizes much below the defaults (even negative now) so theres not much hope getting any consistent positioning between clients
00:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @fokkonaut
00:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> youre very adament that nameplates have no layout shift depending on options, just curious why. some people prefer them above
00:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i would pose that most people have their font sizes much below the defaults (even negative now) so theres not much hope getting any consistent positioning between clients
00:08 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> config is why this client is so good
00:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i do-est agree, there is no way sensible defaults are possible
00:09 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> plus you have like a bajillion people that will crucify you if you change anything
00:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> for example the font sizes are way too big today, but might be fine with lower res screens
00:09 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> everyone plays different
00:10 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you can't just make assumptions for the user, this is an open-source game
00:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> for example the font sizes are way too big today, but  were with lower res screens
00:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> for example the font sizes are way too big today, but  were fine with lower res screens
00:10 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> dont make people rebuild source, this is how you get so much disparate features across clients
00:10 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> not enough flexibility xd
00:10 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> minirant over
00:11 < bridge_> <louis> open source makes it easier for users to get whatever config they want
00:12 < bridge_> <louis> the base client should be minimal with great default values and not 200 options for trivial things
00:12 < bridge_> <louis> i agree the nameplate font is too big by default
00:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> then change the defaults, but having options instead of magic constants is fine
00:12 < bridge_> <louis> its not options instead of constants, its options on top of constants
00:13 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> the only thing gained from minimalism in a sense is ease of use. if a user never touches a setting, they're not experiencing any complexities
00:13 < bridge_> <louis> there's development positives to minimalism too
00:13 < bridge_> <louis> development and bugfixes move faster
00:13 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> so if there is a good default, the complexity comes at no cost to the user. yes to the dev I understand
00:13 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but I still argue most settings have little overlap and we need unit tests anyway probably
00:14 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> maybe I'll get shot here for saying unit tests though
00:15 < bridge_> <louis> do u use base ddnet client?
00:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yep
00:16 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> well what do you mean
00:16 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i have a lot of config
00:16 < bridge_> <louis> just curious i meant using denet instead of t client or smth
00:16 < bridge_> <louis> just curious i meant using ddnet instead of t client or smth
00:17 < bridge_> <louis> anyways i think most maintainers are anti config settings which im glad for
00:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i don't think client competition is bad or anything but if ddnet had non-default settings for "non-ddnet" things it would just improve the general player experience
00:18 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i don't really know what the fuss is about but I'm not a maintainer
00:18 < bridge_> <louis> whats a non ddnet thing
00:18 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> somehow I have a commit for ddnet XD no idea what that was
00:19 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> idk. i guess something highly requested? saving multiple skin settings, entities outlines, freeze display in team
00:20 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> those are the notable t client ones
00:20 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> fast input is something that i feel should be in base client
00:20 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i especially dont think allowing the client to store more skin settings and to toggle between them introduces like any overhead at all
00:20 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> its just extra data
00:21 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> and some scrollable area in the ui that has to be toggled on with a checkbox
00:21 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont particularly care for tclient profiles ðŸ‘€
00:21 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> there is something oddly attractive about custom skin settings being laborious to change
00:22 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when someone joins, they normally keep the same skin
00:22 < bridge_> <louis> i forgot what fast input does
00:22 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> so you really get attached to how someone's skin looks idk
00:22 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> recognize it
00:23 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but i still think its a valuable thing. maybe for some modes too, switching to volleyball skin
00:23 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> not biased or anything
00:23 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> (the tee is deep anyway)
00:25 < bridge_> <louis> yeah skin slots would be neat
00:25 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> what about entities outlines or tee trails? they're really just eye candy but so is the confetti louis added
00:25 < bridge_> <louis> i dont like the profile slots that change your entire name and dummy name and flag etc.
00:25 < bridge_> <louis> its too much and better suited for cfg files imo
00:25 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah I want it just for skins really
00:26 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> in the UI the menu is just for Tee it wouldn't make sense
00:26 < bridge_> <louis> entity outlines are kinda weird
00:26 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it makes the tiles less busy
00:26 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when playing
00:26 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> at least imo
00:26 < bridge_> <louis> it feels ugly unless youre using a really plain entity set
00:27 < bridge_> <louis> which ddnet doesnt come default with
00:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you do use a plain one on purpose yeah
00:27 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> enetity outlines is great, entities can sometimes be hard to discern, tee trails can be functional
00:27 < bridge_> <louis> also tee trail is not the same eyecandy as confetti xd
00:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i changed my entities to have a borderless version
00:27 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i think tee trails are cooler than i thought originally
00:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> at first I was like meh but its actually info and probably helps with speed, seeing his a trajectory was not working for a parrt
00:28 < bridge_> <louis> its definitely more prominent and might feel cluttered since its always on
00:28 < bridge_> <louis> 
00:28 < bridge_> <louis> also its personally not that teeish imo, it looks really nice with multiple ghosts but otherwise idk
00:28 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> at first I was like meh but its actually info and probably helps with speed, seeing that a trajectory was not working for a parrt
00:28 < bridge_> <louis> theres value in keeping everything in default client relatively tee themed
00:29 < bridge_> <louis> tclient is great cause it allows ppl who want those more complex options and graphics a good client
00:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i do at least agree that I don't ever want to see a screenshot and be like wtf am i looking at
00:29 < bridge_> <louis> i think the networking and input features could be neat for ddnet but not the other stuff
00:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but people are already making it like pixel fonts and stuff
00:29 < bridge_> <louis> yeah but idt we would ever allow the font to be configurable ingame xd
00:30 < bridge_> <louis> i guess minecraft does it but its hidden behind resource packs
00:30 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you could I guess but seems pretty pointless to me
00:30 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i love the font
00:31 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> teeish definition needs to be expanded upon
00:31 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> idk how you imagine that to be
00:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ive seen a lot of skins in community that are nowhere near teeish to me but we all probably have different ideas of it
00:35 < bridge_> <louis> thats why its in community
00:36 < bridge_> <louis> its also not baked into the client, yes u can click a checkbox but the skins are pulled from a detached skin server
00:37 < bridge_> <kebscs> reality is 99% of players dont know how to code and most of them just use default values and dont change anything
00:40 < bridge_> <louis> one thing i noticed is that there is barely any hierarchy to the settings menu now, its equally as difficult to find smth important and commonly changed compared to a more obscure setting
00:41 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i don't think most people dont change things at all
00:41 < bridge_> <louis> maybe its just cause i was more used to the simple settings menu back in the day, but still
00:43 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> many people are acquainted with reset on switch, restore weapon, nameplate size, speed/position/angle
00:44 < bridge_> <louis> auto equip weapon is a common too i actually think it should be off by default
00:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> flows better for race normally to have it on though?
00:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> its just other modes
00:45 < bridge_> <louis> p sure it makes switching slower if ur holding it down
00:45 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> unless you have to hh/fly I guess
00:45 < bridge_> <louis> uhh and yeah it can fuck u up sometimes idk its kinda jank tbf
00:45 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah maybe ur right
00:46 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> You do forget about the "policy" of not adding too many, unnecessary config options (due to maintenance)
00:46 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> words by heinrich and deen, iirc
00:46 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> so its difficult with so many opinions to agree on a good default thing
00:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i didn't "forget" I specifically mentioned that I think the significance is generally overstated
00:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I don't have experience developing though so my confidence is limited
00:46 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> (i didnt read whole convo)
00:47 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I think tons of niche settings only overlap with very small IF ANY other settings
00:47 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> and the tests (in most cases) would be trivial to write should they exisr
00:47 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> and the tests (in most cases) would be trivial to write should they exist
00:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> for example here, it's important to have these settings: `cl_show_direction 0; cl_nameplates_size 50; cl_nameplates_offset 30;`
00:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> 
00:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Especially important: the show_direction, to not move the whole nameplates up
00:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366546621956882533/image.png?ex=68115737&is=681005b7&hm=f2e01088b28537ca1db3cc6fe9b9e64a5129a165860867b00f248ea668e8a2ed&
00:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> okay so first of all what is this even
00:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but it looks cool
00:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> DurÃ¡k
00:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> thanks
00:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> xd
00:49 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> xdd
00:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> damn dude I think I don't realize just how much different ddrace shit you've made
00:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i probably need to see it all sometime
00:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> (never played f-ddrace)
00:50 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> haha :D what a lot of people say ^^^
00:50 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> I'll show you around whenever we both find some time :p
00:50 < bridge_> <louis> alcohol best feature
00:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ðŸ˜› yeah, not often on currently but maybe soon. ive never really talked to you before
00:50 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> hahaha
00:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> just talked "around" you lol
00:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> tbf this is the case for a lot of people
00:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> maybe you would be interested in some of my ideas as well ^^
00:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> (if you can think of some 2D game, I have already tried to make it in ddnet editor :justatest: )
00:51 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> for me its important to do implementations clean, so things usually work very well
00:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i guess i havent tried to make chess, but that seems actually impossible
00:52 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> no it is, new ddnet client can hide weapons, and there are all chess skins
00:52 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i called it 5d chess
00:52 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> but nothing coded yet
00:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> well, if you change code yeah
00:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I'm talking about pure ddrace
00:53 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> you wanna make chess like the tictactoe with switches?
00:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> all of my games are meant to be "Fun" server compatible
00:53 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> hard to draw
00:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> the issue isn't drawing it, its storing board state
00:53 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> bitwise
00:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> we have more entropy to use with dummy speed now but its hard
00:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ye right
00:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you can get orders of magnitude higher bits with speeds than switches
00:54 < bridge_> <louis> bro will do anything but learn c++
00:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> downside ofc is needing dummy
00:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ofc ðŸ˜„
00:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> to me, learning how to conform to some fixed rules and try to push a closed system to its limit, THAT is what motivates me to create
00:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> its why I like using tools like audacity to make music
00:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> if  I have too much freedom, I focus too much on what COULD be created instead of just trying to work to the upper bound
00:56 < bridge_> <louis> if thats what makes u happy ig
00:56 < bridge_> <louis> but then u can never do anything past a certain complexity
00:56 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it does. i have more fun in the editor testing and pushing things than basically anything ive done alone
00:57 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> aside from coding personal projects
00:57 < bridge_> <louis> also audacity just makes things harder idt its any more closed than other stuff
00:57 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i would rather map than play if i know what I'm working on
00:57 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah, I guess it just helps me focused on embracing a mess
00:57 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah, I guess it just helps me stay focused on embracing a mess
00:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> plus ive received so much positive feedback on volleyball despite feeling like I didn't really do much for it so i feel like I can potentially do way better, there's that too
