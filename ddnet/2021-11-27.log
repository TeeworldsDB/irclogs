09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> how about to add milestones ingame ? if u play a map, u can see where u died last time
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> how about to add milestones / graves ingame (clientside)? if u play a map, u can see where u died last time
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lyn / Micha> Doubt it,ll be use full or interesting
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> oh i guess it is. how many times ppl tell me, they died here last time
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> if u have it visually, its a nice eyecatcher, and many conversations would start because of it
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> and if u feel disturbed by ur own grave, then toggle it off
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> some maps are so ugly, we fail it so often. if we see the milestone, would be funny thing
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i guess many novice would like it
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> maybe less brutal player

13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> We already had a lot of ideas for it, and also better ideas for points, etc. But since we can not insert it ourselves and no one helps us it will probably never come üòÅ
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> If you want to have something you have to insert it yourself, since not everyone is a PC professional only the things that PC people themselves think are useful and insert them.
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> Of course, back then, when ddnet started, I contributed many ideas and they were inserted, but today it's somehow different üòÅ
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> Only small changes can be made, if it becomes more complex you have to do it yourself
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well somehow different is mostly that we grew up. We all have a lot more real life things to do :D
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> So DDNet is at the end of evolving and only life support measures is what keep it running. (That's what I understand here xD)
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Since Chinese are getting more and more, the only hope is that they take it over xD
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> with each update the game is evolving
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> yes, maybe it wasn't fair to all of the ppl working on it. But sounds like no big steps anymore
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> it's also limited by the desire to be backwards compatible with other 0.6-based teeworlds clients
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> otherwise it would be possible to add like, actual 45 degree slopes or moving platforms that aren't super janky or new weapons that look different or whatever
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> though, there's only so much of those sorts of things you could add before it becomes too much anyway
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Yuzu your idea has quite a few flaws, like, what if you play a specific map particularly often?  You'd end up with hundreds gravestones everywhere. You could limit this to one gravestone, but what if you kill cuz you failed, as an example, the noobfilter? This would render this feature useless
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> feature requests need to thought out thoroughly ^^
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> I don't understand the decision to support backwards, to be honest. DDnet could become an own fork and go for player suggestions.
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> But I'm no developer, I don't know shit
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> be*
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> i mean i wish the community split hadnt happened in the first place
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> @murpi only save the grave with longest racing time
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> But what if u fall out of map xD
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> race time doesnt exactly correspond to distance progressed tho
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Or only save last kill
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> if a map has time checkpoint / tele checkpoints you could count how many have been crossed and only update if the amount is the same or greater, that would probably correlate better in those cases (though it still wouldnt be perfect and wouldnt necessarily help for all maps)
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> But ok, I understand the problem
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> if a map has time checkpoint / tele checkpoints you could count how many have been crossed and only update if the amount is the same or greater, that would probably correlate better in those cases (though it still wouldnt be perfect and wouldnt necessarily help for all maps, but it's closer to being what we'd want)
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> if a map has time checkpoint / tele checkpoints you could count how many unique ones have been crossed and only update if the amount is the same or greater, that would probably correlate better in those cases (though it still wouldnt be perfect and wouldnt necessarily help for all maps, but it's closer to being what we'd want)
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> avoid editing your messages here in #developer ^^
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> oh right sorry
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> but anyway, some people may still prefer other 0.6 clients, and also if you break backwards compatibility too much then the myriad of other 0.6 custom gamemodes that exist won't be playable through DDNet anymore either
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> though the point about other modes only means the client needs to support older server types, the fact some people still use other clients (not counting bot clients) means cutting backwards compatibility risks alienating some players
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> But ddnet is the biggest part of tw these days. In my eyes it should become an own game and leave vanilla tw behind
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> i like ctf and am upset I can't play it anymore because of the divide (I'm unable to run 0.7 clients currently for some reason, they lag horrendously)
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> I mean, it's even an own steam client
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Vanilla teeworlds is proud of you. But somewhen the child have to leave the house xD
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> However, maybe I'm wrong
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Even official teeworlds go for a break every few years. If u support downward compatibility but no longer upward compatibility, there shouldn't be a problem
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> the break around the transition from 0.6 to 0.7 was kind of just horrible from what i remember of it
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> 0.5.2 to 0.6 too
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> I can't speak for 0.5 and earlier because its been a very long time since those were transitioned from
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> the point is that making such breaking changes shouldn't be done lightly
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> doing it right takes extra time and energy beyond simply doing it
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Do you have a NVIDIA graphics card? For me Teeworlds 0.7 also started lagging a lot on startup a few days ago. Could be a driver update.
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> today I have a full time job and other stuff üòÄ
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> :justatest:
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same :monkalaugh:
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> is it just me or did anyone else notice a longer load time? im using the steam beta version
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> no, i have the issue with integrated laptop graphics
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could download both versions from ddnet.tw and compare the times to make sure
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> I'll try in a sec
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodDiamond> Is there any way a Clan invite system could be added to the basegame? So the people cant just take tags from other people that easily?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> that would essentially require an account system first for it to actually be able to do anything anyway
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> but i dont think clan protections are needed
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh thanks for sharing this but sadly the teesmash tourney did not seem to get shared there probably nor will the upcoming bomb tournament
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> Faking is a much bigger and actually problematic issue, and yet we still dont have even an optional account system to protect against it
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodDiamond> but that would fix the problem of faking as well if a account system could be added or not?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> well, now you have an account system that needs to be secure
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> right, well my point is that it has been suggested many many times and never implemented
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is github down?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems so
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> It is crazy how much time you still spend on this project besides all other stuff what is taking time in your life.
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @chillerdragon#0000 if i see a tourney coming i will try to tag you. But i am also not really active actually so not sure if i am a big help
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool all my maps were deleted
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> never mapping again
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> jk
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @lynn what wtf how what
