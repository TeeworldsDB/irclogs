01:35 <+lel> hello
01:35 <+lel> Why exist this platform ?
01:36  * lel slaps Q around a bit with a large fishbot
01:39 <+lel> uhm, is that an default textserver ?
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> this thing is ddnet-related channel
01:41 <+lel> and why that exist ?
01:42 <+lel> seems like an console
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> this thing exist cuz some people are using qn/fn/etc instead of discord
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> and this channel was made for considering about development questions as i know
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> so
01:43 <+lel> ahh okay, now im understanding 
01:44 <+lel> ty!
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> np
01:44 <+lel> you have you own domain, looks in your WHOIS
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> who created this network ?
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lel its DDNet.tw and this channel is for develelopement of gamemode
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> i had some weird bug where i couldnt join team
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTKDyWfgMQ
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> is it possible to make that when I drag and drop .map file on DDNet icon it will open the map in editor?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should be, we had sth similar for demos
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then you can associate .map files with ddnet client and just double click them, which is even better
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 apparently teehistorian demos are broken?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :kek:
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> LETS CHOT
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like u dont chot when it's working
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Big big chotter
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 is it just 0.7?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Idk, couldnt check
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was out when I heard about it
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> is ´inp_joystick´ an experimental command, or how exactly does it work?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> is ``inp_joystick` an experimental command, or how exactly does it work?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> is `inp_joystick` an experimental command, or how exactly does it work?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> i dont think that joystick using is an experimental function
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> and my friend played with js
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I only got it to work with additional software mh. The command doesn't rly do anything at me
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik could add, i'll try in 1-2 weeks
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I can't wait that long @deen !
