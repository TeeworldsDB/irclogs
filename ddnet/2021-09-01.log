10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> lol
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 no merge xdd
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My head is all over the place. I have a math exam I'm not ready for in 8 days
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cut me some slack
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then study, you should.

16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they gonna increase .com prices
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> capitalism :feelsbadman:
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who would have guessed if we give a private company the rights to a TLD they will milk it for all it's worth
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Completely unavoidable, how could we have imagined that a private business in a capitalist world would prioritise profits above all. Very unexpected indeed
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only we had a multistakeholder organization to Assign Names and Numbers to organizations, with oversight from all countries making sure there is no foul play. We could name it something like Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN for short
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wait, hmm
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/multistakeholder/multistakeholder non-profit/
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.icann.org/
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funniest thing is if you ask ICANN this weird setup makes the market more "competitive" by allowing registrars to "compete". How do I register to compete in the `.com`Â TLD which is the most desirable huh? American hypercapitalism....

17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> How can I change the master-server for local servers / my client? Is this even possible?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> masters.cfg
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> question: is it possible to make a relay service blockchain-ish where the "miners/hosters" host nodes for relaying p2p connection in exchange of "le gamer cryptos" and everyone(gamedevs) got free network relay services and hosters gets rewards generated out of no where ðŸ‘€
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> which joystick*does* ddnet actually support? seems like some axes values are hardcoded in CControls. the only support gamepad seems to be the OUYA.
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> any can you already play with two sticks, like left for movement and right for aiming?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> well i cant rly move with it. Also i have cheap one like this:
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/882694342639251536/USB-Gamepad-Joystick-for-PS3-Raspberry-Pi-PC-Windows-Android-Linux-Retroflag-NESPI-SUPERPi-CASE-Wire.png
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i can only move crosshair
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> with left stick
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> nothing more
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> would be nice to be able to bind the sticks to movement keys as well, so I'll probably try to add that to vanilla first
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> and then try to adapt ddnet as well
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> actually the whole thing should probably be redone with https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryGameController :justatest:
