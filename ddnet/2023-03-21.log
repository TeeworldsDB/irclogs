01:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hi Phish Bot
01:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> It sounds like no one invited it
01:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably Zwelf did it on the matrix side
03:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh wow, take a close look at that again :
03:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh wow, take a close look at that again üòÆ
03:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `<!--` and `-->` are for single-line comments in JS
03:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so they *can* actually be used to hide JS code from browsers that do not support JS
03:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I remembered it correctly ^^
03:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```js
03:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> <!-- console.log("abc");
03:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991>      console.log("def");
03:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> -->  console.log("ghi");
03:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
03:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> prints just `def`
03:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki too ^^

13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Run large language models like BLOOM-176B collaboratively ‚Äî you load a small part of the model, then team up with people serving the other parts to run inference or fine-tuning.
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel do u know how torrent works?
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its basically a peer to peer compute power sharing
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to run a big model
13:42 < bridge> <Voxel> ahh

15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> TIL
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> was part of a ctf challenge
15:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is the quote related to mysql being part of a ctf?
15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the quote was part of what you had to know/find out/guess in a ctf challnge

15:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> timakro is here, pog
15:11 < bridge> <timakro> Hi, I wasn't here for a while :D I'm looking for C debugging help as I'm kinda rusty. Any idea why this segfaults? I have a coredump
15:11 < bridge> <timakro> 
15:11 < bridge> <timakro> ```
15:11 < bridge> <timakro> (gdb) frame

15:11 < bridge> <timakro> (gdb)
15:11 < bridge> <timakro> ```
15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sad that rusty is not a pun
15:11 < bridge> <timakro> could as well be a pun (wouldn't have issues like these in rust) haha
15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> haha
15:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk much context
15:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just made a quick google https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5873780/glib-type-testing-macros-cause-segfault-when-passed-a-gslist
15:13 < bridge> <timakro> But if thats stackframe #0 it means the bug is in that line, not g_slist_copy, right?
15:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Note that this is a ‚Äúshallow‚Äù copy. If the list elements consist of pointers to data, the pointers are copied but the actual data isn‚Äôt. See g_slist_copy_deep() if you need to copy the data as well.
15:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm idk tbh xD
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/o9000/tint2/blob/master/src/systray/systraybar.c>
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tbh i never used glib
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe @Learath2 knows
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he loves c
15:17 < bridge> <timakro> Yeah I modified this, it crashes on a line I wrote. I tried to patch another segfault but not very successfully ^^
15:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well the only thing i can point out is that ur making a shallow copy, idk much else :p
15:19 < bridge> <Learath2> did you try asan and ubsan? it usually cuts most debugging sessions down to a couple minutes üòÑ
15:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `x/i $rip` pls
15:22 < bridge> <timakro> ```
15:22 < bridge> <timakro> (gdb) x/i $rip
15:22 < bridge> <timakro> => 0x55b195b811a1 <on_change_systray+658>:      mov    (%rax),%rax
15:22 < bridge> <timakro> ```
15:22 < bridge> <timakro> Hm, may check those out
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what does x/i
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh so $rip is where it crashed
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> til
15:29 < bridge> <timakro> Had to google ti: x is "inspect memory", `/i` interprets it as instruction, `$rip` is instruction pointer
15:29 < bridge> <timakro> Had to google it: x is "inspect memory", `/i` interprets it as instruction, `$rip` is instruction pointer
15:29 < bridge> <timakro> So basically prints the current instruction at time of segfalt

16:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> how to fix this while freshly building ddnet server?
16:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> on win with vs
16:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> `[12/133] Generating release/ddnet_engine_shared.lib` seems to have worked, so i dont know
16:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think its a Rust issue, but since when do we need Rust to compile the server?
16:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Rust is not in the ddnet libs, how to get it to work?
16:18 < bridge> <deen> Rust is part of the dependencies, you need to install it to build: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#dependencies-on-linux--macos
16:18 < bridge> <deen> You can google for how to install Rust on Windows
16:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> we got it
16:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what did you do to fix it?
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> magick
17:22 < bridge> <kio> guyz
17:22 < bridge> <kio> how can i build the new version?
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just as the old version
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> from what version did u upgrade
17:23 < bridge> <kio> there are something different
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats ur OS whats the old ddnet version u built
17:24 < bridge> <kio> windows
17:24 < bridge> <kio> idk
17:24 < bridge> <kio> 16
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is rust installed?
17:24 < bridge> <kio> little check
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u do git submodule update 
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even know if we had updates tho xd
17:25 < bridge> <kio> the command cargo give me a response so i think that rust is installed
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else share what error you exactly get
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is probably easier

17:26 < bridge> <kio> maybe i choose the wrong kit
17:28 < bridge> <kio> git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use amd64 for example, or mingw x86_64 if u have it installed
17:30 < bridge> <kio> amd of VS?
17:30 < bridge> <kio> wait maybe
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes the other is 32bit
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u probably dont want it
17:30 < bridge> <kio> yes

17:34 < bridge> <kio> this is my vscode configuration
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @murpi what is KeClient btw?
17:35 < bridge> <kio> ?
17:35 < bridge> <kio> i gave a random name to it
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> always have to be careful in this chat xd
17:35 < bridge> <kio> about what
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> about cheaters
17:36 < bridge> <kio> lel
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where did u even get them from
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> other/vscode/ddnet.code-workspace
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> contains a ddnet workspace
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno your tasks.json looks like someone else created it
17:39 < bridge> <kio> I had started to create this client that was supposed to have sexy graphics and some features, but then I didn't have time to do it, now I have time and I wanted to continue but I need a decent version, everything worked before, but downloading this new version doesn't work anymore ddnet normal lel
17:39 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087777473086894140/2023-03-21_17-37-16.mp4
17:39 < bridge> <murpi> @kio I hope that's not a bot client? You previously posted code which is used for bots
17:39 < bridge> <kio> this chat and after i edited that and made it works
17:40 < bridge> <kio> like?
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> problem is you using mingw32 make binary, mix it with Visual studio c++
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe copy paste your whole workspace and delete all these .vscode files and try again
17:40 < bridge> <murpi> You deleted your old repo "KVClient" which had e.g: spinbot
17:40 < bridge> <kio> was a local texture spin lel
17:40 < bridge> <murpi> Hm Hm
17:41 < bridge> <kio> https://github.com/k-i-o/KRV-Client
17:42 < bridge> <kio> I program for fun, if I had to make cheats inside the client I would do them for sport but it would only be a personal goal, I would not use them and I would not spread them, however my goal now is to make a decent client with nice graphics, so don't worry
17:44 < bridge> <kio> without these files which command i had to do
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say u dont really have to do a lot
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> simply select a kit and start F7
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it should compile
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats all i ever did in vscode be it on windows or linux
17:47 < bridge> <kio> Do you recommend uninstalling something and reinstalling it to fix the kits or do I just select I don't know what when I put the kit?
17:51 < bridge> <kio> @murpi do you understand and approve? otherwise tell me and I stop doing anything
17:51 < bridge> <kio> to practice finding memory spaces etc I did some little useless external hacks, but I don't think it's a problem, it's just fun üò¶
17:52 < bridge> <kio> to practice finding memory addresses etc I did some little useless external hacks, but I don't think it's a problem, it's just fun üò¶
17:52 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087780888294735883/image.png
17:53 < bridge> <kio> it says it can't find the dll, and every time I press ok it tells me a different dll
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then copy them manually
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks like vsc++ create sub dirs called debug
17:54 < bridge> <kio> yes idk why
17:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Is this just trying to compile ddnet master branch?
17:54 < bridge> <kio> never happened
17:54 < bridge> <kio> yes
17:54 < bridge> <kio> üò¶
17:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Did you post the build log somewhere?
17:55 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087781568153665667/message.txt
17:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, rust seems to fail to create something too. Could there be a permissions issue with the folder?
17:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Though seems the exe files are created normally
17:57 < bridge> <kio> I try to reopen vscode with admin permissions
17:58 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087782284591116460/message.txt
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so the build worked?
17:59 < bridge> <kio> same error
18:00 < bridge> <kio> build worked but no dll generated
18:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you try copying the dll manually?
18:02 < bridge> <kio> I put all the dlls by hand and the error disappeared, but when opening the game it crashes in the loading screen..
18:02 < bridge> <ReiTW> isn't libpng not generated but an external lib ?
18:02 < bridge> <kio> all lib
18:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should be copied automatically
18:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but if it's not, you could try copying it manually
18:02 < bridge> <kio> yes i thing
18:02 < bridge> <kio> yes i think
18:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should be in ddnet-libs, somewhere
18:02 < bridge> <kio> crash
18:03 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe it also failed to copy the data dir? That could appear like a crash too
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do we crash without a datadir nowadays?
18:03 < bridge> <Learath2> No, but it would immediately quit out no?
18:04 < bridge> <kio> loading screen without texts or images, only a progess bar and after a crash
18:05 < bridge> <Learath2> No text no images does smell like no datadir. Can you check if there is a folder called data next to the exe?
18:05 < bridge> <kio> inside the same folder Debug?
18:05 < bridge> <Learath2> Yes
18:06 < bridge> <Learath2> If not copy the data folder from root aswell and see if it works
18:06 < bridge> <murpi> We cannot control what people do with the code, and we have no authority to give approval for any modifications made by third parties. However, I encourage you to consider the impact of your actions on the community and the game as a whole. That includes modifications that could give players an unfair advantage **in any gamemode**.
18:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we used to not do that
18:06 < bridge> <kio> i will show u a weird thing
18:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Might have regressed after setting vulkan as the default. The shaders are in data
18:07 < bridge> <kio> okk, I will be more reserved with my things and will not show them
18:07 < bridge> <kio> @Learath2
18:07 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087784653085212722/2023-03-21_18-05-48.mp4
18:08 < bridge> <kio> I compared two projects, one is my old one that was working and the second is the current one that is not working
18:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah this is where my knowledge of visual studio comes to an end. I honestly haveny compiled on windows in ages
18:09 < bridge> <Learath2> It is most definitely a mess created by the folder structure
18:09 < bridge> <kio> i used this configurations for the old project
18:09 < bridge> <kio> but i give problems now
18:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Notice your dlls are also there
18:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe it has something to do with how you used cmake? Did you use the cmake gui or directly open the folder in vs?
18:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like there's a bug lingering as well
18:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> data being copied to the wrong dir
18:11 < bridge> <kio> yep
18:11 < bridge> <kio> üò†
18:11 < bridge> <Learath2> Probably due to how cmake gui generates a subproject for each target
18:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Or rather the visual studio target of cmake that is
18:13 < bridge> <Learath2> A similar issue happens in the xcodeproject target
18:13 < bridge> <kio> F7 do this command [main] Building folder: KeClient 
18:13 < bridge> <kio> [build] Starting build
18:13 < bridge> <kio> [proc] Executing command: "C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.EXE" --build f:/KeClient/build --config Debug --target ALL_BUILD
18:13 < bridge> <kio> xcode :cammostripes:
18:13 < bridge> <Learath2> That's not the interesting part
18:14 < bridge> <Learath2> How you generated this visual studio project is what matters
18:15 < bridge> <Learath2> If you just open the cloned folder with VS, if I recall correctly it's handled properly
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> should be
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can even clone using VS itself
18:24 < bridge> <kio> potete guardare i pochi secondi inziali e i pochi finali, per√≥ il problema potrebbe essere il kit di visual studio, perch√© quello nella build mi sembra proprio un progetto VS :/
18:24 < bridge> <kio>

18:24 < bridge> <kio> you can look at the initial few seconds and the final few, but the problem could be the visual studio kit, because the one in the build looks like a VS project to me :/
18:24 < bridge> <kio> https://www.veed.io/view/83fbb47d-4ad7-40e4-8d66-78cd7294b564?sharingWidget=true&panel=share
18:26 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh you are using vscode hmm
18:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Mhhhh. Ok, let me try it myself :/
18:28 < bridge> <kio> i love u
18:28 < bridge> <kio> üòÑ
18:40 < bridge> <kio> ehm
18:41 < bridge> <kio> i did something
18:41 < bridge> <LAURA> The objective & aim of chatting with me should be sex and relationship
18:41 < bridge> <kio> nruh
18:41 < bridge> <Learath2> You are right Laura but this isn't the place
18:41 < bridge> <kio> bruh
18:42 < bridge> <kio> we are developer, only cocks or computers
18:42 < bridge> <kio> we are developers, only cocks or computers
18:42 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, vscode just generates the project in this weird way sadly
18:42 < bridge> <kio> wait wait i look some green texts im horny
18:42 < bridge> <Learath2> stop
18:43 < bridge> <kio> :/
18:43 < bridge> <kio> looks good wait

18:43 < bridge> <Learath2> That looks like it's make or ninja not visual studio/nmake so what did you change?
18:45 < bridge> <kio> i called the folder "gay" to punish the project (actually to change as to workspace so vscode doesn't recognize it as the same project), then i chose unidentified kit and re-added my old config files which weren't working before
18:46 < bridge> <kio> this fules

18:46 < bridge> <kio> files
18:46 < bridge> <Learath2> It works with the msys generator btw
18:46 < bridge> <kio> my goal by adding cmake-tools-kit was to find a setting with the path I put but nothing came out
18:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah you switched to mingw too
18:46 < bridge> <kio> ok
18:46 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087794485695631430/image.png
18:47 < bridge> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the vs project generator just doesn't work, I'm not sure what we do about that, it's just the way targets are treated
18:47 < bridge> <Learath2> So close, I guess the rust part failed above
18:48 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087794929532682281/message.txt
18:48 < bridge> <kio> i wanna cry
18:49 < bridge> <kio> 3 hours only for compile the orginal game
18:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Well if you have visual studio it will just work(tm) in there
18:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, it wasnt the rust part that failed it seems
18:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could try doing it in visual studio, that has at least been tried by project members before
18:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can probably fix that
18:54 < bridge> <Learath2> I should do this in a clean vm and make a tutorial sometime
18:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> first step would be creating a bug report though ^^
18:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I have a tutorial for msvs
18:55 < bridge> <Learath2> I meant for people that don't want vs
18:55 < bridge> <Learath2> With msys2 and mingw
18:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
18:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, do that üôÇ
18:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Honestly iirc msvs just works when you clone within it
18:57 < bridge> <kio> i don't rly like VS but im trying with that
18:57 < bridge> <kio> it works üò†
18:57 < bridge> <kio> i don't want VS sdfijndfsjahinlk
19:00 < bridge> <Learath2> I'll figure it out with mingw after dinner
19:11 < bridge> <kio> bruh, where the fuck it take x, y, w, h
19:11 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1087800763041972324/image.png
19:12 < bridge> <kio> oke
19:12 < bridge> <Learath2> CUIRect is stateful
19:13 < bridge> <theozin> oi
19:13 < bridge> <theozin> hi
19:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Those should technically be `m_X`, `m_Y`, `m_W` and `m_H`
19:13 < bridge> <theozin> hello
19:14 < bridge> <Learath2> hi
19:14 < bridge> <kio> I don't know how to do anything anymore, they changed all lel methods
19:14 < bridge> <kio> hi
19:14 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I think `CUIRect` is pretty much the same as it has always been
19:15 < bridge> <Voxel> Do you need something?
19:15 < bridge> <kio> no the class render
19:15 < bridge> <theozin> I'm Brazilian and I'm using a translator:cammo:
19:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think `CUIRect` wasn't able to draw on its own before
19:16 < bridge> <theozin> no
19:17 < bridge> <theozin> someone who plays
19:18 < bridge> <theozin> pls
19:19 < bridge> <Voxel> This is where we talk about the develoupment of the game. If you're looking for someone to play with, feel free to request in #looking-for-group
19:20 < bridge> <theozin> thanks
19:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh true, so there is some change there
20:22 < bridge> <Chairn> you can also show which accessed address caused the segfault
20:23 < bridge> <Chairn> `p $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr`
20:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah cool üòÆ
20:34 < bridge> <Chairn> most often will show `(void *) 0x0` but you never know üòÑ
21:04 < bridge> <timakro> @Chairn Uh nice, a null pointer. But I still don't know where it comes from
21:08 < bridge> <kamino> Could we get a new Statistic on the website and co that shows the oldest standing records?
21:27 < bridge> <Chairn> could it be a this pointer that is null when you try to call the function?
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> You mean the function argument?
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> ```
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> (gdb) frame
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> #0  0x000055b195b811a1 in on_change_systray (obj=0x55b195bcc940 <systray>) at /home/tim/Downloads/tint2/src/systray/systraybar.c:298
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> 298         GSList *list = g_slist_copy(systray.list_icons);
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> (gdb) print systray.list_icons
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> $3 = 0x55b19749d2a0 = {0x55b19736f250, 0x55b19730ab50, 0x55b197441ff0, 0x55b197370a40}
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> ```
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> It's not null as you can see
21:31 < bridge> <Teero> vscode provides a nice gui for debugging with gdb
21:31 < bridge> <timakro> And we're not dereferencing anything anyways so...
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give us the whole function?
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps it's not in that line
21:32 < bridge> <timakro> ohh `this` pointer, this is C not C++
21:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `this` is C++, not C :p
21:35 < bridge> <timakro> yeye cuz Chairn said `this` that can't be the problem because I'm working with C
21:36 < bridge> <timakro> I'm pretty sure now that somehow the wrong debug symbols got used because I copied my modified binary to /bin so that probably somehow confused gdb. Then the line with the bug would be `traywin = (TrayWindow *)l->data;` (which makes sense, 0 deref) and maybe my fix worked after all but somehow the old binary is back
22:04 < bridge> <Teero> i'd like to quit vsode but the visual debugger things makes me stick around. pretty easy to spot segfaults and fix em with this
