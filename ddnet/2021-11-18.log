12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Going to apple for the 5th time to get the keyboard on this macbook replaced
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Engineering marvel
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> don't get apple products
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Dont get products
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would never spend my own money on a macbook. This one was free
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only apple product I paid for was an ipad, which I'm extremely happy with. If only other manufacturers could do good tablets
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn found that gitlab supports mermaid but github still doesn't
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what a shame to use github nowadays
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they doesn't seem to care at all
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> about all the cool functionalities that can be implemented
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 pretty good
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> I'm contemplating getting one on Black Friday or not.
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> But sounds like you are tied into Apple ecosystem.
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use an android phone
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only things I have that are apple are my laptop and tablet. Laptop was free and the tablet was literally the only good tablet on the market when I got it :P
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wait
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the s8 is coming soon
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well now they're in competition with samsung
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> samsung does awesome products nowadays
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh they are not very different to apple when it comes to business practices sadly
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My flagship samsung phones die just as quick as my friend iphones. It should be unacceptable for a phone to become basically unusable in 3 years
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a gameboy advance that works exactly as advertised 17 years after buying it. I have a thinkpad laptop that is still performing the same as when I got it 7 years ago except for the battery
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They literally just dont build them like they used to ;(
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sadly that's pretty much made it for
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> as you'll just buy the new phone, for them it's more money
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, they literally want it to die. Planned obsolescence is the saddest thing ever
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my nexus phone still runs
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well some companies doesn't do it
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unfortunately, google stopped providing security updates for the drivers
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean my Galaxy S9 also still "runs". It hangs all the time even after a complete reset it's not back to how I got it
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd be nice if it ran an unmodified linux kernel
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm using it as my main phone, it doesn't hang all the time
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> did anyone try to debian phone
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> forgot the name
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apps have become more memory-hungry though, leading to more app kills by android
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I can't really blame that on the phone manufacturer
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Mobian I think it was
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I absolutely hate this. The apps are massive and they use soooo much memory. Cheap memory was a mistake
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I consider getting this when it gets released:
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/surface/business/surface-laptop-studio
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, usually the problems with things like these, e.g. the fairphone or pinephone is that they usually just perform worse and have very meh hardware
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> true, but at least they're easier to maintain
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The camera in my like 3 year old S9 is still better than the fairphone that came out this year
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like before you just had to remove the back of your phone & the battery
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> anyone could change it easily
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would pay a huge premium for this
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gimme a removable battery, headphone jack and a camera that isnt 144p and I'll pay like a bucketload of money
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll easily pay 850â‚¬
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> u can make a DDPhone
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fairphone's camera surely isn't 144p (I guess it was an exaggeration?)
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, just exaggerated
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well for sure if you search for image quality you'll have to go over leaders
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> even now apple isn't the leader for photography anymore
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Make it a long term support phone with 6 years of performance guarantee and I'll pay 1kâ‚¬
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already have to pay about that much to replace my phone every time samsung pushes an update to fuck me over
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There you go, 128x112 pixels 2bit goodness ðŸ˜„
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/910880686272028722/menu_2.jpeg
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtf lmao
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just needs a baseband module and I'm in
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what's cool is that, it was not a long time ago, we went pretty far, in term of evolution
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Technology got better at an exponential rate
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but still companies has to keep the best
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like nvidia for sure already has the next generation of graphic card after the 4000 series
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they just keep that, for competition also
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's make a clone of play store but with a catch. If your app takes up more than 200M you get whipped. If your app leaks memory you get hit with a bat
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> corporal punishment yay
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As far as I'm aware chip development does indeed have huge lead times, like multiple years at this point. So all companies doing their own chip design are indeed holding back
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check out fdroid. it has some quality apps ðŸ™‚
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @heinrich5991 isn't fdroid the shitty store full of injected apks?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what "injected apks" are
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> infected*
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fdroid is an app store for open-source android applications
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah no it was aptoide I think, you could install something bad on your phone
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Installing apks from unknown sources can always be dangerous
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fdroid isn't exactly unknown
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's why aptoide had a bad reputation
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it even has a wikipedia page
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but people were still using it as some apps were removed from the play store
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wasn't saying fdroid, just in general
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i got an manjaro phone
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@ReiTW)
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> running on the old pine non pro hardware and its very meh coming from iPhone XS
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i mostly rq using it before it manages to connect to the wifi
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> imo ddnet/zcatch should be rewritten on ddnet code base so it has a 0.6/0.7 bridge. Poor zcatch community is very divided
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> go ahead
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea maybe actually ill do after my ddnet-gctf is polished
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can i then hand of maintainance to ddnet? \:D
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2021/11/18/german-state-planning-to-switch-25000-pcs-to-libreoffice/
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Poggers
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess...
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Poggers
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Libreoffice is a little sad :/
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It always worked so badly for me
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> more users means more motivation for devs
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but ye agree libre office is shit but then which office software isnt shit? \:D
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> MS Office works fairly well ngl
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is the only proprietary piece of software that I think is still leagues above their open source alternatives
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And Adobe Premiere + After Effects. Open source video editing is like non-existant
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just make everyone use pandoc + latex, problem solved
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pandoc can even generate word documents and powerpoint presentations directly
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> +1
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, alienating 99% of the current workforce
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I made people at my job use it. They are just filling in normal text, then the server auto-translates it with panoc and latex and they get a presentation back
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> easier than powerpoint templates etc
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah that's a cute idea but isn't your job a tech job, with tech people using this solution? :D
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, only used by C++ developers
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why do c++ devs create slides?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> vim \> word
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> heck i would even prefer notepad visual studio or emacs over word or libreoffice
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because developers also occasionally need to communicate? ðŸ˜„
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats what project managers are for?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In this case it was to create presentations of root cause analyses
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hm
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> good luck making the pm understand and explain the race condition you had in your code and how you'll prevent similar bugs in the future ðŸ˜„
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: so when are you presenting your solution to the german goverment?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> when they invite me
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> stop bully pros iv seen pros that know code -,-
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> #deenforpresident
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> we use onlyoffice integrated to nextcloud at work, it's basic and works fine
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even the fact that a race condition ever needs to be explained to a pm sounds insane to me lol
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> thats enough for us
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is he going to do with this information? :F
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nothing, that's what I meant
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fix the bug
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> filmora with it's library is kinda insane nowadays
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> the only thing it misses out is vector image editing
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> And if you're not happy with it's after effects DaVinci Resolve 17 has one of the best color panels
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> And if you're not happy with it's after effects (or filmora's prizes), DaVinci Resolve 17 has one of the best color panels
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> contribute to it to improve it
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a thing you can't do with m$$
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but blender shows its possible to be in the industry
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> latex best
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> normies can do their simple documents in markdown and render them in beautiful latex generated pdfs
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with pandoc
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blender is indeed the best example of good open source software that can easily compete
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Darktable is also great, if it had an ipad build I could finally get rid of lightroom
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could maybe do one myself actually
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://krita.org/en/
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Krita is for painting, not photo editing :P but it is indeed good
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> linux is also solid competitor to windows. I am sure azure uses linux servers \:D
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly gimp is underrated
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not quite as good as clip studio paint imo, but it works well
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz ppl simply dont want to learn the software
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also teeworlds and ddnet are the best games peroid
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like trying vim for 1 minute and saying it sucks cuz u dont know shit to do
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg i just called ddnet a game -,-
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gimp is also inferior to photoshop imo. They really should take a page out of blenders book and move to industry standard UX
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> gimps ux is fine
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> krita is going places
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blender became much more competitive when they stopped with the weird ass control scheme no 3d modeler ever was used to
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also rly sad saying x is inferior when you don't take into account that it's made by peoples free time, will and effort, and that you don't have to pay for it, plus the 4 stallman freedoms you have
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ppl dont value that
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid humanity
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I mean, business wise it ain't profitable
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not allowed to say something is inferior if it's made by peoples free time?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it triggers me
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> considering what i said
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sorry but I won't sit here and pretend blender 2.3 was better than maya because it's open source and it's mean to the developers
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok maybe i made my point badly, you can say its inferior or whathever, but people usually never have a positive actitude towards these programs even by the fact nobody owes them anything
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i suck at writing
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see. I do appreciate the work put in and that they provide a free alternative, but it won't make me rate the software any differently
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are excellent open source programs out there right now that very easily even outclass their proprietary counterparts. e.g. OBS
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to visit r/StallmanWasRight/ and be sad
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wonder why they will remove it

17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> r/ABoringDystopia is also nice if you want to be annoyed
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> why remove dislikes when you could just have an option to hide them
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> or, if it's similar to what comments have with dislikes, then it ain't a good decision on their part
