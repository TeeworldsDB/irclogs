00:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon please don't convert huge parts of the code (that you aren't touching anyway in some commit) between styles :/
00:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> Oh. Why? ._. I thought you like that
00:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it's okay if you change the style of code you touch
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> or if we will find some solution to do it mechanically, I'd be kinda okay to run it on the code
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> but just changing the style of code generally results in unneeded friction
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> e.g. merge conflicts when you try to apply some kind of patch
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> when you change the code anyway, that's not a big problem, because the actual change would have stopped the patch from applying as well
00:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon I hope you haven't done all that manually, but with a search-and-replace function?
00:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i didn't use a script. But i used strg+f but i didnt spam but Check what Is getting changed
03:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 closed pull request #1003: fixed styling in src/game/server ('if (' -> 'if(') (master...master) https://git.io/vNryl
04:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Goran> We should really have a kill protection command to activate it more quickly. Because i have some dumb friends that press it on accident
05:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <abcqwerty> client side kill protection?
05:05 <+Learath2> a command to make the kill protection start instantly after start maybe
05:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> so you can get veto by giving yourself kill protection?
06:29 <+Learath2> veto != kill protection

08:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @deen why did you revert it?
08:42 <@deen> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=5914&p=61010#p61010
08:42 <@deen> can't finish maps anymore
09:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD> Just remove all maps that rely on any kind of bugs
09:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> I agree with @Tom 
09:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> We shoulnt touch the Core Vanilla physics
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> hUH! ?
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> If bug is long enough in a ecosystem, we can't just remove it.
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It could broke to much things. It could work, if we would have a big amount of testers, to test every map when we change gameplay/physics issues ðŸ˜›
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> "if bug is long enough in a ecosystem, we can't just remove it"
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if it never happens (which is not the case for this bug) then a fix like this would be fine
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> yea, that's why I sent second sentence. To make clear my opinion ðŸ˜„

14:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> this morning i was playing the map triplecan, it contains a triple grenade part which was now much much harder than before. this will also make every other triple on every other map harder. not to mention that you cant properly speedrun those now or that most of these were tested with ddnet servers
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut xxxD
14:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD> Just remove all ranks np
14:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD> And the rocket bug has no influence on normal triple imo
14:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> >"just remove all ranks np"
14:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> >"just delete tw np"
14:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD> "this will also make every other triple on every other map harder. not to mention that you cant properly speedrun those now or that most of these were tested with ddnet servers" well this is simply false, u can do a normal triple just fine and consistently with the right timing. idk how it is with freeze triple or other buggy stuff like this
14:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD> "this will also make every other triple on every other map harder. not to mention that you cant properly speedrun those now or that most of these were tested with ddnet servers"
14:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD>  well this is simply false, u can do a normal triple just fine and consistently with the right timing. idk how it is with freeze triple or other buggy stuff like this
16:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <cinaera> is there a summary of the bug and what the fix is doing?
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=5914
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <cinaera> doesn't contain much relevant information, neither what exactly causes the bug nor how it's fixed
16:56 <@deen> cinaera: sometimes grenade exploded twice
16:56 <@deen> this fixed it by returning after it exploded already
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> `vector2_base operator *(const vector2_base &v) const { return vector2_base(x*v.x, y*v.y); }` is this even mathematically correct?, i think you cannot multiply vectors like that
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> (vmath.h)
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> also is this even used? xD
22:08 <+eeeee> there are a bunch of ways to multiply vectors, this particular one is this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> tthis isn't the dot product
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> dot product results in a scalar
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> it should be like this, more or less: `T operator *(const vector2_base &v) const { return x * v.x + y * v.y; };` if i got the equation right
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> there is also `vector2_base operator /(const vector2_base &v) const { return vector2_base(x/v.x, y/v.y); }` which i also doubt its mathematically right
22:13 <+eeeee> hmm idk then. did you try commenting those out to see if they are actually used anywhere?
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ill try now
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> lol
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> the CEditor uses it
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> well, there is a inline dot function in vmath also
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> but that operator overload doesn't make much sense
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> pointwise multiplication is also sometimes used
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> numpy also does it that way
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> `*` is point-wise there, `@` matrix-multiplication/dot product

22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:20:17] [discord] <Ryozuki> ```
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:20:17] [discord] <Ryozuki> bool operator ==(const vector2_base &v) const { return x == v.x && y == v.y; } //TODO: do this with an eps instead``` what is eps?
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:21:16] [discord] <Savander> why? that * seems good
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:21:54] [discord] <Savander> you can just num * [x, y] = [num*x, num*y]
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:22:13] [discord] <Savander> you can just num * [x, y] = [num * x, num * y]
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:22:22] [discord] <Savander> you can just `num * [x, y] = [num * x, num * y]`
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:22:37] [discord] <Savander> either for division
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:22:50] [discord] <Ryozuki> what u talking about?
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:01] [discord] <Savander> `T operator *(const vector2_base &v) const { return x * v.x + y * v.y; };`
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:05] [discord] <Savander> no i
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:08] [discord] <Ryozuki> thats my version
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:11] [discord] <Ryozuki> dot product
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:12] [discord] <Savander> `vector2_base operator *(const vector2_base &v) const { return vector2_base(x*v.x, y*v.y); } `
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:24] [discord] <Ryozuki> thats not mathematically correct
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:27] [discord] <Savander> why
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:27] [discord] <Savander> ?
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:29] [discord] <Ryozuki> thats what i pointeed out
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:23:48] [discord] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_of_vectors
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:24:00] [discord] <Savander> but you can multiple be single num
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:24:03] [discord] <Savander> also
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:24:11] [discord] <Ryozuki> thats a correct way
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:24:19] [discord] <Ryozuki> but its not vector multiplication
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [22:24:23] [discord] <Ryozuki> its scalar multiplication
22:24 < ***> Playback Complete.
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> it is?
22:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> for me it's perfectly fine. But im not mathematics ;p
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> the eps thing is using a tolerance (\epsilon) instead of exact matching
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I really doubt that product function is actually used as I don't see a hadamard product being useful in anyway in tw ðŸ˜›
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> can you use some terminology that I know? ðŸ˜›
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> the wiki page doesn't say anything about vectors
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> well any vector can be represented as a matrix
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> matrix?
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> that good movie? ðŸ˜®
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> we even called matrixes with one column or one row, column and row vectors respectively
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> just say "point-wise" or "element-wise" multiplication ðŸ˜›
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> SIR YES SIR
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> pointwise multiplication is usually defined for functions btw
