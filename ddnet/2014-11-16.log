15:50 < laxa> deen: I want your opinion on something
15:51 < laxa> Some chilean's guys asked me for a ddnet channel on the TS
15:51 < laxa> I gave them channel admin rights
15:51 < laxa> I am not sure that's a good idea to give them the right
15:51 < laxa> what do you think about that ? :)
15:52 < laxa> it's suppose to be a public channel, not a private one
16:08 <@deen> they can even use your TS?
16:08 <@deen> i assumed their connection to europe would be too bad
16:08 <@deen> which chilean guys?
16:11 < laxa> look TS status on ddnet.tw
16:11 < laxa> busy right now
16:14 <@deen> ok
16:14 <@deen> i don't know them, i wouldn't trust them with pw
16:15 <@deen> FUMOFFU & Ferzak would've been fine, for example
16:15 <@deen> and Pwner
16:15 <@deen> I think these 3 are the most active chileans

17:03 < Maple> so ehh
17:03 < Maple> how does tournament map testing work
17:03 <@deen> you send the map to a great testers
17:03 <@deen> -s
17:04 <@deen> and that tester tests it. if it's fine, the tester tells me about the map, i may take a look as well
17:04 <@deen> then you get the map tested just with the 1 tester, no one else can see it
17:04 < Maple> "great testers"
17:05 <@deen> a ddnet tester you trust

18:43 <@deen> If you were "Gayple" on test server, it was for teleporting people around
18:44 < Maple> i didnt teleport anybody
18:44 < Maple> i swear
18:44 < Maple> i put my name as Gayple because Welf called me that way
18:44 < Maple> why bother, you never cared

21:36 < laxa> server of new solo map
21:36 < laxa> GER:8331
21:37 <@deen> Monsta crashed it
21:37 < laxa> oO ?
21:37 <@deen> the nice guy with bot client
21:37 <@deen> aaaah,
21:37 <@deen> that's the bug i fixed!
21:37 <@deen> but i forgot to reload servers!
21:38 < laxa> will the server crash again ?
21:38 <@deen> yes
21:38 <@deen> i will set autorestart of servers in a few seconds
21:38 <@deen> then all servers will be restarted as soon as they're empty
21:39 <@deen> just look at the server version
21:39 <@deen> 6.2.1 is good
21:41 < laxa> deen: done ?
21:41 <@deen> check for 6.2.1 server version
21:42 < laxa> ok cool nice ty

23:03 <@deen> seems like harmony hosting isn't perfect after all. getting reports of huge packet loss from one hoster =/
23:10 < eeeee> i wonder if ddnet servers should be automatically put in favorites in ddnet client
23:10 < eeeee> in case the ddosers kill the master servers
23:17 <@EastByte> eeeee: there is a ddnet tab in the ddnet client
23:18 <@EastByte> with all ddnet server sorted by country retreived from ddnet versionsrv
23:18 < eeeee> okay then
23:19 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/emscripten/epicrot/
23:19 <@EastByte> epic stuff right? :)
23:21 <@deen> eeeee: also, people wanted to kill me when i made the client search for "ddnet" when you start it for the first time and never had a teeworlds client before
23:21 <@deen> nice, EastByte ^^
23:21 <@deen> EastByte: how do you output, sdl?
23:22 <@EastByte> yea, I use sdl to render my pixelbuffer
23:22 <@deen> meanwhile i have made a huge library work with intel's fucking compiler
23:22 <@EastByte> and the rest is my own graphics stuff
23:22 <@deen> who needs c++11, right?!
23:22 <@EastByte> I don't need it :P
23:28 <@deen> It's really not fun to work around compiler bugs
23:28 <@deen> EastByte: any progress with the accounts?
23:28 <@deen> or lost interest?
23:30 <@EastByte> lost interest and I'm quite busy right now
23:31 <@EastByte> and in the end some things about the accounts weren't clear to me
23:32 <@EastByte> let's do some further discussion about it this week (I guess I'll have some spare time)
23:33 <@deen> sure =)
23:33 <@deen> i still think it's an important step forwards
23:33 <@deen> -s
23:33 < eeeee> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=112472#p112472
23:35 <@EastByte> hmmmmm
23:37 < laxa> finally finished this fucking new 4 stars solo map :x
23:37 <@EastByte> we had so detailed discussions on #teeworlds about possible account systems
23:38 <@EastByte> I wonder what slayer is going to do
23:38 <@EastByte> laxa: gz
23:38 <@EastByte> oh hi WolfAlex
