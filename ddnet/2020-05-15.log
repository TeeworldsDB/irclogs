00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a way to intersect whether there is a specific tile on a line between pos1 and pos2?
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> something like GetMapIndices?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @vNikyu  Indeed there would be some benefits of having thing like `bind <key> +reset_other_tee`, but until someone eventually adds it, you can use `echo` command to have chat -info about whatever you want. Just like I wrote few messages up. And I use it myself same way.
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ```bind <key> "cl_dummy_reset_on_switch <0|1|2>; echo Reset on switch: OFF"```
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And if I remember correctly (didn't check for long time) you can change colour of echo messages in DDNet client settings, so you could make these bright red or whatever
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> better than nothing
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Soreu I have a resetonswitch cfg already, but having to chekc everytime is kinda annoying aswell.

13:10 <+ChillerDragon> omg @Soreu pls stap editing or resending ur messages so hard to read
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> so you want to make your dummy stop hooking or things like that? I use my hammerfly bind for these things but yea its not optimal
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I don't edit messages since I do know it resends whole message to quakenet
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> Well i got some dupsiwoopsis here of ur messages
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would be nice if we could disable edits in this channel, but I don't find any option in settings
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> There's no way to do that, even with 3rd party discord bots. Looked for this kind of solution some time ago
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ChillerDragon: Interesting, because if you look at discord, there's no edits of my messages. Only murpi's that edited his msg once from what I was able to notice ðŸ˜‰
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu on irc your messages are also not duplicated, I think ChillerDragon meant murpi's message.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok nice, setting ddnet to fullscreen bricked my monitor configuration
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> previously it would not resize to the window size
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> guess I'll have to reboot
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I tend to edit my messages alot ðŸ˜„
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It's fine as long as not done on this channel specifically
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea wasnt u @Soreu sry
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^^,
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/controls.cpp#L286 wanna ask what's the point of this option? also shouldn't it be object set to input data like copy moves?
