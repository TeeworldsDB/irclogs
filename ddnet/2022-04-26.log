00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> RISCV revolution when?
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it has already begun for small devices in IOT
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + Linux support
06:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> ```js
06:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora>     true == 'true'     // true
06:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora>     false == 'false';  // false
06:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> ```
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> VVLIW
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> very very long instruction word xd
06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> now this one looks like absolute wtf
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Use Triple equal sign and its fixed

09:36 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 any plans to publish your color refactors to upstream?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://znah.net/hexells/#162
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not particularly fond of the color stuff, that's why I didn't mess with it
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I might try to clean it up
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> "fond"
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> noun
10:17 <+ChillerDragon>     The background of a design in lace.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what about Infinity === (0.1+0.2)/0
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh its true ðŸ˜„
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> so you dont like the colors in ddnet code?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's french for background
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but "fond of" = liking a lot
12:34 < BoopBeepBoop> Someone alive here?
12:36 <+BoopBeepBoop> Anyway, is it normal for someone to use "super" on a server?
12:36 <+BoopBeepBoop> Because I hadn't seen anything like this before.
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> boop beep boop
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on test servers yes, on normal servers there is smth similar you can activate in teams with /practice
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can not use super on normal servers, so I would say it is not normal xD
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> note that u can get infinite jump and ininite hook on some maps
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> many nobos confuse it
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> test
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki u missing the drama #5022

16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks made my comment now
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/968518856198996008/unknown.png
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice contributation
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice contribution
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly stupid
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a dead game holding us back
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tru
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im always annoyed
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a dead game with an unwilling maintainer
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the amount of cruft we can remove
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by breaking protocol
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the gameinfo flags
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> networking is a mess
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should break the protocol, and make it extendable and future proof
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so that future mods dont have to monkey patch
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like we did with teeworlds
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice to know u agree with me :D
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think our saying has 0 value
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdxd
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it has
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tbh everyone knows that vanilla is dead
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the lÃ¶ast release is already like 2 years old
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> before that like 10 years
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oy is simply blocking teeworlds, at some point either the players that care are too old anyway or accept that
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vanilla is basically unmerged robyte solo show xD
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know its pretty common
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for pvp games
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to end up dying and getting only players in race gamemodes
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this happened to quake
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and css
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> csgo is still famous, but bcs it has tournaments etc
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> csgo has surf
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> without that it would probs die too after a while
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah css still has active surf too ðŸ˜„
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well csgo esports is too big
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it wont die for now
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the biggest played game in steam
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most*
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> where is the ping calculated and sent to the server by the client?
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nah people still plays vanilla quake
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but i don't think it's much better than we have
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> quake vanilla = teeworlds vanilla
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> most played quake mod where osp and defrag
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> osp modify game physics but is still pvp while defrag is race mode which also allow osp physics
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> could /showall on by default ? or could it be a server setting somehow to force it
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> cl_run_on_join showall 1
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> ok thats nice thanks
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> but i kinda wanted to force other players too
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can modify the source code to force it i think
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its probs nice to force it on a live server if that was ur plan
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its probs not nice to force it on a live server if that was ur plan
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sv_showall_default
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sv_show_all_default
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sv_show_all_default 1
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Sorah
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> that didnt work
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a server command
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> ye
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> maybe its showall not show_all sec
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nopew
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nope
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> still not working
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what are you trying?
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> to have it as map settings
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you need to set it in rcon
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or via config file
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> connot be set from a map
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> ohh well
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> than it doesnt help me at all
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> thanks anyway
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you need it for, tho?
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean, why do you need others to have it enabled?
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> so you can always see lasers/draggers from far away
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can see them from far away
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as large as your zoom is set
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> showall is only for tees
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> if i zoom out far i see them again but that weird
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> and not really what i want
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> but showall does fix the issue with that laser tho
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay, then you need to give an example situation
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> join ig if you have time
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> There is no way to reset animations when touching a startline. 
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> The sync feature seems to have no visible effect.
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> 
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> Will we bring back the ability to sync animations?
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Soapy Sandwich sync is synced between clients
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know of no good way to sync animations to race time without abrupt changes (like it was before, when it existed)
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I can't figure out why A/UB san is failing on most recent commit, could someone help
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4997>
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```

23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not just asan/ubsan failing
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> hmm true
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you apparently never declare the function `CMenus::RenderTeeSettings` with a `CUIRect` parameter
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *never define
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> but the issue comes from DoToolTip
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> it was working before I added that
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I'm not sure how I used it incorrectly
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh, sorry
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `DoToolTip` is apparently not defined anywhere
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> but it's already being used in RenderSettingsTee fine, only when I use it stuff breaks

23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> is it related to the pID?
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the error says that the linker can't find the definition of the function `DoToolTip`
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> but why?
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I looked into the source code and the problem is exactly what I said
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `CMenus::DoToolTip` is not defined anywhere
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe do a search for `DoToolTip` across the whole code base to understand the problem
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> oh
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> ToolTips got refactored since I made this pr
