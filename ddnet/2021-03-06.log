02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> good video
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> trust me
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/chillavanilla/TeeworldsEconMod/blob/fcd58281e4cc57bbd55f5b52c38802db9a6bf6eb/src/main.py#L20-L63 is this your log parser?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> Could it be implemented that server messages also get a different color in f1 like messages in which u get tagged in?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> would be very nice
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> hey, is there something like a kill/death event in the ddnet client? if so, can anyone tell me what it is called?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> KillCharacter?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> yep, i guess that is it, thank you :D
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> ah nvm, KillCharacter is a server event

23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Cl_Kill is what you're looking for then?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> NETMSG_SV_KILLMSG
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> NETMSGTYPE*, if you want to track all kills on server
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> i guess that will be it, but since i just started with client development i dont know how to track the netmsgtypes
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> easiest would be in killmessages.cpp
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> ah i see, ty
