10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if I output a list of (texture, texture coords, screen coords), then that could theoretically be rendered by a graphics card, right?
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^ (thinking about letting render_map use the graphics card)
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 render to a framebuffer

11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 could you help adding support for F-Client to ddnet server?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont know how to translate extended msgs in the ddnet code
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> if seen.contains(&(deck1, deck2)) {
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     ...
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> }
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> `seens` is of type `HashSet<(VecDeque<i32>,VecDeque<i32>)` Why does this move `deck1` and `deck2`? Any way around this?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> if seen.contains(&(deck1, deck2)) {
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     ...
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> }
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> `seen` is of type `HashSet<(VecDeque<i32>,VecDeque<i32>)` Why does this move `deck1` and `deck2`? Any way around this?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> any way around this:
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let decks = (deck1, deck2);
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if seen.contains(&decks) {
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>   â€¦
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> }
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> this transfers ownership to `decks`?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you can get it back out
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `decks.0`, `decks.1` or `let (deck1, deck2) = decks;`
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Silly :D
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thanks, you've been a huge help in my rust journey @heinrich5991
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could manage it in the tuple the whole time, then you won't have to do that juggling
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome ðŸ™‚
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro soon u will know more than me
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut wdym by translate?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'm not well-versed in 0.7 compatibility code btw)
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mh, well, 0.7 for example uses an extended netmsg for team state, so i have to translate the msgid to the 0.7 msgid in RepackMsg()
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats how I do it in my mod at least but I cant find RepackMsg
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, sounds good
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its generated or so?
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk ^^
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mh
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't worked with that code yet
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think Learath2 and timakro worked with it, but I don't know if they want to answer questions about it
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't think I remember
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wdym by adding support for F-Client to ddnet server? @fokkonaut
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro Learath did a lot things different than in your initial build
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep I read some of his code
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Doubt you could help, but anyways; I am trying to send and receive extended net msgs to and from my 0.7 client
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For example, in ddnet sv_teamstate is a normal net msg
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and in 0.7 i made it a netmsgEx, so now I have to translate it between the versions
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That should happen in CServer::RepackMsg
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I cant find it, and if its generated it will be a problem I think
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah, I was just confused, sounded like you were working on the ddnet server code
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh then you want extended net msgs for 0.7
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And the server doesn't even send them to your client?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Because it's 0.7
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just need to add the if (msgid == 30) msgid = Netmsg_sv_teamstate (but the extended one, to be sent to 0.7 clients)
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> msgid 30 is the normal sv_teamstate in ddnet
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well does it break for vanilla tho.
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think learath did a fix for vanilla 0.7 clients, not sure
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah no
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Someone else did
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I think you need to fix the `RepackMsg` function in server.cpp to also work correctly with extended net messages
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I would use @ddnet7, would that be correct?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, do you want to introduce new messages?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I thought you had an existing one
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Doesnt work without it
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, I do, but I am doing a new update for fclient so i will reset it
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs i fucked up naming before
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ideally you'd use a domain that you contrl
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you don't have any, you could maybe use `@fokkonaut.github.io`
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just thought why not using ddnet7 or so because that would be more general
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And can be used by other clients
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yours can also be used by other clients
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mh
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess if you add it to the ddnet source code, it's also fine to use 7.ddnet.tw or something
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or just ddnet.tw
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay, one last question
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (look into the messages, the first ones I added were @heinrich5991.de ^^)
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (look into the messages, the first ones I added were `@heinrich5991.de` ^^)
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and they're still supported by everyone supporting the protocol
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am adding a cl_explayerflags, because that is sent by my client, it only contains whether my Aimline is on or not right now, but for the future it might get more, so does it need a 7.ddnet.tw or just ddnet.tw?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just use fokkonaut.github.io there I guess
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think ddnet will switch to use playerflags via a different message
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for teamstate I can see that ddnet will switch to it, eventually
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Isn't that already covered by the ddnet protocol? I think there was a feature to display other players aimlines
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro thats not what I need xD my client is 0.7 and in 0.7 the playerflags are clamped, so an unknown playerflag will invalidate the packet
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not possible to add the aim flag there
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sorry, I'm a bit out of touch with the network code, now I finally got what you want. Thought the whole time you wanted to support extended net msgs with your 0.7 client
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wait or do you, ok just forget it xD
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm confused
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am working on ddnet server to support fclient a bit more
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fclient already has ex netmsgs etc
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But communicates only with my server basically
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nouis: it's more confusing now
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw what is stopping vanilla from getting ex messages. did someone veto it already.
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I guess it could be done
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see them vetoing a compatible implementation though
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. because it contains strings like `@heinrich5991.de`
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is your one acts like a identifier currently?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are a couple of messages that I expect everyone implementing the protocol to implement
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah no, they're even `@ddnet.tw`
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sixup currently doesn't have anything extended right?
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `what-is@ddnet.tw`, `it-is@ddnet.tw` and `i-dont-know@ddnet.tw`
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> correct
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFIAK
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if we do it in vanilla i would imagine all extension would be teeworlds.com since they don't have anything else. and ddnet can maybe some how do the same with sixup, since it currently doesn't have any
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's exactly what I fear
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> protocol incompatibility just because there are a couple of strings mentioning ddnet
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which demotivated me to not do a PR against teeworlds
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> why not rename it to teeworlds then?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's an existing network protocol
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> doesn't sixup need seperate extensions from ddnet's
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, not necessarily
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> if we update to 0.7 we might as well break other protocols
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'll just create complexity for vanilla's pride's sake
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not good ðŸ˜¦
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking:
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: but if fok gets sixup extensions if vanilla someday decided to do something similar it will just create more complex stuff i think
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: but if fok gets sixup extensions now, then vanilla someday decided to do something similar it will just create more complex stuff i think
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and the way the race protocol works in vanilla is kinda dirty.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does it work?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> they just appended it and expect them to be moved to proper offset in 0.8 i think?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't know if offset is the right term.
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I understand
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vanilla also need a way to somewhat freely extend their own protocol within major version (like the player name change thing and spectating cursor thing which oy said could be done in 0.7).
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and i think a map vote issue oy said might be good for 0.7 as well
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ex messages kinda does that. we just need a cleaner identifier (maybe)
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for a single entity updating the protocol, simply adding one each time they add a message suffices
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess it'd also be nicer if vnailla had an easy way for mods to add messages
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> right
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think i'm still thinking about mods.
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vanilla can just add stuff if no mods are using those "offsets"
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 fixed cmakelist
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> tough choice
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I still see a cross
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its the clang style
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk about it
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't be merged before it's not fixed
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not dilated xD lol
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
12:12 <@deen> you can run clang-format -i $file
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i think i got it now
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is possible that f-client gets enough 0.7 extensions to the point that ddnet client could just talk 0.7 protocols but still keeping most of the codes.
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ˜†
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> brilliant :kek:
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie mind if I close https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3262 ?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't look like it's getting updated soon
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sure.
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll wait a bit and see how vanilla deal with this. ðŸ‘€
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> `Add w as default bind for dummy hammer - def-` oof
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its good
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I jump on w ðŸ˜„
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The message is wrong, it's on h
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wait isn't w the default jump
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046>
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> space is default jump
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think both were default in ddnet at least
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyway, those defaults would never overwrite your existing settings
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh, so this commit is just regular auto-hammerfly
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I thought that's actual built in deepfly ðŸ˜„
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that one too
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah nice! Did you figure out whats causing the random weapon switch while deepflying or is this still unfixed
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no idea
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i never seen random weapon switch
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i always think it was only on the first shot
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> example here: https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/782951875741483009
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you'd have to manually switch to hammer again to fix it (even if you're already having the hammer out)
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> seems only on first shot
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> probably you had pistol out and after that it just looks like panic
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I never panic
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> let me upload another example
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The original deepfly bind is such a hack I'm not quite sure where to even look to find what went wrong

13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3258

17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh noes, the man who made it impossible to game on linux died
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im so sad
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki Don't be an ass, especially about someone having died
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> directx isnt even the problem
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its more about drm that makes game not run on linux nowadays
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> is the antiping source on github?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/src/game/client/prediction
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is this: 194.67.208.6:8203 a real ddnet server, cuz it's shit af
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> since when u can teleport to players
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ReiTW yes, official. Teleport how?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's a telegun at the end of the race lol
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wth is this shit
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha, intentional addition or just an old tile that got a new meaning?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk, pepe map is not like that by default, and seeing people teleporting everywhere is kinda annoying, idk how rus can play like that, prob cuz there's not much servers for them
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @deen ty

19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well I hope ddnet will  remove that, it's not pepe anymore
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ReiTW yeah, tele gun might be a bad idea, @Å Ã¸Ã¸â„¢ also noticed that you can do weird stuff with it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> its because of cl_dummy_restore_weapon
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This confirms heinrich5991 always saying we have too many options ðŸ˜„
