00:24 < bridge> <sans._.> cheaters suck :owo:
00:24 < bridge> <sans._.> im all for perma bans
00:24 < bridge> <sans._.> simply because we can teach cheaters to fear them instead of being like "yeah ill just wait it out, its only 1 or 2 days"
00:25 < bridge> <sans._.> sadly idfk how to deal with evaders
00:36 < bridge> <louis> perma bans suck
00:37 < bridge> <louis> the average 12 y/o cheater doesn't need a perma
00:37 < bridge> <louis> for severe offenses yeah though
00:38 < bridge> <totar> they can just make a new account
00:38 < bridge> <totar> We don't have hwid bans
01:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we should NOT encourage ban evasion
01:44 < bridge> <totar> I don't think this is radical information
01:45 < bridge> <totar> valve takes the same approach with CS2, you're allowed to play again if you make a new steam account, the punishment is losing everything associated with your old account.
01:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at that point might just make their account content deletion the actual punishment then
01:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's also pretty lame to encourage people to come back under different names
01:47 < bridge> <totar> I don't think we should have policies that are impossible to enforce
01:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but as if you say "the punishment is losing everything", then might as well make that the official stance
01:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but if as you say "the punishment is losing everything", then might as well make that the official stance
01:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> damn my engish brokey
01:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> can't even order correctly words
01:54 < bridge> <totar> If you're perma banned I think it's implied that you've lost your account. 
01:54 < bridge> <totar> 
01:54 < bridge> <totar> The only way to truly prevent ban evasion is to do what osu! does, because they made the entire gamemode from scratch they can basically enforce that all account have a reasonable skill progression history, anyone who doesn't have that gets investigated for ban evasion (mostly for top players).

01:55 < bridge> <totar> they also just auto ban your account if you improve too fast
01:55 < bridge> <totar> new accounts aren't allowed to set top ranks
02:00 < bridge> <teero777> hi sjrc6
02:00 < bridge> <totar> hi
02:00 < bridge> <teero777> gn sjrc6
02:00 < bridge> <totar> gn Teero
02:59 < bridge> <kebscs> Interesting, this would work for ddnet
02:59 < bridge> <kebscs> Even now, but hard to enforce
02:59 < bridge> <totar> it's been suggested
02:59 < bridge> <totar> but admins need to do the work
03:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> guess the idea would be to try to find a formula that expresses most people's growth, and fit that to each player
03:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the shape of the graph is a lot more important than the absolute values since people improve at such different rates
03:07 < bridge> <totar> I think that's over complicating it
03:08 < bridge> <totar> you're never going to get such accurate data for each player that you can confidently compare it to a curve
03:08 < bridge> <totar> also we can't use this anyway because we're not osu, ddrace has already been released for 10 years without finish tracking being tied to accounts
03:19 < bridge> <kebscs> Issue after a pr is a new one
03:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think you're underestimating how much you can get from fudging statistics with educated guesses :P
03:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it doesn't need to be a great model to be a useful model
03:22 < bridge> <totar> no I mean there are already thousands of highly skilled players for whom we have no gameplay history, so you can never accuse someone of ban evading when they could have already gained their skill at any point in the last 10 years
03:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you know they pay people lots for doing bad statistics
03:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they call them data scientists XD
03:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh, I wasn't thinking ban evasion tracking based on skill levels, I was just thinking of detecting cheaters by suspicious finishes
03:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I agree that that's a bit of a probelm
03:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I agree that that's a bit of a problem
03:31 < bridge> <kebscs> Less than 1k points and top10=investigate
03:31 < bridge> <kebscs> ðŸ¤¯
03:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can do a lot more than that
03:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not all cheaters are TASing top ranks
03:33 < bridge> <kebscs> It's definitely better than hiding record channel ðŸ’€
03:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh for sure
03:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's such a shame that all the best anticheat systems are largely security through obscurity
03:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for any simple notion of human-like behaviour you can engineer a system that maximizes human-likeness while also maximizing evil cheatyness
03:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you think you're clever by picking a complex notion of human-likeness, by using machine learning or something, your adversary can simply produce their own system by training it on your system
03:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> release your anticheat for others to make use of and it becomes half useless by the next week
03:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or keep it to yourself and let others either suffer through making their own or simply force them to live without since they don't have the resources to create one
03:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Clearly this is a great justification for SaaS
03:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh how I hate SaaS
03:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and you can still totally use a SaaS to produce a dataset for machine learning or for simply analyzing by hand
03:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Are we truly doomed to fail? Should I go to bed?
03:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The answer to both those questions is yes.
04:00 < bridge> <louis> eeeh idk about this
04:01 < bridge> <louis> im sure classifying human vs bot is much more easy than replicating human behavior
04:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's easier, but it's also much easier for the bot creator to produce training data (assuming we're at the point where we're resorting to machine learning)
04:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or more like, the bot creator doesn't even need training data, they can just use the anticheat as a classifier
04:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> plus the botter has the advantage that they only need to control one or two tees, and they can use a fairly large amount of computing resources for that
04:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> meanwhile the anticheat needs to cheaply classify hundreds of players
04:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> strictly speaking the goal isn't human behavior, it's behavior that passes the anticheat
04:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the anticheat also needs to be fairly lax in order to avoid undeserved punishment
04:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we can do that for ddnet
04:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there is a huge gap in skill level gain due to age i think
04:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its a thing
04:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we just have to wait a couple of years for everyone to transfer
04:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hi tooter
04:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im awake 2 :D
06:04 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s normal time for him ish

11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @totar what is the name of your client?
11:02 < bridge> <totar> it's tater client, or tclient
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono
11:02 < bridge> <totar> ?
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no or
11:02 < bridge> <totar> both are acceptable
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and watafak is TaterClient-ddnet then? xd
11:03 < bridge> <totar> the name I picked when I forked it
11:03 < bridge> <totar> xd
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cleanup ur branding pls
11:03 < bridge> <totar> too late
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:03 < bridge> <totar> scripts are pointed at the url
11:03 < bridge> <totar> :P
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> go create a new org github.com/tater-client/tater-client and drop tclient everywhere
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @totar and what is your name?
11:04 < bridge> <totar> it's Tater
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats totar then
11:05 < bridge> <totar> the avaiable discord username
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and who is sjrc6
11:05 < bridge> <totar> the available discord username
11:05 < bridge> <totar> is your bridge bad and uses "username" instead of "display_name"
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like it
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its good for pining people
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but solly has spaces in his name for example i assume its the display name
11:06 < bridge> <totar> for me it shows "@Tater what is your name" lol
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1743930385.png
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats why you should fix it xd
11:06 < bridge> <totar> you don't get profile pictures?
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bro its irc
11:07 < bridge> <totar> ok
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are no profile pictures
11:07 < bridge> <totar> sry idk which of the 3 bridges you are using
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fair
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok good talk i will also consistently refer to your client as some undefined mess of a branding
11:08 < bridge> <totar> tbh I didn't name my client something more interesting because I didn't plan to make a client. If I knew it would have thousands of users I would have given it a name that wans't my name lol
11:08 < bridge> <totar> I thought I would just give the exe to a few friends
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like tater better than tclient because letter-client is so overused there are duplicates already. For example f-client is that FallenKN client or fokkonauts client who knows
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think having your name in there even with a big user base and contributors is ok
11:09 < bridge> <totar> now people copy me and call their clients {their name} client lol
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it always have been a thing kinda no?
11:10 < bridge> <totar> idk maybe?
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as i said f-client f stands for Fallen or fokko
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chillerbot-ux chiller stands for chiller
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kclient k stands for krisko
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt botox also name a client after him self?
11:11 < bridge> <totar> yeah but they usually don't use the full name like people do with tater client
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a ye
11:12 < bridge> <totar> I mean tbh I'm not unhappy with the name, because it's fun to go ingame sometimes people are like "Tater? like the client?" xdd
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fame
11:12 < bridge> <totar> they don't even know I'm a person tho xd
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i usually get "chiller like the gores mapper? YOUR MAPS SUCK"
11:12 < bridge> <zhn> fallenkn client is old af, no one will use it nowadays anyway. but yeah, that makes client names context-based
11:13 < bridge> <totar> hahaha, I have some nice memories on your maps. but they do suck
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ._.
11:13 < bridge> <zhn> f3 ngl
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cyber bullying
11:13 < bridge> <totar> the suck is part of the fun tho
11:13 < bridge> <zhn> gitgud
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sucking can be fun ;)
11:14 < bridge> <totar> the new maps are perfectly balanced and flawless. the old maps you never know what will happen ahead
11:14 < bridge> <totar> suddenly the worst part you've ever seen in your life
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there might be dragons
11:14 < bridge> <zhn> yk they're like oldschool parts where you fail the worst possible way but its fun to fail like that and not like on any hh map xd
11:14 < bridge> <zhn> just bumping into bottom freeze
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof i regret updating arch.. ddnet launches slower than csgo now
11:17 < bridge> <zhn> gg
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn can you help me ping Cans? is he here?
11:20 < bridge> <teero777> > <ChillerDragon> i usually get "chiller like the gores mapper? YOUR MAPS SUCK"
11:20 < bridge> <teero777> fair
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ._.
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm i would blame some sdl update or something but other sdl games still launch instant
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no idea how to debug this
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can consistently reproduce this backtrace during the black loading screen https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Xj ``libusb_handle_events_timeout_completed`` looks sus
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm i can not reproduce on my laptop???
12:13 < bridge> <zhn> @cansulat
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what issue did you have with your client Cans?
12:47 < bridge> <teero777> new linux-zen is buggy af
12:47 < bridge> <teero777> don't update
12:48 < bridge> <teero777> there is a memory leak somewhere and sometimes kernel threads start but don't stop causing cpu to be at 50% until i restart consistently
12:48 < bridge> <teero777> they appear individually
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> torvalds pls fix
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> man
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> 4gbs on idle?.... almost like windows
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> 4gbs and 50% cpu on idle?.... almost like windows
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Modernizing
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> im downgrading to paper and pencil
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Don't do it
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Don't validate schools which make us do that
14:30 < bridge> <teero777> i hate ddnet...
14:31 < bridge> <teero777> why must the physics be so bad.....
14:31 < bridge> <melon> you shouldnt have started the C rewrite
14:31 < bridge> <melon> your sanity is slowly dropping teeto
14:32 < bridge> <teero777> it's not about this
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> im testing some new ddnet techniques and they are not always possible
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> for example you can climb a 5x1 staircase with max speed with just djs
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> but not for infinite time
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> at some point it breaks and you bump
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> so unsatisying
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> so unsatisfying
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> when did the shutdown times get so slow?
14:39 < bridge> <melon> there is an open issue about it, i dont remember what actually introduced it
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> also is anyone else having the bug where you have to wait endlessly after rendering a demo?
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> the client just sleeps for like 30s
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I told you how to reproduce it
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> what? how
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> i don't know how
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I dunno, look dms

14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao i pinged some dude from red hat to fix my ddnet client issue xd
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> dms xd
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's private msg link
14:41 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> ??? XD
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> poor dude
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what poor dude
14:42 < bridge> <melon> "hey man, can you fix this indie game for me pls ty"
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i spent my entire sunday debugging because of him
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and did u fix it?
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i found multiple fixes and the bad commit
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and is it their fault?
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i found no fix in his repo
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just know that downgrading his package is one of the fixes
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> was the bad commit in their software?
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:43 < bridge> <teero777> i have almost every single time
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok nice
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/vcrhonek/hwdata/commit/fa1ccf4e4944bdb4110025c5c40e4fee8c8de29b
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Always blame others
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes!
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet has no bugs
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet is perfect
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would say poor dude doing open source for free and i am some ass complaining
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but he is red hat so he gets paid
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is launching ddnet not part of his pre release test flow?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat it was hwdata OMG
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> true
14:46 < bridge> <melon> can you take my steps and try to reproduce the exact thing? - because i can then reopen the issue
14:46 < bridge> <melon> select a demo
14:46 < bridge> <melon> render cut to video and set the playback time to 0.1
14:46 < bridge> <melon> pause the demo rendering
14:46 < bridge> <melon> forward a bit
14:46 < bridge> <melon> Close the rendering

14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª my favorite hotfix is this one ``sudo rm /usr/lib/libusb-1.0.so*`` (dont try at home)
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> increases ddnet launch times by 10000x
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> decreases*
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> watafak
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :D 
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i giggled too
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it makes sense
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this red hat dude with his usb id database ddosed libusb
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xDDD
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so if you delete libusb ddnet just says no joystick found and carries on
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you have libusb it gets stuck there
14:48 < bridge> <teero777> I tried it....
14:48 < bridge> <teero777> I am now writing from phone
14:48 < bridge> <melon> me who did rm -rf ~/.c and tab enter, without realizing .config is autotabbed before .cuts
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Delete it on your phone too
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> f @melon 
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> There is .cuts? xd
14:49 < bridge> <melon> glad i'm on nixos so most of my config directory is declaratively in my dotfiles
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 my keyboard kept working :D
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I dont have that
14:49 < bridge> <melon> i created .cuts myself
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> giga chad keyboard does not need libusb
14:50 < bridge> <melon> it were cutstamps of my songs
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> xD
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chiller has a apple keyboard. it's soldered on the soc directly
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bluetooth keybord goat
14:51 < bridge> <chairn> sounds like some floating point shenanigans once again
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> teeworlds far lands when
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i respect your willingness to alpha test my 3 month late debian packages on arch tho chiller.
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Thanks
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I'll not have this issue
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are welcome :) 
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you might not be afected my laptop isnt either it seems hardware dependent

15:05 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks give some chill music, 1min
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1min and chill that is hard
15:06 < bridge> <teero777> i could do this faster by hand
15:07 < bridge> <teero777> also should be instrumental
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i cna send you a sad ost
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWws1VM7iW0
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> this??? XD
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's not chill
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's epyc
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> send link
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://youtu.be/YknzjncfHnY?t=63
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it ends at like 2:14 or smth
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> too much
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> to high quality
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> like relaxing ones
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ??
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> anyway can't help you xd
15:12 < bridge> <melon> https://youtu.be/lr1fTEi9EMA?si=ZurtsOBEH4DVjmIV&t=2217 @teero777 check this timestamp
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> the start is good
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> thx
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> fuck this
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> no music today
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> even if jupstar won't watch
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you need to collect your music from other sources anyway. i already hear my own music anyway :lol:
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> the jump sounds overtone the music anyways xd
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> teeworlds sounds are ASMR anyway
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> https://youtu.be/HKYE1HVRPBw
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> here you go
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> thats what i wanted to show
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> @chairn
15:22 < bridge> <teero777> and due to some dubious floating point behaviour you can't keep the speed forever
15:22 < bridge> <chairn> uh, i don't see anything weird ?
15:22 < bridge> <chairn> where's the red circle when you need it ?
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> well, at some point the speed decreases for 3/4 of the runs because there is no possible solution to keep going at the same speed
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> the speed in the parentheses is the unramped value
15:51 < bridge> <chairn> you cut the footages too soon
15:51 < bridge> <chairn> bottom right start at 75, ends at 63 i think
15:52 < bridge> <chairn> bottom left starts at 36, ends at 36...
15:54 < bridge> <teero777> look at the unramped values....
15:55 < bridge> <teero777> for ddnet 2 please remove the stupid velramp lol, it is pretty useless.
15:57 < bridge> <teero777> bottom left starts at -50 and ends with -43
15:57 < bridge> <teero777> bottom right starts with -111 ends with -64
15:57 < bridge> <teero777> top left 26.8 and ends with 23
15:57 < bridge> <teero777> top right is just walking speed
15:58 < bridge> <teero777> for ddnet 2 please remove the stupid velramp , it is pretty useless. (the pow() in the velramp is also eats 10% of my physics performance)
15:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> `tune velramp_curvature 1` :gigachad:
16:00 < bridge> <teero777> that, but on every map and not changeable
16:24 < bridge> <teero777> i found an approximation for the velramp that does not change physics in my tests :poggers2:
16:24 < bridge> <teero777> cool
18:14 < bridge> <chairn> one day, i'll make fixed point physics
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> with bigints
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 5 billion block wide maps here we come
18:16 < bridge> <chairn> 32 bits already enough
18:16 < bridge> <chairn> 16 bits integer part, 16 bits fractional part
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok more like 5 trillion block wide maps but let's not
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> even with good compression and dynamic streaming of maps that would be a bit hard to pull off
18:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> depends on complexity of course
18:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but not like anyone wants to implement asset streaming if they don't absolutely have to
18:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo macossers which terminal emulator do you use?
18:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :apple:
19:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melon stop afk and start moderating!
19:13 < bridge> <melon> i just died okay let me cry
19:27 < bridge> <teero777> please, and fix all collision functions to not be ass then :DD
19:27 < bridge> <teero777> use DDA
19:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think fun category should start using stars now
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> This has been a dream of mine for years now
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> I am curious how the performance would be, stuff like square roots/trig functions on a fixed point number requires a round trip through floats or a call to a potentially expensive function
20:00 < bridge> <chairn> nah, sqrt might be faster in floating point cuz there are instructions available
20:00 < bridge> <chairn> trig functions on the other hand, and pow, log functions might be faster
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ChillerDragon: Alacritty
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s just a terminal emulator
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> it uses opengl which is cool i guess
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s just sane and simple
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's simple
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't use trig, ez
20:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> alacritty logo is ugly the icon is basically already a dealbreaker
20:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i can not align the window with keybindings i have to use the mouse to position and resize the window????
20:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also it somehow failed to launch bash for me but that was probably a skill issue
20:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Alacritty has been nice for me in at least three tiling window managers so far, so I haven't needed a mouse
20:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> also wdym the logo is fiiine
20:33 < bridge> <melon> you guys see your applications logos?
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> on mac? yes
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> Canâ€™t really turn it off
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> agreed i just donâ€™t care as much
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym? thatâ€™s never the appâ€™s job
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> the window manager does that
20:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not really but I checked just to make sure it wasn't that ugly
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s not good looking
20:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> There is built-in FP hardware for trig but it's bad. The standard implementations use lookup tables and Taylor series. Both of which can be done in fixed. The instruction count shouldn't be too different but since FP instructions take more cycles than int ones it'll probably be faster.
21:06 < bridge> <chairn> they don't use taylor series, taylor series are quite bad and converge very slowly
21:07 < bridge> <chairn> i don't know what exactly they use, but you can look into glibc implementations of math functions
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It's some sort of continuous function between the lookup table
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> idk about the glibc one but I saw chebyshev polynomial approximations for it in a couple places
21:54 < bridge> <teero777> @totar bait?!
21:59 < bridge> <kenai_12> 50$ gift https://steamegifts.cfd/105438941
22:18 < bridge> <teero777> im gone
22:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Hi gone I'm solly
22:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen are there any plans for the 100 open pr situation? its honestly frustrating
22:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Spam the pr you want closed
22:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Alot of them are features which have been on permanent "eh maybe" (same with issues)
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Some are mine
22:46 < bridge> <teero777> all solly fault
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You always think it is ðŸ˜­
22:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Solly (bun bun) i am already spamming which i think is bad but my 8 open prs seem stuck even with spamming
22:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it needs at least one new maintainer imo
22:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Who would you pick
22:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kaffeine
22:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Yeah fair choice
22:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure if he would accept and he is probably not too active either but better than it currently is for sure
22:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also both tater and furo could be maintainer imo
22:54 < bridge> <Teero> If kaffeine is maintainer we are finally going to have minetee?
22:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Minetee?
22:54 < bridge> <Teero> yes
22:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Any new gamemodes should be based of DDNet insta probably
22:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes mintee and infclass support
22:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> And DDNet insta should be merged into DDNet
22:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Echechechechcwhcwhce
22:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Idk how much effort it would be to redo infclass
22:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It doesn't seem like that complex of a gamemode
22:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I don't think maintainers should have to be that active
22:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea me neither
22:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Idk really ABT furo
22:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is goat
22:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> speaking of activity kebscs is also powering a lot of good stuff through
22:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Tater is great but idk how good of a maintainer tater would be , deffo would support it tho xd
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (not saying tater is bad, tater knows alot ABT many things, but compared to caffeine...)
22:58 < furo> Me as maintainer? Sure, I'll insta merge all chiller prs.
22:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like this furo guy
22:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you have my vote
23:00 < bridge> <Teero> who actually has direct access to the servers?
23:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ssh on ddnet servers?
23:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the admins
23:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Roooooobyyyy
23:01 < bridge> <Teero> learath, deen, hein, robyt etc?
23:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye rossbit, lerato, heinrich, deen as far as i know
23:01 < bridge> <Teero> ah ok
23:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think jao was admin at some point to but i somehow assume he never had ssh access
23:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too*
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have ssh but i saw deen deploy a new server live
