00:15 < bridge> <chairn> hmm, which "activity" should i chose ?
00:15 < bridge> <chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330314667028910101/image.png?ex=678d8794&is=678c3614&hm=ca3db644a757b9efe9dee35e10753b1eb1f4802aa6538a97cb16241fbb58f955&
00:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> good question, maybe trace profiler?
00:17 < bridge> <chairn> well, either need root or change some setting to allow access to performance counters
00:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u have no root? xd
00:22 < bridge> <chairn> i prefer to allow access to perf counters
00:30 < bridge> <chairn> well, seems like it crashes even more severely because it crashed the whole computer...
00:30 < bridge> <chairn> sample duration is 2000ns..., i cant find to increase it
00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh yeah maybe trace is not the correct tool
00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but dunno if the shader debuggers or similar can catch crashes
00:32 < bridge> <chairn> seems like no for the moment
00:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao just as you said that my browser crashed
00:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> welcome to 2025
00:35 < bridge> <chairn> looks like something more useful : https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/speed-up-gpu-crash-debugging-with-nvidia-nsight-aftermath/
00:38 < bridge> <chairn> oh god, this requires changing the source code...
00:43 < bridge> <chairn> well, not tonight...
00:59 < bridge> <learath2> Time to attach a kernel debugger ðŸ˜›
01:00 < bridge> <chairn> it was the same behavior as on windows ðŸ˜„
01:01 < bridge> <chairn> sound replaying the same last 2 notes, and mouse moving spuriously, like the kernel is fighting for his life and giving barely enough cpu time to the other apps
01:02 < bridge> <chairn> sounds like an issue with nvidia optimus which is quite classic on laptops
01:06 < bridge> <totar> I don't get device lost or api related crashes in other vulkan games tho only ddnet.
01:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You get device lost in ddnet? I never had it ever I think
01:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> A RL friend had it, and after cleaning his GPU and replug it, it was gone xd
01:52 < bridge> <teero777> I get it sometimes
01:52 < bridge> <teero777> Only when put of vram tho
01:52 < bridge> <teero777> And on bad gpus like my laptop
01:52 < bridge> <teero777> If the game runs for more than 20hrs mostly
01:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah true I saw that on your 20k map
01:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But that really puts your hardware to the limits xd
01:55 < bridge> <teero777> same thing on 10milx13 xd
01:55 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks not if you fix the vulkan backend xd
01:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But that's sad too. Out of vram can be handled cleanly with vk
01:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The fix would be to have only one backend and make the rendering more efficient:deen_star:
01:57 < bridge> <teero777> Does pg support big maps?
01:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What even happens on OgL here,?
01:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's more efficient but there is still room for improvement
01:58 < bridge> <teero777> 3.3 loads but the entities don't exist
01:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah yeah
01:58 < bridge> <teero777> 1.4 works fine but the perf is horrible
01:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But that's also troll.. Just not loading the whole buffer
02:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If patiga would use the thing I sent him which is not using textures, you could probably load 22k maps
02:00 < bridge> <teero777> pls make u128 sized buffers
02:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What is that
02:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U want 128 bit is?
02:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Os
02:01 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks btw is chunking possible with the current mod support?
02:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I'd say yes
02:02 < bridge> <teero777> So we could do minetee with an actual good world? :v
02:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Rendering wise yes. Network harder
02:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If u send all chunk updates to everyone, then yes
03:01 < bridge> <zhn> why nor
03:01 < bridge> <zhn> why not
04:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes all configs and commands are listed in the readme on GitHub

10:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I only had it once after installing an NVIDIA driver update without rebooting afterwards
12:27 < bridge> <murpi> I ran into this error after adding a new display to my system, particularly with my Index when SteamVR started up
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> We should collect all and put them into wiki xd
13:06 < bridge> <Sans> So I'm trying to expand on my experiment from yesterday, and I learned that I can move settings I add to a separate file, the problem is I can't find that file but the greet on start feature still seems to be working
13:06 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330508606868553769/image.png?ex=678e3c33&is=678ceab3&hm=02ae6bd78e240d3a10bb7948d1a87399807ad9156954cb94f3db9cc8282afd77&
13:07 < bridge> <Sans> Shouldn't it be right here?
13:07 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330508847688974367/image.png?ex=678e3c6c&is=678ceaec&hm=734a53dbb75169e2bf9251a9aa953df81659973a023e5580e5c70ecde3f8233e&
13:20 < bridge> <Sans> @tsfreddie let's move here
13:21 < bridge> <Sans> > it'd take more than that lol
13:21 < bridge> <Sans> wdym?
13:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you do need to include the header in the proper places which can be more than a few files. and even then it will just merge with the existsing cfg file
13:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think what you want needs a bit of storage refactor
13:23 < bridge> <Sans> Can't I piggy back off the existing one and just save custom options to that file?
13:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> do you care about saving?
13:23 < bridge> <Sans> yeah
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> Also weirdly enough, my custom option is not saved in the `settings_ddnet.cfg` file
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> and there's no custom file in the config dir
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> so it's saved somewhere, but idk whre
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> so it's saved somewhere, but idk wher
13:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye, that'd be more complicated i think. without modifying how storage works cfgs are consolidated into one file currently i believe. i should double check
13:24 < bridge> <Sans> so it's saved somewhere, but idk where
13:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> my guess is that the game doesn't even know your custom options exists, since my guess is that you haven't included the headers in the right places.
13:25 < bridge> <Sans> the option is there
13:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ah
13:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if you did. default options are not saved anyway. you have to change them
13:25 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330513547880566836/image.png?ex=678e40cd&is=678cef4d&hm=f54dc3398bf77d7279310c0011e3273dafdfaea7621d7293859966e6a6b0edf7&
13:26 < bridge> <Sans> Default is 1
13:26 < bridge> <Sans> and after changing to 0 it's saved
13:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i see
13:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> looks like you've done more than the two screenshots you've sent lol
13:26 < bridge> <Sans> That's the whole weird thing
13:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> do you have a repo
13:26 < bridge> <Sans> https://github.com/Sans3108/ddnet-1/commit/53795cb389b05276178deb2b50197a0f37917814
13:26 < bridge> <Sans> This is the commit
13:27 < bridge> <Sans> I've gone off of @stormaxd's instructions, he's teaching me stuff :3
13:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the way you did it looks like it should save in `settings_ddnet.cfg`
13:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> are you sure it is not there
13:29 < bridge> <Sans> huh
13:29 < bridge> <Sans> it is
13:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
13:29 < bridge> <Sans> I did a search before and it wasnt
13:29 < bridge> <Sans> :what:
13:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> probably just bad timing or something. like you opened it before it saves or you force closed the client so it couldn't save. if you have a debugger on and just stopped the program from the debugger it could just kill it without a chance to save
13:31 < bridge> <Sans> then this part is useless 
13:31 < bridge> <Sans> ```cpp
13:31 < bridge> <Sans> #define CONFIG_FILE_SANS "settings_sans.cfg"
13:31 < bridge> <Sans> ```
13:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yes
13:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if you want to save to a separate file tho. you might need a separate CFGFLAG and check it in the storage code during save.
13:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you added that like as a defintion but you haven't used it anywhere
13:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so it basically didn't even exist
13:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you added that line as a defintion but you haven't used it anywhere
13:32 < bridge> <Sans> let me try that I suppose
13:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> or even simpler just check whether the config starts with `s_`, lots of hacky ways, but you do need to manually do it
13:33 < bridge> <Sans> doing it by flag seems more safe
13:36 < bridge> <Sans> where are the flags checked? I see where they're defined but no mention of them aside from that
13:36 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not sure
13:36 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i can check
13:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> one result. epic
13:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330516388200185917/image.png?ex=678e4372&is=678cf1f2&hm=f3c141741015ba580bc4549b52fb295f8edb849169de76e5d5104c3f32cc6a97&
13:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you could just copy the Save method and add a SaveSans, and call it the same places. with the two method checking different flags
13:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you could just copy the Save method and add a SaveSans, and call it in the same places. with the two method checking different flags
13:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the save code looks very readable as is. good luck
15:54 < bridge> <filoqcus> Why am I getting status code 500 from https://ddnet.org/players/?json2=nickname ?
15:54 < bridge> <filoqcus> :justatest:
15:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Works for me
16:02 < bridge> <filoqcus> When I try to get information from 60 nicknames, ~10 will give status code 500
16:07 < bridge> <chairn> there's probably a rate limit

18:17 < bridge> <APFFF> Where is the Strong/Weak Indicator picture file stored?
18:18 < bridge> <APFFF> nvm found it
20:07 < bridge> <dynamofox> Hi! By chance are there any identifiers added at build time that are later sent to the servers?
20:07 < bridge> <dynamofox> 
20:07 < bridge> <dynamofox> There are some external servers that as soon as I join freeze me and say:
20:07 < bridge> <dynamofox> "chat/server: *** You have been punished for bad client. Get official client from ddnet.org/downloads"
20:08 < bridge> <dynamofox> And the client build I'm using isn't one downloaded from ddnet.org but rather compiled unchanged from source.
20:09 < bridge> <dynamofox> And the Linux client build I'm using isn't the one downloaded from ddnet.org but rather compiled unchanged from source.
20:10 < bridge> <dynamofox> Hi! By chance are there any nondeterministic identifiers added at build time that are later sent to the servers?
20:10 < bridge> <dynamofox> 
20:10 < bridge> <dynamofox> There are some external servers that as soon as I join freeze me and say:
20:10 < bridge> <dynamofox> "chat/server: *** You have been punished for bad client. Get official client from ddnet.org/downloads"
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> I plead the 5th
20:13 < bridge> <louis> i remember stuff like that banning me from noby fng
20:13 < bridge> <louis> i would change one source line recompile and it would detect i wasnt on official ddnet
20:17 < bridge> <louis> also if you wrote crashmeplx in rcon you would get banned too somehow
20:17 < bridge> <louis> lots of quirks
20:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont use a bot
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah external
20:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think ddnet reports its version but idk
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thinksource is 19.0 and current latest 18.9
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe they do some basic shit
20:34 < bridge> <louis> it sends more rhan just client version number
20:35 < bridge> <louis> it sends more than just client version number i think, or maybe modifies the sent version if smth is changed elsewhere
20:39 < bridge> <totar> Yes
21:00 < bridge> <zhn> it sends a lot actually
21:03 < bridge> <dynamofox> Okay, the latest linux build from ddnet.org doesn't get blocked.
21:03 < bridge> <dynamofox> Let me try the latest chaotic-aur build. (the version I tried from there that gets me frozen is 18.8.2)
21:14 < bridge> <dynamofox> Okay, the latest DDNet 18.9 build from the chaotic-aur repo gets blocked as well.
21:14 < bridge> <dynamofox> So it's plausible that there are some servers where the 'anticheat' performs detection based on some whitelisted data from the client, likely tied to a specific build.
21:25 < bridge> <totar> Which server is blocking you?
21:28 < bridge> <dynamofox> TeeFusion 'Ranked' maps, iirc some other non-TF servers are blocking too.
22:37 < bridge> <dynamofox> I have a clue.
22:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> bro has a clue
22:56 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, i've asked if it can be evaded somehow but they said that there's no plan to support anything other than official builds
23:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> @milkeeycat so hot
