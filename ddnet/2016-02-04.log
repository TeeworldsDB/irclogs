18:36 < Gabeee> o/ everyone
18:50 <+o_be_one> \o
18:51 <@deen> hi Gabeee 
18:52 <+o_be_one> Gabeee is a long time r0x.TW moderator
18:54 < Gabeee> (and French)
18:54 < Gabeee> Hey deen, nice to meet you
20:20 < Gabeee> So, deen.
20:20 < Gabeee> o_be_one gave me a quick summary of the ddnet/teeworlds's situation
20:21 < Gabeee> It's sad people's feelings are being prioritized before technical issues
20:25 <@deen> i don't know anything about that^^
20:31 < Gabeee> Well, about the security issues in teeworlds, fixed in ddnet but not fixed upstream
20:32 <@EastByte> huh? ddnet uses the upstream repository directly
20:33 <@EastByte> or are you talking about issues which havn't been added to the official teeworlds repository?
20:33 < Gabeee> that, yeah
20:34 < Gabeee> But some stuff should be fixed in teeworlds
20:34 < Gabeee> And they're only fixed in ddnet
20:34 < Gabeee> (I'm talking about the spoof issue)
20:34 <@EastByte> it's a hack
20:34 <@EastByte> the teeworlds maintainer won't accept such garbage
20:35 <@EastByte> also it's fixed in 0.7
20:36 < Gabeee> Oh, okay
20:40 <@EastByte> But it's generally hard to support the official teeworlds
20:40 <@EastByte> lack of activity
20:41 <@EastByte> and they simply don't care about issues that might be a mod-related issue only
22:16 < Henningstone> They even don't care about anything else concerning vanilla teeworlds for a couple of months now ._.
22:18 <+o_be_one> sure ..
