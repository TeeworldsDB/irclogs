00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually proof of work in this case would probably only hurt ðŸ˜„ It's cheaper to verify the work than it is to do the work, surely, but verifying isn't free, we'd need a very powerful firewall that has a rather large uplink
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I dont think infinite shots are used anywhere but maybe problems with some special tunes and weaponteles?
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> does it work with shooting laser directly into a corner
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> check that case where u shoot sg into a grid of weapon teles with no destination
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i believe it is used in Awayza (solo)
07:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Headshot> leave
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> wow vscode ... isnt the purpose of if_supported to not fail if not supported? xd
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1647159171.png
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how is that vscode's fault tho xd
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> its full vscode fault!
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> have you done a compiler upgrade, tried to delete build dir?
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> just deleted the build dir
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what compiler do you even use, clang?
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> clang
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> whatever the errors are gone in the editor it doesnt compile but idc
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what version
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> who compiles with his editor anyways
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> only lunatics
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you for example
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> no i would never
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i also use vscode variant, and for me it always works
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> only needed a quick poke to get my syntax highlight back on track
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet u use like clang 7
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> i assume it picked up my system clang clang version 13.0.1
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> i use arch BTW
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
09:18 <+ChillerDragon> im just suprised this error could even happen
09:18 <+ChillerDragon> when it looks so failsafe in the cmakelists
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno, maybe they added compability for the flags, but not actually
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sadly cant test with clang 13
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> clang 15 works
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> its probably bill gates him self using electron to spoof clangs user angent
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think its bcs you are vacinated
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> interferrance
09:20 <+ChillerDragon> i lose 10 min everytime i want to ungrey those preprocessor if statements -.-
09:21 <+ChillerDragon> i should just switch to vim
09:21 <+ChillerDragon> no features -> no bugs
09:21 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
09:21 <+ChillerDragon> (end of rant)
09:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also works for me
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then drop support for mysql
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> say we just suport mariadb
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still 331, so many weird issues xd
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> would it be possible to add an optional parameter to `save_replay` so you could define the demo's name? `save_replay [length] [demo name]`
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> suggestion: would it be possible to add an optional parameter to `save_replay` so you could define the demo's name? `save_replay [length] [demo name]`
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just implement it xd
14:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Ez to so for someone with programming skills xD
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no need to have skills
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> search for "save_replay"  see how other commands did it and copy paste xd
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadams> deep hammer
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadams> :cammostripes:
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> would it be possible to add some sort of sorting to the skins? for example after name or after last one added to the folder?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/952632470703067226/unknown.png
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wtf send skin
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/952633318418034771/tuzi_cat_neon.png
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> @lynn
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> tqw
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> tq
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The skins are already sorted by name see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/8ea73b7800121eb7fa13f1d24b3c79da4c3475be/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L476
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> What exactly is the point of sorting them by date? Sounds unintuitive at first, which date should be used then, the last accessed date or the last modified date?
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> with sorting by name i just meant that u could add like a wheel sorting with options like these:
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> - name (a-z)
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> - name (z-a) 
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> - newly added skins
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> - oldest skins
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> i just think its nice to have the skins that u personally downloaded and manually put in the folder on the top of the list
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You could make a toggle between the detail view and the tile/grid view (best with icon). And offer the two filter options (name/date) in the detail view like in the server list.
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> i have not understood ur message since i have 0 knowledge in this area but i appreciate ur effort in trying to help me
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> hmm i dont think we really need a detail/grid toggle. the way the skins are shown are just fine, it's just how it's sorted
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when fix name autocomplete
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> 
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when add fallback skin option
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> poke https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/659
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> @heinrich5991 how the hell did you even notice this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4656
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> hats off to you
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> he noticed it by spectating someone with one jump available jumping
