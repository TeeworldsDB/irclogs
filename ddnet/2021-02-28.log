15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh interestingly i had a locked mouse(if we mean the same) with #3577
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it was bcs when loosing focus the mouse mode was changed, which caused the mouse to be locked for an unknown reason in windows
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> What was the reason you told him to use old mouse, was it some experience?

16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> How can i disable the spam filter?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sv_spamprotection 0 maybe
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> No I mean the option from the client
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If you write smth 2x
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> There is then [2]
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can't I think
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> A time penalty was recommended for using the /swap feature. The two options I see is:
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 1) Creating a variable m_StartTimePenalty by it whenever race time calcs are used e.g. m_StartTime - m_StartTimePenalty 
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 2) Adjusting m_StartTime by the penalty amount. 
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Option 2 is simpler/cleaner but does mean that the start time could be in the negatives should someone swap within the first minute. 
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Thoughts? Any other option I am missing?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any way to do f1 commands thru terminal / console
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <拓真> Here I get a memory leak
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <拓真> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/base/system.c#L167
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis on Linux yes, we have a fifo file for that, so you can write into the file, like `echo shutdown > server.fifo`
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks, will fix
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such obvious leak
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but well nobody looks frequently at the big system.c
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no one tested on Windows I guess
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen ur change doesnt free all branches
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless WriteConsoleW does it
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh it does now
