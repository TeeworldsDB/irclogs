00:01 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> *Pat Pat Pat* it'll be okay
00:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @stormaxd what are you doing?
00:02 < bridge> <-StormAx> old freeze
00:02 < bridge> <-StormAx> when ninja has a katana
00:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> stars?
00:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
00:02 < bridge> <cyberfighter> no the katana
00:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i see
00:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I miss the stars. They were so perfect to time things + whenever I see old teeworlds videos or the trailer on steam it just feels like nostalgia and a whole different game :(
00:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 when ur promised clientside alternative to get them back
00:04 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i dont lol
00:05 < bridge> <-StormAx> its  awful, add old starts is possible only by changing client version to 16010
00:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nah, you can simply render them clientside
00:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the client knows about all the info needed in order to replay the old server behaviour for the stars
00:06 < bridge> <-StormAx> hmmm
00:06 < bridge> <-StormAx> if you know that, where is stars is sending?
00:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wdym?
00:07 < bridge> <-StormAx> some netmsg, so server understand what to set freezebar || stars
00:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/42319546a6d3d98e300405cb11011fcee1332cce/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L2024
00:07 < bridge> <-StormAx> thanks
00:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> np
00:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm just too lazy and busy to do it myself but I really want this as an option back
00:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> clientsided
00:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> good night
00:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> As you can see in the link, the client with new HUD Version will not receive the stars. Simply render them clientside.
00:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> The Info you need is sent via DDNetCharacter snap object.
00:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This info is also used by the client to render the freeze bar.
00:11 < bridge> <-StormAx> Ah
00:11 < bridge> <-StormAx> So i can just sat it as local variable
00:11 < bridge> <-StormAx> Cool
00:12 < bridge> <-StormAx> So i can just set it as local variable
00:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You mean as config option clientside?
00:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
00:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or what?
00:22 < bridge> <-StormAx> exacly what i ment
01:13 < bridge> <-StormAx> huh, i cant see any info i neer
01:14 < bridge> <-StormAx> or i just blind
02:27 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> `GameServer()->ClientsMaskExcludeClientVersionAndHigher(VERSION_DDNET_NEW_HUD)`  excludes clients that have the new hud (16010 or higher)

05:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> I want to use sql for managing my server accounts, can someone give me a direction
05:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> managing accounts with c++ is pain and hard to scale
06:29 < bridge> <Ewan> SQL is very simple in nature and the glue to use it in cpp is really trivial
06:30 < bridge> <Ewan> also already implemented
06:30 < bridge> <Ewan> https://www.w3schools.com/sql/
06:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i fast read it yesterday, how can i combine my existing c++ code with sql ?
06:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> DDNetCharacter has m_FreezeEnd field.
06:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/42319546a6d3d98e300405cb11011fcee1332cce/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1250
06:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> based on that you should be able to recreate the exact logic the server uses
06:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @stormaxd oh, and you also have m_FreezeStart which might be helpful, idk right now
06:50 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Hey everyone, I'm hoping I might be able to get some help here, I couldn't find answers on the internet, however I came across a blog post by @deen  and it led me here. The issue is about small to medium size DDOS attacks on my game server (Valve Source 1 engine game), I'm looking for help to mitigate such attacks. My server is often hit by 50k PPS attacks probably from some "script kiddie", I suppose an entry-level server should in theory be a
07:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I hate this world
07:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 😆
07:09 < bridge> <learath2> I would first of all check why the server is having issues.
07:09 < bridge> <learath2> 
07:09 < bridge> <learath2> First thing to check is if the attacks have enough throughput to saturate your connection. If they do then you are in our situation and there isn't much to do, if you can find a cooperative hoster they might let you have filters upstream, that is the only thing that helps that isn't cost prohibitive. You also use Source 1, so I'm guessing Source networking, the protocol is much more supported than our custom solution, you might have better luck wi
07:11 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Nah they're small attacks, not sure how to check why my server is having issues, I'm fairly new to Linux, but I guess them spamming 50k pps at my game port probably doesn't help
07:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's either CPU overload or network overload
07:15 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Hmm I see, I'll have to look into it, I wonder if I can tell them to ddos me when im testing instead of playing 😂
07:18 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Do you have any suggestions to be able to analyse the situation when the attack occurs (again I'm fairly new to linux so if you could point me in the right direction)
07:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Check `htop` for CPU usage
07:20 < bridge> <__bauxite__> I suppose if it's cpu related I can always pay for a bigger cpu, if network maybe I can do the same?
07:20 < bridge> <learath2> Also another critical thing is whether the kernel is struggling to deliver the 50k pps or whether there is a defect in the game that's struggling to drop the garbage fast enough
07:21 < bridge> <__bauxite__> I'd like to say there's many defects in the game because it's on a 2006 engine version which never got any of the security and other updates
07:21 < bridge> <__bauxite__> But idk for sure
07:22 < bridge> <learath2> Problem is network cost scales exponentially for us. Attack cost scales weakly linearly. So you start needing insane amounts of networking just to handle the occasional attack
07:23 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Yeah i can see why it would be more difficult in your situation, fortunately I only run 1 small server for a game literally nobody plays so I'm not even sure why we're getting ddosed in the first place xd
07:24 < bridge> <learath2> If the game engine is having trouble dropping the packets but not the kernel you can try dropping them in iptables and that should help.
07:24 < bridge> <learath2> 
07:24 < bridge> <learath2> If the kernel is having trouble delivering the packets you'll need to mess around with kernel options, maybe try an xdp filter or upgrade to a better cpu
07:24 < bridge> <learath2> It seems to boil down to kids and psycopaths
07:40 < bridge> <__bauxite__> I guess the first step is constructing a set of iptables rules that seems good, then go from there, unfortunately I have limited knowledge of iptables and documentation doesnt seem great, but i'll keep at it, see what happens. I gotta find some way to gather data during the attack that might be helpful, but idk where to start with that yet.

08:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or there is an opportunity for reflection attacks. And @__bauxite__ is just collateral damage. Or it’s a wider attack and the Hoster is actually the target or something like that. I also find it hard to believe small servers can be targets of ddos. Everything I get some I am saying to my self „I can not be the main target that makes no sense“ :D

08:02 < bridge> <Ewan> morning to the early birds
08:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I personally like using `nload` to look at the amount of traffic but you seem to have those numbers already. Then I can recommend capturing one attack with `tcpdump -w attack.pcap` let that running for a short time during the attack then ctrl+c it. This is something you can then analyse after the fact. Then as fokko pointed out check your cpu usage. If your game server it self has cpu spikes and there is lags in game but your ssh is still smo
08:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s also interesting how you are being attacked. Is your game tcp or udp based? Are the IPs spoofed? Is it just a few IPs? Is it a lot of different IPs? Where are the IPs coming from?
08:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also which port or service is attacked? Is it targeting your game server? Is it doing so with packets that implement the protocol correctly? Can they tell you something about your weak spots? Is it targeting a different port? Could target a website you have running and the game server lagging is just a side effect.
08:22 < bridge> <ReiTW> I'd always block everything using host's provided fw and only allow used ports first
08:22 < bridge> <ReiTW> Then yes you can check what the attack is exactly by analyzing it
08:24 < bridge> <ReiTW> iptables is kinda old and has been replaced by nftables, but if you still use iptables and want to gain a bit of performance you can put your rules in the table mangle, chain PREROUTI'G
08:24 < bridge> <ReiTW> PREROUTING\*
08:27 < bridge> <learath2> Isn't iptables just a frontend for nftables in the kernel nowadays?
08:28 < bridge> <reitw> iptables is the frontend for netfilter
08:29 < bridge> <reitw> nftables is netfilter too afaik, but somehow more optimized
08:29 < bridge> <reitw> from the wiki: `nftables uses mostly the same Netfilter infrastructure as legacy iptables`
08:30 < bridge> <reitw> https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/04/11/benchmarking-nftables
08:30 < bridge> <reitw> kinda old but still p
08:30 < bridge> <reitw> kinda old but still up
08:32 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I'm fairly sure nftables replaced the iptables part of the netfilter
08:33 < bridge> <reitw> afaik the kernel part didn't change much (netfilter), only some changes regarding nftables. But nowadays when you use iptables command you're kinda using nftables
08:34 < bridge> <reitw> if you want to use the good old iptables you have to dpkg-reconfigure & switch to iptables-legacy

08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i unmasked amd64 on llvm and all related to get llvm 17
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> also lld 17
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i dont have lld on path
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> its weird
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have  it today
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i needed a restart
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ❯ which lld
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> /usr/lib/llvm/17/bin/lld
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye im sure it setups symlinks or path in some profile thing
08:39 < bridge> <reitw> @learath2 ah yea well looks like nftables uses a newer kernel infrastructure in which the idea was taken from BPF-like systems
08:39 < bridge> <learath2> Bash caches executable locations
08:40 < bridge> <reitw> inspired*
08:40 < bridge> <learath2> You need to run `hash -someargumentIdontrememberRTFM`
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> what i mean is, it required a login instead of closing and opening term
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:41 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, one thing I don't remember though is if the old iptables stuff still exists in the kernel
08:42 < bridge> <reitw> they do if you switch to the legacy part
08:42 < bridge> <reitw> if not ig old modules are disabled by default
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks did u see tcp getting a 40% increase on perfomance on kernel 6.9 opn epyc processors but not intel?

09:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> do they use tcp?
09:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
10:08 < bridge> <Ewan> so true

10:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i narrow the result of pResult->GetString(0) down to standard characters ?     (abcd....) and (123456...)
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if ddnet has any alphanumeric filter or rly and string filter routine
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I've created a function for that:
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ```c++
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> int str_check_special_chars(const char *pStr)
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> {
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>     while(*pStr)
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>     {
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>         if (!((*pStr >= 'a' && *pStr <= 'z') || (*pStr >= 'A' && *pStr <= 'Z') || (*pStr >= '0' && *pStr <= '9')))
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>             return 0;
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>         pStr++;
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>     }
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut>     return 1;
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> }```
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> you can iterate over it and remove characters that aren't in the ranges of 0x30-0x39,  0x41-0x5A, 0x61-0x7a
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> quick
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if ddnet has any alphanumeric filter or rly any string filter routine
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's from my mod, it simply checks a string for containing only alphanumeric characters. if not, it returns 0
10:13 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> do you just copy my problem to  chatgpt ?
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> im sure std has something very quick and brief for this btw
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ```c++
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> if (str_check_special_chars(aUsername) == 0)
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut>     {
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut>         pSelf->SendChatTarget(pResult->m_ClientID, "Your username can only consist of letters and numbers");
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut>         return;
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut>     }```
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> he makes the f-ddrace mod
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (from my ConRegister)
10:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i gonna use it for registering stuff too
10:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 👍
10:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> imagine asking chtgpt about ddnet codebase lmao
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> std::string in, out;
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> std::copy_if (in.begin(), in.end(), std::back_inserter(out), [](char c) {
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan>   return std::isalnum(c);
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> });
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd probably do smth like that
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> googling failed me in finding a quicker way
10:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Probably works equally as fine
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> da brevity doe
10:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> hm this one just needs its std::isalnum
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I've decided to adapt to ddnet's system.cpp style
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> for wat
10:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> superior of system.c :troll:
10:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i really don't feel like making the account system in c++, can some one give me direction in using sql ?
10:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> indeed
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> what do u need direction for
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> what specifically do u not know how to do
10:19 < bridge> <gerdoe> check out mrpg, there is some mysql based account system
10:19 < bridge> <gerdoe> everything :justatest:
10:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> .
10:21 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i tiered of making same shit in my every program and function
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what u mean
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> that's life
10:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> a cant no more make one of these.
10:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
10:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char abuff[1001];
10:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     str_format(abuff, sizeof(abuff),
10:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> there are strategies that make it so you rarely have to write duplicate code
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> such is life
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> for simple stuff like this you can add an auxiliary buffer higher in scope just for formats & copies, guaranteed that you never access it before setting it, keep a pointer or reference to it, etc
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> so u can just use the same buffer for all ur string formats & copy them where they're needed
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> not "all" but a lot
10:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> :cammo:
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i have never interfaced with sql in ddnet so the implementation details are outside my grasp
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't imagine it's anything difficult
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> you have your string query and you get your results
10:24 < bridge> <learath2> Why not `isalpha`?
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> sift through them
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> and continue the tedium of life
10:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> checkout CScore code in ddney
10:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk, made it a long time ago
10:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet
10:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> afair it has some sql interaction
10:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is mrpg a mod for ddnet ?
10:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> yup
10:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> kurosio refactored it a little™
10:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> so better check ddnet code :kek:
10:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> where is that boy who said to me use sql, guide me

10:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi man
10:56 < bridge> <kekomonter> :justatest:
10:57 < bridge> <kekomonter> I think you can just take from my mode and refactor for your, this will be easiest than my explaining of sql in ddnet code
10:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ok
10:58 < bridge> <kekomonter> And my explaining will be hard to understand cuz my english is so bad xd
10:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> cool
11:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> And my explanation will be hard to understand cuz my english is so bad xd
11:02 < bridge> <reitw> yup
11:06 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I guess I can do that now that I have a bit of time
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if people still care
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
11:15 < bridge> <devinci24> Probably. At least I think I would use it
11:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ❤️
11:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes
11:44 < bridge> <Dreamless> I'd like to see a timer counting it down as a more nerdy option xD
11:45 < bridge> <Dreamless> I'd like to see a timer counting it down as a more nerdy option (like with numbers) xD
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to make folder named "Account" when a server created. where do i need to put this ?
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if(!Storage()->FolderExists("Accounts", IStorage::TYPE_SAVE))
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         Storage()->CreateFolder("Accounts", IStorage::TYPE_SAVE);
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to make folder named "Accounts" when a server created. where do i need to put this ?
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if(!Storage()->FolderExists("Accounts", IStorage::TYPE_SAVE))
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         Storage()->CreateFolder("Accounts", IStorage::TYPE_SAVE);
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Do you know the hierarchy?
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Like, where the server is starting (c++ main function)
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and how everything is initializing from it?
12:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no, i put it in CServer::Init()  but it gave me an segmentation fault at building time
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What does it say?
12:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> just segmentation fault, nothing else
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (my guess: storage is not yet initialized)
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> do you develop in release mode?
12:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> this is the code i use everytime 
12:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
12:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> $ cmake --build ../build && ./../build/DDNet-Server.exe
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit he’s doing it like a barbarian
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ok
12:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why 😂
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> cosmos do it in CStorage ctor
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> or rather after
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> immediately after
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> anyways, fast-forward: I personally create the folder in CGamecontext::OnInit(), but that's up to you where you do it
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> juts make sure the m_pStorage pointer is actually set
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> then it should work
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yah
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> im hungry
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> what to eat
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> same, gonna do lunch break soon
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> no home food and nothing is open
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> ugh
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm at work, gonna grab something from the chicken truck
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> what do u do at work
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> programming
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> websites though, using VueJS
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> frontend and backend
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i should give my website some attention
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> same
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> buttoo lazy
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> admittedly I am slow to pick up on new tech
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> especially pertaining to the web
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's a pain in the ass anyways
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i am using the vanilla stack but I could probably benefit from a css framework
12:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> CSS, supporting different browsers, etc
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> css is fine
12:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> at least we were allowed to drop internet explorer support
12:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz THATS a pain in the ass
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i am so hungry
12:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ok, gtg grab some food
12:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> see you in half an hour
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> how’s food
13:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> was nice
13:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> u still hungry? haha
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i neglected to start cooking until just now
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> got rice
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> and some chicken
13:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> me rn
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t like this kind of chicken…
13:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🐔
13:07 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i will use some of this ground beef instead
13:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i added 1 folder and 2 files to the src directory.
13:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> now it wont compile

13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see on one of the chillerdragon videos, he add something to the cmakelist.txt or something
13:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You need to add the file to cmake ,yes
13:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> otherwise it won't be recognized
13:32 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is CmakeList.txt is auto generated?
13:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no
13:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
13:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> slowdragon
13:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only if your name is vhllerrdragon
13:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude
13:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I in da plane xd
13:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi vhllerrdragon
13:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have a shell script that auto generates cmakelists
13:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fakof xd
13:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> where u flying tho
13:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> bali
13:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> fakof
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye
13:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> have a nice time bro
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 17 Hours no \#developer
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don’t spam too much
13:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dont worry, i'll be here to start some conversations on multiple topics so that you can read everything later and look which is actually interesting and which not
13:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thank me later
13:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude but the Cmake script is so nice. I wonder if anyone would also like it. Idk how to market it better
13:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
13:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> send github link maybe
13:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ChillerDragon/crools/tw\_cmake
13:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Mobile link be like
13:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i cant click
13:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fakof
13:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> where link 🐒
13:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s more of a riddle
13:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/crools/tw_cmake
13:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> not found
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like we will never get the script
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> if you're going to foolishly automate the cmakelists you should just glob the source files
13:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk how he wants to market it better when he 1. doesnt send a link and 2. sends a wrong part of the link
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a riddle...
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude I phone and it riddle
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
13:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ur riddle
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t wanna do /master/-
13:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no need
13:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> do i need to put it there in a way so it get compiled at correct moment? or just put it there (i am not talking about alphabetically order)
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what you mean
13:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its a riddle
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
13:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :thonk:
13:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> me rn
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to put it in the proper category
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> just search an existing file yours is related or near to and add it next to that
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i think the CI will warn you if they are not sorted alphabetically
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but it doesn't actually matter for anything but clarity
13:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> last warning before self destruction
13:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> code will be deleted permanently
13:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ok
13:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok riddle wrong
13:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you dont say
13:41 < bridge> <Ewan> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/928853077593849900/1098329994545082508/F12A3953-F102-4088-BEB1-F68E57F88ECD.gif
13:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok my internet ded nvm I market other time
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> greatest salesman of all time
13:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 📈
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> im liking this shift from new ppl wanting to make bot clients to ppl making server
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> also myr also has balls posting in this channel considering
13:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wait til the serverside bot questions come and they start their own client :kek:
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> macho client or whatever it is called

13:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hard riddle
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> tf is that name
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lib crash
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i know already what it does
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> very, very bad marketing
13:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you need some crash course
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> on marketing
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> true
13:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hit me up if you're interested, 5€/h
13:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> *(that's marketing my friend)*
13:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> meta
13:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :D
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i was hoping to reap the benefits of the msys build environment but apparently it uses newlib libc + some cygwin glue for the posix compatibility layer
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i was hoping to reap the benefits of the msys build environment in another env but apparently it uses newlib libc + some cygwin glue for the posix compatibility layer
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cygwin.com/cgit/newlib-cygwin/tree/winsup/cygwin/poll.cc
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it's quite nasty
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> so i couldn't use the ucrt shell to make anything dependent on e.g. <sys/*.h>
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> or compile for 32 bit
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> but i guess it's fine since the only thing in my setup that i actually need the posix compatibility for is distcc and it doesn't really matter which runtime that uses lol
13:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> now compile like a charm
13:52 < bridge> <Ewan> great
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> fokko are u windows
13:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i generate one of these SKYBLOCK_VALUES_H for my header ?
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> the header guard?
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> `#pragma once` at the top of ur file
13:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> #ifndef SKYBLOCK_VALUES_H
13:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> #define SKYBLOCK_VALUES_H
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> or this, for the very few compilers that don't support `#pragma once`
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> #ifndef SKYBLOCK_VALUES_H 
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> #define SKYBLOCK_VALUES_H
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> 
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> your code
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> 
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> #endif // SKYBLOCK_VALUES_H 
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
13:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me try it
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> do u know what this does
13:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think it wont allow including a header no more than one time
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
13:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is it gonna broke the program if you don't put these on your header ?
14:00 < bridge> <devinci24> It could lead to endless inclusions
14:00 < bridge> <devinci24> like 2 file including eachother endlesslz
14:00 < bridge> <devinci24> like 2 file including eachother endlessly
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> depends
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> No
14:01 < bridge> <devinci24> it could
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it will lead to multiple definition error
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and it will fail to compile
14:01 < bridge> <devinci24> that's another issue
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s the only issue
14:01 < bridge> <devinci24> 🤷‍♂️
14:01 < bridge> <devinci24> Have you already tried it? ^^'
14:02 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
14:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yes I’ve used a header guard?
14:02 < bridge> <devinci24> including 2 .h withouth header guards
14:02 < bridge> <devinci24> once including the other
14:02 < bridge> <devinci24> one including the other
14:02 < bridge> <Ewan> endless inclusions is not relevant
14:02 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s no way for it to happen
14:02 < bridge> <devinci24> what
14:03 < bridge> <Ewan> once it attempts to define symbol when there is already one of the same name, it will unconditionally fail on compilation *
14:03 < bridge> <Ewan> and if there are no symbols to be defined, the header does nothing
14:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how old are you ?
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 18 why :justatest:
14:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> I am 23 and don't know shit
14:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That's not possible anyways
14:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and wouldn't make any sense
14:10 < bridge> <devinci24> wdym
14:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> two files can't include each other
14:10 < bridge> <devinci24> it wouldn't make sense no
14:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> header guard is exactly what ewan said it is for
14:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> header guard is a pretty cool name
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> he protects ur header
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> tho i'd recommend using `#pragma once`
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> brevity
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> does the same exact thing
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, I did, chillerdragon. it's very easy ^^
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdrgon
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm using thunderbird

14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> improper syntax
14:15 < bridge> <devinci24> if that isn't recursive calling idk how to call it
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> #define B 1
14:15 < bridge> <devinci24> That wasn't the point
14:15 < bridge> <devinci24> look at the logs
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> and then once you get an *actual valid definition*
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> then it will fail to compile the second time
14:16 < bridge> <devinci24> again, it's not the point
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it literally is
14:16 < bridge> <devinci24> ...
14:16 < bridge> <devinci24> My point was recursive calling being an issue
14:16 < bridge> <devinci24> and you told me that wasn't possible
14:16 < bridge> <devinci24> well. it is
14:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ?????
14:17 < bridge> <devinci24> but yeah I forgor how c macros were 💀
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> this isn't *doing anything*
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just erroring
14:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's not possible for two headers to include each other
14:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that's my whole statement
14:17 < bridge> <devinci24> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1194993610630893659/image.png?ex=65b25f86&is=659fea86&hm=60bdf07c5c4c41b99a9fd0847c829fd23f8f75ace27e152d7d4936a8936bd146&
14:18 < bridge> <devinci24> it is and it's an issue xD
14:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Issue = not possible
14:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it doesnt make any sense
14:18 < bridge> <devinci24> fokko
14:18 < bridge> <devinci24> please
14:18 < bridge> <devinci24> read the wohle chat
14:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no u
14:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 🍿
14:18 < bridge> <devinci24> .
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's a PR by c0d3d3v that does this, but it also starts laying out the hud pngs differently for some reason: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6724
14:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @devinci24 yes, it does "prevent" recursive includes, but the point is you don't want that behaviour anyways because you can't include two files into each other
14:19 < bridge> <devinci24> Anyways I already wasted enough time on this
14:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> True, you did
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> indeed
14:19 < bridge> <devinci24> yep
14:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 😂
14:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Good soup
14:20 < bridge> <devinci24> I literally said it as an issue... and a use of header guards... idk why I m getting so much shit for it
14:20 < bridge> <devinci24> mb I guess
14:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Because it's not what it's used for
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in headers, you usually only forward-declare. duplicate typedefs and duplicate function forward declarations are fine IIRC, but not duplicate classes/structs?
14:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> because you don't do that anyways
14:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i forgot to expand on my *
14:21 < bridge> <Ewan> but yes
14:21 < bridge> <Ewan> that
14:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @devinci24 the header guard is to make sure each header is only included once
14:22 < bridge> <devinci24> You could want to do it if you have class A that needs Class B and vice-versa.
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> :greenthing:
14:22 < bridge> <devinci24> yy ofc
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> No
14:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Please stop dreaming up the least likely situations
14:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that's not possible, in that case you would simply declare the one class in the other header as following:
14:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> `class CCharacter;`
14:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That way the compiler can resolve that
14:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But you can't include it
14:24 < bridge> <Ewan> Technically it is if only one header forward declares
14:24 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, should I provide a version that doesn’t touch assets and only does the stars thing?
14:24 < bridge> <Ewan> But you will never do this
14:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @mpft we successfully finished step #1 of annoying chillerdragon when he will come back in 17 hours
14:24 < bridge> <Ewan> So true
14:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that would be much appreciated. reorganizing the assets seems like a thing we don't have the energy for
14:25 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 also, do you perhaps have a windows computer you can test the curl-multi patch on? I’m about to push the finished version but can’t test it due to no computer juice
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could even extract it from the PR, not sure
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> computer juice = battery?
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I could go home and test it there
14:25 < bridge> <Ewan> computer is getting cranky. he needs his juice
14:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i need my juice
14:25 < bridge> <Ewan> and some sleep
14:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i stayed up till 6:30 :feelsbadman:
14:26 < bridge> <learath2> The only computer capable of running windows in this house does not have a disk 😄
14:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @devinci24 just fyi we (at least i) werent hating on you
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. I can test it this evening, yes
14:26 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
14:26 < bridge> <devinci24> cap
14:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ok
14:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i can test now lerato but i would need a memo
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> No hdd
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> how are the other ones incapable is more what i was after
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> arm or something?
14:34 < bridge> <learath2> The macbook I’m using does not have any more space for a windows installation. The only other laptop in the house has a broken screen
14:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 it seems it might actually just be the first two commits of said PR? ^^
14:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i make a 
14:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
14:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> abuff[2][100];
14:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
14:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> isn't abuff is a pointer to a pointer ?
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> arrays aren't pointers
14:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but when you make abuff[100]   abuff is a pointer
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's incorrect
14:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> sryy
14:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> C just allows you to use `abuff` the same way as `(&abuff[0])`
14:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i forgot the char 😄
14:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char abuff[100]
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is just some C weirdness
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but `abuff` absolutely isn't a pointer
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (it's called array/pointer decay, I think)
14:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i make a 
14:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
14:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char abuff[2][100];
14:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
14:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> isn't abuff is a pointer to a pointer ?
14:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i fixed it
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, it's an array of arrays
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you should get rid of the "an array is a pointer" intuition
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's wrong
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you declare an array, you don't have a pointer any more than when you declare a normal variable
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```c
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> int a;
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> int b[2];
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
14:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's the new standard thing or i was wrong at the beginning ?
14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> this confusion is mostly due to the thinking that char * and char[] are interchangeable but you definitely should not think about them the same way
14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> most beginners guides will refer to the two in mostly the same way, as a “string”
14:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not a new standard, this has been the case since the very first standard in 1989
14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but one is a pointer and one is an array and this should not be forgo no matter what you are doing!
14:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> :justatest:
14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but one is a pointer and one is an array and this should not be forgotten no matter what you are doing!
14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> you can get in lots of trouble mixing them up
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you get the pointer to `a` by writing `&a`. you can get a pointer to the first element of `b` by writing `b` or by writing `(&b[0])`
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that you can also write `b` instead of `(&b[0])` mostly makes it harder for beginners
14:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you have char[10]
14:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>  char == pointer to it's first element (&char[0])
14:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> right ?
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, when you write the array name `char` (bad example, it's a reserved keyword), then the C compiler turns it into `&char[10]`
14:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i have been wrong my whole life
15:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> give you the address of it's last element ?
15:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> or did you meant &char[0}
15:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, when you write the array name `char` (bad example, it's a reserved keyword), then the C compiler turns it into `&char[0]`
15:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, my mistake
15:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
15:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char abuff[2][100];
15:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
15:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so this is a pointer to a pointer   abuff    ? which is   gonna be   abuff[0][0]  ?
15:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
15:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char abuff[2][100];
15:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
15:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so this is a pointer to a pointer   abuff    ? which is   gonna be   &abuff[0][0]  ?
15:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> or &&   double reference 😂
15:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think I'm wrong
15:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> &abuff[0]
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the problem started from this 
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char **SkyB::GetUserDirPath()
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     IStorage *storage;
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     char abuff[2][100];
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     storage->GetCompletePath(IStorage::TYPE_SAVE, abuff[0], abuff[1], 100);
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     return abuff;
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> }
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> this is wrong
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> char abuff[2][100] is a 2d array of characters
15:11 < bridge> <Ewan> an array holding 2 arrays of 100 in this case
15:11 < bridge> <Ewan> there are no implied pointers in the definition of this 2d array alone
15:13 < bridge> <Ewan> if you only need the path, do aBuff[100] and provide it with a literal input
15:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i have
15:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
15:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> char abuff[10][10][10][100];
15:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
15:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> they are all pointers except the last 100 chars, am i right ?
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> I suppose, In the same way that abuff[10] is a pointer
15:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 100 * all the pointers that you created
15:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and abuff is only a pointer to 10 another pointers ?
15:18 < bridge> <Ewan> this isn’t really how i’d think about it
15:19 < bridge> <Ewan> you are allocating 100,000 bytes
15:20 < bridge> <Ewan> you can take pointers to these elements but since the only named variable here is the array itself, the only pointer you can get from it via shorthand without using the reference operator is abuff itself
15:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it is not to say that abuff in itself is a pointer, because it is an array
15:21 < bridge> <Ewan> but using abuff in any manner which requires a pointer will work because it’s shorthand for &abuff[0]
15:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i return a two dimension char ?
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> There are literally no pointers declared here
15:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no, i need both
15:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't we have 10*10*10 pointers there ?
15:35 < bridge> <learath2> No
15:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't we have 10 * 10 * 10 pointers there ?
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> The label `abuff`, in some situations "decay"s to a poinger to the first element because it's an array
15:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> wdym
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> It's a special situation when `abuff` is used in some expressions. In those situations the array "turns into" a pointer to it's first element
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> There are no pointers declared by `char abuff[10][10]`. You declared 10 arrays of arrays of 10 characters
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> consider a function which takes a char * and you have a char[]. basically every str_ function in ddnet, right?
15:39 < bridge> <learath2> Yet when you pass `abuff` into a function for example, it will "decay"/"turn into" a pointer to it's first element
15:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i don't get this, how they are not pointers, you say they are all char's ?
15:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> they must be array of 10 pointer's which they each gonna point to another array of 10 pointers
15:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> anything except this is not making sense
15:44 < bridge> <Ewan> you are basically doing abuff[100000] and all of the extra [] are just doing a bit of handy math to put you at the right index
15:44 < bridge> <Ewan> and in some situations abuff is contextual equivalent to &abuff[0]
15:44 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s all
15:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and in some situations abuff is contextually equivalent to &abuff[0]
15:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and what type they storing ? a char ?
15:46 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
15:46 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn’t really matter the type
15:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me go to the c++ community, i can't sleep tonight
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> probably don’t
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> return char * and know what it really is on the receiving end or create a custom type
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> but it’s a little unusual
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i also think you’re misunderstanding IStorage::GetCompletePath
15:53 < bridge> <Ewan> the first string, pDir is the path name to get (e.g. “skins”) and the second, pBuffer is the output buffer to plop the complete path into (e.g. C:\Users\ewan\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\skins)
15:54 < bridge> <Ewan> trivial functions and stuff in the libc will specify input/output by name but you can usually tell by whether or not the argument is marked as const
15:54 < bridge> <Ewan> const char * has to be input
15:54 < bridge> <Ewan> char * is usually output unless the author forgot to make it const which happens sometimes
15:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i can't stand this, i was wrong so many years
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s alright
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> when you are new to programming you constantly look back and see how bad your code was just a short time ago
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it just means you’re learning
15:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> this is good
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> learning W
16:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i can't access it directly
16:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
16:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```bash
16:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> error: cannot call member function 'virtual void IStorage::GetCompletePath(int, const char*, char*, unsigned int)' witho
16:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ut object
16:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> nono
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> still call it with your IStorage * instance
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> just use the arguments correctly
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> it is not static
16:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if it was static i could call it directly without object ?
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
16:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> wow
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> but it can’t access any members or non static methods
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s basically a normal function
16:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you man
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> np
16:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> today i did not cod that much but i leaned a lot
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> :poggers2:
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> learning is awesome
16:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why you can't get screenshots with windows tools on ddnet ?
16:20 < bridge> <Ewan> you can
16:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i remember it wasn't the problem before
16:20 < bridge> <Ewan> if you’re in fullscreen then you have to tab in or do it twice
16:21 < bridge> <Ewan> since its a fullscreen window it doesn’t interact with dwm/the shell at all except for the thumbnail
16:21 < bridge> <Ewan> and since the screenshot apis work through dwm it can’t do it properly
16:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i assume it asks for the thumbnail but not before already taking the screenshot
16:22 < bridge> <Ewan> u can look it up in feedback hub there’s probably something about it there
16:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's strange, now i can screenshots
16:22 < bridge> <Ewan> you can use desktop fullscreen and it’ll be mostly the same minus a few extra steps for inputs to get to the game & frames to get to the screen
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> but screenshots should work
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i have to sleep
16:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> gn
16:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but screenshots with shareX is weird,
16:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's been 7 hours and packages are still emerging 😬

18:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i remove 
18:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet

18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> HI
18:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is happening ? 🙂
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i felt it
18:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i tried #pragma once
18:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no luck
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is this 100% the whole file?
18:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes and there is another file: values.cpp
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why do you use namespace
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but then non static variables
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe u meant extern int?
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs what you do there makes no sense in my brain
18:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's more organised in my opinion
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am surprised cpp even allows this
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i cannot imagine any case where this ever makes sense
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well ok
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cpp doesnt know about headers
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it's basically just a global variable
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use extern int
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it works
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> define the int then in ANY cpp file
18:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> actually this is the first time i using namespace in my life
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can do the exact same using a class
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just add public
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> classes kind of are name spaces too xd
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but inside a class u'd need a static function
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it's a class function that works without a object
18:33 < bridge> <kekomonter> You can just create component system like in client, but in server, and create class like CAuth. Or create class CSkyB, add hooks for main game events, add m_SkyB in CGameContext and  call hooks from CSkyB
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mamad_melanin #1 never use global variables
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #2 don't listen to ppl with dark green name tags that say otherwise
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #3 don't use globals
18:35 < bridge> <kekomonter> xd
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> global variables are the origin of all evilness
18:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why did you mentioned ddnet 5 times ?
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you know the famous quote from Einstein?
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Don't use global variables, bro, trust me"
18:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> oh yes
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno. that was my entry song for today
18:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see it from another Einstein tho
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am twostone
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and jao is too stoned
18:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but why it's not allowing me to do it, it's in a namespace
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs that's not how it works
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for ever global variable, it will create a symbol
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and if u do that in a header without extern, it will create many global variables
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then it cannot say which one you meant
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imagine header includes literally as text replacements
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then imagine all cpp files that include this header have this global variable
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when linking u have the same global var many times
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can't explain it better
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask chatgpt 😏
18:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i get it now
19:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the image i used for my passwords database just got deleted after being on the same place in internet for focking 3 years
19:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :pepeW:
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> post it here
19:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no nsfw here 😬
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
19:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it will get compressed by discord anyways
22:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> Does anyone know how those player information of 0.7 Teeworlds servers are done by the ddnet master server?
22:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> it seems like spectating players are shown as is_player=true while ingame players are shown as is_player=false
22:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> on 0.7
22:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> shouldn't it be the other way around?
