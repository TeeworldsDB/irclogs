15:54 < Learath2> deen: uhm do you have some time to hold me hand? :P
19:24 <@deen> Learath2: sup?
21:53 < Learath2> deen: http://paste.pr0.tips/Hq there are some things im not pleased with in terms of syntax
21:54 < Learath2> maybe you could show me some better ways
22:01 < Learath2> the generate family of functions, createXFile  family look like they could be simplified with maybe some kind of macro, L160 and L166 also bother me
22:02 < Learath2> i was reworking it to fixed sized arrays but Araq seemed adamant that string is just fine to represent binary data
22:03 <@deen> haha, ok
22:03 <@deen> just don't pass it to echo and other C functions?
22:03 < Learath2> exactly what im doing
22:04 < Learath2> well i do pass it to C functions
22:04 <@deen> Learath2: ok, just don't pass it to C functions which expect \0 terminated strings
22:04 < Learath2> is that dangerous?
22:04 <@deen> nah
22:04 < Learath2> i think the crypto family all expect fixed size so it works out
22:04 <@deen> have the full source?
22:04 <@deen> cannot open 'sha256' I get
22:05 < Learath2> http://paste.pr0.tips/wO forgot that one
22:05 < Learath2> i hacked that together quickly
22:06 <@deen> oh, i need to bootstrap nim again^^
22:18 <@deen> Learath2: like this? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/70183649061c953881f6d7023235791f
22:18 <@deen> oh, i forgot to log into github
22:19 <@deen> correct: https://gist.github.com/def-/52fca91b0e0158f1b26920b822ec3815
22:20 <@deen> not sure what your problems were with 160 & 166, just made the param names explicit
22:20 <@deen> and the template looks rather simple
22:21 < Learath2> oh that looks much better
22:21 < Learath2> 158 is still meh, its b/c the resulting cert is of type msg & sign(msg)
22:21 <@deen> I don't know why you use result[0] instead of result.foobar
22:22 < Learath2> deen: the line looked too long like that :P
22:22 <@deen> then split up the line
22:22 <@deen> it makes no sense having to look up which index corresponds to which tuple entry
22:23 <@deen> signature = raw[65..128] #32 byte  ED25519 Signature
22:23 <@deen> that's 64 bytes, not 32
22:34 < Learath2> its the comment thats wrong
22:35 <@deen> that's why you use static sized arrays instead of comments
22:35 <@deen> then the compiler would warn you instead of me
