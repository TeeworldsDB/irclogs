00:13 <+Learath2> The safe way to handle new messages on 0.7 would be to port over heinrich5991's extended-protocol patch
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> broadcast is available clientside in 0.7, thats why i tried to implement it serverside.
12:29 <+Learath2> who killed the 0.6 masters?
12:50 <@heinrich5991> huh
12:50 <@heinrich5991> actually doesn't work for me
12:51 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: I see one singular server
12:51 <@heinrich5991> I see none
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> getting 0 game servers either
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> I'm not even getting a response from them to be exact
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> ```DEBUG:root:generated server token: b'\x06'
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> DEBUG:root:sending packet (b'xe%\x13\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xffgie3\x06') to 31.186.251.128:8300

13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> I was seeing 1 Zcatch server but it doesnt even pop up anymore
13:06 <+breton> oh, so i am not the only one
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Nope
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @DaRealFreak do you see count responses from the masters?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> Only got one all other servers didn't respond within 2 seconds
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @DaRealFreak from master2 presumably?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (me too)
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 62.210.136.156 can't check which one it is rn
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, master2
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so what happened
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?

14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - teecloud is dead (since the same time as the master servers have problems so I listing it too)
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - master servers aren't sending any responses(master1, master3, master4)
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - master2 is sending only a count response, nothing else
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - teecloud is dead (since the same time as the master servers have problems so I'm listing it too)
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - master servers aren't sending any responses(master1, master3, master4)
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> - master2 is sending only a count response, nothing else
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hmmm
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> masters are being dos'ed
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> but isn't it strange that master2 is still returning the count response but not the list response?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just broken right now
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhpas different filtering on dos
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @DaRealFreak maybe because teecloud is hosting one of the master servers? :)
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 masters dont require much respurces right?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can run a new one if needed
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> what about moving the master server protocol to http and taking cloudflare as a ddos protection layer
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> you also could add new or remove masterservers while not forcing to update the teeworlds client
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> + cloudflare could show a saved response of the website if all masterserver go down
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> + it'd allow to have the servers on multiple countries, which'd take the nearest one whereby the response time would decrease
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> + the advantages which http has
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> + the advantages of http
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> + i could help with writing the master server if you want to stick to php
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is already working on it
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably in rust I'd assume
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yeah that's a great idea
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Marcel the advantage isn't rly about http, but tcp directly
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> with a simple firewall you could ask him to block all packets that aren't already established
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> & ❤ lava lamp wall ❤
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> haha yes lava lamp ❤ i love the idea to generate randomness
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> yea i did not want to go into detail
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://i.imgur.com/UP4kDkg.png
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 0.7 still works though xD
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where can i define a var like POWERUP_WEAPON?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where can i define a var like ´POWERUP_WEAPON´?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where can i define a var like ´POWERUP_WEAPON´
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where can i define a var like `POWERUP_WEAPON`?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> everywhere
21:58 <+breton> so... any idea when the master servers go up? Are they still being ddosed?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Will ddnet Update to 0.7?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> somehow i want it :D
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but the menus would need a rework i think xd they are so messy imo
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what do you think? will we have ddnet in 0.7? (client+server)
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teemine> Probably but its gonna take a long time xD
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye xd
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But i think we just have to go with the time. Staying on older versions is dumb too; No new players, maybe unsupported sooner or later...
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But: Porting such a big project like ddnet to a new tw version will be take its time xd
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 is it possible to add a CNetMsg without editing the hash for the server? Because then we could add Broadcast again (its still in the client code)
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> the hash for the srv? @fokkonaut
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the hash that you find in the `generated` folder
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> well didn't look at this part
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if it is not the same as the client hash you cant join the server
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ah ok ik what you mean
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it will change if you edit network.py
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it will change if you edit `network.py`
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We need to decide on it first
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After that it'll take some time but its doable
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Greyfox did the last major update and ddrace was much simpler then ddnet
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'll be so much pain
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait, ddrace is already on 0.7?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know its a long way till we actually have 0.7 ddnet, but im just wondering, will you add /whisper for everyone who is used to it or will you only allow the whisper system in vanilla,m
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know its a long way till we actually have 0.7 ddnet, but im just wondering, will you add /whisper for everyone who is used to it or will you only allow the whisper system in vanilla?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you are typing a message, you can auto complete using tab, but can you also go a step back using Shift+tab?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> why would it be not allowed for others
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean the system from vanilla 0.7
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they have their own clientside whisper
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean client and serverside, but its not a chat command there
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ah
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> well didn't look at all the changes
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> back to the tab question: if youre using the whisper, you have to select a player using tab (like in chat autocomplete), i think we would need a picker like rshift in spectator mode. because imagine whisper to a person on a full server and you need to find him Just by rotating through the Players with tab xd
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i should probably write these suggestions when we actually at the point we have ddnet in 0.7 xD
