07:17 < Forzed> wena xoro!
13:56 < Chained__> hey i have a question. How and who determines the value of a map ? (the points earned on completion)
14:01 <@deen> Chained: that's not value, it's difficulty
14:02 <@deen> and it's determined by the map testers: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewforum.php?f=9
14:10 < Chained> ah ok
15:13 < Chained> whats tsin ? i've read about this in relation to skynet compilation
15:21 < fstd> tsin is a funny little machine that produces high amounts of range and anger for very little inputs of trollage
15:21 < fstd> rage, even
18:20 < One_> Hello
18:21 < One_> Can someone explain to me what command I have to type to only build the server from source? Because "bam all" obviously builds everything, I only need the server
18:21 < Henningstone> bam server_release
18:23 < One_> thanks
18:23 < One_> does bam server_debug also work?
18:23 < Henningstone> you're welcome
18:23 < Henningstone> yes it does
18:23 < Henningstone> if you need debug symbols
18:25 < One_> thanks
18:49 < hi_leute_gll> amnyone here?
18:55 < hi_leute_gll> hail the active admins
19:36 < Chained> @fstd how is this connected to skynet maps ?
19:37 < fstd> Chained: it's not, i just answered the question "what's tsin?"
19:39 < Chained> stop confusing me
19:40 < Chained> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=1031
19:40 < Chained> i don't get this tsin thing :D
19:40 < fstd> tsin is a guy, okay?
19:40 <@deen> Chained: Tsin is a person, he made this map collection
19:41 <@deen> and he was main admin of the DDmaX server
19:43 < Chained> and he did what so that ddnet excludes this map ?
19:43 <@deen> he said he did not want that map released on DDNet
19:43 < Chained> skynet was mapped by noother, so what ?
19:43 <@deen> because it was exclusively for DDmaX
19:43 < Chained> seems retarded to me
19:43 <@deen> well, Tsin made the compilation
19:44 <@deen> also, after DDmaX stopped existing, a few months later we added all DDmaX maps, including that one
19:44 < Chained> but the colors are wrong, red tiles were much better :/
19:44 < Chained> why the remapping ?
19:45 <@deen> no idea
19:48 < Chained> oh i got this wrong: szyker made the skynet maps and Noother made the skynet compilation
19:48 < Chained> so thats why I'm asking, bc tsin just did the recoloring
20:11 < fstd> if recoloring existing maps transfers the copyright to tsin, you could recolor again to obtain the copyright by the same mechanism
20:19 < Chained> the nonsense is completed 
20:19 < Chained> just don't use tsins recolored maps, he can't complain and done
21:06 < Chained> ddnet ZAF has a load > 6
21:06 < Chained> since i don't think it's hexacore someone should take a look 
21:10 < fstd> sure, what's the root pw?
21:16 < Chained> isdyj3y4sUtEeK
21:22 < fstd> there's not even an sshd answering port 22!
21:25 <@EastByte> right, and it's also not the root password
21:25 <@EastByte> fstd: I think you just got trolled back
21:26 < fstd> i think you overestimate my willingness to believe in being given the correct root password on IRC
21:29 <@EastByte> why did you check the ssh port then?
21:30 < fstd> because it can't hurt to try.  i didn't entirely discard the possibility
21:31 < Chained> the ssh port is obviously moved due to security reasons. it's on 23
21:32 < fstd> but what would you run telnetd on, then?
21:35 < Chained> 22, attackers will get too confused to continue
21:39 < fstd> but there was nothing behind 22!
21:40 < Chained> uuuh, quantum computing !
21:55 <@deen> Chained: yeah, high load on ZAF because of too much hard disk load
