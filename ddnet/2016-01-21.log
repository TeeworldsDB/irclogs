01:30 <+Nimda> [Dice Game] Rules: Be the first to get 50 or more points on your permanent score by rolling as many dice as you want one at a time. If you roll 1-5, the points get added to your temporary score. If you roll a 6 you lose all points on your temporary score. You
01:30 <+Nimda> can stand any time, which adds your temporary score to your permanent score and your opponent gets the turn. If a player gets 50 or more points and stands, the other players have still one chance and can roll dice, trying to beat the score.

10:19 < IcyFoxy> Hello world. I'm *slowly* starting to create a mod with ddnet as the core/base. And I really don't see why damage was entirely replaced with freeze and that hearts cause damage by this definition as they.. freeze.  Also, why is the ddrace effectively hardcoded in ? It should be a normal gamemode that the server should be able to switch between like normal.
10:21 <@EastByte> that's a remnant of the previous ddrace mod
10:21 < IcyFoxy> If there is interest, I'll send in patches.
10:22 < IcyFoxy> EastByte: Ah, so no need in the current state of things?
10:22 <@EastByte> it's needed for the support of old maps
10:22 <@EastByte> also ddrace/ddnet is a bit too complex to keep it seperated from other mods
10:22 <@EastByte> teeworlds lacks of such modding capabilities
10:23 <@EastByte> (I'm talking about its simple mod api)
10:23 < IcyFoxy> Actually teeworlds isn't that bad for modding... You just need to guard things as per the gamemode.
10:24 < IcyFoxy> But yes, the limited API should be extended.
10:25 <@EastByte> actually there was a complete rewrite of ddrace planned since it's pretty messy, that didn't happen in the end
10:26 < IcyFoxy> Oh?
10:26 < IcyFoxy> Was there progress or?
10:26 <@EastByte> not that I know
10:27  * IcyFoxy is still reviving code and yet .. damage *still* isn't being done o.o
10:28 < IcyFoxy> Who ever nuked the damage.... Was very redundant XD
10:31 < IcyFoxy> I was wrong, I am doing damage.
10:31 < IcyFoxy> Hammer works, gun nope lol
10:36  * IcyFoxy afk - taking a break :P
12:18 <+Learath2> IcyFoxy: well damage is just commented out on src/game/server/entities/character.cpp
12:18 <+Learath2> function is TakeDamage
12:26 <+Learath2> IcyFoxy: check CProjectile::Tick() thats where we removed the damage for all projectiles
12:29 <+Learath2> https://github.com/Speedy-Consoles/teeworlds Zeta was working on the rewrite of ddrace he got quite far
12:29 <+Learath2> breaks vanilla compat and instead was going to rely on a translation proxy iirc
12:36 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: I already got those. Currently looking for the shotgun -> laser code and comparing against teeworlds.com' source.
12:36 < IcyFoxy> As for the rewrite link... Thanks!
12:37 <+Learath2> what are you looking for ? the damage code for laser and sg ?
12:37 < IcyFoxy> I've actually ben contemplating to re-write it all in Rust.
12:37 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: Right now, what makes the shotgun have lasers instead of.. many bullets.
12:38 <+Learath2> character.cpp:L512
12:39 <+Learath2> well you prolly modified the file so its somewhere in CCharacter::FireWeapon()
12:40 < IcyFoxy> Yea
12:41 < IcyFoxy> Most annoying thing though is... Freeze vs Damage :P
12:41 < IcyFoxy> I'll fix later, but I do want to actually keep the ability to freeze.
12:41 <+Learath2> i think that was btd's creation :P
12:44 < IcyFoxy> btd?
12:44  * IcyFoxy afk shortly
12:44 < IcyFoxy> Thanks for the shotgun btw, workd. Now it's just tiny lol
12:44 <+Learath2> forgot way before ddnet he did most of the first rewrite of ddrace with greyfox
12:49 <+Learath2> im watching a movie give me a hilite if you want to know anything else
13:17 < IcyFoxy> Learath2: Thanks. Maybe not right now, but I'll likely have more questions. Would you be interested in assisting me in normalising ddnet's code such that I can work on my mod - which for the record is a leveling system like n-lvl and intend to give it a number of gametypes that people can level up in. This includes a DDrace where a player must already have certain weapon skills and a partner with the other 
13:17 < IcyFoxy> appropriate skills to play. - or at least that's the idea.
13:17 < IcyFoxy> ?
13:55 <+Learath2> you'd have better luck modifying all the mods adding leveling capabilities and hooking them up to a shared db
13:55 <+Learath2> teeworlds gametypes arent cute at all :P
13:56 < Stitch626> IcyFoxy: History: ddrace was created by MoxNebula in 2009, reworked by 3da in 2010, then by GreYFoX, July 2010 grey begun recoding of ddrace with trunk code, and a new gamelayer system (ddnet actual uses it) - and now i have a big hole in my history :/
13:56 <+Learath2> and if you are going to try normalize ddrace code you'd have better luck writing your own :P
13:57 < Stitch626> would agree Learath2 ^^
13:57 <+Learath2> 2010 grey began recoding ddrace with huge help from btd
13:58 < Stitch626> yeah
14:00 <+Learath2> around 2013 grey left to get a real life and left the project to i guess me and heinrich5991
14:01 < Stitch626> yeah, grey works on google i remember
14:01 <+Learath2> we decided to rewrite it and zeta started a rewrite in 2014 and he did finish it mostly but we never ended up using it
14:02 < yasin_killer> hi alls
14:02 <+Learath2> somewhen along the way while i was away ddnet launched which was built on ddrace
14:02 < yasin_killer> :)
14:02 < yasin_killer> hi all hey?!?!
14:02 <+Learath2> i believe now we have ddrace.info pointing to ddnet :P
14:02 <+Learath2> thats about it 
14:03 <+Learath2> o/ 
14:03 < yasin_killer> where are you from?
14:03 < yasin_killer> ?
14:03 < yasin_killer> hey :| im iranian and pro player in the teeworlds "|
14:03 < yasin_killer> :|
14:03 < Stitch626> i still don't like ddnet. but i'm on this channel because there are sometimes interesting things
14:04 <+Learath2> what dont you like about ddnet ?
14:04 < Stitch626> all.
14:04 <+Learath2> thats cute
14:04 <+Learath2> it was weird for me at first too the jetpacks and stuff but you get used to them
14:05 < Stitch626> i don't like the monopilic place on tw, and the code.. but thats still not all i think
14:06 <+Learath2> well being a monopoly doesnt give them any adventage
14:06 < Stitch626> maybe, but it destroyed DDRace in any ways because there are not rly much alternative server
14:06 <+Learath2> everyone is free to launch servers and have their own rules on them its up to the players to play on which server they want
14:07 < Stitch626> sure, but ddrace have too much servers, so there is no need for alternate servers i think
14:07 <+Learath2> noone is forcing people to play on ddnet servers so im not sure if this can even be called a monopoly
14:08 <+Learath2> its not like ddnet is keeping the source code under the wraps and only showing official servers in their client
15:40 <@heinrich5991> Stitch626: the ddnet source code is the successor of the ddrace source, the server network is another thing built on top of it
15:43 <+Learath2> was looking for a project to start working on but instead will finish up my accounts code
15:49 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: publick ey crypto?
15:49 <+Learath2> yep
15:49 <@heinrich5991> =)
15:49 <+Learath2> combined with your extended serverinfo should even be able to revamp the friends list to support it
15:50 <@heinrich5991> yay!
15:54 <+Learath2> anyone has any idea what version of openssl we are linking along with libcurl ?
15:56 <@heinrich5991> does it matter, do they have incompatiblities?
15:56 <+Learath2> no idea tbh but idk how to find the headers for it
15:57 <@heinrich5991> /usr/include/openssl/
15:57 <@heinrich5991> on my system
16:18 < fstd> ldd(1) could tell
