00:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the design?
00:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> adding a lot of boxes kinda covers a lot of screen
00:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean the panel part should be there ofc
00:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> tho i really like this part of the chat
00:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414369770115170364/image.png?ex=68bf51fe&is=68be007e&hm=3d25fb762e3541c644fdc434e6947de5ae65d79b2ff51cbb1da039245ff069e4&
00:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I agree, don't change that
00:01 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but top bar covers a lot of space and even if opacity could be lowered with some setting or something it would still bother me a bit
00:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, he can always just push the panel container down, so it covers only as much space as there are messages
00:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or lower the minimum size
00:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but better idea: how about resizable panel?
00:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @kebscs i campaigned for tees with eyes in the middle always but was rejected
00:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ii snucxk it into nameplates tho

00:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> been having huge what i thought was packet loss
00:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but unstable ping sometimes pushing over margin could also do it
00:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i set 300 margin ages ago
00:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what is going on

08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> year of the edos desktop
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> im so proud of how clean the design ended up
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> the mailbox i did is a killer feature
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> fn port_worker_thread() -> ! {
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // init stuff..

08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     println!("Got read request, lba={lba}, sectors={sectors}");
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     let mut buffer = alloc::vec![0; (*sectors) as usize * 512];
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     let result = port.lock().read_sectors(*lba, &mut buffer, *sectors);
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     match result {

08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                         data.len()
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     );
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     let result = port.lock().write_sectors(*lba, data, *sectors);
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     caller.answer(AhciResponse::Result(result));

08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 }
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a ahci thread that routes requests to ports
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> AhciRequest::DeviceRequest { device_id, command } => {
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     if let Some(mb) = device_mailboxes.get(*device_id) {
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki>                         mb.send((command.clone(), req));
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     }
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 }
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> AhciRequest::DeviceRequest { device_id, command } => {

08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> and when i get a interrupt i wake up the relevant port worker thread
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> do u have a roadmap
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> next up is probs adding fat32 again
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> in my previous edos i had a pile of bugs cuz bad thread comms
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think im better now
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but now i go to gym
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> do u have public recreation centers near you
09:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> what do u mean
09:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> gym is in a 2 min walk
09:08 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon why are you contributing to the people currently ruining the entire race gamemode :cat_hmm:
09:08 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon why are you contributing to the people currently ruining the entire (DD)race/Gores gamemode :cat_hmm:
09:09 < bridge> <Cellegen> You ask this to a guy who made chillerbot
09:11 < bridge> <blazulite> never been able to understand what chillerbot is exactly
09:31 < bridge> <Cellegen> Me too but it has bot in it
09:31 < bridge> <Cellegen> :think_bot:
09:54 < bridge> <headshotnoby> xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had the sudden realization
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should write some linux kernel drivers
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> that willgive me more insight into kernel dev
10:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> different clients chiller made
10:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon oh shit i thought nobody would notice. Why are you browsiong bot client repos???? moderator caught in 4k
10:36 < bridge> <manikoo> ^^^ maintainer
10:36 < bridge> <manikoo> btw
10:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @blazulite by now chillerbot is an umbrella term as @soulyvevo pointed out correctly. It used to be a meme like 10 years ago I was coping with cheat accusations by saying yes i use a bot
10:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** back then i called it chillerbot.png which is funny because images usually dont give unfair advantages
10:38 < bridge> <soulyvevo> xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then when i obtained enough coding powers to actually build a client i leaned into that meme and called most clients i built chillerbot
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** to differentiate them they have a suffix such as chillerbot-ux chillerbot-h7 and so on. All clients that contain a z in the prefix contain unfair cheats and are not distributed.
10:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I acidentally sent chillerbot-zz in the ddnet discord tho ....
10:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that was a minor woopsie
10:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** chillerbot-zz was for a school project and i got a good grade and somehow managed to make teeworlds my project in high school xd
10:39 < bridge> <manikoo> double z.. unfairy unfairy cheats
10:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** chillerbot-zx is is the evil twin of chillerbot-ux and the client i use on a daily basis. Its not optimized for unfair pvp. It just has some features which are debatable and i only use them with the admins permissions.
10:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats the entire story :)
10:41 < bridge> <manikoo> biggo sus maintainer
10:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no proof
10:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am also industry leader when it comes to antibot
10:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** "ein guter schwimmer kennt beide ufer" we say in germany
10:42 < bridge> <manikoo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1287716834682081280/1338422730428645396/petpet.gif
10:42 < bridge> <Assa> total gray head energy
10:42 < bridge> <manikoo> oho sounds good
10:44 < bridge> <Assa> now I know why he is maintainer:
10:44 < bridge> <Assa> provides "anti cheat" for ddnet, sells bot client which is "undetectable"
10:45 < bridge> <Assa> and if he needs more money, he detects it and sells a new "undetectable" one 🧠
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** No I am maintainer because I actually care about the game ._. and spend lots of hours trying to improve it. Nothing shady about me. If i hear another accusation you will hear from my lawyer josspit with a defamation lawsuit.
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> you know that I am just joking chillerbuddy ^.^ I know we are both spending lots of hours to imporove our favourite game
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** OwO
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> is jupstar ur lawyer
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill sue u for using C
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** always has been
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> is he actually a lawyer?
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> will he defend u from that
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> no xd
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he is actually a lawyer
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> what
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he can give legal advice
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is a programmer
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he is a pro gamer
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> I need to know, if he is a lawyer I need to maintain distance :p
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar is a vulkan connosieur
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa he is not xd
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> that is true
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> (he will always blame the drivers)
10:49 < bridge> <manikoo> do you have blog about your projects
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> I need a ddnet blog tbh, maybe 5 ppl would read it
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://edgl.dev/
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
10:51 < bridge> <Assa> so he is actually Edgque :p
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> edgl
10:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oops sent from the wrong account
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> im chiller
10:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @manikoo was that a reply? to who?

10:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** irc moment
10:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was wondering why u were so slow to plug ur blog
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
10:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont have a blog :c only a yt channel
10:52 < bridge> <manikoo> sadly
10:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this is my chillerbot blog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0tpwp2QN6A
10:53 < bridge> <melon> I follow your GitHub - unfollowed now, I can't believe you'd do that.
10:53 < bridge> <manikoo> :poggers2:
10:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** shiet lost a follower
10:54 < bridge> <melon> Rather contributes to cheat client devs than do accounts
10:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon i was indeed worried about my followers seeing it
10:54 < bridge> <melon> Unbelievable
10:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i instantly deleted the fork but then it closed the pr xd
10:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh good that you remind me ima delete it now
10:54 < bridge> <melon> Already screenshotted
10:54 < bridge> <manikoo> got one
10:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon i was updating the same thing in my antibot so i thought it would be funny to say hi
10:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon also the contributor farmin in gh is real
10:55 < bridge> <melon> !remind 30d pressure chiller into doing accounts
10:55 < chillerbot12> Helo melon I will remind you at Mon Sep 08 2025 11:25:17 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
10:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon ppl think i made the ddnet web editor because i fixed one typo
10:55 < bridge> <melon> Fuck h mean in 30 minutes
10:55 < bridge> <melon> 30 DAYS
10:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if it shows up in contributors ppl dont know what u really did
10:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon so i am hoping for some people to self report to me because they thing im bot dev xd
10:56 < bridge> <melon> btw chiller, how to chat with you outside of irc
10:56 < bridge> <melon> Give email
10:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon ye the d syntax is wip go ping ryo to add it
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> !remind 360 implement fat32
10:56 < chillerbot12> Helo ryozuki I will remind you at Mon Sep 08 2025 16:56:16 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
10:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>**  @melon chillerdragon@gmail.com
10:56 < bridge> <melon> tanks
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> imagine gmail email
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> edgar@edgl.dev
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im cool
10:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** *melon registering me on of rn*
10:56 < bridge> <melon> Are you self hosting
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
10:56 < bridge> <melon> Do you hate yourself?
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
10:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gmail has G in the name its gangster email
11:00 < bridge> <melon> Chiller please respond to my email
11:00 < bridge> <melon> :peepoSpreadsheet:
11:02 < bridge> <filoqcus> Chiller play kog
11:02 < bridge> <filoqcus> :omo:
11:02 < bridge> <melon> I'll leak his position to the Finanzamt if he doesn't answer
11:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf is peepoSpreadsheet xxxxxxxxxxxxxD
11:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon do you even know which country i am in right now?
11:06 < bridge> <melon> The Finanzamt will find out
11:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** "I hope this email finds you well," is crazy intro btw
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** stop mail me bro we can chat here xd
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** when is learath in munich?
11:07 < bridge> <melon> :ChooChoo:
11:07 < bridge> <melon> Stop leak
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bro wat leak xd
11:08 < bridge> <melon> My intro!
11:08 < bridge> <melon> Now I look like a 50 year old
11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah yes
11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ez
11:08 < bridge> <melon> Idfk
11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 melon wants to meet you in munich airport. Will you be there any time soon?
11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im in
11:08 < bridge> <melon> When are you close to Germany again?
11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he is in ams
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he is always close
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon should we fly to amsterdam together?
11:09 < bridge> <melon> true
11:09 < bridge> <melon> Hmm, can actually
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now?
11:09 < bridge> <melon> Damn
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, probably won't be doing munich all that often anymore. It was my connecting airport from Italy
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bru we missed him
11:09 < bridge> <melon> Gg
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now we have to go to amsterdam
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** too bad
11:09 < bridge> <manikoo> do you want to meetup with greatest maintainers to discuss your game impoving strat??
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> was very close to munich yesterday
11:09 < bridge> <melon> Nah but we can actually do a flight to Netherlands
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i want to lick lerato
11:10 < bridge> <melon> sometime next year
11:10 < bridge> <manikoo> ok
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon amsterdam specifically
11:10 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, no meetup with you
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon lerato is always on the move wdym next year
11:10 < bridge> <Assa> > i want to lick lerato
11:10 < bridge> <Assa> I mean I wasn't
11:10 < bridge> <Assa> :justatest:
11:10 < bridge> <learath2> Next year I'll try moving somewhere far. Maybe Tokyo this time
11:11 < bridge> <manikoo> jap servers included
11:13 < bridge> <Assa> I am in amsterdam in october, hotel already booked :3
11:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg omg @melon lets go w assa 
11:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its gonna be huuge
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> Well, dm me if you want to grab a beer and talk about envelopes
11:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** beer and envelopes xxxxxxD
11:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** love it
11:14 < bridge> <Assa> grabbing a beer sounds good ... but the envlope part ... xD
11:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** haha
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, beer and no envelopes
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** envelopes and no beer
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** joint and quad clustering
11:15 < bridge> <Assa> quads already clustered, I am almost finished with improving rendering
11:15 < bridge> <learath2> Clustering quads is illegal under the geneva convention
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** watafak
11:16 < bridge> <Assa> then I already broke the geneva convention in my open PR
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** assa is gangster
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hot
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> We can talk about how you destroyed jupstars fps in just 3 minor versions
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** F
11:16 < bridge> <Assa> I am pretty sure he has done it himself, or witht he spectre bug
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** spectre was in 2014
11:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wdym
11:17 < bridge> <Assa> like I asked him to check and make benchmarks, he just refused and gave up
11:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** reminds me of the ddnet++ and ddnet-insta bug reports 
11:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** speaking of where is pathos
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> can't be that I see improvements in FPS on my system on all maps since I started working on it, and he just has half? That's sus
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** have you tried telling him to buy a better gpu?
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or update his graphics driver
11:18 < bridge> <learath2> We should do an illegal ddnet hackathon sometime to just make accounts
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 sounds fun
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where?
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> centralized or decentralized?
11:19 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you accidentally ended up optimizing for just your exact gpu and cpu combo? That would be funny
11:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
11:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** works on assas machine
11:19 < bridge> <learath2> Idk, we'd figure it out first day of hackathon
11:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** jesus trolling in this channel is such a timesink
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> I think patiga claimed that ddnet is "obviously" cpu bottlenecked, while I experienced the opposite
11:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i should talk about main branch again to boost my productivity
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> and I have a 4070 xD
11:20 < bridge> <learath2> I just noticed sth. Now that I'm doing a masters in computer security, I am officially allowed to roll my own crypto as I'll soon be the expert
11:22 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I don't know how it is now but iirc it was cpu bottlenecked for me too a year or so ago, but my cpu is ancient
11:22 < bridge> <Assa> I usually play on a 2K monitor (and I have another 2K monitor next to it), maybe it's actually setup related
11:23 < bridge> <Assa> also jupey provided a benchmark, it was only the beginning what was slow
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> I also play on dual 2k monitors
11:24 < bridge> <Assa> and in my benchmarks I always benchmark demos, maybe something is up with ingame rendering at the beginning, something loading
11:25 < chillerbot12> yo @melon keep in mind to: pressure chiller into doing accounts
11:26 < bridge> <Assa> he said at first it sucks, then it gets faster
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> Peculiar
11:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 can u merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10848 so i can merge downstreams :c 
11:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** my prod is running a multiple day old ddnet version thats unacceptable
11:31 < bridge> <learath2> I'll take a look when I sit down somewhere
11:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
11:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ofc never merge while standing

11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> when next ddnet meetup
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> barcelona - hamburg 50€
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> better than frankfurt which was 200€ lol
11:37 < bridge> <manikoo> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1263768271690268682 remember this
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> im up for ddcon lan too
11:38 < bridge> <melon> How was Frankfurt so much more expensive xd
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> because barcelona - frankfurt is only "premium" air brand like lufthansa
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> hamburg has vueling
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is cheap
11:38 < bridge> <melon> Frankfurt would be Nice tho, 2h with car
11:38 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> hamburg far?
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> where u live
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk germany tbh
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just said hamburg but any other city than frankfurt works
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> or lets meet in mallorca
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> its germany too anyway
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:39 < bridge> <melon> ~8 1/2 hours
11:39 < bridge> <melon> 😢
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> are most devs in the south?
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> or north
11:40 < bridge> <melon> Lmao I would definitely join on mallorca
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> which side is best
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> let the war being
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hear north is jelous of south
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz more tech?
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe idk
11:40 < bridge> <melon> :kek: 
11:40 < bridge> <melon> 
11:40 < bridge> <melon> I think the devs in here are pretty spread out
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> lets go to a middle ground
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> france
11:41 < bridge> <melon> Me and chiller sleep in one bed, the others are pretty much all across germany
11:41 < bridge> <melon> :megupuke:
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok just come here
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.guru3d.com/story/intel-arc-pro-b50-gpu-launched-at-for-compact-workstations/
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> 16gb vram
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> 360€?
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> dam
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i should buy this for server
11:43 < bridge> <Assa> I'd wish for a small version which I could put in my nuc
11:43 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder if this is possible at all 🤔
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.pccomponentes.com/tarjeta-grafica-sparkle-eco-intel-arc-a310-4-gb-gddr6
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should have bought this instead of the nvidia gt 710 omg
11:44 < bridge> <manikoo> warsaw best place for
11:44 < bridge> <manikoo>  ddcon
11:46 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder if there is a tool where you could enter user locations and which calculates a city in order to minimize travel times
11:46 < bridge> <Assa> hmm probably always returns frankfurth as it's easy to reach by plane
11:47 < bridge> <Assa> hmm probably always returns frankfurth as it's easy to reach by plane and in the middle of europe
11:47 < chillerbot12> yo @Assa keep in mind to: test if long map setup times cause client getting stuck in loading screen waiting for server response
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 4100 test if long map setup times cause client getting stuck in loading screen waiting for server response
11:48 < chillerbot12> Helo Assa I will remind you at Thu Sep 11 2025 08:08:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
11:49 < bridge> <Assa> shit this was a day too much 🙁
11:54 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 320 level up dnd char
11:54 < chillerbot12> Helo Assa I will remind you at Mon Sep 08 2025 17:14:27 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> Battlemage has surprisingly good specs
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> I hear they worked out a lot of the driver kinks too
12:13 < bridge> <melon> I should play DND again
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> it's like programming, you have your class and upgrade it's functionality, until you loose overview
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe it's a me problem
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe u decreased cpu usage and that made my cpu not clock as high
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Could be some stupid shit
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> all good, I just didn't want to ping you when we're yapping in this channel
13:02 < bridge> <Assa> as I said, for me the game seems to be gpu bottlenecked. Having less gpu calls corresponds to more fps
13:02 < bridge> <Assa> as I said, for me the game seems to be gpu bottlenecked. Having less gpu calls corresponds to more fps (less gpu calls per render call)
13:05 < bridge> <Assa> maybe the reasoning is wrong 🤔 idk where the bottleneck is
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes that is generally true, but that is not a gpu bottleneck
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Still on cpu
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gpu bottleneck would mean that your gpu is at full load or transfer for some of its components
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since the graphics api calls are in a separate thread you could say, that it's a battle between how good the client is vs how fast the backend is. So in normal case game is cpu bottlenecked
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And more and more client code
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Esp with our awesome O(n^2) physics
13:15 < bridge> <Assa> hmm, isn't the backend seperated in extra cores?
13:16 < bridge> <Assa> I guess it is, but only partially
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes and yes
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> Now, that we have seperated rendering from the client, I am going to test if I can use a thread and see benefits
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> nice talk 👍
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> I think the demo renderer in the game can be improved.
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> For example, this is a 3rd party demo renderer developed for the source games I left below.
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> <https://github.com/crashfort/SourceDemoRender>
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> and while it covers a lot of things found on ddnet, it also contains many features.
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> 
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> For example, motion blur can be added by slowing down the video compared to the video fps. (I don't know the exact math unfortunately.)
13:26 < bridge> <bangdik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1010844327070679180/unknown.png?ex=68bff4a4&is=68bea324&hm=2f9e353d6cc6a28e978cbeff4320c194fcc449314a2d3a0b427ddd39f1d3d3ad&
13:30 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon dont be so scared to merge stuff like <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10857>
13:30 < bridge> <kebscs> 😂
13:31 < bridge> <kebscs> these are both from tidy check, also can look up cpp docs
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ? Xd
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I already told you before, everything that uses graphics threaded will not be.
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll not review it and veto it
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rendering itself was always threaded as in backend
13:40 < bridge> <Assa> didn't ask you, I am just checking 😄  I want to use a thread a layer earlier
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
13:42 < bridge> <Assa> ah no, you'd break the render sequence
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't want this spaghetti code, show me only my structs/classes how you want to create a structure that works nicely multithreaded
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't want this spaghetti code, show me only by structs/classes how you want to create a structure that works nicely multithreaded
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> I mean what we could do is split up CClient::Run and move the render code into a seperate thread splitting it up from the rest of the client logic
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> it might turn out that it not works due to various side effects/logic issues
14:21 < bridge> <totar> Physics doesnt run every frame so it has almost no impact on measured fps
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> prediction does!
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```

14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:23 < bridge> <totar> only in extreme situation where it takes a huge amount of time, but the fps will be super fast for all the frames when physics doesnt run
14:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> prediction doesnt run every frame?
14:23 < bridge> <totar> no ofc not
14:24 < bridge> <totar> If you use fastinput it will run when you change inputs so technically it reduces fps xd
14:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 100fps improvementish
14:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i should do it with dbg dummies instead cuz players move around
14:26 < bridge> <totar> Ping also makes it way more expensive
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 250 -> 150
14:27 < bridge> <totar> 8000ms with just 2 tees is noticeable lag from physics
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 8s?
14:27 < bridge> <totar> Yeah
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ofc it does
14:27 < bridge> <totar> Im the only one who tests these things
14:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait lag as in
14:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cost

14:29 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 320 benchmark without prediction and antiping
14:29 < chillerbot12> Helo Assa I will remind you at Mon Sep 08 2025 19:49:29 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.

14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait did i just see 128 p server support??
14:31 < bridge> <Assa> hmm it shouldn't  affect demos tho 🙁
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414588921421234266/image.png?ex=68c01e18&is=68becc98&hm=177d806ba97eb5a599da725287432199c5cab36b16cc4197fc78c5d0d536b0b9&
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> demos do prediction no?
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to an extent
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like colliding into a wall intratick
14:31 < bridge> <Assa> demos should only do interpolation not prediction
14:32  * bridge <Assa> should
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i havent really noticed demos not looking as if they are running collision every frame
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but im not looking
14:32 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 && @zwelf2 I rebased and addressed all the feedback in #10049 and #10063. It would be really nice if you could give it a quick review so we can land them together in one teehistorian bump
14:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10049
14:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10063
14:33 < bridge> <Assa> do demos calculate all the physics?
14:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk
14:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is my server saying 128 players
14:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its on master
14:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10581> ios still open
14:41 < bridge> <totar> no
14:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 review 4 review? xd
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> you are not qualified to review those 2, it requires zwelf or heinrich 😛
14:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rip
14:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 we need a heinrich?
14:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where a heinrich
14:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lerato trust me im network hacker
14:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) looks like a bug caused by https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/05890fe1cb0f727744b1e9f0a3dfce3960f18f4d/src/engine/shared/protocol.h#L88 being used wrongly
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ghasp
14:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** send fix
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i got too many open prs
14:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its probably just a matter of replacing `MAX_CLIENTS` with `Server()->MaxClients()` 
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and im eating
14:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** eating wat
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fish
14:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nice
14:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** :fish:
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i didnt catch it
14:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** pusi
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats not very nice
14:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i only eat animals i killed with my bare hands
14:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and chicken nuggets from mc donalds
14:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** because i dont like to shred baby chicks
14:51 < bridge> <Assa> ah yes mc donals chicken nuggets, I believe the crust is made of of old amzon package carton
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> ah yes mc donals chicken nuggets, I believe the crust is made of of old amazon package carton
14:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
14:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think they only shred half of the baby chicks
14:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa are you vegan?
14:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and they dont use that
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> no, I am a trashbin
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ls ~/.local/share/Trash/files | wc -l
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 10584
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does this make u hungry
14:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** brit doesnt get german saying xd
14:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wait im not sure actually
14:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the trashbin thing does it make sense to you @Solly (bun bun) ?
14:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we say it a lot in germany
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we also use vacuum cleaner
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> others are like ` ... 2> /dev/null`, I am like ` ... 2 > /assa`
14:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
14:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think i understand
14:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) do you know what this means? "my english is not the yellow from the egg"
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well its not used unless you speak german
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i think it used to be used, my dad has said it a few times
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lmao no way
14:55 < bridge> <Assa> do you know how many germans it takes to change a lightbulb?
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** does he know ger?
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but he has been to germany alot
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** germans love to say it
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> he can order alcohol in almost every language
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think some seriously say it not as a joke
14:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa 5?
14:56 < bridge> <Assa> only 1, we are very efficient and don't understand humor
14:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh right
14:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was about to say i know the joke not with "germans" xd
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> he can order alcohol in almost every language
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ( any background on this would dox me lmao )
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well it just means "good" right
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i feel most plp would understand it
14:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) "not good"
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well not the yellow from the egg
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but the yellow from the egg is good
14:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) **not** the yellow from the egg
14:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ye
14:57 < bridge> <Assa> ye
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> some people prefer just egg whites
14:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sayings are so weird
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well english people would say yolk not  yellow
14:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** italians and russians randomly have sayings about wolfes 
14:58 < bridge> <Assa> I prefer the part without the shell
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well its all probably borrowed from literature
14:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wolves*?
14:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wolves
14:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** test passed
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and its luck which ones are copied into common parlence
14:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u might be real brit after all
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i say leafs
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because leaves also means something else
14:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** in which context?
14:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** tree?
14:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> leaf
14:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tree leaf
14:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** a ye
14:59 < bridge> <Assa> what else do others say?
14:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> leafs = plural leaf
14:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> leaves = plural leaf or plural leave
14:59 < bridge> <Assa> that leafs me confused
15:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he she it lefteded the game
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leafs
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> do leafs life?
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do leaves live?
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> okay I stop butchering foreign language
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that mfl to you
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (modern foreign langugae, not mf langugae)
15:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> (good that you explained that tbh lmao)
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> btw using a seperate thread in the client worked so far oO
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> only joining didn't
15:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !remind 69 @learath2 BING BONG PING PONG https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10848
15:04 < chillerbot12> Helo ChillerDragon I will remind you at Mon Sep 08 2025 16:13:27 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
15:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa spawn new thread for every frame 🧠
15:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> spawn a new frame for every thread
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> no
15:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> prerender the frames in the future for minimal latency
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** cache frames in redis
15:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> prerender the frames in the future for minimal latency (<- this makes no sense)
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> 1. Work on a supercomputer
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> 2. Write a program that starts itself async twice
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> 3. Wait until supercomputer goes down
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> 4. Tell gov computer not big enough
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> 5. Get yelled at by sysadmins
15:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> forkbomb a supercomputer so u can get a bigger supercomputer
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> we actually did that in my bachelors 💀
15:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a supercomputer being a max load during a task isnt unusual
15:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats how its meant to be
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> yes but you are usually not taking all of the supercomputer by yourself, but sharing it with countless other scientists
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> also your institute may have to pay for compute
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> are cores/time not split between who is using it?
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah yes you can use cluster 3 thru 7 between the 3rd of sept and 15th of september
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
15:09 < bridge> <Assa> yesn't
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (because scaling tasks at runtime is probably hard)
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> there is a bit `on demand/no demand` trickery going on, we have tasks that need to run daily and they can run at times where others are not using it e.g. at night
15:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do supercomputers use schedulars?
15:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i need a robyte
15:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i feel like the overhead of task switching is something that would want to be avoided
15:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where a robyte
15:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want a robit
15:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> romegabyte
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> then there is an economics aspect, a supercomputer uses a lot of power and you want to use it at the day, because electricity is more expensive at night
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> due to solar
15:11 < bridge> <Assa> yes!!!
15:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> surely electricity is cheaper a night if you arent mostly solar
15:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz demand would be less
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> here in germany we mostly have coal solar and wind
15:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414599182819262555/iu.png?ex=68c027a7&is=68bed627&hm=b9c16457819fef3198a027a9ea1a5e41c65025ddeae842fb806d0a83086ae1a1&
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> oh and gas
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> gas is no more due to russia
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> https://app.electricitymaps.com/map/zone/DE/72h/hourly
15:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414599489615958117/iu.png?ex=68c027f0&is=68bed670&hm=6791d2f0e20ce12a6354ab7a6c83c194867b798023759981efbc6d10f21c9082&
15:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (yes the graphs agree hard coal and lignite is just counted as coal i think)
15:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is a really nice website damn
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> take a look at the electricity map, currently (at this hour) we are using mostly solar and coal
15:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wish they would ease up on the blur tho, oh my pc
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> the max solar capacity in germany is insane
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> no sane actually calculating goverment should ignore solar
15:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i can see
15:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am just exploring this map
15:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> very cool
15:16 < bridge> <Assa> take a look at france, which is mostly atomic
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nuclear ftw
15:17 < bridge> <Assa> and then germany, which has no atomic anymore
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk why people are against it
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> they are just afraid of a thrid fukushima/chernobyl
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414600704693370931/image.png?ex=68c02912&is=68bed792&hm=6735f39c9e0d163531326f671518821e86d13870ea7e4a2bbca5f6c1eace0fd2&
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rmm
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> ye, hypocrits
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why does france get a better government than the bloody uk
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> makes no sense
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> imo they phased nuclear out too fast, should have phased out coal first.
15:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> definatley
15:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nuclear is far more sustainable due to irregular refueling
15:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (in terms of oh no russia stopped giving us x so now we cant use it)
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> but now it's to leat, you can't just "turn them on again"
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> but now it's to late, you can't just "turn them on again"
15:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats what britain did
15:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> quite scary
15:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just turned on a random nuclear site
15:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that handt been used for a while
15:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (finding evidence is not working)
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> don't worry, we all have our chicken to plug with our goverments
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> chicken to plug
15:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> with.. stuffing?
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> that's a german metaphor to go full circle 😄
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait sizewell a got turned off?
15:24 < bridge> <Assa> in english it's a "bone to pick with sb."
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i get the meaning
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its just funny
15:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> scrap this i cant find anything
15:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** "we all have our chicken to plug with our goverments"
15:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
16:13 < chillerbot12> DO NOT FORGET @ChillerDragon TO: @learath2 BING BONG PING PONG https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10848
16:34 < bridge> <kebscs> the more tidy checks i fix, the more warnings it shows
16:34 < bridge> <kebscs> so it found more of the redundant inline stuff :tear:
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> Q: Do you think it's an issue if DDNet is a central authority for accounts? As in we store all the PII. Short answers only
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think its an issue, we should just get it working and not worry this much about details,
16:40 < bridge> <melon> DDNet as the owner of both client, server and masterserver. i dont think its an issue
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is already a central authority on stuff whether u want it or not
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> the benefits to get this working for the ecosystem imho will be massive, so much tooling and webs can be made around accounts
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> (please provide oauth2)
16:42 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon i will pr once i silence/fix all remaining warnings so i got all enums cleaned up in 1 pr
16:42 < bridge> <kebscs> so far i have these commits <https://github.com/KebsCS/ddnet/commits/pr-clang-header/>
16:43 < bridge> <kebscs> worst warnings that probably will need to be silenced are `misc-confusable-identifiers`, `deprecated-enum-enum-conversion`
16:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do it
16:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 I dont think its an issue as long as you make me ddnet admin
16:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 will we make @ryozuki responsible for backing up all the PII?
16:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :lol:

16:56 < chillerbot12> Elo @ryozuki I just wanted to remind you that: implement fat32
16:57 < bridge> <Assa> I don't get threading in ddnet, I literally have a dbg_msg at the end of the thread function, `dbg_msg("dbg", "closing thread");`, I get the message, and the thread still hangs on join

17:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: if you work on the same stuff like me that’s a op loophole. If I would pr it would stale for at least days. If you pr the same I can merge it in minutes. Ez.
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> the enums you posted in the github thread are valid btw
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> ```
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> enum class ELayerQuadsProp 
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs>  { 
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs>      PROP_NONE = -1, 
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs>      PROP_IMAGE, 
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs>      NUM_PROPS, 
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs>  }; 
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> ```
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> this has an init value and no other values = valid
17:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do
17:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How so
17:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah true
17:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I forgor
17:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go write that on GitHub pls
17:03 < bridge> <kebscs> XD
17:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes it’s op info
17:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We need it documented I forgot about it thrice already
17:04 < bridge> <kebscs> its just enums that have random values inside
17:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> cracknotgood
17:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: do you know him? ^
17:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye ye I remember now @kebscs then fix should be the way to go
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> As in you call `thread_wait` and it hangs?
17:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sometimes I feel like I edit too many comments of others on GitHub xd
17:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A bit übergreifend
17:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No way you can translate that to overreaching xd
17:14 < chillerbot12> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: level up dnd char
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks how to troll a friend, add `use std::collections::BTreeMap as HashMap;`
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But there are some api differences
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> it finished and the waiting call hangs
18:02 < bridge> <Assa> yes, somewhat known zCatch player
18:02 < bridge> <learath2> Are you using actual real threads spawned with `thread_init`?
18:02 < bridge> <Assa> I fully used std::thread logic
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> You'll need to show some code, this works in the unit tests
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> We don't use `std::thread`
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> Then what does that have to do with ddnet? We don't use `std::thread` except inside video where jupstar doesn't like using our stuff and none of us really know what he is doing
18:06 < bridge> <Assa> today is next week :owo:
18:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa wowo true zcatch gamer
18:09 < bridge> <Assa> thread idea is dead, it crashes violently
18:10 < bridge> <Assa> you do btw, I find multiple references in the engine
18:11 < bridge> <robyt3> As Learath2 said, those are only in the video render and Vulkan backend
18:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Game client code should use `IJob` for concurrent jobs
18:12 < bridge> <melon> if you want to use it in the context of DDNet your best bet is to annoy jupsti with it
18:12 < bridge> <melon> if you want to use it in the context of DDNet your best bet is to annoy jupsti with it xd
18:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless you want to make everyone life harder, use `IJob`
18:14 < bridge> <Assa> yes and no, it has too many side effects, unfortunatly we can't just put rendering alone in another thread
18:15 < bridge> <robyt3> But the first rule of performance optimization is to measure before you optimize and then measure again after
18:15 < bridge> <Assa> my measurement results: client worked before, client crashed violently after
18:15 < bridge> <Assa> btw, the quad-cluster branch has actual benchmarks
18:15 < bridge> <Assa> btw, the quad-cluster branch has actual benchmarks as you wished
18:16 < bridge> <robyt3> No, what I mean is, why do you think putting something in a thread would give you more performance? First you should measure to determine what to optimize.
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> The game seems to be cpu bottle necked, this is what determined my thinking here
18:17 < bridge> <robyt3> Thinking != Measurement
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> sure
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> I sometimes just throw things at the wall in order to check what sticks around
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> how else should you improve on unclear matter
18:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Use a profiler to determine what's slow
18:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Then optimize what is slow
18:19 < bridge> <Assa> I find it incredibly hard to profile this
18:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Why? Start the game with a profiler and look measurement to determine where the CPU spends most time.
18:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Why? Start the game with a profiler and look at the measurements to determine where the CPU spends most time.
18:27 < bridge> <robyt3> If you have a demo to benchmark consistently, you can also profile before and after changes and compare the results
18:28 < bridge> <Assa> you mean like I did with the quad cluster PR? I already made a small ddnet-benchmarking repository
18:28 < bridge> <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet-benchmarks
18:30 < bridge> <robyt3> This only gives you total frametimes though. A profiler can tell you which exact function or line of code is executed relatively often compared to others. But you have to profile the same situation if you want to compare the results, e.g. by playing a demo and then quitting at the end.
18:31 < bridge> <Assa> yes true and of course, I mostly use the frametimes in order to proof that there is an improvement
18:34 < bridge> <robyt3> If you want to find which code you should optimize, you need a real profiler though. Otherwise you might be optimizing code that is already fast enough, which may only decrease readability.
18:53 < ws-client> **<Pathos>** @ChillerDragon nope, no special setup
18:53 < ws-client> **<Pathos>** But I at least isolated that it has to do with tournament mode in progress thing options and/or the message for it
18:54 < bridge> <Assa> my profiling result is, that the slowest part of rendering is CPlayers::OnRender and not map rendering, so no matter how much I optimize after that, you won't see benefits
18:55 < bridge> <Assa> huh why is every frame the vector constructor called for players?
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon: Was it you who had the ctrlmsgs documented somewhere?
18:56 < bridge> <Assa> `CTeeRenderInfo aRenderInfo[MAX_CLIENTS];` ah yes we are reconstructing an array every frame
18:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> tfw this is considered a performance problem
18:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can tell why this game runs fast lol
18:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> meanwhile other games: generating a multi-megabyte acceleration structure every frame
18:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is considered a huge optimization.
18:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> compilers watching as you move another vector by value for the 5th time and it cant optimize it cuz lto is turned off :squidward_deadpan+the sfx:
19:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> bazinga
19:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/ctrl_messages.html this?
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> Aha, yep
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> I think I'll be adding a new ctrl message or extend the ones we already have
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> It's been long enough since we got a new one
19:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> are you doing something accounts related?
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> yep, I'm reworking my old accounts implementation, getting rid of the `NETMSG_ENCRYPTED` overhead
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> We are getting an extension to `NET_CTRLMSG_CONNECTACCEPT` to signify the server is capable of encrypted communication, and `NET_CTRLMSG_NOISE` to do the handshake over, after which the client and the server will be able to exchange fully encrypted packets
19:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Does this have a chance to be merged or is it just to scare heinrich so that he keeps working on quic? xd
19:07 < bridge> <learath2> Who knows, maybe he'll like it
19:09 < bridge> <learath2> I still don't know where to sneak in the encryption flag in the packets though
19:14 < bridge> <learath2> If only we werent using `NET_PACKETFLAG_UNUSED` for the 3 people who use 0.7
19:17 < bridge> <learath2> I guess 0.6.5 is truly used by nobody, maybe I can steal its `NET_PACKETFLAG_TOKEN`
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> I have never seen such waste, `NET_PACKETFLAG_EXTENDED` isn't even sent over the network, why is it hogging a bit?
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> Of the 3 free bits of flags we had available, 2 got used to support 0.01% of the playerbase collectively, and the last one is unused but used 😄
19:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 dont pollute flag bits pls
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> So y'all get to pollute the flags all you want but I don't?
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** would never
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> I'm taking `NET_PACKETFLAG_TOKEN` discussion joever
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** as long as u only send it to new ddnet clients its fine i guess
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sending it to everyone
19:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not good
19:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why would you do that
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> I need a packetflag
19:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok
19:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** as long as u dont break backcompat all good
19:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** just dont send the wrong packetflag to clients that dont support it
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> I'll only be breaking 0.6.5. Which is just a hallucination anyway
19:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no need to break it
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> Actually we never supported it anyway
19:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u could join
19:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so your accounts will be quicless?
19:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i like it
19:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** imo thats the way to go to just have encrypted payloads
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, Noise over udp framed with teeworlds protocol instead
19:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we already have compressed payloads 
19:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why not also encrypt no need to bloat in quic
19:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 imo the compression flag should just mean encrypted for new ddnet versions
19:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and then the first byte of the decompressed payload can be another varint with flags
19:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where the real compression flag will move
19:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and where we have space for 1283812390123 flag extensions
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> Why make an actually used flag weird instead of just reclaiming one?
19:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we can even put the ddnet version in the very first packet sent
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> If I break compatibility enough heinrich might actually be inclined to finish quic
19:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> just need to get as much random data from NIST's beacon to be decoded as player data
19:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i hope if it gets down to breaking the entire protocol i actually have something to say 
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> Actually this doesn't really work as well as I thought. All encrypted packets need to be vital
19:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no such thing as a vital packet
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> Nvm, that can be avoided, ok I'll just steal a flag, maybe repurpose the extended one so you can be happy too
19:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** only vital messages
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wow chiller
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your recent actions broke my heart
19:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** shit
19:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat i do
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> It'd have been a new concept
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You are not worthy to be a ddnet maintainer
19:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg tell me already
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You know what you did
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i have no clue
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** help me out
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> contributing to the worst people on planet
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh that
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> Oh yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that too
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i already defended my self about that
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> Not acceptable. Don't do it again. Not funny
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a bit funny
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if you cant differentiate between that and actually doing something harmful then i dont care about your respect anyways
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> ur just gonna get another ryo situation
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The fact that your aknowledge their existence is already bad
19:49 < bridge> <learath2> It's the kind of funny that we can laugh about after removing you
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They literally destroy this game
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well you did more than me
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt bring it up
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i deleted the fork
19:49 < chillerbot12> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: benchmark without prediction and antiping
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just put my self in there so cheaters approach me
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> then ddnet doesn't need the cheat clents to win for it to die
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i agree that its bad
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and i also fight against it
19:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** on my fng server at least
19:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i would also do it for ddnet if i had the power to do so
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> ye I'll just remove all the maintainers BCS they don't do what I want
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> ???
19:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ i cant tell if you are serious or not btw. Its not like i contributed to the destruction. Or gave them a platform.
19:51 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe I misunderstood you
19:51 < bridge> <Ewan> funny enough to remove chiller or me
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am serious
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> It is funny, we can laugh about it but a maintainer isn't supposed to be doing it
19:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** okay then lets talk
19:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** whats the problem @Jupstar ✪ ?
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> If nothing it is exceptionally horrible PR
19:52 < bridge> <Ewan> OSS PR
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller I have something like moral deep inside me, and I am proud of that bit that I have.
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> These people don't
19:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** okay yes
19:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so far so good
19:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so why are you mad at me?
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, we are public, we have relations with the public
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller whom am I discussion with rn?
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do I need to discuss this
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This should be obvious af
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> Multiple people asked me about why there is a ddnet maintainer doing that
19:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 okay thats fair
19:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so it looks like ddnet supports it?
19:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
19:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but im not ddnet staff i cant even login to rcon and i disgaree with almost all rules
19:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** heinrich told me when i became maintainer that i can still have opinions
19:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nobody told me about public presence
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> hey, you! guy that gives us a shitload of code on a regular basis for no pay! stop that
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller, but you should have common sense
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes i agree
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** honestly i thought nobody would care or even notice
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> Do you even understand what we are talking about here or what the subject is?
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt know u all watch these bot repos
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt expect it to become a thing
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Someone told me
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then that someone is sus
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller contributed code to a cheat project and you're angry because you can't control where he contributes to
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt contribute code
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i edited the readme
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> o?
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats the thing
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> even better
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its not like i distribute malicious code
19:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (someone wana link the commit, or should i)
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i broke their url
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No "but" dude
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is already the problem
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** from outdated to broken
19:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** what is the problem?
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> No ofc you should not link a bot commit. It's like everyone in this discussion is being willfully ignorant
19:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well it would be nice for people to see the discussion in the context its in
19:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nah i dont think we should link it
19:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe inappropraite channel for this discussion if not
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> can u dm it to me
19:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is a screenshot fine
19:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think this entire discussion is giving cheats a platform imo
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Enough, discussion of this. Don't be doing that in the future please, thanks. People follow you people see your commits and actions
19:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we should all be banned because of rule #7 or which ever it was
19:59 < chillerbot12> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's giving you a strict warning
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Enough discussion of this. Don't be doing that in the future please, thanks. People follow you people see your commits and actions
19:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fair
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Excellent PR 😄
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> Enough discussion of this. Don't be doing that in the future please, thanks. People follow you, people see your commits and actions
20:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ could we talk privately about this?
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can write me in element or discord any time
20:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lets do uit
20:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rule 7 is dont fake others?
20:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or ` Don't promote or encourage illegal activities - Includes botting/cheating.`
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> Blue name that doesn't know the rules :pepeW:
20:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) which rule is that botting one?
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> 7
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> i break it regularly so i'd know
20:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> without looking whats rule 3 in /rules
20:16 < bridge> <melon> ```

20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> you know the blue name is a popularity contest
20:16 < bridge> <melon> i agree
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of very good blue names out there
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> with their own interpretations of the rules
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> also some that have 3 online hours per year
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> they just havent been pruned yet
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> oh man
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> i almost seeded
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> glad i was in time to stop it

20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> do u pay for a box
20:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lmao inf ratio

20:20 < bridge> <learath2> Yellow terminal user wtf
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> this is my laptop LMBO
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :greenthing:
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it looks like that because it's inverted colours and I use a cream yellow as my white colour
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i was on gruvbox light lately but the systemd default palette is absolutely mindlessly written
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it looks like that because it's inverted colours and I use a cream yellow as my foreground colour
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> in response poettering basically said "uhhh just use dark mode lmao"
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it was unreadable over ssh and i didnt wanna turn off colors
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Stack memory allocation is effectively free
20:22 < bridge> <louis> wow what do u seed
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i bet he has lots of anime

20:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> my beloved
20:22 < bridge> <melon> that is some crazy seeding
20:22 < bridge> <melon> i got hatemail from my co-worker for using light mode zed
20:22 < bridge> <melon> but i literally can't stand dark mode for 8 hours a day anymore :(
20:22 < bridge> <robyt3> The funny thing is, we are using `NET_PACKETFLAG_UNUSED` but `NET_PACKETFLAG_TOKEN` is unused
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i cant have my editor putting me to sleep
20:24 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing his issue is not the allocation but the filling of it each time
20:24 < bridge> <teero777> well if you have a lot of light then light mode is nice and good.
20:24 < bridge> <learath2> Was supposed to be a reply to this. Thanks mobile discord
20:25 < bridge> <teero777> but usually its dark in my room
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> He is still filling it every frame though, now it's just a member variable instead of stack
20:25 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yeah that changes pretty much nothing
20:26 < bridge> <learath2> If you want improvement there you need to cache it
20:34 < bridge> <Assa> yes but not copy by value
20:34 < bridge> <Assa> yes but not copy by value, if you can just use the const reference and don't need it
20:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Without measurement this is not meaningful. Due to caching, the copies may have performed better.
20:35 < bridge> <robyt3> And you still have the same copy of the skin render info with `m_aRenderInfo[i] = GameClient()->m_aClients[i].m_RenderInfo;` regardless of member or stack variable
20:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think i checked previously but having copies is required
20:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> afaik/iirc copies is required
20:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Remember the first rule of optimizing
20:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which.. set of rules
20:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but probably in this case it would be profile
20:36 < bridge> <robyt3> The first rule is to measure instead of guessing
20:37 < bridge> <Assa> I agree on that part, but not copying the CNetObject_Character in every function, I found this with the profiler
20:37 < bridge> <Assa> I just see, that I changed too much in the PR, didn't want to get the m_aRenderInfo change in for the exact reasons you state :justatest:
20:37 < bridge> <robyt3> But has this improve it?
20:37 < bridge> <robyt3> But has this improved it?
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> You need measurements before and after and include them in the PR if you claim a performance benefit
20:41 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know how to do this properly. The profiling I did was ingame and is a bit inconsitent between each run
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd profile before and after the change, then compare how much time is spent in the code your are trying to optimize relative to the total time or time in the parent function.
20:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** emoji spam is against the rules?
20:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** is that the emote wheel?
20:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh wait those are discord rules
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 this is before and after: I don't belive this does a lot tbh

20:55 < bridge> <robyt3> On dm1 with 64 players and `zoom 0`, the item rendering actually has the most impact right now
20:55 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414685513331380336/image.png?ex=68c0780d&is=68bf268d&hm=c85787938d693f73ee7dcec8c14c8b9da22c550dec86b0af4bb1710c15627809&
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> interesting, that it's the items for you, I got my stats from an active linear server
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> anybody knows a good platform to buy old pcs
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> like for 20-40€
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess wallapop..
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> looking for smth like amth ahtlon 64
20:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Because it scans through all snap items, and fetches them, just to check for the flag item which isn't even present
20:56 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414685777765339226/image.png?ex=68c0784d&is=68bf26cd&hm=57d34f3df456da88270e62843fda8f9ab2f335ca62073e756142f0e563b90770&
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> looking for smth like amd ahtlon 64

20:56 < bridge> <aegisub> ~~this is abusing freeleech though, my transmission stats are much "worse"~~
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> maybe it's a gametype thing?
20:56 < bridge> <robyt3> This could probably be optimized a lot by caching the flags when preparing the snapshot
20:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Flag rendering is unrelated to the game type, but with 64 players the snapshot is large and this performs a linear search that always misses
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> I think I know exactly what tracker that is
20:57 < bridge> <aegisub> yeah it's not the most secret one
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> I recently restarted over there after losing my account on another due to inactivity
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> This is probably the biggest next optimization. Making the snap lookups better
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> The client update is still mostly affected by the skin updating with many players
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414686692094378165/image.png?ex=68c07927&is=68bf27a7&hm=749ec4834af3d98fb8f7f0a1bd24fb40c47ce80384fabde3462518088fbb4177&
21:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, 0.7 optimized this, but I don't know if this was possible to do without breaking demos somehow
21:01 < bridge> <robyt3> And making the networking threaded on Windows
21:05 < bridge> <robyt3> On my laptop with slow internet, I had massive frame drops every few seconds due to what I assume was networking. Don't have a profiler on it though to actually confirm whether that's the cause, but it seems a lot better with faster internet.
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> Another optimization opportunity I know of on the server is better ban lookups
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> Currently we do a linear search through bans and our N is getting to the point where it is getting slow
21:07 < bridge> <robyt3> I thought it was using some slightly smarter hash table?
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe someone changed it? I remember seeing it in the profile a year ago when I was profiling some other issue
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> CBan<CDataType> *Find(const CDataType *pData, const CNetHash *pNetHash) const
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> {
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3>     for(CBan<CDataType> *pBan = m_aapHashList[pNetHash->m_HashIndex][pNetHash->m_Hash]; pBan; pBan = pBan->m_pHashNext)
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3>     {
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3>         if(NetComp(&pBan->m_Data, pData) == 0)
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3>             return pBan;
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3>     }
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> 
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3>     return nullptr;
21:09 < bridge> <robyt3> }
21:09 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
21:09 < bridge> <robyt3> For mutes and votemutes I just switched to `std::map<NETADDR, CMute>` instead of a linear search
21:10 < bridge> <blazulite> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414689442114965584/aint_no_way.png?ex=68c07bb6&is=68bf2a36&hm=b9ec91b89332e05f2d2cdb12aaabc701e5ae152a0239e72f5e44089a05874d0e&
21:11 < bridge> <Assa> this brainrot makes me agressive
21:11 < bridge> <learath2> Guess my information was dated here
21:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll try to optimize this one
21:13 < bridge> <melon> See you in a month with a see commit PR and 4K lines changed :kyaruXD:
21:14 < bridge> <melon> "oh this is bad, oh wait if I change this I can optimize that"
21:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Only the flag rendering, not the entire snapshot handling :justatest:
21:14 < bridge> <robyt3> We even cache the flag in the snapshot already but don't use the cached on
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> Like 14 years out of date it seems. Oy fixed this 😄
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> Ahh, I misremembered what the issue was with it. It's that the hashmap doesn't have great performance for small-medium ban lists. I didn't want to move away from a linear search, I wanted to go to one 😄
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> Or maybe something that plays better with the cache, like a poptrie
23:51 < bridge> <kebscs> wtf `    for(int Team : {TEAM_RED, TEAM_BLUE})`
23:51 < bridge> <kebscs> this works?
23:51 < bridge> <kebscs> :deen_star:
23:52 < bridge> <robyt3> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/initializer_list.html
23:53 < bridge> <kebscs> yea but didnt know it can be in for like that
