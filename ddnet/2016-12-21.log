17:02 < Congrtx> Hello guys, I am wondering, why doesnt DDracenetwork have /register and /login?
17:03 < Congrtx> because VIP rooms are really good for donations
17:29 <@EastByte> that wouldn't fit into ddnet at all
17:45 <@deen> Congrtx: not interested in making money
17:45 < Learath2> well is ddnet even self sustaining?
21:34 <@deen> Learath2: barely, but who cares?
22:08 < Learath2> well if it isnt self sustaining then it still wont be making any money was going to be my point :P
