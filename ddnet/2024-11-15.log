00:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> :)
00:17 < bridge> <kebscs> wrong id
00:17 < bridge> <kebscs> this works `GameClient()->m_Tooltips.DoToolTip(&s_aListExtended[FriendType], &Header, "HELLOOO");`
00:17 < bridge> <Assa> what magic do I need to do to get debug logs üò¶
00:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> i thought the id had to be unique and thats it?
00:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> compile target debug?
00:18 < bridge> <kebscs> yes thats why everything there uses &s_aListExtended[FriendType] as id
00:18 < bridge> <kebscs> not sure what `(char*)this + FriendType` even does
00:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> (char*)this casts the this pointer to a char
00:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> then adds FriendType so its unique per iteration
00:19 < bridge> <Assa> I am sure my IDE shows me wrong build targets
00:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> mmm
00:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> have uconsidered learning how to use the terminal
00:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> are u on loinux?
00:20 < bridge> <Assa> sudo apt-remove -f tell-me-how-to-use-terminal && apt clean
00:20 < bridge> <Assa> sudo apt-remove -f tell-me-how-to-use-terminal && sudo apt clean
00:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
00:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> cd build
00:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
00:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> make -j`nproc`
00:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
00:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> sudo apt-get a better distro /j
00:21 < bridge> <kebscs> yea but why convert address to char*
00:21 < bridge> <kebscs> and then add number to it
00:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> because the value of the address is some random big number
00:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> and then the number makes it unique per iteration
00:21 < bridge> <Assa> thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
00:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> cuz the id has to be different
00:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> `&s_aListExtended[FriendType]`
00:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> is the same but the difference is more like 14 than 1
00:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> `&s_aListExtended[FriendType]`
00:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> is the same
00:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> `&s_aListExtended[FriendType]`
00:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> is the same (if the bools are sized as 1 byte)
00:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> `&s_aListExtended[FriendType]`
00:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> is the same (if the bools are sized as 1 byte, they might be bigger idk)
00:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> `&s_aListExtended[FriendType]`
00:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> is the same (if the bools are sized as 1 byte, they might be bigger idk, amnt compiler)
00:23 < bridge> <kebscs> but why make undefined behavior instead of just using smth thats already there
00:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> it isnt undefined behaviour
00:24 < bridge> <kebscs> youre casting class object to char array
00:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> even tho the type is void* the value is being used as a number
00:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats safe unless you <word> it
00:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats safe unless you derefence it
00:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> ill use `&s_aListExtended[FriendType]` cuz it works but idk why equally big random numbers dont work
02:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich rejected the proposal of auto upgrade. But it would technically be possible.
03:07 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon and you have a so-called "egg" for ddnetpp. Which is for a dedicated Pterodactyl server
04:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?xd wat
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> no idea
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> hru chiller
04:42 < bridge> <woidless> It sounds like you're referring to Pterodactyl, which is indeed a popular open-source game server management panel. This software is widely used for hosting and managing game servers and applications. With Pterodactyl, you can control game servers across multiple machines and manage them through a web-based interface. It runs on Docker, which means each game server is isolated in its own container, helping with resource management and security.
04:42 < bridge> <woidless> 
04:42 < bridge> <woidless> "Pterodactyl eggs" specifically refer to environment images or pre-configured setups for various games and services within the Pterodactyl panel. These "eggs" act as templates, containing scripts and settings that configure specific games or services so they can run smoothly on Pterodactyl. This makes deploying new servers for different games or applications much simpler.
04:42 < bridge> <woidless> 
04:42 < bridge> <woidless> If you're setting up a server or need specific eggs, there are many available in the community, or you can create custom ones based on your needs.
04:45 < bridge> <woidless> https://github.com/engels74/pterodactyl-eggs
04:50 < bridge> <Ewan> are you chat gpt
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> fork w 2 commits and 0 engagement
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> seems the upstream project doesn't even use the term pterodactyl
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> strange
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> https://pterodactyl.io/
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the thing
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
06:14 < bridge> <woidless> Which file contains the Server Tick speed value?
08:01 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
08:01 < bridge> <Ewan> this guy does not read messages that are not from chillerdragon i see
08:35 < bridge> <woidless> Who!
08:35 < bridge> <woidless> Who?
08:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> that guy
08:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> who always talks to chiller
08:44 < bridge> <woidless> And who?
08:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that guy
08:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm afraid of the whipping, so I cannot tell you the name.
09:02 < bridge> <woidless> Is that me?
09:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
09:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> :justatest:
09:41 < bridge> <woidless> That right
09:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: check my last message about your protocol documentation pwease
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> So I asked @heinrich5991 for **a branch** in order to implement the [material layer](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5313>) without getting an answer (maybe I am too fast). 
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> The idea is, to add a layer which is painted over the gamelayer (similar to TPs or tune) which change tile behaviour according to a material. For example make a tile slippy, make it accellerate faster (booster tile, by running over it), add penalty tiles (slow down to low speeds), etc, a lot of well defined combinations of existing tunes.
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> 
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> I already implemented it in a testbranch, but this feature went a bit over it's head and went huge. It has a lot of construction parts:
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> - Handling new tune parameters for the materials
10:47 < bridge> <Assa>    - Each material cold be it's own PR
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> - Client needs a new layer in the editor, similar to tune
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> - This comes with a physics update, how to handle standing on two different materials for example? I already put a lot of thought into this (this is implemented)
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> - Prediction, old clients: Technically this all could be emulated similar to the tune layer, but I think this is a major break
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> - Client animations: This one could also be done outside of it's own branch, for example use different ice sliding animations and particles on low friction ground, similar to [here](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WixRWjyqm1o>)
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> 
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> For a lot of these things I already have an implementation, and I would like to break it into small suggestable reviewable chunks on it's own branch, but I am not allowed to create one, what's your opinion?
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> > which change tile behaviour according to a material. For example make a tile slippy, make it accellerate faster (booster tile, by running over it), add penalty tiles (slow down to low speeds), etc, a lot of well defined combinations of existing tunes.
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean.. as you mentioned these are just "combinations of existing tunes" and is already possible with a few edgecases where it might not be.
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> this sounds like a rather heavy change for small gain

11:01 < bridge> <urg_> but wouldnt this make mapping a lot more stream line and simple especially for people who dont understand all the ins and outs of it?
11:02 < bridge> <urg_> honestly i couldnt know cuz i dont know the bare minimum when it comes to mapping :-]
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> you are still right, painting "ice" over wall would be more intuitive, then having to add 5 tunings to tune_zones in the map settings
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> you are still right, painting "ice" over wall would be more intuitive, than having to add 5 tunings to tune_zones in the map settings
11:05 < bridge> <animepdf> Can I request kernel interfaces from antibot module? I want to hook up to server's IStorage
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> I think @blaiszephyr has a point, the benefit would come from the cleaner material interactions, like you are standing on ice and normal ground, and have the maximum of both friction (minimum of the values), the minimum ground control speed, maximum ground acceleration, average ground impule jump (imagine one is sticky material, one is normal, now you jump half as high), etc. This is also the part that breaks the prediction.
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> 
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> But is it worth it? Maybe just implementing the client animations would be sufficient, since everything else can be emulated with tune layers (but not to such a detailed degree)
11:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> you know what i'd want?
11:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
11:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> templates in the editor with these settings, a "community db" basically
11:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> with common settings, envelopes etc ready to use without having to create them from scratch
11:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> paid ddnet assets when
11:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> :nouis:
11:29 < bridge> <Assa> uh, that is also an idea, because I was thinking about adding a tuning parameter import as well, maybe we can put well defined materials into loadable configs
11:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> doesnt a new layer mean there will have to be implemented another map format version
11:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> which wont be compatible with teeworlds client and servers
11:30 < bridge> <Assa> you mean like the current one, which already isn't?
11:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh
11:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> didnt know that
11:31 < bridge> <Assa> default teeworlds doesn't support teleports
11:31 < bridge> <Assa> **default**!!! teeworlds doesn't support teleports
11:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> depends on what kind of compatibility you mean, blockworlds is based on teeworlds, and the freeze is displayed as laser blockers in the DDNet editor :kek:
11:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah xd i dont know much about teeworlds
11:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> depends on what kind of compatibility you mean, blockworlds is based on teeworlds, and the freeze is displayed as laser blockers in the DDNet editor for example :kek:
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> This is always safe, even if you dereference. Char pointers are allowed to alias any object type
11:37 < bridge> <murpi> @essigautomat Not sure if you're aware, I'm OP of #9250
11:37 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9250
11:38 < bridge> <woidless> Can someone help me find the values for deceleration and acceleration?
11:38 < bridge> <Assa> hi @murpi sorry if I sound harsh, I am just brutally honest
11:39 < bridge> <murpi> Then you don't seem to know what name_bans are for üòÑ
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> TBH there is no point in name bans, isn't it banning by name?
11:39 < bridge> <murpi> At least on DDNet
11:40 < bridge> <learath2> You'll have to change the ABI yourself. We intentionally don't really use anything from the server because it can break on accident, like the CPacker issue we had this week
11:41 < bridge> <Assa> why are name bans implemented, wtf, who thought of this, now implement skin bans
11:41 < bridge> <Assa> (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
11:41 < bridge> <learath2> They effectively take your points away without deleting ranks which we don't do
11:42 < bridge> <learath2> (Unless the ranks are replaybotted or use bugs we removed)
11:42 < bridge> <murpi> I'll responded to your comment, to give some examples
11:42 < bridge> <murpi> I responded to your comment, to give some examples
11:43 < bridge> <Assa> okay disallowing some names entirely makes sense
11:43 < bridge> <Assa> ‚î¨‚îÄ‚î¨„Éé( ¬∫ _ ¬∫„Éé)
11:44 < bridge> <Assa> thought the idea was to get rid of the player, not to remove his records or prevent certain nicknames
11:46 < bridge> <animepdf> Well, I think (thought), all game-server classes I use are compiled into .so and even if server will mess something up my AB will work fine. And because of this I compile my AB from ddnet sources, and not as a completely external project, should I worry about it?
11:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> it's also used for certain.. other names
11:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
11:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> it's useful given we dont have an account system and this is a proper way of stopping people to use certain names
11:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306933476456661042/image.png?ex=67387826&is=673726a6&hm=e2a5aa37ce47c3bfad861616ea8852f734b237f868c17b83cee8c7ceb57287ad&
11:47 < bridge> <animepdf> Also main goal is to keep ABI compatible with stock ddnet
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> > okay disallowing some names entirely makes sense
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> Yes I understood, now honestly `skin_ban` would make sense
11:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> hm, why? the community and skin db's are controlled, if you use other proxies or download that skin yourself, your fault.
11:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> also people using disgusting skins can just.. not name them inappropriately
11:49 < bridge> <learath2> Well we compile the antibot with only a couple things from the ddnet server. That's system.h and antibot.h, nothing more iirc. Idk how you are compiling yours
11:50 < bridge> <Assa> is P2P skin sending a thing? When they change the skin name, others can't see them anymore or am I wrong?
11:51 < bridge> <learath2> No it's not. Yes they can't unless they have download skins enabled and you are using a skin that is part of their skin db provider
11:52 < bridge> <animepdf> I include everything I need to antibot xd. base/system.h hash.h engine/storage.h message.h config.h, and much more, but only from engine and base
11:53 < bridge> <learath2> Base is mostly fine. Engine we sort of designed the antibot around not having to have the antibot touch the memory of the server at all
11:54 < bridge> <learath2> The ABI structs are all distinct from the ones the server uses internally e.g.
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> You could add a hook to the skins provider for banning a skin, supporting the community, but I think the benefit would be minimal as you'd need a skin that has slipped through (people do make mistakes) and been missed
11:56 < bridge> <animepdf> Well, creating (mostly copying) all needed functionality to antibot sounds like a lot of pain and wasted time. So what was the CUnpacker issue? Also do you have own realization of it in AB?
11:57 < bridge> <animepdf> Well, creating (mostly copying) all needed functionality to antibot sounds like a lot of pain and wasted time. So what was the CPacker issue? Also do you have own realization of it in AB?
11:58 < bridge> <learath2> We got lazy and used CPacker on the antibot, for like the first time in a decade someone made an ABI breaking change in CPacker. It started crashing because old antibot module new server
12:01 < bridge> <animepdf> That's weird, even if CPacker changed in server binary, shouldn't old version of it be compiled into AB? ABI gives only m_pfnSend that accepts raw data, all packing is made purely on AB side(at least in my AB)
12:02 < bridge> <learath2> That's not how it's linked up
12:03 < bridge> <animepdf> So it's really *linked* to server, I though it was simply copied to AB binary
12:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk which message you mean o.0 could you resend it?
12:04 < bridge> <learath2> It's really hard to know if we are both talking about the same thing, but yes it is truly actually linked if you make calls into the server
12:05 < bridge> <woidless> How do I specify the number of percentages of people from the total number of online users on the server who must press f3 in order for the vote to be completed
12:06 < bridge> <animepdf> I'm talking about classes like CPacker, I thought they are compiled into AB so it uses own standalone version of it, but looks like it's referencing server's CPacker instead and is dependent of it
12:08 < bridge> <animepdf> This makes everything much more complicated. I guess I will migrate my AB to very standalone project that will use own classes instead of referencing, I hope this will make it independent of server realization. But I'm scared to think how much it will weight
12:08 < bridge> <animepdf> Imagine 5mb libantibot.so
12:08 < bridge> <animepdf> :monkaStop:

12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oh yea ofc 508 is the correct one. Thanks @kollpotato i recently re counted it and only updated it in one place. Thanks for reporting @kollpotato 
12:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> np :D
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @hakanulgen download this unzip it and double click on DDNet-Server.exe then login as admin in f2 (rcon console) and type in ``sv_gametype dm`` and then ``reload`` https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/ddnet-windows-latest.zip

14:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> hehe copy paste
14:50 < bridge> <woidless> And then what
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1731678647.png here it tells you you don't have a c compiler installed
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a new system ships without the needed depdencies to build ddnet so you got to install them once using apt
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies-on-linux--macos
14:53 < bridge> <woidless> After he downloads it all:cd DDNetPP/build and is needed 
14:53 < bridge> <woidless> cmake ..
14:53 < bridge> <woidless> make
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if he is still in the build folder he does not need the cd
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yes running ``cmake ..`` and ``make`` again in the build directory
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 why most tools default to at&t syntax?
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> intel looks way easier and sane
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @hakanulgen are you german? o.O
14:59 < bridge> <hakanulgen> nah
14:59 < bridge> <hakanulgen> turkish
15:00 < bridge> <hakanulgen> can you come again

15:04 < bridge> <woidless> what to do
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can you show more of the error message?
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what kind of system is that?
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what does ``cat /etc/os-release`` show
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and ``g++ --version``
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> I honestly don't know this one. I also don't know anyone who uses att syntax
15:08 < bridge> <woidless> linux
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea that much i assumed xd
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but which distro which version

15:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> get debian 12
15:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where did your friend get a server? is it new? can he select debian 12 instead of debian 10?
15:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if there is no option to run a newer debian you have to update your self for example following this https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-upgrade-debian-10-to-debian-11/
15:15 < bridge> <woidless> He asked to install Debian 12
15:15 < bridge> <woidless> Just in case, ChillerDragon, write what to do next, I remember that you will go to bed soon
15:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you have debian 12 it will be as easy as on your machine
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just clone and build like you already tried
15:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ChillerDragon I actually got the same error about CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER as well, but that was right after installing both the compiler and cmake, on a system with like a year of uptime, but it compiled just fine when I manually specified the env var as g++
15:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oof that was an ugly sentence...
15:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> main point: it's possible for that to show up even if you have a compiler
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> main point: you can starve even if you have food in the fridge
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @inv41idu53rn4m3 that sounds cursed if you have a healthy up to date system and a compiler installed with apt then cmake should find it
15:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk if it's very healthy, I haven't really done any active maintenance on it

15:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have debian 12 btw

15:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and if it's not a home computer I would absolutely not recommend trying anything Windows related
15:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> running a vm is another option

16:38 < bridge> <teero777> does this work for structs/classes?
16:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes, prints `class CMyClass` for example
16:39 < bridge> <teero777> ah nice
16:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> *((char*)this + 5) = -1
16:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> Jokes on you you just overwrote the first byte of a uint32 as 0b11111111. This happened to be a size of an array. The array is then iterated over and causes a segfaults, but not before writing to a bunch of things out of bounds causing an accidental zero day which deletes the French language pack from your system, bricking it. 
16:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> Reading from it if you stay inside the object should be safe (or if you're in an array even further). But writing can cause unsafe stuff
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> It's not the writing that causes ub as long as that pointer is still within the object
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> The dereferencing, reading, writing, all are fine. It's the rest of your program that causes ub by respecting that new length and writing beyond the object
17:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> mmm
17:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> oke
17:02 < bridge> <learath2> (You are right that it's usually not a great idea and will cause unexpected stuff, but "undefined behaviour" is a very specific thing and you need to be exact about what is UB and what isn't because C/C++ is just very strict about it)

17:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> There's UB you need to be scared of and UB that just gets regularly abused for convenience
17:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> because it isn't all *that* undefined

17:08 < bridge> <learath2> - Learn to code, start from fokkonaut's ddnet PR and fix that up
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> - Beg one of the 2 people that have decently well working implementations of it to implement it for you

17:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I remember watching this :P
17:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> do older clients accept more than 64 clients, but just cant show them?
17:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> fokkonauts playground laready has 128 slots and i can join fine
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> Some "engineer" at youtube decided to remove the confirmation before changing the video that is currently being cast to tv. So clicking that link made me lose my place in a 1h video essay
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> No they don't. All implementations of 128p use an id mapping, they map the 128 players to 64 closest/most likely to interact with players
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> No they don't. All implementations of 128p use an id mapping, they map the 128 players to 64, using heuristic measures like closest/most likely to interact with players
17:11 < bridge> <reitw> bw historically goes up to 256p and works the same, tho I never use it lmao
17:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Any MSVC enjoyers? I gen an error when I try make a typedef for `size_t`: `'size_t': redefinition; different basic types`(C btw). For some reason in MSVC  `size_t` can be used without including a header file, is there a compiler flag which can change this behavior or maybe a macro which indicates that the type is defined :\
17:11 < bridge> <reitw> (multiple maps, single server instance)
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> Why are you typedefing size_t?
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh no
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's dirty hacks all the way down
17:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> can clients support 128 clients and not do this jank?
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> It's somewhere in the roadmap for ddnet to get native 128p support or n player support
17:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ddnet client already does this I think?
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> Soon(tm) as in hopefully within the next 6 months üòÑ
17:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wait no I'm dum
17:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but like, doesn't the player list support that?
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt that just setting MAX_CLIENTS to 128 and call it done?
17:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok but then won't it break for older clients?
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> I think we had snap size issues :/
17:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> when /show-everyone-which-i-can-seee-when-zoomed-out-instead-of-actually-everyone-cuz-thats-dumb
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea that makes sense but whats the solution for that? increase snap size?
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> If you want to up it to 128 and test it out it would be appreciated
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> Also there are 64 wide masks that need to be widened to `std::bitset<MAX_CLIENTS>`

17:15 < bridge> <woidless> This change to 128!
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am too tired now. But I have the feeling there has to be some low hangung fruit that could already be released now on the client side to later not have to use player mappings anymore
17:16 < bridge> <woidless> This change to 128?
17:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> gcc long long long anyone?
17:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> gcc __int128 anyone?
17:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless not it requires quite a bit of writing actual code to get 128 players to work. Remind me tomorrow and I can have a look.
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> But then we'll talk about this again in 2034 when upping it to 256p
17:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> yep
17:17 < bridge> <woidless> Ok
17:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> at that point __int256 will be a thing xd
17:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> supported by only 128 bit architectures
17:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> this is al a /j btw
17:18 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon maybe I'll remind you about slow motion tomorrow? It's not like making it. And choose the actions that need to be done in tune to slow down or accelerate
17:18 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if we'll ever get 128b architectures. The size of the address/data bus seems to be enough for pretty much everything we can imagine for now üòÑ
17:18 < bridge> <robyt3> I think that was fixed or are there some remaining? We have a `typedef std::bitset<MAX_CLIENTS> CClientMask;`
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, cool
17:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> ugh yeah but what if im in the year 292,277,026,596.927,714,913,658???
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 client side masks? For predictions?
17:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well we *do* already have 512 bit registers on some CPUs...
17:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> avx registers for storing bitsets?
17:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> hehe
17:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, pretty sure you can do bitwise operations on them, wouldn't make sense to not have the basics in there
17:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> probably slower than just doing it 64 bits at a time lol
17:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeap
17:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> As for performance, how many tees can we handle before it becomes an issue?
17:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess network would be the biggest bottleneck
17:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> bros are running ddnet at 1000s of frames per second
17:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> so yes network
17:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> since actually processing a few thousand tees would be nothing
17:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> also alot of people play with /showall which is a huuuuuge waste
17:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> /showall needs to be nukes
17:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> /showall needs to be nuked
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> I think 512 was breaking down with the current code
17:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> :poggers2:
17:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We need a distributed Teeworlds server, make an MMO, call it World of Tees
17:40 < bridge> <teero777> jupstar can handle more i thik
17:40 < bridge> <teero777> jupstar can handle more i think
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> That's why I said current code, without touching much. His rewrite in rust can indeed do much more
17:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> because there's no existing typedef for it
17:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> what rewrite in rust o-o?

18:07 < bridge> <learath2> `_kernel_size_t` perhaps?
18:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> im coming from javascript sooo
18:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> its better
18:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> ffmpeg doesnt do rendering
18:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> and i already have ffmpeg installed
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> for rendering videos i mean
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> like demo to mp4 encoding
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> There is plenty of uses of `size_t` in the kernel, idk what your issue is tbh
18:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> o i guess that is fair, but you can hook ffmpeg to your window
18:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> it doesnt need to be a compile time dependency
18:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> languages that ship with package managers are dangerous because they end up with stupid dependency trees for basic apps
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> ask @jupeyy_keks
18:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> and if anything should be installed for it, it should be a c -> rust compat layer
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> but it is?
18:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> its probably a dependency of a dependency cuz rust
18:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the difficulty of handling dependencies for C makes the software better lol
18:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even
18:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm making a linux kernel module and I can use `size_t` and everything works, but I'm also making a library which can be used by the kernel module
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, cpp ends up with manual bootstrapping of such xddd
18:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> also takes many years
18:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307029851156385822/image.png?ex=6738d1e7&is=67378067&hm=909a52dab806e87ea047708db74993603e4f10a6426417fa2031b24022fae7ca&
18:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg ai
18:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> and a good internet connection
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> you can download it once and work as you wish
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I don't want to include any kernel related headers so I did this https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/ddnet_protocol/blob/master/src/common.h
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> offline i mean
18:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> how else do you expect audio to work
18:11 < bridge> <teero777> audio?? xd
18:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> ffmpeg shouldnt handle audio playing
18:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> and that would be ffplay anyway
18:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> ofc audio, noone would be crazy enough to use it for videos!
18:11 < bridge> <teero777> xddd
18:11 < bridge> <zhn> xd
18:11 < bridge> <teero777> stop troll
18:11 < bridge> <aegisub> ddnet doesn't just shell out to ffmpeg, it uses libavcodec/libavformat (the libraries making up ffmpeg) to encode directly, which is much more robust
18:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> Why can't your library not include stddef? I don't get that part. Is your compiler misconfigured or sth?
18:12 < bridge> <learath2> Why can't your library include stddef? I don't get that part. Is your compiler misconfigured or sth?
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> just grep ffmpeg in sources and look what it is used for
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> ‚ôø
18:13 < bridge> <aegisub> you'd need to grep for av or avcodec
18:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I can include it in normal projects but it doesn't work with kernel module :\
18:13 < bridge> <teero777> this is not about ddnet
18:14 < bridge> <zhn> but we are talking about ddnet-pg, not ddnet
18:14 < bridge> <zhn> ddnet ofc doesn't use full ffmpeg bundle, but seems ddnet-pg does
18:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> no more issues allowed
18:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307031146688938044/image.png?ex=6738d31c&is=6737819c&hm=3e04121bb39ffacdfec833335c9fcfd6c3633f54bbb317414f2e6f1cc68939e1&
18:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh god...
18:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307031217702437015/image.png?ex=6738d32d&is=673781ad&hm=b1ab07c613331744b98fd1b01afd19d677fda0820dd01603026033853d022c13&
18:15 < bridge> <aegisub> ah I didn't read enough backlog it seems
18:15 < bridge> <learath2> The kernel itself includes stddef all over the place, so it's not like a rule or sth. Anyway, idk
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but it means it wouldnt be a compiletime dependency but runtime optional dependency
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> which is yipee
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307031419058651177/image.png?ex=6738d35d&is=673781dd&hm=13ad63c6ba2f5a83f7a434cc5afa57bbc55360da1ba570a7dd46cc8ee656a7a2&
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> also it feels like teeworlds
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> very ... rough in every way but it works :D
18:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> reminder that ddnet is just a teeworlds mod, so it makes sense :kek:
18:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> crashed after a minute of gameplay for me
18:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> but it worked
18:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> so epic
18:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> i had to host a local server
18:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> skill issue, i played hours of gores on it
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> can it join normal servers nowadays?
18:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> skill issue, i played hours of gores on it, and i also beat @gerdoe in a few rounds of ctf
18:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> in (old) ddrace servers
18:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> ?
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> skill issue, played insta for hours on it
18:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> iirc jupsti doesnt intend it
18:17 < bridge> <aegisub> this is still true though
18:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> iirc jupsti doesnt intend for it to be compatible
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> I thought Jupstar was intentionally never going to support normal ddnet/teeworlds protocol
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, mister 20 ping
18:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> ye
18:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> skill issue
18:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> skill issue, i touched grass for hours
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, it doesn't :justatest:
18:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> dd-pg feels like ddnet with antiping on by default, it felt like cheating
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> i had 60-9999 ping, still playable enough
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> dd-pg is better in most ways imo
18:19 < bridge> <learath2> It's such a shame that's the direction he took with it
18:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> is he going to make a brand new protocol or what?
18:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> he mentioned he will allow modifications when he releases it
18:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> so we might see that at some point
18:19 < bridge> <learath2> It'll cause unimaginable amounts of migration pain and community splitting for absolutely 0 reason
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> my insta is ready for tweaking :brownbear:
18:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> my zombies can't wait to be implemented üí•
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> for 0 reason?
18:20 < bridge> <learath2> Ok -1 reason
18:20 < bridge> <teero777> it is a different game
18:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> he'll sell dd-pg, "for only 29,99$"
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> he literally remade teeworlds in rust with accounts in mind
18:20 < bridge> <learath2> A different game that looks and behaves almost exactly the same way as another
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> i wouldn't say he had 0 reasons to do it
18:21 < bridge> <learath2> Many reasons to give ddnet/teeworlds a proper rewrite. 0 reasons not to properly support the current set of mods
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> he was tired of needing to do backwards compatible things and getting nowhere
18:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> we can do that together when he releases it
18:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> wasm ftw
18:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> ok i stop trolling
18:22 < bridge> <teero777> remaking the mods is easier than maintaining backwards compatibility for the next 10 years
18:22 < bridge> <teero777> also mods in dd-pg are much more powerful
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> When he releases it properly one project is definitely going to die off. We barely have the people to maintain this project let alone give it a complete rewrite in wasm to support dd-pg
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> since ddnet 2.0 was a thing as an idea of throwing out old ddnet/teeworlds i wouldn't say it either
18:23 < bridge> <teero777> twgame exists already with most stuff implemented
18:23 < bridge> <teero777> dd-pg uses that currently as a physics module and it works quite well
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> didn't heinrich make his own proper protocol based on quic?
18:23 < bridge> <teero777> even tho many things are not done yet
18:23 < bridge> <learath2> Just remember me when the game dies, that's all I ask
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> You can tell people there was this old 80 year old dude that warned us that breaking 10 years worth of mods wasn't the best idea
18:24 < bridge> <zhn> bruh, i heard that almost on every major release
18:24 < bridge> <zhn> better thing will live, thats all
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> quic is just wrapping the already existing protocol 1 to 1, it's a different transport, not a different protocol
18:24 < bridge> <zhn> 0.5 died, 0.6 lived
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> 0.7 bappened, 0.7 died
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> We had the time, the people and the talent to port ddnet to 0.6. We have none of the above nowadays
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> wait so there was no work done on making a better protocol?
18:26 < bridge> <zhn> because 0.5 and 0.6 were pretty similar, aren't they
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> There is no need for a "better" protocol as was mentioned to you many times now. The protocol is just fine except for the fact that it contains some crud
18:26 < bridge> <zhn> code wise, protocol wise
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> Almost exactly the same, the bulk of the work was that a lot of code was moved around by ddrace and by teeworlds, so when 0.6 came out merging the two was almost impossible
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> Hours and hours of resolving merge conflicts and testing, but as I said back then we had much more time on hand with more people
18:28 < bridge> <learath2> btd was still around, greyfox was here
18:28 < bridge> <zhn> so still we will have no server side assets, no dynamic map chunk patching, etc
18:28 < bridge> <learath2> Those have nothing to do with quic, correct
18:28 < bridge> <zhn> and it doesn't solely depend on protocol, map format should be reconsidered too as it was discussed many times before
18:29 < bridge> <zhn> i don't argue about quic being a new protocol, i was thinking that heinrich tries to improve existing one *and* implement quic base for it
18:29 < bridge> <zhn> nothing else
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> "the protocol" isn't stopping you from implementing these, it's perfectly capable of expressing these things
18:29 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, tell me
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> quic is mostly just replacing udp 1 to 1, and giving us transport security, the second one is needed for accounts to be secure
18:29 < bridge> <zhn> backcompat is part of ddnet and it was the only reason why jupstar did it
18:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> holdon i got an xkcd for that
18:30 < bridge> <zhn> if ddnet eould not support older clients we would not have to see this reimplementation
18:30 < bridge> <zhn> jupstar would just work on that in current codebase
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> And when he does finish up and release his work you can all have fun with your shiny new clients playing vanilla
18:31 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, i will praise it, because its better and more flexible
18:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> certainly, at the cost of throwing away a decade of modding
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> thousands and thousands of human hours spent on developing all the mods that have to be completely re-done
18:32 < bridge> <zhn> we will be able to make more stuff with it anyway
18:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> i think u want roblox (that is a game engine which has inherit multiplayer functionality which can do anything)
18:33 < bridge> <zhn> and since wasm modules are reusable, these will be easily transferred
18:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> a framework for ddnet servers
18:33 < bridge> <zhn> its called game engine smh
18:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> can you.. read the thing in brackets
18:33 < bridge> <zhn> and yes modders always considered teeworlds as game engine with its own constraints
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> you'll slowly recreate the mods we currently have, while slowly leeching off players and devs, which will kill both because both will end up too small to be sustainable
18:34 < bridge> <sollybunny> not all game engines have inherit multiplayer functionality, and those which do often require a lot of code to do so or are easy to cheat on
18:34 < bridge> <zhn> although oy would always say opposite
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> many an open source project died this exact death, fork -> dev split -> not enough dev time for either -> dead project
18:35 < bridge> <zhn> does anyone force all the devs to move to dd pg?
18:35 < bridge> <zhn> i don't see it
18:35 < bridge> <zhn> also we don't have so much active developers to be actually split
18:35 < bridge> <learath2> No, but dd-pg needs dev time and there is a finite amount of it unless you think new developers are going to show up to help recreate the library of mods
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, think whatever you like. I'm just making a prediction based on what I've seen happen to other projects and what I've seen happen within this project. You obviously disagree, that's fine
18:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> if this is an election im siding with the "dont fork or split anything, jupeey can do whatever they want, if it attracts people then let it"
18:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well the rust cult is pretty good at doing just that...
18:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> They love rewriting things :)
18:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> wd40 keep me safe üëª
18:39 < bridge> <learath2> Hopefully someone will implement a compatibility layer to solve it, but given the amount of activity we have nowadays that's even doubtful
18:39 < bridge> <zhn> the only developers we actually have to contribute to ddnet upstream are... robyt3, because no one else wants to waste their time on thing they implemented in their own fork to be closed just like any other major prs we had. i don't say that there's no reason to close them but that's the thing
18:39 < bridge> <zhn> the only great thing that was added from another fork is fokkos 128 id mapping, thats all i can recall for now
18:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307037397921300541/image.png?ex=6738d8ef&is=6737876f&hm=76ce0ae70608fa8ca0e1168536fcbdfeddd374315e89201d094c870140a4eabc&
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> You and I obviously have very different ideas on how this project is supposed to run, so it's quite normal we disagree
18:40 < bridge> <zhn> so what?
18:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> das alot of people
18:41 < bridge> <zhn> ye, but i still don't see any reason for cpp developers to split over rust project
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> There is a limited amount of developers in general, most of us know both C++ and Rust. There won't be random Rustaceans showing up to write mods
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> There is a limited amount of developers in general that are interested in teeworlds/ddnet, most of us know both C++ and Rust. There won't be random Rustaceans showing up to write mods
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> It's understandable people are annoyed that not everything is getting merged and getting things merged is the only way to mod this game properly
18:43 < bridge> <zhn> i was about to say that we have less rustaceans than cpp enjoyers there
18:43 < bridge> <zhn> at least most active ones, i.e chiller and robyt3
18:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> u can do alot of server side only. the problem is alot of mods are unmaintaed, not open source and hard to find
18:43 < bridge> <learath2> This is also exactly why ddrace moved away from teeworlds client, providing a smooth experience requires client support
18:44 < bridge> <zhn> history repeats itself, eh
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> Not really, we were all extremely careful not to break backwards compatibility so as to ensure a unified playerbase and not splitting the community
18:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> i just played on vanilla 0.6, still works fine
18:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> :D
18:45 < bridge> <zhn> all other clients died just because they needed to handle with ddrace support, didn't they?
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> All other clients died just because the ddrace client was just technically superior and a superset to all of them
18:46 < bridge> <zhn> and all major cool stuff just was merged in ddrace client, just to not waste time duplicating it
18:46 < bridge> <zhn> not vanilla ones
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> ddnet is just a continuation of ddrace, so now that's the most useful client
18:46 < bridge> <zhn> gamer and tdtw are still better in ui ux way for vanilla
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> Vanilla died in general, how many people play it now, 20-30?
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> If there were more players there would be popular maintained vanilla clients
18:47 < bridge> <zhn> we have at least 30 russian vanilla player rn, i don't know numbers from eu and us
18:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> i wana play some ctf ):
18:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> the non i/g kind
18:48 < bridge> <zhn> newbies enter vanilla mods and ask us "new mod?"
18:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> the kind where its 8 per side on ctf5 and its 100 100 (both sides captured the flag 100 times)
18:48 < bridge> <zhn> theh also tend to play on ddnet vanilla servers, they just don't see any other
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, the lack of actively maintained vanilla clients is not because vanilla clients didn't handle ddrace well. It's because there are no active developers in the vanilla sphere
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> ddrace based clients are just easier to maintain because you can piggyback off of our maintainance of it
18:50 < bridge> <zhn> imagine trying to handle ddrace updates with client you code solely
18:50 < bridge> <zhn> ofc they dropped it
18:51 < bridge> <learath2> They dropped it because these developers aren't involved much at all with the game anymore. Gamer client is by Dune, he had 6 contributions in the last 5 years
18:52 < bridge> <zhn> it's one of the reasons, not the only one
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> psychogod was active enoug but still dropped tdtw
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> psychogod was active enough but still dropped tdtw
18:53 < bridge> <totar> What does ddpg offer to players over ddnet? I find hard to envision it replacing ddnet unless it's an official switch
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> If there was a demand for a vanilla client, there would be a maintained vanilla client based on ddnet at the very least, if you think ddrace support is so important that it'd kill the client
18:54 < bridge> <zhn> every good vanilla player has their own tweaked ddnet client with few adjustments :)
18:54 < bridge> <zhn> and that's thr way how small things like clan in spectators come into ddnet
18:55 < bridge> <zhn> proper modding api, an actual modding
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> It can only be an official switch if we somehow find hundreds and hundreds of hours to reimplement ddrace as a wasm module with the 3 Rust developers we have around that are all so busy that they either don't contribute nowadays or only do maintainance
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> Also all the old ranks need to play back perfectly on the newly reimplemented ddrace, and we have to support both dd-pg based clients and old clients at least for a while because we can't just drop support for it completely overnight
18:56 < bridge> <totar> This isn't a direct offer to players, it's indirect
18:57 < bridge> <zhn> client mods xd
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> Way more fps, probably more stable once it's released because Rust, and in the future when there are people around to make mods for it it's more flexible so stuff like the old nodes mod
18:58 < bridge> <totar> Way more?
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> didn't you test it?
18:58 < bridge> <totar> Surely 5000 -> 20000 is not important?
18:59 < bridge> <zhn> we have players that owe computers handling ddnet at less thab 100 fps
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> It's not imo but I've given up on that discussion long ago. I now pretend it matters
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> It's always better to have more frametime available anyway, you can do more
19:01 < bridge> <totar> I guess but you need to do physics which is kinda fundamental limited
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> Surely these ancient machines can't run dd-pg anyway, it needs vulkan
19:02 < bridge> <learath2> Our physics are tied to ticks, not fps, so I guess frametime doesn't have much to do with it
19:02 < bridge> <zhn> i mean the ones with vulkan, even
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> What toaster that is new enough to support vulkan properly runs ddnet at less than 100 fps? My intel atom netbook with igpu still ran it at like 150 last year when I checked
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, all of this is beyond the point. I've delivered my grand prediction. I'll go make some food
19:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> can we remove rust from ddnet, its just annoying x-x
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> It's about to get an actual use soon(tm)
19:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> (removing all the stubs from client removes 1mb of the executable and)
19:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> (removing all the stubs from client removes 1mb of the executable and probably speeds up compile time)
19:07 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6961
19:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> couldnt be done in cpp?
19:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> too late now not telling heinrich to redo their work xd
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> could be, but it isn't
19:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> *sigh*
19:11 < bridge> <totar> My point was vague sorry, I meant if you need to spend 1/1000th of a second to do physics the extra frames don't increase smoothness.
19:11 < bridge> <totar> Unless you have a separate thread
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, it is technically quantized but we interpolate, so it might look smoother
19:12 < bridge> <louis> well i'd guess the indirect benefits would be the reason people switch if they do
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> but my point with frametime was that you can do other stuff, you just need to update physics at the correct times
19:15 < bridge> <montikboom> is there any way to fix this? the half of mine server is this "bots"

19:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> uncheck show connecting players
19:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> if htis is ur server then uhhhh idk
19:16 < bridge> <montikboom> how
19:16 < bridge> <louis> in the filter settings
19:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307046621703438417/image.png?ex=6738e186&is=67379006&hm=cecfff81805b716a49cf5052c8aeb0617e258572d78e0859605d8ee81575d1e2&
19:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> turn on "filter connecting players"
19:18 < bridge> <zhn> bon appetite, big boy
19:18 < bridge> <montikboom> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307046983038402580/image.png?ex=6738e1dc&is=6737905c&hm=1c0689a55334aebb1354b54a2e98088fb38490449e8b6b59f204f7e200cd5681&
19:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> huh
19:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> idk ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
19:18 < bridge> <montikboom> this "players" is not letting other join game
19:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> this is called a slow loris attack
19:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> theres probably some setting somewhere to turn timeout to really low
19:19 < bridge> <montikboom> where?
19:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> *finding*
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> `conn_timeout`
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> but youre probably better off banning the ips
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> because they can just reconnect after
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> because they can just reconnect afterwards
19:20 < bridge> <montikboom> this in f2?
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> set it to like 10 or something
19:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> idk if its in ticks or seconds
19:21 < bridge> <montikboom> i put 5
19:21 < bridge> <montikboom> ty, this worked
19:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> cool
19:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> if its automated the bots r probably still connecting over an over again
19:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> so u should probably ban by ip
19:22 < bridge> <zhn> seconds
19:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> why is it 100 by default then
19:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats maaaasive
19:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> is it for map download?
19:23 < bridge> <zhn> i was connecting to one brazil server for almost 2 minutes, so its gut xd
19:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> .-.
20:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> How do I iterate over the game layer using twmap and place a specific tile from a layer based on the game tile?
20:15 < bridge> <zhn> you mean copy game layout into tiles layout?
20:15 < bridge> <zhn> design layer i mean
20:16 < bridge> <zhn> @fokkonaut
20:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
20:17 < bridge> <zhn> look up imilsch's exporter from gores generator
20:17 < bridge> <zhn> lemme send link
20:18 < bridge> <zhn> https://github.com/iMilchshake/gores-mapgen/blob/main/src/twmap_export.rs
20:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Thanks
20:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> How does it work for bash?
20:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: maybe
20:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> `m.groups[16].layers[0].color = (234, 234, 234, 255)`
20:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This is how to modify color of a tile layer
20:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> cant find a doc about twmap to get and set a tile from that layer
20:28 < bridge> <louis> are u using the python version?
20:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
20:30 < bridge> <louis> i think u have to use help(twmap.Map) and find the layers attribute
20:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh, okay lemme see
20:31 < bridge> <louis> if you want to modify a design layer then u need to find the index of the layer it corresponds to
20:31 < bridge> <louis> if u want to extract game tile layers:
20:31 < bridge> <louis> ```py
20:31 < bridge> <louis> with open(map_path, 'r') as file:
20:31 < bridge> <louis>         map_data = twmap.Map(map_path)
20:31 < bridge> <louis> game_layer = map_data.game_layer().tiles
20:31 < bridge> <louis> front_layer = map_data.front_layer().tiles
20:31 < bridge> <louis> ...
20:31 < bridge> <louis> ```
20:35 < bridge> <kebscs> people will have 5000 instead of 4000 fps at the small cost of full rewrite and no new updates
20:35 < bridge> <kebscs> ü§ù
20:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> worth it
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> i agree
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> totally worth it
20:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> ü•î ü§ù ü•î
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> ü•î
20:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm the right potato
20:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> for some reason it doesnt seem to load the map into python
21:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> m = twmap.Map(sys.argv[1])
21:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> this does crash silently
21:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> map is in the same path + admin cmd
21:11 < bridge> <zhn> huh
21:18 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> hi again, how to get position and timer value by player id?
21:21 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> :nouis:
21:25 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> in server side
21:33 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> pls help üò©
21:36 < bridge> <kebscs> CGameTeams::OnFinish has finish time, can probably find timer same way
21:37 < bridge> <kebscs> position is in CCharacterCore
21:39 < bridge> <kebscs> int CurrTime = (pSelf->Server()->Tick() - pChr->m_StartTime) / pSelf->Server()->TickSpeed();
21:41 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> thank you
21:47 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> i write in server.cpp. how to get pChr by id?(for(int i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++))
21:51 < bridge> <robyt3> You can't use the character data in the engine (`server.cpp`), check `gamecontext.cpp` and `gamecontroller.cpp` for other loops with `i < MAX_CLIENTS` condition
22:14 < bridge> <murpi> @essigautomat https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot/issues/87 Could you clarify what the command is supposed to do? You mentioned twmap-check, but I assume you meant twmap-check-ddnet?
22:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> just have the ddnet bot check it the same way it checks skins etc - (e.g in dms) ?
22:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> or is that to heavy on the bot
22:40 < bridge> <Assa> yes exactly, I know that you can Download compile and run this tool, but thats not really accessible for the majority
22:41 < bridge> <Assa> also I did a PR for patiga in order to check tunings üòÅ
22:45 < bridge> <Assa> fixed the description
22:45 < bridge> <Assa> fixed the description for discordbot issue
22:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there any kind of rule when to use references vs pointers? :p
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> except when pointer should be possible to be null
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> except when pointer can be null
23:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> except when null pointer can be passed
