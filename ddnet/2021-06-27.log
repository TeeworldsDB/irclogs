00:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do players reconnect on each map chnage?
00:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do players reconnect on each map change?
00:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> looks like not
00:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> looks like yep
00:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> when you have 0 jumps (after hitting that x jump switch tile) you can still jump on stoppers, is that intended?
01:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Sorah I blame you
09:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have made maps abusing this pls no fix
09:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> oof
09:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> ~~feature~~
13:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> my idea was to fix it before it lays eggs xd, idk if it breaks something to change it
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> `air_jump_impulse 1` is your fix
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> `air_jump_impulse 0` is your fix
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> bad fix
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
20:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> someone know how to fix this? that happen when the server crash, the port is still working
20:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/858781117464707072/unknown.png
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i need to shutdown my pc or change the port in autoexec.cfg
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could use something like SO_REUSEPORT
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but why is your server crashing in the first place?
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is it still running in the background maybe?
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i am testing something so shutdown the server manually is too long, everytime i want to build/start the server i press ctrl+c is the console
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> and no
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use htop and search if ur server still there as a zombie or smth
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> some application is still running
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/858783726062534666/unknown.png
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there it is
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> there is a way to force the shutdown?
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> pkill
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/how-anthony-mennella-culter35-how-did-you-do-that-how-to-do-it-gif-20143672
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pkill name
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should work
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can also add a signal handler to your code, and just use std::exit or smth if u don't care about the type of signal
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i thought pkill <pid>
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does it really work with name as parameter?
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh i guess
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can test
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> works for me
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> thx
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> <a:leftlick:765697937643929612>Jupstar<a:rightlick:765697930694361108>
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol xd
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey, will know
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey, good to know
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbf i've no idea if thats intended by that program (originally), but often these programs get extended,
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vi also starts vim for me
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its like a superset xd
