00:54 <@deen> Trax: hi
01:06 < Trax> anyone here?
01:13 <@deen> Trax: yes
01:13 < Trax> Hey deen ich schreib dir mal Privat
01:18 <@heinrich5991> \o/
01:23 <@deen> hi heinrich5991 
01:24 <@heinrich5991> hi :)
01:24 <@heinrich5991> what's up?
01:36 <@deen> trying to debug weird connection issues Trax is having to GER
01:36 <@deen> Trax: you could also try to post it on ddnet forum, maybe other people have the same problem or had it once
05:59 < ciderxD> hi
06:02 < ciderxD> i am the guy behind the attacks to the master servers xD, its req2 flood with random spoofed source ips, source port, ip header id and  correct checksums, bye!
06:02 < ciderxD> :D
06:02 < ciderxD> wanna the script?
06:03 < ciderxD> no, ok never XD
09:34 < ciderXD> flooding masters now XD
09:34 < ciderXD> im apple
09:35 < ciderXD> :F
09:36 <@EastByte> what has it todo with ddnet?
09:36 < ciderXD> give me love
09:36 < ciderXD> i need love
09:36 < ciderXD> well ddnet has master server :-|
09:38 <@EastByte> so? you are just killing general 0.6 servers
09:38 < ciderXD> yes
09:38 < ciderXD> mm
09:38 <@EastByte> doesn't affect the ddnet servers though
09:38 < ciderXD> i know
09:38 < ciderXD> im learning
09:39 < ciderXD> this is for educational purposes
09:39 < ciderXD> later i affect ddnet
09:40 <@EastByte> well, then learn how to 'affect' ddnet in the first place and don't attack teeworlds
09:40 < ciderXD> i understand now 100% the ip header, etc :D
09:41 < ciderXD> i said i would destroy teeworlds anyways, because i will abduct girls and nobody believe me nobody give me love
09:42 < ciderXD> you fixed the info req but if i overload the server bandwidth it will affect the server anyways
09:42 < ciderXD> im gonna buy enough spoofable servers later
09:43 < ciderXD> when i finish learning
09:43 <@EastByte> "im gonna buy enough spoofable servers later"
09:43 <@EastByte> and this is where you gonna fail
09:43 < ciderXD> why?
09:44 <@EastByte> well, if it would be so easy, why did no one attack with strong ip spoofed attacks, yet?
09:44 < ciderXD> mm can you stop 1Gbit info req?
09:44 <@EastByte> depends on the server provider
09:45 < ciderXD> with correct checksums, and all random, source ip, source port, ip header id, ip header time to live, etc
09:45 < ciderXD> valid source ips
09:45 < ciderXD> or what about if i use ips from telekom for example?
09:46 < ciderXD> or the ips from players?
09:47 <@EastByte> has been done before but no one can effort strong ip spoofed attacks like you mentioned
09:47 < ciderXD> why no? money?
09:47 < ciderXD> i will become rich
09:47 <@EastByte> it doesn't matter whether the packets have proper characteristics
09:48 <@EastByte> nvm, gotta go, cya
09:48 < ciderXD> we will see
09:48 < ciderXD> cya
09:48 < ciderXD> <3
10:20 <+eeeee> dude
10:20 <+eeeee> he understand the ip header
10:20 <+eeeee> better not joke with him
10:21 < laxa> Roflmao
10:21 < laxa> Who is that kid ?
10:21 < laxa> Seems to have real mental issues...
14:23 <@deen> laxa: just a troll seeking attention, have a few of those running around DDNet
14:53 < laxa> deen: thanks
14:53 < laxa> Hey guys
14:53 < laxa> Question about C++
14:53 < laxa> I need to do a web API for a school project in C++
14:53 < laxa> would you try to do reflection use macro or hard code every route ?
14:53 < laxa> *using macros
14:55 < laxa> API is a simple CRUD on 3 endpoints
15:27 <+o_be_one> helo
17:04 <+o_be_one> hey did you seen that ? https://gameservermanagers.com/lgsm/twserver/
17:50 <@deen> i don't understand the use of server managers, so no
17:52 <+o_be_one> i think its not really useful, but maybe it could help noobis
17:52 <+o_be_one> and i think your didnt study enought this server manager
17:52 <+o_be_one> its not kind of shitty web manager ...
17:53 < Henningstone> setting up teeworlds servers is not that difficult... cmon, we are talkin' about teeworlds ^-^
17:53 <+o_be_one> its just some bash scripts, python too i think to do a server and offert start stop play debut status etc.
17:53 <+o_be_one> it works REALLY well (i use it for my steam game servers just cause i havent enough time to script everything, to teach my game masters how to use ssh, etc.)
17:54 <+o_be_one> Henningstone: no game is really hard to host ... and yes TW is really like a "small thing" to config
17:54 <+o_be_one> but i remember how i manage my own tw servers and how ddnet manages their servers, its absolutly not the same way
17:55 <+o_be_one> the ddnet organization is really better to expand in many servers hosting, not my old use
17:59 <@deen> the ddnet organization is just quick and dirty, it's a wonder it still works^^
18:08 <+o_be_one> thats what you think, it helped me a lot with r0x.tw organization ^^
18:09 < Soreu> rather that's what most think xd
18:09 <+o_be_one> and thanks to allow me to see this by using github :)
18:09 < Soreu> with no linux u barely can do something :c

21:29 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna install libboost-dev on my linux for Compile Server_Sql_release
21:29 < Hamid_Jigool> but
21:29 < Hamid_Jigool> there was error
21:30 < Hamid_Jigool> Reading state information... Done Package libboost-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source  E: Package 'libboost-dev' has no installation candidate
21:30 < Hamid_Jigool> whats this?
21:32 <@EastByte> looks like you have some apt source missing
21:33 <@EastByte> but I'm not familiar with debian, maybe deen can help?
21:34 < Hamid_Jigool> no when i type "apt-get update" its good... but if U think that this must be a problem show me a way to fix it
21:35 < Hamid_Jigool> its kali linux ... and on Ubuntu too... so in Ubunto and kali both have error
21:41 <+o_be_one> no problem they all here : http://screen.obeone.fr/sc_16-01-15_15-41.png
