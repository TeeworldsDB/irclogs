00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> What exactly is dfng, description looks fun
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Currently I am hosting on Repeek. Basicaly is fng but supporting ddnet tiles and multiple teams
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> fng with jetpacks :justatest:
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> :pepeH:
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> biggest advantage is zooz :gigachad:
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Currently I am hosting on Repeek. Basicaly is fng but supporting ddnet tiles and multiple teams and multiple spikes
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I thought zooz was intentionally disabled just for fng
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Antizooz on fng is snap radius
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> More efficient
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> We are approaching dfng differently. Plus zooz will help to level out differences between dyn and static users
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You can level them out with snap radius as well, but okay i guess, happy zoozing :troll:

01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Not Keks how does extract skin zip on skin db work
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or does it work at all

07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based
07:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Just upload a zip containing skins
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk didnt work for me
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Did it do nothing? Can you pm me the file
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for me it at least extracts it
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the network payload looks correct, so weird that it doesnt work
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> make sure the zip is an acutal zip, not smth like 7z
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate"
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is what i tested and works
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh i think its cuz it was 7z
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does somebody know someone here that was a relatively modern macOS computer, that does not use apple sillicon?
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> define relatively modern
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it support the metal API? ðŸ˜„

09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so yeah my point is actually if it can run moltenvk for ddnet's vulkan backend
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want to know if the FPS are also so weirdly capped like on M1 for other hardware
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or if apple somehow forces a max refresh rate to claim more efficiency xD
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can test for u if my setup fits what u need
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah would be cool
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you have homebrew?
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ys
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `brew install cmake ffmpeg freetype glew glslang googletest libpng molten-vk opusfile SDL2 spirv-tools vulkan-headers wavpack x264`
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you must compile the client with cmake .. -DVULKAN=ON
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which version client
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> best is just the ddnet master branch
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fyi i need to change some things to get ddnet to compile on my setup
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mostly a certain header and also certain math functions
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh are you on an outdated macos version?
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 10.15
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, is 12.x their current? ðŸ˜„

09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> would any version of ddnet 16+ work ? @Not Keks
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i already have a working copy
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but its not newst
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> il go do stuff while this stuff installs

09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the brew install went through without errors?
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> try removing ffmpeg
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah its cmake
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think ffmpeg is the proble
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well remove that too ðŸ˜„
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i nee cmake
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> right
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u already have it right? ðŸ˜„
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wont have it if i remove it (?)
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean remove it from the command line
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol

09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but maybe you did that in the past?
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doubt it
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that would explain why it cannot write to cmake
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why would i need to
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> no brew should not be run as root
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what does ls -l /usr/local/lib/ show?
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> ask the ``brew doctor`` he also knows about permissions
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> a lot of stuff
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then do what chiller says ðŸ˜„
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ChillerDragon: dont u also own macos
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> i do
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or did u install linux on it
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs u terminal hacker
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> i just didnt touch my macbook in ages
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> i hope it still boots
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> what does ``brew link spirv-tools`` say when you run it?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```brew link spirv-tools

09:40 <+ChillerDragon> why does it want to write to cmake?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> what even is spirvtools?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> virus that jupstar is making me install
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it wants to add cmake toolchain files probs
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> spirv is the shader bianry language
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> why cant it put that into /opt/homebrew ?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> basically bytecode for shaders
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> /usr/local sounds correct to me tbh
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that path usually for local modifications
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> ye but not /usr/local/lib/cmake
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i see a bunch of other libs installed in there
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> homebrew has its own folders
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what does the permissions say
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> more importantly, most of them are owend by me
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> nice
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but some are owned by root including cmake
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> most? xd
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye xd
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk how
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> then chown fix it
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that a good idea
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> idk
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> tbh
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why not xd
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> what could go wrong haha
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the question is, how did it end up like that
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u didnt run it as root
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what could go wrong doing random terminal commands
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably nothing
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> back in the days running brew as root was more common
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> old man noby
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i got this laptop in 2019
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is how my /use/local looks like
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1036198602827104316/unknown.png
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i also have to install with sudo
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> ``chown -R "$USER:$USER" /usr/local/lib/cmake``
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> changed $USER:$USER to something more correct then it let me symlink
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but still a lot of the other libs arent linked, and give various errors upon trying
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> leme finish cleaning some more and il take another look at it if its still needed
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just ask deen he is macos pro now
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if his /use/local also dont use root, then u did smth wrong some day xd
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if his /usr/local also dont use root, then u did smth wrong some day xd
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> Im having a hard time trying to understand what this even does :D https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/spirv-tools.rb
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im sure i did lol
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i just doubted it was specifically running brew as root since afaik it never let me
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> are you on Ventura yet?
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> brew did not use to complain back in the days
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> it was even in the ddnet readme
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> or teeworlds idk
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u remember if this was changed before or after 2019
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2146
09:49 <+ChillerDragon>  Jun 16, 2019
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there we have it
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thanks chiller drache
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> hehe
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> maybe yo ran da ``sudo brew install cmake``
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> because you are true vanilla maximalist following the readme in early 2019
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> you can check if your freetype and sdl is also owned by root
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> but that stuff should really be in a homebrew directory iirc something like /cellar/
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is there smth like `sudo brew doctor fix-all` so nobos like us can fix it xd
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> libfreetype is not root
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no idea waht i was trying to do that caused this lol
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> there is ``brew doctor`` and if it finds issues it prints commands you can run to fix them
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> brew is poggers
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> written in ruby
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> masterrace
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like half of sdl is root
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> but its so fucking slow
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> but brew can some cool stuff like build from source if binarys dont work and so on
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> do* xd
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Brew is such a shit package manager that you have to do some messed up shit to get it to install things, then it breaks in a later patch
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Jupstar âœª there is also linuxbrew if you wanna have some poggers package manger on your linux
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes totally want that
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> So who wants to explain packet ack to me and the sequence numbers
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> when looking at heinrichs dissector output the client just seems to spam the seq 10 and the server 4
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Both sides have their own seq number iirc
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the server sent 4 vital packets up to now. The client 10. I thiink that's the case
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> ah so you count the vital packets?
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> thats a good hint thanks
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both sides keep track of the last vital packet they received in order
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (they discard all others)
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then they request resends if vital packets are received out-of-order

13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you choose to send a password that compresses really well, the INFO packet might also get compressed
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for the nice blog post ðŸ™‚
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> is there a way to manage .map files with another thing that the teeworlds client ? i found an xml2map, but it was in 2008, and now its 404notfound
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is patiga's twmap
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> how does it work and <where i can find it ? is it public ?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is also a python binding for it if you prefer to use python
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> oh
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> insane
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> can you give me the python  one :D
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> please
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> got it
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> thanks

16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TheNoobestNoob> hello, i have a problem with something:
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TheNoobestNoob> i set up a class called CPoint which inherite from CEntity and here's the thing, for some reasons i can't call GetCharacter(), it says class "CCharacter" has no member "GetCharacter". any idea? includes seem ok and this error does not apply in older versions of ddnet (10.x)

18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Alexander_ with dxvk on windows it manages to load so far that i can see a cursor, which i also can move
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but it doesnt load the desktop and after a few seconds it hangs xD
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> oh xd
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> too bad
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you are missing features, please feel free to dm me them! :happy:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> Thanks !
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pinksky> Awesome work btw :)
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 is it 4 bits flags now or 6 bits? https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/d6813bf4c9e3da7f155e448c747b87dbb511fe96/src/engine/shared/network.h#L17 seems like your dissector claims that the first byte of the header is ``uuffffaa`` not ``ffffffaa`` as the comment claims. u=unused f=flags a=ack

21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gotroyb> Hello. I've prepared a patch so that ddnet client predicts the dfng behaviour correctly (all /teams are on the same world). It relies on the DDRACE and FNG gameinfo flags and does not introduce any new. Also, since dfng is mostly compatible with DDRace, would it make sense to use the same entities png? Also, it would be nice if players' color would get mixed with their /team color (nameplates already get that color). I'm not sure how easy w
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gotroyb> Also, I noticed that on DDNet 16.5 the client draws freezebar instead of the fng-like ninja stars at dfng. Is there a way to overcome this?

21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @noby ^
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: well, you can either say that the upper two flags are unused or that the upper two bits are unused
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it says the same thing
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe the comment could be updated
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I think I wrote both ðŸ˜…)
22:15 <+Sad> Hi all. Suppose I am a programmer looking forward to support the ddnet project in my free time. Is there something I should focus on?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we have 400 issues if you need a starting point ^^
22:16 <+Sad> Yeah, just had a look at those.
22:17 <+Sad> anything from that that you guys would give priority to?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> problem is lot of these issues arent easy fixes, or require quite some knowledge, or can easily introduce physic changes etc.
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but all issues with a bug label i'd consider a high prio
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> #5496 
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this one would be cool
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5496
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> for the patch should we also include the "updated" ddnet entities png? (we are preparing a PR)
22:42 <+deen> Sad: welcome, that's really cool. I'd recommend not changing physics :D Bug fixes are of course always welcome, lots of quality of life improvements possible in client
22:49 <+Sad> I promise, I won't touch physics! :D I'll just go through the issues and pick a few arbitrarily then or choose a few depending on my mood, I'll see when the time has come
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Is it possible to add milliseconds to race timer? Would be great
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think there id
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think there is
