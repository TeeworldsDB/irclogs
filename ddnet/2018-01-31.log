00:36 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: now
00:36 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: preferably, the vote code would use the Server()->Tick()s
00:36 <@heinrich5991> would make it a bit more deterministic
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> does anyone have an idea what map file is doing in website's root directory? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/Ice%20Cave.map
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it was for tournaments... or maybe not

09:02 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/tree/dd_pr_voting how do I write tests? :P
09:09 <@deen> Learath2: can you pass simulated votes into CVote?
09:09 <@deen> Otherwise make the interface of CVote so that you can test useful scenarios
09:10 <+Learath2> I do have a test file that doesn't work there
09:10 <@deen> added it in cmake?
09:10 <+Learath2> yeah
09:11 <@deen> strange
09:11 <+Learath2> I'll make it work with ticks first, it seems to be angry at me for using int64
09:11 <+Learath2> also how would you handle vote closing in tests? just a sleep? and how would you simulate tick time in tests?
