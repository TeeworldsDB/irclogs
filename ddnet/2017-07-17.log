02:41 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://heinrich5991.de/temp/downloader
02:42 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't do master server interaction
02:42 <@heinrich5991> give it an IP address on the command line and it'll try to download all the maps from the given server
02:52 <@heinrich5991> deen: permissions fixed btw
02:53 <@heinrich5991> and let's encrypt works on winxp nowadays
09:20 < Learath2> heinrich5991: how did they get le working on winxp? did they get their root signed by someone else?
09:21 <@deen> Learath2:
09:21 <@deen> In X1 and X2, there was a NameConstraints forbidding the intermediate from issuing for .mil domains. As a simplification for the sake of this post, let's say this was represented as Deny=.mil. Note that this form has no Allow.
09:21 <@deen> Windows XP has a bug in the certificate verification code, where if no Allow clauses are present, XP assumes that the certificate is valid for no names at all. Any certificate issued under such an intermediate would work on every system except Windows XP, as systems that do not understand NameConstraints at all would ignore it.

09:22 <@deen> Let's Encrypt Authority X3 is almost the same as Let's Encrypt Authority X1 - they have the same keypair, it's just that the NameConstraint has been removed. Same with X4 and X2.
