19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 The problem with the unmasked entities is, that we load the map before we receive a snapshot, so the map displays what was set last, thats why we have to reconnect.
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe we should call OnMapLoad() again when we receive a snapshot, where `DONT_MASK_ENTITIES` is different than before?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, we cant do that. It will lag the game as hell :D
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut is the overlay prerendered?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont think so, but the Indices are set when we load the map
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So when we load the map, it will look for invalid tiles and set them to 0, so we dont render them.
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, this'd need quite some work :/
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I guess we cant just update them
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe defer the setting of tiles to 0 to when we get the first snapshot?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can  try that, but I am not too confident it will work
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This looks like a lot of work, tbh
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can we maybe send the flag before loading the map?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then the client would have its information ready
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut hmm idk where we'd put it tbh
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe add a function called MapLoadDeferred, which would get called when we get the first snapshot
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which would go through all tiles and invalidate the ones needed
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think it will lag the game, especially on big maps
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It goes through every index
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Imagine it on BlmapChill ðŸ˜„
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have an idea.
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut the first snap gets there pretty quick
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or @heinrich5991 would a server capability for gameinfo be appropriate?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I thought of a 3-dimensional vector, which saves the layer, index and position of invalid tiles and if we send the flag, it will go through them and replaces them with their original index. But I didnt find a way to set the index, so that the client renders it.
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `Collision()->SetCollisionAt()` doesnt make the client render it
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 It would be cool if this was changeable ingame, but not needed
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe try windows tests
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on this CI
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> appveyor is slow af right?
