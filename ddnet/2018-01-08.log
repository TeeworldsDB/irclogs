20:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti what's your question?
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Some time ago ive mapped a swing in a map, its just That u hook on a special position and just hold d or a to get very close through 1 tile freezesit worked perfectly but i needed to change the position of the part, so i just copied it and placed it at an other place.
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The problem was then that the part didnt work anymore because the Tee would swing more far now.
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I wonder how the position in the map is able to influence physics
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> positions are unfortunately using floating point numbers
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> this means that they are more accurate near (0, 0)
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Hmm :GWchadThonkery: 
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But as i know now it doesnt influence falling trough kills for example, that is strange :GWchadThonkery:
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's still pretty accurate, even far out ^^
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> do you know hte "far lands" in minecraft?
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> they suffer from the same problem
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> far lands are caused by limitation of 32bit integer
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Far lands doesnt exist anymore or :GWchadThinkeyes:

20:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> this is what I mean
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because of limiation o 32bit
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ±2,147,483,647
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it also says floating point in my link
20:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ±65536 - somewhere
20:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Strange shit :GWchadThinkeyes:
23:26 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> might just need more precision error for death tiles
23:27 <+Learath2> let's recode teeworlds using fixed point arithmetics
23:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> +1
