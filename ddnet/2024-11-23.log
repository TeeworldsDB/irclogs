00:12 < bridge_> <montikboom> So, I discovered dbg_tuning command. Can I ask, if this using client to get tuning list or server sends tuning list to the client?
00:12 < bridge_> <montikboom> @teero777 sorry for ping, but I think you know
00:12 < bridge_> <montikboom> Or anyone else can answer my question?
00:19 < bridge_> <teero777> The server sends the tunings to the client so the client can use them for antiping/prediction
00:19 < bridge_> <montikboom> Can I make the server not send anything to the client?
00:19 < bridge_> <learath2> LOL
00:20 < bridge_> <montikboom> Funny üòÇ
00:20 < bridge_> <learath2> I hate that this is what has become of the community of this game
00:20 < bridge_> <learath2> You can't, the client needs it for prediction and antiping. If you send the wrong values the game will look wrong on the client
00:21 < bridge_> <montikboom> Is there any way to send values to the client but not showing them in dbg_tuning?
00:21 < bridge_> <teero777> nope
00:21 < bridge_> <montikboom> Or should I tell players not to use antiping
00:22 < bridge_> <learath2> It also breaks the normal prediction, so they'll also have to play with prediction off if you want to send fake values. Which is extremely annoying to play without
00:23 < bridge_> <montikboom> :(
00:24 < bridge_> <montikboom> Any way to keep tunes in secret but not break antiping?
00:24 < bridge_> <learath2> No
00:24 < bridge_> <montikboom> :tex_cry:
00:25 < bridge_> <learath2> There is also a tool to calculate tunes for any time rate
00:25 < bridge_> <montikboom> Ik that
00:26 < bridge_> <montikboom> Can I modify client to remove that command?
00:26 < bridge_> <learath2> You can, but people will keep playing with their own clients
00:26 < bridge_> <montikboom> But I think online will be ü§è
00:26 < bridge_> <montikboom> Ok
00:28 < bridge_> <learath2> embrace the soul of open source, thousands of hours of developers work is available to you for completely free, live and let live üôÉ
00:29 < bridge_> <montikboom> Thousands?
00:29 < bridge_> <melo∆û> i'd consider ddnet surpassed the 5 digit hour mark a while ago
00:29 < bridge_> <learath2> Easily, dozens of people worked over this game for more than a decade
00:29 < bridge_> <melo∆û> i'd assume ddnet surpassed the 5 digit hour mark a while ago
00:33 < bridge_> <montikboom> I think print prints
00:56 < bridge_> <-StormAx> Yo is there's any chance to read the whole rcon console? maybe there's func which is does exist like that?
00:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> No
00:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> i mean you can do it but there most likely is not a function
00:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> you should see what dump_remote_console does, the f1 cp,,amd
00:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> you should see what dump_remote_console does, the f1 command
00:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> sorry yeah you should see what dump_remote_console does, the f1 command
01:46 < bridge_> <teero777> I'm sure I myself have spent more than a few hundred hours sinking

02:25 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What do you mean?
02:26 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the user is not on the ddnet discord, as far as I can believe the username auto completion.
02:27 < bridge_> <jxsl13> he is

03:28 < bridge_> <zhn> there's nothing you can keep in secret, only code part i think
03:29 < bridge_> <zhn> chillerdragon: yeah he does
03:47 < bridge_> <Solly> @montikboom i cannot fathom for what purpose you want to hide tunes from the client
04:18 < bridge_> <zhn> they want to hide their super secret slowmo tunes so no one could replicate them xd
04:18 < bridge_> <Solly> ):
04:18 < bridge_> <Solly> sigh
04:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @leo2kk could you setup a irc bridge for the discord? I can also help setting it up and even host it

07:10 < bridge_> <totar> you shouldn't need infinite stack size
07:11 < bridge_> <totar> other platforms are fine because of higher default stack size

08:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious how does the DO NOT CHANGE MAP vote work on kog? What does the admin (user facing) api look like? Are there config variables for it? How are they called? I might yoink that feature for @woidless and want to avoid having different user facing apis for same features
08:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also are you planning to add a irc bridge to kog discord?

09:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless oke done ``add_vote "DO NOT CHANGE SLOW" block_votes`` and ``add_vote "CHANGE SLOW" unblock_votes``
09:26 < bridge_> <woidless> Can you make time? Which will be blocked for
10:06 < bridge_> <pilonpl> my game freezes after finishing
10:06 < bridge_> <pilonpl> is there a way to diagnose what the issue might be?
10:10 < bridge_> <pilonpl> i think it might be related to demos
10:11 < bridge_> <pilonpl> because i have quite a lot of them saved
10:48 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @pilonpl: which version are you on? Does it freeze every time? Can you try opening the console before you hit the finish line and see if you can maybe correlate any of the log messages to the freeze starting or stopping.
10:49 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Latest steam version. It's been happening for quite a while now so idk what might've caused it
10:49 < bridge_> <pilonpl> And i just turned off my pc so maybe i'll check later
10:49 < bridge_> <pilonpl> But yeah it seems to be happening every time
10:49 < bridge_> <zhn> freezes completely or crashes?
10:49 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I recommend joining something like run\_orange where you can get a finish within seconds for testing
10:49 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It freezes for like a second and resumes
10:50 < bridge_> <zhn> sounds like io issue
10:50 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Yeah
10:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Then f1 while you fly into the finish line
10:50 < bridge_> <zhn> i don't remember if demo saving happens in main thread though
10:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> If it freezes on the writing demo file we have a good suspect
10:50 < bridge_> <zhn> sounds insane
10:50 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It should be async i guess
10:52 < bridge_> <pilonpl> But are demos only saved to disk at the finish?
10:52 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I would assume they have to be kinda streamed to a file in chunks or something
10:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It's actually quite interesting
10:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> And auto demos record even after finishing
10:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> So they would save after disconnecting i guess
10:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yea it already writes them while playing
10:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> You can also try turning off replays and demos and see if that helps
10:56 < bridge_> <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1309819850897494036/image.png?ex=6742f84b&is=6741a6cb&hm=8e332bf7011a72f6109c821c1a189c71ec2763c5c2cbc79a765f03d42b82f330&
10:57 < bridge_> <zhn> checked demo code, it uses fwrite under the hood to save demos
10:58 < bridge_> <pilonpl> it doesnt lag every time
10:58 < bridge_> <pilonpl> but it might be some cache idk
10:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe disable auto demo deleting, it has to scan all your demo files
11:00 < bridge_> <zhn> huh
11:00 < bridge_> <zhn> why it should
11:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> i have max demos set to infinity
11:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> It has to find the oldest demo to delete
11:03 < bridge_> <pilonpl> its weird, now i tried finishing just fly 1 and it didnt lag even tho earlier it did lag
11:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> https://tenor.com/view/toy-story-buzz-lightyear-toy-fly-to-infinity-and-beyond-gif-17474152
11:03 < bridge_> <pilonpl> i dont delete demos
11:04 < bridge_> <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1309821897143222324/image.png?ex=6742fa33&is=6741a8b3&hm=3ae9c2afb38cd80832a299f293eb193581c8f13827a9b662d8030d90cf1c48d0&
11:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> its actually a symlink to a folder on a different drive
11:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> NTFS drive
11:07 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Anyways, i'll come back later and i hope we can figure out a way to fix this. I think it's an issue with the game itself so yeah
11:17 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you can try moving old demos to a different folder on that drive snd see if that changes the behavior. Or check if there are a lot of demos for the map you finished and whether depending on that, the client freezes.
11:18 < bridge_> <jxsl13> in the code it seems that only the best demo for a map is kept
11:18 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and others are deleted.
11:19 < bridge_> <jxsl13> maybe deleting of files fails, which I doubt
11:19 < bridge_> <jxsl13> with ntfs, who knows

12:29 < bridge_> <jxsl13> lsof -i -P -n | grep 8303
12:29 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and see if some other application is using that port

12:31 < bridge_> <jxsl13> can you post your server configuration (without secrets and passwords)
12:31 < bridge_> <woidless> I just reinstalled the operating system, installed the dependencies, ddnet, and then compiled it
12:31 < bridge_> <woidless> ok

12:31 < bridge_> <zhn> afair ntfs support lacks performance on some popular package
12:32 < bridge_> <jxsl13> well, that is a small configuration that should work
12:33 < bridge_> <woidless> I missed the most important thing
12:34 < bridge_> <jxsl13> did you do some firewall configiration?
12:34 < bridge_> <jxsl13> did you do some firewall configuration?
12:34 < bridge_> <woidless> —é
12:34 < bridge_> <woidless> This only
12:34 < bridge_> <woidless> I didn't do anything else
12:35 < bridge_> <jxsl13> where is your server hosted?
12:35 < bridge_> <woidless> play2go
12:35 < bridge_> <woidless> Germany
12:38 < bridge_> <jxsl13> hm
12:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> are there any alerts in your web user interface on the play2go website?
12:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> literally dunno what's going on here
12:39 < bridge_> <woidless> none
12:40 < bridge_> <jxsl13> are there any alerts for ddos protection or is there any firewall configuration in their website?
12:40 < bridge_> <jxsl13> or something like that?
12:41 < bridge_> <woidless> I think I'll check with the support now.
12:43 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you can try to check if you can access your server at all. but seeing as you are (hopefully) connected via ssh, them your server should be accessible from the internet.
12:43 < bridge_> <jxsl13> then*
12:44 < bridge_> <woidless> I am connected to it completely via ssh
12:45 < bridge_> <jxsl13> what happens if you start the server and manually connect to it by writing ip:8303 in your game client?
12:45 < bridge_> <jxsl13> is it just a master server thing or is connecting to it in general not working
12:47 < bridge_> <woidless> I will connect to it, the problem here is that this server does not appear in the list of servers
12:48 < bridge_> <jxsl13> maybe the "master server list" part is one of many problems and not the only one.
12:50 < bridge_> <jxsl13> *afk*
13:31 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Btw when testing a custom build of ddnet how to make sure it uses a separate config folder?
13:31 < bridge_> <pilonpl> So it doesn't mess up your normal setup
13:42 < bridge_> <jxsl13> backing up your config folder is probably the way to go
13:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> Replace `$USERDIR` with `user` in the `storage.cfg` in your `build` folder and create a folder `user` next to the `data` folder
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless on the server you have master issues does this command work for you? ``curl https://master2.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json``
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i guess the log message already indicates that the master was reached (not sure tbh)
15:08 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> The same lol(
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?
15:41 < bridge_> <lolomama_66876> hello

15:55 < bridge_> <woidless> wtf
15:56 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> text
15:57 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the problem is master server reaching tue servers. How to debug that, I don't know. You can setup like an apache2 server with it's default static html page and check if you can access that page or let someone else check if they can access the page from their location.
15:59 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I think the master uses some udp stuff to poke the server with the teeworlds protocol not http but not sure I never looked into that stuff
15:59 < bridge_> <woidless> I didn 't understand anything , but it looks brilliant
15:59 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Can you connect to the server?
15:59 < bridge_> <woidless> Yes
15:59 < bridge_> <woidless> But go is not in the list of servers
16:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Weird
16:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ddos protection is my guess
16:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> but dunno
16:06 < bridge_> <jxsl13> in case it is udp that the master uses
16:17 < bridge_> <montikboom> can you help me add ddnet-server.exe here please?
16:17 < bridge_> <montikboom> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1309900532927692872/image.png?ex=6743436f&is=6741f1ef&hm=72fd4da942baaec2e4364b97b24d7764cd085b86fb6ef279ee51befce700f9be&
16:17 < bridge_> <montikboom> In visual studio
16:21 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> and what to do with this problem?
16:22 < bridge_> <jxsl13> probably ask the support of your hosting provider
16:29 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> uh
16:30 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> they said all fine with ports and etc..
16:31 < bridge_> <jxsl13> try sv_register ipv6 or sv_register ipv4.  nothing much you can do if you did not fiddle around with your firewall
16:31 < bridge_> <jxsl13> switch hosting provider
16:33 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> alr tried
16:33 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> on another hosting provider all good(
16:34 < bridge_> <woidless> I have been using this host for a long time, there were no problems with the server wizard, they appeared recently. But the hosting did not do any updates
16:34 < bridge_> <woidless> Then how?
16:34 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> but yesterday im bought a more expensive and here this bug
16:35 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> but on another tariff plan on the same hosting provider it works good
16:35 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> hm
16:35 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> (
16:35 < bridge_> <woidless> None
16:35 < bridge_> <woidless> Promo 1 also doesn't work
16:35 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> promo 2 work
16:35 < bridge_> <jxsl13> maybe it's possible to use a different ddnet master server
16:36 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> hm
16:36 < bridge_> <jxsl13> in masters.cfg or how that file is called
16:39 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1309906185440333925/image.png?ex=674348b3&is=6741f733&hm=96e1a465ae02128b5aa3a0751c3ea967425fca391e36944618dfa5af5b57c0ba&
16:39 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> nope
16:55 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> work
16:55 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> its dont work register method
16:55 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> on this master
17:47 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Have we checked `iptables` and the like yet?
17:47 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> @woidless What's the output of `sudo iptables -L`

20:20 < bridge_> <barlars> guys idk is it happening on ur pc but if i press space in map maker i hear some noise
20:21 < bridge_> <maksim_sanchez> This is a problem for everyone, just buy promo 2, it should work there, although I don‚Äôt know why
20:38 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> is it like a faint screeching noise
20:38 < bridge_> <barlars> kinda
20:38 < bridge_> <barlars> high hz
20:39 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> when i run ddnet using headphones theres always this extremely quiet screeching noise
20:39 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i dont know why
20:39 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> it doesnt pick up on the computer, but its getting sent through the headphones
20:42 < bridge_> <yousername1337> Hello!
20:42 < bridge_> <yousername1337> 
20:42 < bridge_> <yousername1337> The essence of my question is simple - I made a new section for voting and it simply does not inject my cfg into the game.

20:43 < bridge_> <yousername1337> In the cfg there are only tunes
20:57 < bridge_> <yousername1337> i fixed
21:09 < bridge_> <montikboom> What tunes?
21:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> what does this mean
21:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> it‚Äôd have to be detected in volume mixer to be mixed on your output device
21:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> are you sure it isn‚Äôt your DAC
21:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> it‚Äôd have to be detected in volume mixer to be mixed on your output device, ddnet doesn‚Äôt connect in exclusive mode
21:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> or opus artifacts around sfx which i have heard but only when they are playing
21:19 < bridge_> <triki> can some one share assembling code?
21:19 < bridge_> <triki> from this https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/985717921600929872/1307710869051801670

21:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> the bot is open source under the ddnet org on github iirc
21:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> what do u want it for

21:35 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> like
21:35 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i try to record my audio output with audacity, but it doesnt pick uo
21:35 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> like
21:35 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i try to record my audio output with audacity, but it doesnt pick up
21:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> Are you sure the noise is coming from your headphone? I get a high pitched noise with high FPS due to coil whine of my GPU
21:43 < bridge_> <arab52_62921> Can you tell me? where can I file a complaint about a ban without a reason
21:43 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You can have that sort of electronic noise coming out of your audio jack too
21:43 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> #‚úâ-create-a-ticket
21:48 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> yeah let me retest
21:48 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> like, its not from my pc, i know that
21:54 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> ok its not just ddnet
21:54 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> when i charge my wireless headphones theres a faint buzzing
21:55 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> sounds like when you import raw data in audacity
21:56 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> just really quiet
21:57 < bridge_> <0xdeen> that happens with crosstalk on the mainboard. good mainboards should have a separate area for audio, or just get a dac
21:59 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> good audio is üëç recommended
22:00 < bridge_> <aegisub> make sure to use a good memcpy implementation for best audio quality
22:01 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :) :) :)
22:02 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You want your buffers 4k aligned for the smoothest playback
22:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> @_voxeldoesart if it bugs you the syba sonic usb dac is a really really good value dac
