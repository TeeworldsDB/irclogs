00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, we can't provide save when the map is mirrored
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> So I either lose 40 min progress or sleep xD
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can u afk
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or just give ur timeout to a friend
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i finish for you :justatest:

03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> my bad, searched for mapping and couldnt find it, went insane asn siad "ah fuq it ill post here"
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Just curious, did anyone ever meet Magnus Auvinen?
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the original teeworlds team wanted to do a meetup, not sure if they ever did
04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe teetow knew him irl?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794125866812178462/2020-12-31_16-46-56.mp4
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> im sure if you go ingame nobody knows who Magnus even is but every minecraft player knows Notch hm ... idk what happend there
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 1. Write post-processing X-Flip shader
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 2. Render through it before screen
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 3. Reverse inputs for mouseX and A/D 
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Done
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 10 mins-to-make useless feature that does not break anything at all
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è i wrote this tool for fun, not for this event :)
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Tool is ok
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga will you release it soon? I wanted to link to it, but noticed it's probably not up-to-date yet
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> How do you use shaders in tw btw?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> What methods to look for
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen i want to clean up the tool a little before the rls, it got quite messy yesterday ^^
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But you're good for in-production support-and-fixing. If you ever need a reference, tell me üòÑ
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ü•≥
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://psxparty.kosmi.io/
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a online ps1 emulator
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what a time to be alive
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> what tool @Patiga?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap
13:12 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye ofc best tool
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> sponsored by ChillerDragon lul
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> yo @deen any idea how to debug me spawning on different tiles depending on which machine i run the server? If i run my mod on my vps debian i spawn on a non spawn tile and on my local machines arch and debian i spawn on normal spawn tiles
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust :POGGIES:
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> i run with the ubsan asan thingys
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> but nothing showed up
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga will u publish it to crates?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki is it based on rollback netcode?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what that is
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was really surprised how well it worked for online smash
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses webrtc
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25582187
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a way to synchronize 2 consoles that have no mechanism to synchronize
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://nes.party/
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same for the nes
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> !!
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If they fall out of sync the game is rolled back to the last state that was in sync
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which sounds horribly inefficient, but somehow worked pretty decently as long as you didn't drop packets much
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga if u do pls add the teeworlds keyword to the toml file <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-keywords-field>
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794178343113195550/unknown.png
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon spawning on a non spawn tile sounds verybroken. Set a breakpoint at where we choose a spawn point and go from there
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 its a non standard tile so yea and my buggy mod it works fine in recent ddnet and used to crash in older ddnet
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 but if it works different on different machines isnt that proof for UB? And shouldnt ubsan detect something on spawn?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Non standard tile? Are you running your mods map under ddnet server?
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> wdym?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk, I don't know what you mean by non standard tile so I made a guess
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> ah yea i forgot what is was exactly
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> something like a switcher
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i found a game im rly into rn and apparently its open source and gpl licensed https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ppl buy it on steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gpl best :monkalaugh:
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how many sales they have
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794180193253588992/unknown.png
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more than 6k for sure
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's impressive. Maybe I should reconsider making an open source game
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he made atleast 16.8k‚Ç¨
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but not all ppl review
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw i recommend u play it
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it even has a turing complete cpu inside the game
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> SteamDB has owner estimations: https://steamdb.info/app/1127400/graphs/
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794180673686470676/unknown.png
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 340000*4*0.7=952k‚Ç¨
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 cuz i think steam has 30% share
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats quite a lot
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `340000*4*0.7=952k‚Ç¨`
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about tax
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk where he lives
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 6k copies at 5‚Ç¨ per copy with 50% steam cut nets me 15k‚Ç¨ in profits. If I work a thousand hours on it that's 3$s an hour less than what a mcdonalds employee makes in denmark :P
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam cut is 30$
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 30%
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where did u get that 50 xd
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also they reduce the cut if u get to 1M copies and more after
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It used to be 50 for indies and around 30 for massive companies with bargaining power
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its 30 for all and lowers the more u sell
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess with new marketplaces like epic they had to back down from their insane cut
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no they didnt
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> change anything
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u have to set a higher price tag
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Valve takes around 30 percent of all game sales on Steam, with some exceptions for games from smaller developers in its Steam Direct program. That will remain the case for the first $10 million in sales a game maker or publisher earns. For all sales between $10 million and $50 million, the split goes to 25 percent. And for every sale after the initial $50 million, Steam will take just a 20 percent cut.
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I guess I misremember. I distinctly remember people complaining that the cut is terrible
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 30 is the industry standard everywhere
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe the nintendo switch cut is 50
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i read it somewhere
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway at 30% I'd make a tad bit more than a mcdonalds worker in denmark :D
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need to sell more copies
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this was a FUD campaign by EPIC games against steam
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At 10k copies I'd be solid
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he sold like 350k copies
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway ur game has to be interesting inthe first place to be bought
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc I meant a hypothetical game made by me
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u ever wanna make a game i can help ü§ì
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just gotta get the idea of the year
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I could produce a masterpiece that sells 350k copies alone, that would be 1.2 million euros. I'd honestly just buy a house and not do anything else significant for the rest of my life
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Until it ran out. Then maybe another game
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but dreaming is free
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I sold it at 10‚Ç¨ a copy and move back to turkey I could probably live like a lord until I'm like 50
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very unlikely one makes a game that's that successful alone tho
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Put the milion euros in coca cola shares
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And get 30k euros a year
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And live like a lord i turkey haha
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> put 30k in bitcoin and buy turkey
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm atleast 500k people own Va-11-Hall-A. That's a 10$ game and it's mostly a visual novel. Maybe it is possible
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cocacola is a very slow stock. I'd probably put it in us treasury bonds or maybe lebanon treasury bonds
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Coca cola pays out 3% every year
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you keep your money in lebanon for 3 years they promise you a 100% return. Tho you are kinda betting on lebanon not completely collapsing in that year and that'a a risky bet
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Bonds are 1,7%
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean ambergold did that in Poland and stole like a billion dollars Frombork People haha
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe apple. Apple fanboys never learn anyway
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I would have to look how much Apple pays out
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I wouldnt bet on a stock rising
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Just staying the same
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And paying out dividents
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is the sane approach, but jokes aside if I had that kind of money, I'd just hire a financial manager to handle it
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean a good stock to buy now is cd project red
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Because they fucked up 1 game the stock halfed
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He can have his 10% cut or whatever, my main goal in life is to minimize working and thinking so I can disintegrate into a blob of organic waste while watching useless stuff on youtube
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you buy cdpr stock? Is it publicly traded?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> They announce the witcher 4 and it would go up
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then we sell right before they launch the next buggy mess
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then we buy again at low
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean tesla was fun
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Elon musk smoked a joint
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> It halved and then went 4x ahha
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Betting against elon is like the stupidest thing I've heard
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The guy survived calling someone a pedophile on twitter, a joint in a legal state isn't going to do shit to him
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Most of the world thinks joints are class a druga
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Drugs
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> So its just people thinking he is a drugaddict
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And how can someone like that run a company haha
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very very interesting to see the different cultures around marijuana around the world
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it IS a drug but its not rly harmful imo
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been to many places and opinions differ soooo much
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean you are From turkey so i would assume you are muslim so you shouldnt drink alkohol
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like in turkey older people think it's the same thing as heroin, younger ppl are more lax
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be a fair assumption but you are wrong as I'm of the christian minority in turkey :D
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I know most People 40 or younger are open to marihuana
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Then im sorry learath for that assumtion
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Interestingly enough turkey is only recently this islamic. Throughout it's history it had the most moderate interpretation of islam. One of the few islamic majority countries that has a fairly developed alcohol tradition
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway back to weed, in europe it seems mostly no one cares
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> In Poland you can go to jail for having 1g haha
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's probably still less acceptable in more conservative eastern states yeah
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> In germany is easy to lose your drivers license because of weed
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In japan it's completely unacceptable, you instantly become an undesirable the second you are seen with it
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> weeb
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> In spain everyone smokes
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And now i live in england you pretty much smell it on each Street
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 can i borrow u for a debugging session idk what to search in the breakpoints xd
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @Ama +
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very odd that in the Netherlands and in Spain it's very normalized and in some US states or japan you server a very large jail sentence
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> every second uk smells like weed
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> learath2 u know its nont legalized in ntetherlands kind of
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon well I can't debug it for yoy
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> sad
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where did you break?
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> idk where to break in the first place xd
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> i never use breakpoints
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Dry Wall it's a legal grey area in most places, but it's practically allowed. If no one will prosecute you for it it's not illegal
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Its not legal but its not criminal
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Its decriminilized
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Thats the word for it i think haha
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> well the thing is its legal once its in a weed caffe, but if u are caught with it outside u can get as harsh fine as easter ueopean countires
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: wtf how do you even debug anything without breakpoints??
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> thtas why they literaly muggle weed into cafes
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> using dbg_msgs
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> smugle*
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> if i know what to look for i dbg_msgs if i dont know what to look for idk
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Its funny that edibles are illegal in the netherlands
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Dry Wall the thing is while the laws do exist to prosecute you for it, they never will. People even smoke outside in the netherlands, the whole atmosphere smells like weed
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> + learath been there not for drugs but just been and fuck me do i hat eit
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> making changes to the legal system is very hard everywhere, it takes a looot of work and political support, much easier to just tell the police you don't want anyone arrested for it
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I love when People go to amsterdam and get 1 joint for each person and then are crying that they had a bad trip
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> tell that to africa :kek:
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> they jjst tie you and flog you for stealing candy
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> i think they the only place where law can chaneg like that
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: `IGameController::CanSpawn` is where I would break
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i breakpointed here https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/068284ba5d566485f4764c50415d4a903ad67bc0/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L194 but x and y are never the value i spawn at but the spawn i want to spawn at xd
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> and what do i do when i hit the breakpoint?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You step through trying to figure out what goes wrong
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> stepping just shows me lines of code 
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> so i guess step and print right?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well obviously lol
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would first just do next instead of step
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> yea as i said print gives me nothing weird
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Check the value of Eval after each Evaluate call
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Dry Wall Amsterdam is really one of the most beautiful cities I've ever been to
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> nah, i respect your opinion but fuq that
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> go to lithuania, its soooooooooooo much better
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> #]
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> even the one and only the myth the legend hitler him self sadi it
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and interestingly enough unlike most people the smell of burnt weed doesn't bother me that much
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> people say it smells like dead skunk, I guess maybe I've never smelled a dead skunk so I never made that association? üòÑ
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> learath2 im an ex pot head who cant even satnd the smell of it now :feelsbadman:
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sort of smells like a blend of normal herbs burning, like bay leaves, mint and lemongrass combined
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> some kinds smell like skunk
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not dead.. lol
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> ``{m_Pos = {{x = 14928, u = 14928}, {y = 11056, v = 11056}}, m_Got = true, m_FriendlyTeam = -1, m_Score = 0.000126897736}`` these numbers look weird
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where does one even find a skunk to smell
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> do need some maffs to fix them
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> outside
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> like / 32?
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> what is a u and a v?
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> vector magic
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> nah, for me now that i get even panic attacks from the smell, it smells like if placed some shit and some wierd indian hearb on a knife and lit that bish
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> once i was driving and smelled a skunk and i thought it was someone smoking at first :x
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Oh interesting, I wonder why the coords are in int
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> ok if i / 32 it looks like a coord
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> and it is the coord i do not want
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> ok
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The u and v are vector magic to make it prettier to code
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> can i ignore them?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: ok now that you found the undesirable coords, check which kind of spawn evaluation it comes from
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> and just look at the x and y?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah you can, as you notice x and u are the same and y and v
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just a union
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow i didnt notice
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> u so smart
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> xd
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I just know gdb üòõ
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> pro hacker
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you figure out which type it is, you are going to need to trace it back to find what is adding that spawn point
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "check if the position is occupado"
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> i sometimes lose track of where im stepping around
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you launch gdb with `-tui` you get a nice display of the code
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> wew lemme check
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> ah that thing
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually don't need it but sometimes it helps to see more context
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> im sure u dont need that
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> u probably just read binary instead
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> haxx0r
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also you can do `next` to not step into the calls
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> yea i am nexting all the way
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is also `until` which you can use to get over loops
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609420612.png
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and `finish` which runs until you are out of the current call
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> rip tui
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol stdout destroyed it?
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> seems like
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> nub gdb
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> it also cant recover even if stdout stops
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can do ^L to redraw it btw
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> ok lemme retry
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> wait which key is ^
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> is it ctrl?
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> that clears gdb for me
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> try the command `refresh`
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it is ctrl but if tui is enabled it should redraw tui too, not just completely clear it
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> lul that opend the layout even tho it was closed xd
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> ah tui was off
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye works good
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I gtg for a bit, find the Type of spawn point that is wrong, figure out why it gets added, fix it. I'll be back in an hour or so
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm its no UB and i can also now reproduce it locally its just both spawns count but on production there is a tee blocking the one spawn already
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> so the problem is that these non spawn tiles get added to the spawnpoints array in the first place
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> ima go back to my old breakpoint
14:34 <+Learath2> Now find where spawnpoints are added
14:34 <+Learath2> (apparently irc still works with even shitty 2g internet :P)
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> come pm i dont wanna spam #developer :/
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki yeah, i'll publish it to crates, though i want to do 1 or 2 things before that
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> is there a pixel perfect resolution for DDNet
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1x1
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no subpixels
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> pixel perfect
21:11 <+ChillerDragon> bois new year soon ``grep -nr 2019`` on all projects xd
21:12 <+ChillerDragon> eh 2020
21:12 <+ChillerDragon> oof i missed a year xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Like immortal would be still alive
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :poggers:
