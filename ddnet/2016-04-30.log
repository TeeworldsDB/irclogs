05:40 < d3fault> deen: this is a somewhat rhetorical question that is/becomes a feature suggestion: why are there so many non-ddrace servers now (zcatch zombie etc)? why not just have 1 server where zcatch/zombie etc can be voted just like the novice/moderate/brutal difficulties?
05:42 < d3fault> if you say because you want to advertise zCatch/zombie/etc, then how about this feature suggestion: when a server is empty for a period of time, it automatically becomes zCatch/zombie/etc. you could set percentages of numbers of servers that become zCatch/zombie when empty. just seems like there's not enough ddrace servers anymore :(
09:43 < Learath2> d3fault, brutal/novice votes are just a basic vote map list switch but integrating 3 mods together is a hurdle. way too much work for too little of a gain.
10:27 < d3fault> Learath2: fair enough. i just see empty zcatch/zombie servers and non-empty ddrace ones and it makes me raeg :(

14:57 < d3fault> src/engine/client/input.cpp -- m_pClipboardText is not SDL_free'd when CInput destructs
14:58 < d3fault> i'm not too familiar with SDL, but it looks like memory isn't being free'd
15:13 <@EastByte> d3fault: yea, CInput doesn't have a destructor
15:14 <@EastByte> of course

18:00 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master df12171 def: Merge branch 'master' of github.com:ddnet/ddnet
18:01 <@deen> I'm surprised that this seems to work without problems ^
18:02 <@EastByte> awesome
18:02 <@deen> test it please, maybe my system is just super-weird
18:02 <@EastByte> works for me
18:02 <@deen> i always thought the textures in TW were for a specific resolution
18:02 <@EastByte> and I have a tiling wm
18:02 <@deen> yeah, me too
18:02 <@deen> maybe someone test without a tiling wm^^
18:03 <@deen> I still have some other problems with xmonad though
18:03 <@deen> with the new SDL2 input stuff, when I press 2 xmonad hotkeys quickly together, a part of the last one becomes an input for the client
18:04 <@deen> didn't happen with sdl1.2
18:05 <@EastByte> hm, I had a similar problem with sdl1.2
18:06 <@deen> it's probably more of an xmonad issue than sdl2
18:06 <@EastByte> mount
18:06 <@EastByte> whoops
18:06 <@deen> go on
18:06 <@EastByte> just installing arch on vps
18:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: I heard this does not work on windows
18:08 <@deen> heinrich5991: that's my fear :/
18:08 <@deen> i guess i should compile it

18:20 <@deen> heinrich5991: ok, this doesn't work on windows. do you know why?
18:20 <@heinrich5991> something about reloading textures afaik
18:20 <@heinrich5991> there was a TW pull request about that
18:20 <@deen> yeah, how does that magically happen on X11?

18:21 <@heinrich5991> I don't know
