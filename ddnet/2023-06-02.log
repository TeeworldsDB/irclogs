00:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> anyone have an example of where in the client there is an interface being defined within an implementation
00:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> i need to create an interface or at least an abstract class that would only be used within this implementation (it's a component) but i'm not sure how the convention would work
01:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/01/Rust-1.70.0.html, sparse registry is now default
08:04 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice finally
10:36 < ws-client> <Jupstar> friday and nothing going on here? I'm crestfallen
10:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> wazzup
10:48 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> hi
10:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @Jupeyy_Keks sweeten my day with a new recipe
10:49 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 1. boil an egg
10:49 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 2. open the shell
10:49 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 3. meal done
10:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 1. buy rice, some vegetables, hot curry, 2. cook rice ~10min, roast vegetables with lot of oil ~10min. 3. Put way too much curry to the vegetables
11:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i was busy pumping iron
11:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but im home now
11:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we can talk about rust
11:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> sounds great. What can you tell me new about?
11:15 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> didnt pump rust
11:15 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> epic fail
11:26 <+bridge> <AvoidMyStreakz> yo
11:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yo
11:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/09144b0ced40782b7a939a7d2a88c74c0e02db45/net/src/net.rs#L101
11:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> `next_peer_id` is used only to iterate over `peers`? it causing that id bug
11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 1.70 released
11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/01/Rust-1.70.0.html
11:41 <+bridge> <gerdoe> `Peers` itself should iterate over `PeerMap` from the start otherwise vacant ids will end after 15th connection from the same endpoint
11:42 <+bridge> <gerdoe> maybe i don't understand something but adding `self.next_peer_id = PeerId(0);` after getting raw pointer made it work for me
11:42 <+bridge> <gerdoe> what's `next_peer_id` is used for?
11:43 <+bridge> <gerdoe> what's `next_peer_id` used for?
11:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Slower than Heinrich. Sad
11:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He is bigger rust fan :^)
12:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> HR has done pogger today. They got me a bonus from the local government somehow for being a master degree graduate.
12:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Gov send me 15000cny straight to my bank account
12:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:07 <+bridge> <gerdoe> good job kekw
12:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> Thanks premier Xi, very cool
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Investment for ddnet 
13:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm now officially a chinese government sponsored personnel
13:20 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> HR said it was only the half of the total bouns, the other half will due in 6 months
13:20 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's pretty hype
13:21 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i can finally pay off my credit card
14:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now they know you exist
14:04 <+bridge> <gerdoe> also running libtw2 server on windows is mess since it always panics WouldBlock error duh
14:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> rip, good knowing you all
14:04 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> cya
14:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Does it offer a full server?
14:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> nope but its enough to build some kind of rustee playable server
14:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> physics are also not finished
14:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> prediction makes it even worse
14:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Cool, i saw it implemented some game stuff, but didn't know it's enough to implement a basic server
15:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think my plan was to never re-use peer IDs
15:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> probably not properly implemented though
15:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm interested in a bug report
15:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```thread 'main' panicked at 'Custom { kind: WouldBlock, error: "write would block" }', ...\event_loop\src\lib.rs:93:57```
15:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```rust
15:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> self.net.tick(&mut self.socket).foreach(|e| panic!("{:?}", e));```
15:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> in
15:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```rust
15:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> fn run<A: Application<SocketLoop>>(mut self, mut application: A)```
15:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. hm
15:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting, didn't know UDP writes could ever block
15:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess you can change the `panic!` to `eprintln!`
15:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh
15:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> also seems its unreal to second player to fully connect
15:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> idk why tho
15:41 <+bridge> <gerdoe> it doesn't work with this peer fix and without
15:41 <+bridge> <gerdoe> different addresses in local net
15:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1114187867225346069/20230602-1343.log
15:45 <+bridge> <gerdoe> hangs on second player connect
15:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I only ever tested it with a single player, sorry üò¶
15:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh
15:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> okey i'll try to do something to get it work xd
15:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> atleast rusty maze teeworlds server would work aha
15:58 <+bridge> <louis> hi, what location are usa3 servers at?
16:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> usa
16:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also https://ddnet.org/status/ has locations listed
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> near trump
16:08 <+bridge> <louis> oh right thanks
17:31 <+bridge> <deen> I'm also planning to have CAN and USA1 expire in a few weeks. Do you think that's fine? Just USA2 and USA3 will stay
17:37 <+bridge> <Voxel> will usa2 and 3 be renamed?
17:40 <+bridge> <louis> ig usa3 and usa1 are close in location
17:40 <+bridge> <louis> but cant speak for canada
17:47 <+bridge> <murpi> ^ @Skeith
18:15 <+bridge> <louis> @M_Emile
19:02 <+bridge> <deen> Sure, we can rename USA3 to USA1 after that
20:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2023/06/02/tree-borrows.html
20:45 <+bridge> <C√∏ke> u sure?
20:46 <+bridge> <C√∏ke> try ctrl + right click on the tile u want to search
20:46 <+bridge> <C√∏ke> it will jump bcs sometimes u have multiple layers, but yeah
22:02 <+bridge> <Skeith> I think USA1 would be better for current USA population than USA3
22:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats not a search function, thats right clicking to jump to the layer that tile is on
22:04 <+bridge> <C√∏ke> but thats what he want
22:04 <+bridge> <C√∏ke> but thats what he wanted
22:04 <+bridge> <Skeith> Most people play on USA1, and I don't think many players are that far east
23:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> i didn't even know there was a USA3
23:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> usa1 is the best for most people yeah
23:05 <+bridge> <Skeith> It's new, and people are getting stuck on "connecting"
23:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn never seen it in the browser
23:10 <+bridge> <Skeith> It's new, and people are getting stuck on "connecting" maybe the own person's fault
23:11 <+bridge> <Skeith> It's new, and people are getting stuck on "connecting" maybe the own person's fault
23:11 <+bridge> <Skeith> I had to rejoin a few times for it to let me in
23:14 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/420565311863914496/1114156836904513638
23:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh it's that new
23:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah i'm stuck getting game info lol
23:32 <+bridge> <Skeith> I think USA1 would be better for current USA population than USA3
23:32 <+bridge> <Skeith> there are also quite a few canadian players, idk if getting rid of CAN is a good idea. I guess we'll have to see their ping to USA3
23:38 <+bridge> <Meeu> you're using a custom client yeah? try with the ddrace/steam client
23:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> it shouldn't do that on any ddnet compatible client
23:39 <+bridge> <Skeith> tclient issue?
23:39 <+bridge> <Meeu> apparently treatment said it's not working with tclient, but he could hop on just fine with ddrace client
23:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'll try
23:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> üòµ‚Äçüí´

23:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> i hate steam
23:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> nah still broken
23:49 <+bridge> <louis> iyea it didnt let me in first try
23:50 <+bridge> <louis> i went to ger10.ddnet.tw and it got fixed but im not sure if theyre connected üòπ
23:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
