00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I forgor you had a discord
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Anyways my computer can't be accessed right now, so I do want to ask here.
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> What the plan for "I want a new UI" with the run animations is that, I remove the UI elements for animations, but keep in the actual options for when we do commit to new UI?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Or remove the settings in general?
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> some useless info

07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> is there any settings in ddnet server that allow me to set only ips can join the server?
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> why dont you just set a password lmao
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> The current state is that https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1660902889.pngI was working on it every day in vacation where I had no mouse or internet to distract me. Now back home I’m playing minecraft 24/7 \:DSo the current state is that at first glance when looking at it in the dissector all is fine. Client and server send all the packets. The ddnet Client can properly join a 0.7 server and stay online. But I haven’t gotten to parsing th
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I could help
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I do the same basically in the server already
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: do you have a public repo for this already? I would give it a try later
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When it comes to implementing this to the browser, there should be a separated 0.7 tab which also does not show servers that are already on the main 0.6 tab. Maybe a manual connection as 0.7 client should be possible tho via command
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd simply show all 0.6 and all 0.7 servers in the same tab
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and prefer connecting to 0.6 for now
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: so what you're saying is that you need snap support in the wireshark dissector? 😛
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i keep confusing heinrich with fokko now LOL
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea it’s a mess tho. I think it’s a branch In my ddnet fork. But it also needs another repo it’s a bit of a duck tape project as pf right now. But sure let’s have a call some day and look into it \:)
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@fokkonaut)
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea we’ll see. I also though about a tab. My current implementation added a optional argument to the „connect“ console command to switch to 0.7 mode. Which is nice for testing
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@fokkonaut)
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hehe yea that could help \:p
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why the different tab though?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could use the url scheme used by the master to distinguish between addresses of 0.7 and 0.6 servers
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it calls 0.7 servers something like `tw-0.7+udp://127.0.0.1:8303`
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I think especially in the beginning when it’s still alpha it makes sense to warn users what they get into. But we can also signalize it in one united tab or even apply filters
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Oh wait, I remember someone doing a 0.7 skin renderer in DDNET
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Do you think that would still apply to this whole 0.7 thing?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wot?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Pls send
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> It was a PR, lemme see if it still exists
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Maybe mine \:D
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea 0.7 needs more than just the protocol I’m working on. It needs a new skin menu as well
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> #5660
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5660
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And new textures and binds for ready mode
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ye that
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yea, makes sense. How would it work though? Would you automatically be set as a 0.7 tee in the respecting servers?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. it might make more sense to only define one skin
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and make ddnet servers support 0.7 skins as well
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even for 0.6 clients
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> They do already
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> To some degree
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also for 0.6 clients?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think so
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But there are more 0.6 skins and the new databases etc
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It translates
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Not too good but a bit
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah. but I mean sending 0.7 skins to 0.6 clients as well
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without translation
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> O
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I see
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Only works with the 0.7 supporting clients then tho
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, would need to be guarded by a version check I guess
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes that sounds neat
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But then still players would lose access to all the 0.6 skins which is a reason to not updated
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, keep supporting 0.6 skins
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So I would wait with that one release at minimum
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> support both 0.6 and 0.7 skins
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah i thought remove the 0.6 skin menu
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Then I understood you wrong
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, provide a toggle between both of them, basically
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can either select a 0.7 skin or a 0.6 skin
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe find nicer names for them; maybe 'skin builder' and 'complete skin'
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I see yes
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> That’s my plan
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if it did then i would cry because i designed my tees with passion...
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd be throwing away soo many years of creativity that it's not worth it
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ima\_6a3b909.jpeg
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016651298931752981/ima_6a3b909.jpeg
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Like two settings entries that’s my plan atm
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ddnet is all about creativity imo
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I also wanted to look into porting all the 0.6 skins to a 0.7 format
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But protocol first
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also no idea how to not render the 0.7 in black \:D I might need some help on that
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i stated this before but if we add in the 0.7 skin handler, will there be a way to make 0.6 tees with custom colors less... muddy?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do 0.7 skins have to do with 0.6 skins?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> good point. i was just bringing it up in terms of loose relevancy
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay 🙂
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'm trying to disect it myself, even if its low priority
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when you join a plain 0.7 server it means it picks the 0.7 skin from behind, even if you want a 0.6 sin usually?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, you'd get a default skin then
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cashthemoney> Hello I'm a sugar daddy i need a sugar baby that can make a good daily conversation with me and I will support him with a huge amount of money i pay with Paypal and casshap message me now if you are interested.
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not a good design, imo
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Having to switch manually to 0.7 skin settings when you join a 0.7 server seems a bit odd
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, when connecting to a 0.7 server the client needs to tell it's skin information. Why would we pass standard settings here, when we have some selected ones available?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can try to map atleast the vanilla set of skins like we already do, so if you’ve selected a “full skin” a similar-ish vanilla skin could be used in 0.7 servers
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> UI/UX is very difficult to get right in this case because “0.7 skin” doesn’t mean anything to a new player, but similarly if they pick a “full skin” it not working on 0.7 servers is also not very intuitive
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> cope
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> chillerdragon: you can't really port 0.6 skins to 0.7 because 0.7 skins are a bit higher res and upscaling won't look good
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Aw shit. Yea I guess it requires a lot of manual work then. But should work better with skins where the svg files are available. If not one can recreate them manually or even automated a bit.
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ravie)
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> PLS NO
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> break backward compatibility already, focus on developing the game and not breeding crutches, refuse support for 0.7
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/480806407290224641/904785176377327616/image0-1.gif
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is 0.7 support even "backward" compatibility? 😄
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it can be thought of as being backward compatibility if you consider ddnet to be an evolution of teeworlds thus forwards of any teeworlds version
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> sideways compatibility
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> multiway compatibility
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> New map format
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> New protocol
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What else?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A editor with networking
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> how would editor benefit from networking? xd
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> ddnet secretly spying editor!?!??!!??!!?? 👀 👀 👀
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring-rs
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> collaborative editing
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring-rs/releases/tag/v0.10.0>
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> impressive
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why would multiple people edit a map at once
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that's not very convenient
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ive been working on that for the last 4 months XD
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is convenient lol
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially if u are prototyping parts
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> still one person working on a part at a time
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a pixel art editor inside ddnet
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specialized for making skins
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> + you have to host the map on some server
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> well it's similar to how collaborative google docs work, ppl are not editing the same "part" at the same time but someone can do a part, someone else another and get feedback and do minor changes on others parts
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> or your friend just can destroy the whole map :troll:
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove the gui and use imgui
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add better ingame debugging tools
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> not with versioned edits
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with imgui its so ez
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> oh damn
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> yes
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy-inspector-egui
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is such a convenient feature
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you select a entity in the world
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and yo uget a nice gui with all its properties
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> editable
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016721445453316166/unknown.png
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> game dev 101
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> accounts 😄
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_Sweat:525603859830407168>
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you can already do that tho
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> just communicate and split work in a way that won't suck to connect together later
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> You can always find a way to make anything, it's about improving the tools available
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> Personally I cant live without collab gdocs now even though sure you technically already could do it before
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> just not the same workflow
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's not even inconvenient to do currently
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe multiplayer editing is "cool" to some people but I don't think it really solves any problems
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> so what's your workflow when creating a collab map? you create each a few parts and exchange the map files and then one of you merge them together?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> we make parts in our own files and test them together and when it's done we paste them into the "real file"
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> do you decide in advance where the parts go in the final file? do you also collaborate on the aestetics?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> make some parts in advance and then put them into the real map in a fitting way
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think ur being a bit stubborn about smth that may benefit others, you can always collab ur way even with this
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I just don't understand how it would benefit others
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think its clear
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> when do you ever need multiple people to edit the same map file at once?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Live editing
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thinking about ideas together? Mapping together
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk to me its crystal clear
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> That this is rly useful
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you need to load the map in game and play it together anyway
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> @Ravie  ok well its good to know how you work, i would prefer to make a useful tool so I appreciate your feedback. I see how for you it couldn't change much, although I would be satisfied if it could help you connect the parts together at the end and making final touches
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> @Ravie  ok well its good to know how you work, i would prefer to make a useful tool so I appreciate your feedback. I see how for you it wouldn't change much, although I would be satisfied if it could help you connect the parts together at the end and making final touches
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> but my primary goal I envisioned was to do the parts together not just a patchwork of individual parts
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so make everything already in place?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> yes and no, mostly prototyping
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think even with multiplayer everyone will be working on his own part in some separate place and then have to decide together how to paste them
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> maybe, idk, probable
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> but we wouldn't know until we try
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> sure
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 64bit Linux keeps such a surprisingly massive write buffer
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 20% of available system memory it seems 😄
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was surprised at how quickly a copy to usb was done
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> windows does that better by default IMO
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't keep a (big?) write buffer for externally attached media
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there is some kernel setting I can tweak to achieve that here
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/292024/how-to-reduce-linux-write-buffer-for-removable-devices
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But why do you want to reduce it?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just buy 20% more RAM
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because it's almost as if my tools are lying to me when they say the write is complete
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> copy*
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to reduce it for external media so that file copying processes can show accurate process
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If your tools don't sync afterwards, they don't tell you when the write is complete
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cp doesn't sync
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But my tools can't keep track of how far the sync is along anyway
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at that point you're telling me that cp lies to me? 😛
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What the tools are saying is that the source files can be removed
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw gnome will just get stuck at 100% iirc
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But yeah, no progress bar for the unmount is annoying
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd be okay with that too
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You basically get a umount stuck in an uninterruptable sleep with no information as to what's happening
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or use tools that skip the write buffer altogether like `dd` 😄
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another weird result is mkfs.ntfs, it will 0 the partition by default, it will progress extremely quickly at the start. Then get stuck in uninterruptable sleep for a huge duration because it'll have filled the entire buffer
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dd doesn't skip the write buffer
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dd is just a fancy cp (unless you give it more parameters)
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I usually dd straight to the usb stick without a file system. Otherwise I guess `oflag=direct` should skip
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, if you are ever stuck waiting on a sync/umount you can monitor /proc/meminfo
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The further parameters are what makes it interesting of course. And that you can `kill -SIGUSR1` to get a progress update
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use the tool `progress` to get progress reports for arbitrary tools operating on a single file. it also works for stuff like teehistorian2demo

19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> figma balls
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> creating a windows boot drive is surprisingly annoying to do on linux
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mostly because windows installer is shit, but still
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016762554107834428/unknown.png
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> this whole concept page is just a ploy to insult voxel
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i was lazy to put unique tees
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> why D:
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i was asking about skins
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> but nobody answered me
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> E tier finally finished sunny side up etc
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its ok i think its rly funny
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> coincidence
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it is
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> it was the skin i rly liked
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> :D
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so many little voxels
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> contanimation
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i wanted to make different tees
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> but
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways i think my one complaint is that some of the text is rly hard to read
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i gave up after i rendered 2
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> especially here
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016763347045187594/unknown.png
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> done
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> ez
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> grrh i wanna help with designing this but i think you need a paid figma account
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ah cool
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> why?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> design every button painfully in inkscape like a chad
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea but you cant do it with other ppl
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i always wanted to design shit with other ppl
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> closest thing i found to a free alternative is a thing called Penpot
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> cant u do it in figma?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk can you?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> u just need an account
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> do u have one/
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> do u have one?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> example of something i did in figma (its messy)
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://www.figma.com/file/FC6e6BmlsAHePkmUJtWf3g/DDNet-Layouts
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf big effort for a teams finder lol
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i sent this link in teeams server and nobody respond
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> cool
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> :feelsbadman:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> are you hecta vox?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Voxel what's the auto tee thingy supposed to be? looks cool
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> now u can edit that layouts
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its been a plan in my head for quite a while, inspired by urrh.. sylbot
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i wanted a tee "animation" program thats not linked to any server at all, where you can have tees do certain actions on certain frames
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah replay bot editor
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i need that D:
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so you can do rly funny bugs that arent humanly possible
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thx!
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i think if u want help me u should do everything from 0
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> D:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea. but again i want it to be abundantly clear i do not accept this as botting real plays. i just want a sandbox with a bunch of tees i can control
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've thought of something similar to program little ai tees for a tutorial map so they actually help you through parts
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that'd be cute
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but in my idea you would painfully write it in .cfg files or server settings xd
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> AI is getting better and better
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Would be great if it was accessible for normal people without nasa pcs
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> today i spent 2 hours to find out how to stop ddrace server :D
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> click X on the server window
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> nnoono
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> from code
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> std::exit()
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i did some other thing. dunno is it ok. but at least works
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/program-termination?view=msvc-170
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> ok. next question. how can i... send messages in chat with delay?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i tried sleep() but it broke game xD
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah sleep pauses the whole thread
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> yep
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u probably need a separate counter
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> :|
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you need some timer or count ticks
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> make a counter that decrements every tick and then print when counter=0
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> peepoNoted
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why do you need a delay?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 50 ticks per second
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ravie programmer
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats wrong
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it pauses the current thread
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> ???
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i just want try write 3 2 1 with delay
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sleep pauses the thread it is called from
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well he still said thread not threads
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its not wrong just ambiguous
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Isn't this literally what he has said?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you need to say "current thread"
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he said "the" thread, so its clear which one is named
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or yeah its ambigous
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz ppl usuallyrefer to the main thread
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when they say it like this
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh just nitpicking :BASED:
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why? I am not a programmer but it seems like the exact same thing "whole thread" and "current thread"
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt to me
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whole means nothing at all
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a thread can not be partial
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Well
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Not necessarily
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Async? I guess
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly important that it pauses the **current** thread
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> isnt async just a wrapper for spawning a new thread
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, the c++ call is called this_thread::sleep
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess it's clear from context xD
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don't think so
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> async can have nothing to do with threads at all
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it depends on the runtime
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> create a whole new thread to use sleep() :troll:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are single threaded async runtimes
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and multi threaded async runtimes
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> multi threaded distribute tasks on a pool of threads
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g by using a work-stealing queue
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like tokio does from rust
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> so can anybody do that for me :feelsamazingman:
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learn rust to know more
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to learn about async more
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make your own OS
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do it in rust
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://os.phil-opp.com/
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can learn a lot
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> learn vulkan do understand synchronizing, vulkan forces you to know about memory layouts, coherent/non-coherent memory, you need to sync shader stages sometimes since GPUs are highly multithreaded, just learn vulkan, vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> learn vulkan to understand synchronizing, vulkan forces you to know about memory layouts, coherent/non-coherent memory, you need to sync shader stages sometimes since GPUs are highly multithreaded, just learn vulkan, vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learn vulkan too
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Anyways, you could also wait before sending the command to the server so the server doesn't have to delay anything
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if only i had more time
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just have an excuse to use rust at work
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but hard to use vulkan
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont do gpu stuff
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i literally didnt know what interrupts were before i read and did this os-dev tutorial
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mayeb i knew about it vaguely
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u really lazy, make smth like static std:.vector<std::pair<std::chrono::microseconds, std::string>> delayedmsg
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> iterate through all instances, check if saved time is smaller than the wanted delay
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> add your chats with current time
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also rust comes rly handy in that lower level
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at preventing races
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wow rust is very woke, doesn't see race
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `Vec<(Duration, String)>`
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast rust got better naming sense
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would the perfect os even need interrupts xd
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @MilkeeyCat Does this look good?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016769957742268537/unknown.png
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> my javascript brain didnt understand anything. but huuuge thanks
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> im looking at it rn
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> xD
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its basically like in typescript
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> array = vector
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a pair is a tuple
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Pair = {first:any, second:any}
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but js doesnt have tuples
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tru but typescript has generics
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u could probs build the same datastructure
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not truly
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe but its not first class
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cannot get a syntax like in rust (a, b)
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Ryozuki I have a question about rust, if you're rusty at rust does that mean you're better at it?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we need philosopho tee meme
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just know the more you use rust the more you like it
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> stockholm syndrome
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chill, he really spams rust, i cannot keep up with this guy
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan vulkan vulkan vulkan
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> everyone is promoting their own favorite thing
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a contest
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/252358080522747904/1014947719078477874
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016774625092452352/unknown.png
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, he is too fast
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluestripe:
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even do it on purpose
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> When someone does Rust for the 1st time he gets converted ez
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Rust is rly cool
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes, you are one of my priests now
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🤝
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> see you even make it SOUND like a cult LOL
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's like converting to islam
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> in a rly good way
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> thou must trust rust
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki btw just saw that there's no raw socket implementation in the std
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/index.html
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is udpsocket and tcpsocket
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are raw sockets unix specific?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> raw sockets are very much platform dependent
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its better to be left outside
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> had fun making stupid things like WoL using raw sockets
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> heard it was planned to be implemented
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc i follow the joke
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think I still have my ugly wol code xD
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.rs/pnet/latest/pnet/
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this looks like it could be used for raw sockets
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn I don't have my cleanest version of wol.c but was this
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016789790538084493/wol.c
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn I don't have my cleanest version of wol.c (rip, did alot of editafter) but was this
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> have to take a look
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there a c++ flag/lint that tells whether a header is used?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> include what you use, but built in no
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably undecidable :p
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust can tell it :p
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since when does rust use headers?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust can tell what?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think rust doesn't even yell at you when you have an unused dependency
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unfortunately. but in the case of rust, this would be decidable
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> is there some c++ tool that let's you just write rust
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> is there some c++ tool that lets you just write rust
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that tool called rust?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "c++ tool"?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> some early rust compiler probs was written in c++ xd
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe u can use that
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was written in ocaml
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> rust does it again 🚀
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a bootstrapping compiler for rust written in c++
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway as said
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it was even used in ddnet already
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hacky
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just do cargo c
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in rust
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u want to compare it to rust, u'd need to compare it to c++ modules
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs headers are much more powerful
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can have conditional stuff too
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with cfg!
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/attribute/cfg.html
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (there is more than there)
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how poweful is it?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as powerful as ast is
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can u change the cfg like a preprocessor macro?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> include the same file twice
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more like conditional stuff for oses
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you dotn want to include modules twice
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cant i think
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway headers are a thing that new languages dont even think about
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean u can probs make a macro to include source code
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sqlx has a macro that validates queries at compile time
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, include in c is really just text replacement
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> @noby i found a nice minecraft server for you! It has inverse anti bot. It is called anti human and basically kicks all players without a hacked client :D
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> hi can anyone help me test a game im developing
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :kek:
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> is that a yes
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it teeworlds related?
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> yes
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what kind of game is it, a mod?
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> no its like a twist on teeworlds
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the source code on github?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> yes
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> https://groundslap.herokuapp.com/ this is the game
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just share the github link
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> its ok someone joined
