19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> hellooo
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> who 's there ?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im here for you @daverck ❤
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> ❤
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> I m trying to get the checkbox "/showothers" form settings to work with "/showothersteams"
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> but i don't get the result expected
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uffa
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only one time did some client graphical stuff
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and it was replacign a 5 with a 1
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> i think it should be fixed in gameclient.cpp line 1362
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @daverck btw, I think you shouldn't change the behavior of the client
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> especially because by default, you only see yourself in team, and everyone in spec
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you enter the command, then you get consistent behavior in spec and not spec, but you cannot return to the default settings
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> i think i did that in player.cpp
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> fixed
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wp
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> helo Zen
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> never heard of that guy
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh zCatch
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isee
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how much chat can you do in the same time?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> idk
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably should rate limit all text and the generated sounds aswell
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just saying, maybe it's more effective to actually spam chat
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye proper chat spamming is also rly effective
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i think he uses some kind of automated bot to join and leave spec time
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as he used 2 clients simuoltaneusly
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it looks like he dont use proxies
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since he doesnt return after ban
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder who he is
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't matter
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (the "who they are")
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for the rest of info 🙂
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👍
