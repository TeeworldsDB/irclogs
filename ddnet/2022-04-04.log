00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <d.angelina> @|Ronald| so rude
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|GH0sT|> ok
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <d.angelina> @|Ronald| can I ask you a question?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|GH0sT|> dm me
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <d.angelina> ok better
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 😳
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <d.angelina> accept my friend request
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <d.angelina> ah you did, sry
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> @Ryozuki i added delay in smartpause feature.
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> You can reuse this approach in the help tooltip overlay.
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Just a counter to check if mouse stay on same object
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Omg check style is my fear
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the delay already exists
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD just run scripts/fix_style.py and rebase
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD just run scripts/fix_style.py, commit then git rebase -i HEAD~2  and squash the style fix in the last commit
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Wohoo I dislike this feature to be in the client.
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This definitely belongs to the server. The /showall hack is not very nice and the serverside implementation is a lot less code changes either (see my comment)
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I proposed a solution to a problem.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's ok to discard it if a better solution is proposed.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I just added a function can actually, not so complicated approach as you describe it 😀
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean, just from looking at the tw codebase this command belongs to the serverside, and the way you did it is a big hack imo, and not a sample solution
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Server side feature is a lot simpler, of course
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> point is, your client doesnt even know for example whether a server supports /showall or not
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So that would be required anyways, then we can as DDNet also directly implement it in the server imo
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Actually your solution doesn't work for tee paused while hooked, they would be instantly unpaused
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its nice to have people working on ddnet, i dont wanna demotivate you, but i think features should be discussed before
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thought about that too, but there could be a little space, like tee moved > 32 from origin pause pos
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's ok 🤣 not a personal thing
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that a one-liner
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or 2 :p
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Thing is: choose best solution.
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> At the moment we play ddnet client on ddnet server, so not big difference on user side.
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Just a missing feature imho
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I proposed a solution to a problem.
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's ok to discard it if a better solution is proposed.
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I just added a function call actually, not so complicated approach as you describe it 😀
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye same
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will open a new pr lager
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats your approach for hooking?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think 32 subtiles from origin pos is ok
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I'm missing something to run this script, maybe clang executables
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Smart pause waits to be enabled and start counter. 
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If tee velocity stay zero for a period of time you can enable smart pause and poll position
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you need clang-format
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> whats the error?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> "Found no clang-format 10"
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Very indecipherable error message :kek:
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> means you have not clang-format or clang-format-10 on your system
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I'm installing LLVM
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> any reason why +toggle wouldnt work with hook line color configs
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what cmd r u trying
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Stop bot
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> why doesn't /tp insta unfreeze the tee even if it was frozen before? also, whoever executes /kill after kill protection is enabled will get weak instead of strong
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> whoever kills get weak, that's normal, weak/strong is determined by spawn order
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't worry much about clang-format and clang-tidy, I can fix them later if it's complicated on your system
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> whoever kills gets strong
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> when race is started
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Any plans to switch to a newer version of clang-format? Version 13 "works" with a lot of new warnings.
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Usually what's holding us back are the Ubuntu versions we use on github CI builds
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let me check if we can increase
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ubuntu impish (21.10) has clang 13, let's try it
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Thank you!
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, no clang-format 13 on homebrew?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> how about version 14?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let me see if I can provide easy instructions for 13
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we also didn'T have 10
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> last time tried here btw https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4451
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Bullets being weird on Springlobe 3
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960569736243073085/Base_Profile_2022.04.04_-_17.59.16.01.mp4
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> steam rc build
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can't resolve the ternary problems, even with clang-format 14. So no upgrade for now
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> does not happen in Miper 4, maybe tune shenanigans?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it looks like that because those shotgun bullets are in a tunezone with different properties than where your tee is
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> go into that zone and it will most likely look correct
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know why we dont have proper prediction for tunezones anyways, since the client knows about everything. the tunings are stored in the map file which the client could just read to get the tunings for each tune zone to predict everything perfectly xd
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only when tunes get changed it gets sent i think
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since rc it is like that? so a new bug?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I only tested the current rc build on steam
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks You're on the news! https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/online-platformer-ddracenetwork-gets-vulkan-support/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=Sendible&utm_campaign=RSS
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I especially like the
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Seems it's remaining somewhat popular too, especially with the Steam release, which sees over 2,000 players online at a time every day. Might not sound like a lot but it's more than the likes of some much more well-known indie and AAA titles, so it is pretty impressive.
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> They should be read from the map as at load as well, so on normal ddnet maps shotgun bullets should work. Sounds like a bug
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice ddnet getting currently popular /r/place + news
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks remember me when ur too famous
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:

18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw OSU! is bigger
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since we latetly talked about it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont think osu was always open source
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its only the new client iirc
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah ok
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the server is not open source too
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i always see the main dev complaining about SDL2 bugs xDD
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so basically like us
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do large games also use SDL2 or some custom abstraction layers?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, but mostly for linux ports apparently
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> valve e.g. uses it
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> explains why they sponsor it
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen this is another good link for when we try again with wikipedia right?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all source games use sdl2 under the hood
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so dota 2 and csgo use it
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teamfortress 2
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> as far as i know only on linux tho
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do they use on windows
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sdl is what makes cross platform easier
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they have a native implementation
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but we'd need a different source, gamingonlinux already reported on us, get 5 different magazines to report and we have a chance
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno where i read it, have to find it
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> phoronix mentions us here and there
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does that count? xd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> kind of, still need more
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do user comments on local news count? xdd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tried asking some indie game magazines, but only one replied (and they said "not interested")
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can buy one for 8€ xD
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, has to go through editorial process
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks

18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.libsdl.org/
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the sdl web mentions it
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960584612801814618/unknown.png
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this game is dope too
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> divinity 2 best game after teeworlds xd
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960584696369139732/unknown.png
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but they also only use it for "normal" mouse movement
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nothing special
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they didnt release on linux
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no clipped mouse or shit like that
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that always breaks for us
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also since its tripple A, you wouldnt notice performance drops probably
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it seems they indeed don't use sdl or statically link to it on windows
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> civ6 uses sdl2
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> csgo & minecraft would be interesting since they also use relative mouse input
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but SDL2 really improved lately, they just always have some weird thing that makes us revert, performance drop or stuff like that
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> minecraft uses java hting
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lwgl
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe because to fix or add new things, they also add expensive checks or bad quality code 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xdd they merged my code for flashing the window
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and later changed it again xD
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I checked csgo and it doesn't use sdl
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my mouse mode change to sdl2 got delayed to 2.0.24 xDD
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they'll never merge it
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960591200803500143/unknown.png
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @nouaa fix should now be live btw 16.0.3
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> bug in editor since update,  changes back to normal tileset colour if i try to change it just a little
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960602673458069554/bug.mp4

20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bisect is just fastest xd
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> took me 2mins
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> found it hehe
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> aight ❤️
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when i saw the PR, i though it was my bad 🙂
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the way these time checkpoint numbers fade away looks kinda buggy, the black part doesn't change opacity and then disappears abruptly
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960631903579410442/unknown.png
