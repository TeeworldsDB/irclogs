03:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #817: Enable `-Wextra` and `-Wformat=2` (master...pr_ddnet_wextra) https://git.io/v7OCp
13:24 <@heinrich5991> mac build is green now: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/814
16:08 <+Pyrorca> Helo, can I speak to an Admni ?
16:08 <+Pyrorca> Admin*
16:12 <@deen> Pyrorca: what's up?
16:12 <+Pyrorca> Some problems, I don't know if you remember me
16:12 <+Pyrorca> But I'm a streamer, I stream sometimes Teeworlds, and there is big troubles from that
16:12 <+Pyrorca> Some haters/viewers are faking me
16:13 <+Pyrorca> On the game, on the serv, blocking, insulting, playing badly
16:13 <+Pyrorca> And just now, one of these guy just kicked me with a popular vote
16:13 <+Pyrorca> I ask to kick him cause of the fake, nobody response or vote yes, but when HE try to kick me for block ( which is clearly false ) I got banned
16:14 <@deen> Yeah, I have the same issue on DDNet
16:14 <+Pyrorca> So the only way for me to keep playing the game without having trouble, in stream and off stream, is to have the permission to kick players, and to be unkickable
16:14 <@deen> People call me faker and kick me, so I usually don't play with name deen
16:14 <+Pyrorca> Or I can't stream anymore the game, which is not somethings I like to
16:15 <@deen> Sounds like an extortion: "Give me mod pw or I will stop advertising for DDNet"
16:15 <+Pyrorca> Nah it's not
16:15 <+Pyrorca> Just a request
16:15 <+Pyrorca> Just i'm pretty nervous right now, about what just does happens
16:15 <@deen> I'm not the guy who decides that and I don't think admins are on irc
16:15 <@deen> This is more for development
16:15 <+Pyrorca> Make me feel really bad to know this guy do what he wants
16:15 <@deen> I can forward it to admin channel on discord, where can they reach you?
16:16 <+Pyrorca> Mh yes, what is the discord ?
16:16 <@deen> https://ddnet.tw/discord
16:17 <+Pyrorca> I'm on it
16:17 <+Pyrorca> "Wolfykh"
16:17 <@deen> anyway, no admins online
16:17 <+Pyrorca> Erf
16:18 <@deen> What about just playing with a random name or in team, not good enough?
16:18 <+Pyrorca> Can you transmit the message when there will be an admin ?
16:18 <@deen> If you're well known, people will always try to troll you
16:18 <+Pyrorca> Exept if can't be kickable
16:18 <+Pyrorca> When I pass the filter of a map, they can't not troll anymore
16:19 <+Pyrorca> exept 2 things, faking me, and try to kick me
16:19 <@deen> If we make you unkickable then you can block people etc
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Pyrorca: Just change your name while you're streaming so people don't bother you
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> and have a bind to change it back when you're about to finish a map
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> etc
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <â€  Wolfykh â€ > It stupid, cause the guys who want to troll will see my name anyway on the stream, random name or not
16:20 <@deen> But I guess we could have helper accounts for "vips" which are unkickable but have no further permissions
16:20 <+Pyrorca> And btw i'm not a blocker, this isn't the kind of things I do
16:20 <@deen> If gdin and the other admins think that's a good idea
16:21 <@deen> and then we can add a âœ” next to the name too if someone is logged into rcon with same name as they authenticated with
16:21 <@deen> cheap way of getting accounts for admins, mods and vips
16:22 <+Pyrorca> Cause it's impossible to put this âœ” without your way ?
16:22 <+Pyrorca> for a random player ?
16:22 <@deen> not in the text, we would add it somewhere else
16:22 <+Pyrorca> ahm, I don't understand so '_'
16:22 <@deen> let me try that helper thing
17:02 <@deen> How to tell the client which players are authed?
17:02 <@deen> We could use negative ping as a sign
17:02 <@deen> then it's easy to show in scoreboard
17:03 <@deen> but then we have no indication for people in spectators
17:03 <@deen> we could use a PLAYERFLAG in inputs, but then you only see it when you look at the tee
17:04 <@deen> we could add an extra packet, but that's more wasteful packets that have to be sent all the time
17:05 <@heinrich5991> make it an extra packet on change
17:05 <@deen> are they guaranteed to be transmitted?
17:05 <@heinrich5991> MSGFLAG_VITAL is guaranteed to be delivered
17:05 <@heinrich5991> extra packets can have that
17:06 <@deen> but the packet can get pretty big
17:06 <@deen> ah, we could make it a bitset
17:06 <@deen> just 64 bits
17:06 <@deen> much easier to transmit negative latency, haha
17:06 <@heinrich5991> duh
17:06 <@heinrich5991> ^^
17:07 <@deen> what do you think about this idea btw?
17:07 <@deen> giving VIPs accounts
17:07 <@deen> and showing who's authed with their current name
17:07 <@heinrich5991> I don't like it
17:07 <@deen> why?
17:07 <@heinrich5991> no matter how much people "don't block", I guess most can be tricked into "revenge blocking" at least
17:08 <@heinrich5991> and we'd need a policy to remove people from that status
17:08 <@deen> yeah
17:08 <@heinrich5991> then people will try to block people from that list in order to get them off that list
17:08 <@heinrich5991> sounds like a lot of trouble
17:09 <@heinrich5991> maybe we need a better way to call for mods?
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> how do you even choose who gets VIP
17:09 <@heinrich5991> how do you even choose who gets mod?
17:09 <@deen> @jao: ask "Who wants to be VIP?" on server and choose the first 50 people
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> jao, We will gona use rand
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> well people will want to have it ðŸ˜„
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Shishigami> could give away VIP on a case-by-case basis, much like moderator atm i.e. it could be given to people who are respected by the community as a whole but of course it adds administration overhead
21:53 <+eeeee> how safe is the auth currently? wouldn't we need some pubkey crypto for this?
22:14 <@Learath2> eeeee: auth is not safe at all, i'm working on some pubkey crypto accounts but i'm kinda busy with other stuff
22:28 <@heinrich5991> auth is plain-text
22:39 <+eeeee> vip accounts would get "hacked" often then
