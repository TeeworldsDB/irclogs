00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sometimes on map change/reload my ddnet client (beta) freezes up and crashes btw
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @deen I definitely prefer the first screenshot there, looks way cleaner... Especially the /top5, the spacing in the 2nd image hurts my soul
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie can you test #3161
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3161
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if that fixes the editor problem
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar âœª if you mean the quad cropping then no
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @deen when add option for see the time in minutes or in hours,  as the player prefers
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Kenzoo not planned. hours is fine I think
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u want to see ur time in minutes and not hours then just finish the map faster
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> not rlly
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> not everyone like it
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> old system was very nice and some guys like it
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> and now they dont like this new one
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But this is the problem whenever we change anything
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there will always be some players playing for 10 years who don't accept any change
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't see how seeing hours is so bad. And if we wanted to make an option it would be a whole lot of work for little use
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because it's not just the client that's using hours now, server also starts sending times in system messages back in hours soon
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and when you use /rank we'd even have to prepare a separate message for those who want to see minutes and those who want to see hours
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> The old system was shit and didn't make sense
09:20 <+ChillerDragon> oof the padding between the chat is too much :/
09:21 <+ChillerDragon> and changing time format is rip to all the blaze it number artists
09:22 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603264863.png
09:22 <+ChillerDragon> hope this nice number stays
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go back to 0.7 nobo
09:23 <+ChillerDragon> oof
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> stay in 0.6
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its better
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> leet https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603265247.png
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> waited the whole night to make that time lmao
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3028 occured again
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oo
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think that shows the source of the problem no?
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, out of bounds array access
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably the calculation of dist flows over? I don't understand your source code ðŸ˜„
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fixed
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> pre order chillerbot now to get a antibot crasher
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> check repo
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, that will fix the crash. but shouldn't you instead not overflow?
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> wait you leaked code @noby?
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 can you please update antibot with noby's fix?
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its closed source repo
10:05 <+ChillerDragon> but u gave access?
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> with the hook detects only
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to learath heinrich and deen
10:05 <+ChillerDragon> oof
10:05 <+ChillerDragon> thats why Learath2 has more multis than me now
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
10:05 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doubt
10:06 <+ChillerDragon> @noby can u explain coding pls
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > but shouldn't you instead not overflow?
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah but while i look into what actually causes it on these rare edge cases best to stop the crash immediatel
10:07 <+ChillerDragon> and fix fng bridge i dont want to spam ddnet 
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> use discord
10:07 <+ChillerDragon> oof

16:25 < darkoort> nice
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> server msgs deffs look bad with so much margin xd
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768502752702627840/unknown.png
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove margin
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then do it xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt add the ugly chat
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont want to touch that again xD
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we could just default off the config
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> i dont understand why the margin was added at all? Who wanted that
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs of the background probably
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768503905910652958/unknown.png
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the tees also need a bit of margin
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else they overlap
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i have to say i really like that the chat is always right from chat author, bcs its much easier to read long messages now
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768509080590876682/unknown.png
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why is speedup arrows in entities a different image
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be nice if it was in the entity .png so ppl could customize them
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes would be nicer
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> is it just me or when you using entites, the arrow hides in the freeze? do they have the same color?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they look similar maybe
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> ive seen that in recent maps and they hide a bit, ill show u
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well speedup isnt transparent
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it should be visible with a different background color
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768510133860302868/screenshot_2020-10-21_18-24-40.png
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768510663986511922/Captura_de_pantalla_de_2020-10-21_12-26-29.png
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> this is how it looks for me
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> if you are really zooming, you can watch it, but with normal zoom, you cant xd you just see the number
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah ðŸ˜„
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we could just make them more grey
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> instead of black ðŸ˜„
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> yeee
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> would be nice ðŸ˜„
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> im just pointing it, if I could help i would
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it depents on the bg color of your entity
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe try giving it an outline
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> huh?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> ok, nouis is right, if saturation is over 100,you can slighlty see the arrow
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> about asan/ubsan overhead: I can't hold 60fps on a full server, so still quite some overhead
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> huh, with cl_refresh_rate 0 it hits 60 fps, that's weird
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats not weird
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> remember that the main thread still builds the frames
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, no, actually cl_refresh_rate 0 didn't help
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean 60fps still good comapred to valgrind ðŸ˜„
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> [2020-10-21 18:49:36][mapchecker]: invalid standard map

21:33 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like a vanilla issue does ddnet even have a mapchecker? 
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what do u mean chillerdragon
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/jfc4re/google_releases_chrome_8604240111_security_update/
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the comments lol
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the TU has a computer with 48 cores
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > A heap buffer overflow has been found in freetype2 before 2.10.4.
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Malformed TTF files with PNG sbit glyphs can cause a heap buffer
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > overflow in Load_SBit_Png as libpng uses the original 32-bit values,
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > which are saved in png_struct. If the original width and/or height are
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > greater than 65535, the allocated buffer won't be able to fit the
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > bitmap.
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen do we use freetype before 2.10.4?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bundled in windows xD
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://security.archlinux.org/ASA-202010-10
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> freetype 2.10.0 -> 2.10.1 yep
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe we should update the bundled
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki but we only use our own font, so the only risk is if someone provided an evil ttf file and the player installed that manually. Also, we don't support png glyphs I think. At least I didn't link libpng in.
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
23:39 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ddnet has no map checker right? I was answering @Spyry maybe he deleted his messages on discord or what does not make sense to u?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes as i thought on the censored side of things the messages are gone
