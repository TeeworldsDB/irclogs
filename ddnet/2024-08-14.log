00:07 < bridge> <patiga> if you would need to match often, you could do smth like
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```rust
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> fn edit_tilemap<T: AnyTile, F: Fn(&mut Array2<T>)>(layer: &mut Layer, f: F) {
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>     match layer {
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>         Layer::Tiles(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>         Layer::Quads(l) => {},
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>         Layer::Game(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>         etc
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>     }
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> }
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> This doesn't actually use the `TilemapLayer` trait. now you can just do a function like yours
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```rust
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> fn clear_layer<T: AnyTile>(tiles: &mut Array2<T>) {
00:07 < bridge> <patiga>     tiles.fill(Default::default())
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> }
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> and then use that function with
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```rust
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> let mut layer: Layer = todo!();
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> edit_tilemap(&mut layer, clear_layer)
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```
00:07 < bridge> <patiga> ( @gerdoe )
00:08 < bridge> <zhn> thank you once more!
00:17 < bridge> <zhn> seems rust can't distinguish types in this case:
00:17 < bridge> <zhn> ```
00:17 < bridge> <zhn> mismatched types
00:17 < bridge> <zhn> expected mutable reference `&mut ArrayBase<OwnedRepr<T>, _>`
00:17 < bridge> <zhn>    found mutable reference `&mut ArrayBase<OwnedRepr<twmap::Tile>, _>`
00:18 < bridge> <zhn> ```
00:18 < bridge> <patiga> pls give related code ^^
00:18 < bridge> <zhn> it comes from `edit_tilemap` itself
00:19 < bridge> <zhn> on `unwrap_mut()`
00:19 < bridge> <patiga> the code is just copied over?
00:20 < bridge> <patiga> (I'm ingame rn, hard to type a lot)
00:20 < bridge> <zhn> ```rust
00:20 < bridge> <zhn> fn edit_tilemap<T: AnyTile, F: Fn(&mut Array2<T>)>(layer: &mut Layer, f: F) {
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>     match layer {
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>         Layer::Game(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>         Layer::Front(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>         Layer::Tele(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>         Layer::Speedup(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>         Layer::Tune(l) => f(l.tiles.unwrap_mut()),
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>         _ => {}
00:20 < bridge> <zhn>     }
00:20 < bridge> <zhn> }```
00:25 < bridge> <zhn> ah, `T` is defined by caller, seems thats why it can't infer it from inside
00:33 < bridge> <patiga> hm, I tried out similar code ant that worked
00:33 < bridge> <patiga> *and
00:38 < bridge> <zhn> maybe rust analyzer just fools me
00:38 < bridge> <zhn> closed laptop, eep time
00:53 < bridge> <patiga> nah, have the same error in the playground rn
00:54 < bridge> <patiga> but tbf, this code isn't all that necessary, a match each time is fine ^^
02:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki thanks for putting your trust into my data backup skills xd. But i just upload stuff to github. I am too lazy to do it now but i might do it one day. Also btw heinrich is also pro data backupper i sent him all my maps.
02:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Woah so many users with master server registration issues.
02:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I can reproduce btw. The ddnet-insta GER8 server only registers on 0.7 and fails for 0.6.
02:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i assumed it was the weird GER8
02:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no did i break master stuff in the 0.7 pr?
02:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep updating ddnet breaks 0.6 master
02:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen maybe chill a bit with updating official servers at the moment <:justatest:572499997178986510> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8722
02:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 could the 0.7 pr break the master? I thought the master is just a http request? Or does it also do some actual tw protocol udp stuff? How would you recommend debugging that?
02:40 < bridge> <animepdf> Removing 07 <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
04:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> no U
04:14 < bridge> <Tyrone> @heinrich5991 Could I get my dev role? I had a pr merge a while ago and just forgot to ask for my role, i can link the pr if u want
04:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> (He calmly asks, at 4am) :gigachad:
06:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @joaquocl @.a0040 the master server issue was not on your side. I messed that up sorry. Fix is on its way https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8725
06:20 < bridge> <matodor> 0.7 merged moment?
06:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
06:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but im here to fix it. Took me quite some time to find that bug -.-
06:23 < bridge> <matodor> \🙂
08:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> 🥳
09:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks for quickly analyzing and fixing!
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> :)
09:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> permalink (press 'y' anywhere on github): https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f14ae6bf13ccd8366a322ab448fd782952107b7c/.github/CODEOWNERS
09:48 < bridge> <totar> ?
09:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when you create a link to the master branch, the link might become invalid after we move or delete the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file. because I like working links, I usually post the permanent link if someone posts a link to the master branch. you can obtain the permanent link by pressing the 'y' key on github
10:00 < bridge> <totar> I was on mobile
10:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (I quickly googled:) then you can press the three dots in the top right corner and click "copy permalink"
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or he waits until you post the permalink :lol:
10:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I doubt the usefulness of me opening the pr https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8716 I predicted that you would request a 100% code rewrite @heinrich5991 would be much faster and less stress for me if you just had committed the stuff in first place ... what do you think about that?
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Also for you it should be faster. If you come up with your own idea anyways its one less step to read my code in the first place.
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might have been faster in this case, yes…
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its not always the case. But this time I knew. Its just because I promised I will fix the 0.7 stuff I felt like I had to.
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> You have these very specific ideas of how everything should work and im not getting better at predicting how you want the stuff done.
10:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in this case, filtering the connect addresses earlier is better because we have a limit of 16 addresses per browser
10:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if those are full with 0.7 addresses, we won't even get to the 0.6 addresses at a later stage
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are you back to reviewing prs btw?
10:54 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still 70 prs open :( I have the urge to comment "bump" on like 20 prs and issues
10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not really, I only reviewed the new PRs
10:55 < bridge> <remakepower> I couldn't connect to github now, that's too bad 😦
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea new ones get processed but the older ones all got stale
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> happens. takes quite some energy to go through all these PRs
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hire more maintainers
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> especially fun if you get insulted by some people if you do
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also not do all at once
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > especially fun if you get insulted by some people if you do
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (not you IIRC)
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who is insulting?
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont follow much but from what i see on github its all professional
10:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can DM you somewhere, but I don't feel like opening up another can of worms

11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i feel like a 12yo girl whispering secrets and everyone around is super annoyed
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nothing juicy i promise @louis xd
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nimrocks gave me "wrong credentials" btw

11:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki https://stdrs.dev/nightly/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/std/vec/struct.Vec.html std's docs with internals 🙂
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut did you subscribe to this issue? https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-meta/issues/1
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like, share, subscribe and activate the bell
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> u did it third time
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> stop:justatest:

11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the chat platform has never more than 1 active user so public global chat is private dms by default
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats different?
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i think the interesting doc is this https://stdrs.dev/nightly/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/alloc/raw_vec/struct.RawVec.html

12:45 < bridge> <fix_ale> Ddos?
12:45 < bridge> <fix_ale> Lags all servers
12:45 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes, for RUS1/RUS2. Play on GER2/GER10/POL instead
12:46 < bridge> <fix_ale> Fix? Ddos?
12:47 < bridge> <0xdeen> I can't fix it.
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 I have a proposal. I think it would be really cool to fix the ddos. Have you thought about that?
12:51 < bridge> <learath2> Damn, really? How did I not come up with this before?
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are welcome
12:52 < bridge> <learath2> Also your hilite didn’t work. Borked 3rd party client
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you need more good ideas im here
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 :c 
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lowercase L i guess
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> smol lerato
13:16 < bridge> <mian_ku> I get a problem when I compiling DDNet on Windows. It's happened on `Compiling link-cplusplus v1.0.6`. This the screenshots of console. What can I do?
13:16 < bridge> <mian_ku> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273238774112981066/image.png?ex=66bde383&is=66bc9203&hm=85f92d1ff5970960b2608c19ccabf674e70bd83a659ff636ad6bbcb2e458d367&
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf is link-cplusplus xd
13:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> your target is gnu, are you following the github readme? you want to use either the `msvc` build tools - or use mingw64 with gnu
13:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> rust lib
13:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> your target is gnu, are you following the github readme? you want to use either the `msvc` build tools with msvc rust toolchain - or use mingw64 with gnu rust toolchain
13:24 < bridge> <mian_ku> Sorry? My target just is windows? or my understanding fault?
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what he means is, you use mingw
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is also microsoft cpp
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for mingw you have to make sure to use the correct rust toolchain
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe without the stable-
13:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` type this in your console and try again
13:27 < bridge> <mian_ku> emm, is weird. but I build with MSVC, and building use MSVC too, i don't know why it choose my mingw when its build about rust
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> rust doesnt automatically choose msvc, i'm not sure if it defaults to gnu but when you just run `rustup default stable` - it might've chosen gnu
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> rust doesnt automatically choose msvc, i'm not sure if it defaults to gnu but when you just run `rustup default stable` - it might've
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh that way around i hvent heard about it xd
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> usually it chooses the msvc rust 😄
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah then this
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and if that fails, add the target
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would you use kibi or kilo bytes to show memory usage to a "normal" user?
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it seems like most gpus sold are actuall in GibiBytes. which surprises me a bit, since i think there was a time where this confusion was used to cheat some bytes.
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They are still listed as "GB".. which is kinda wrong then xdd
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i know, very hard question
13:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd use the technically more correct thing and confuse users
13:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> GiB
13:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think we also use it for map downloads
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you'd also say that 1024 is better than 1000?
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (but no strong opinion on this from me, you can choose what you want)
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i think i go with an i and 1024 then
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on linux i often see a small letter for the k in kB
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so seems in unix 1000 is more common (?)
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> according to wikipedia there is a standard:
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_80000
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
14:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> @learath2 what text editor are you using to code if i may ask?
14:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lerato is vscode enjoyer
14:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> electron maximalist
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Neovim nowadays but I used vscode for a long time yoo
14:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: have you already written your text editor in bash?
14:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> what golang LSP are you using? i tried golangci-lint-langserver, but i can't make it attach onto .go files, so i'm thinking about just using gopls
14:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> gopls :gigachad:
14:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> its literally called gopls :kekw:
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only heard of gopls
14:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot when did you switch?
14:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I missed your message saying „I use neovim BTW“
14:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> look at me coding go in neovim like a gigachad
14:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273263468618846260/grafik.png?ex=66bdfa83&is=66bca903&hm=d946f069e2010547b9c736855f9ecf0822763fe03d70cdc159f17a81523fb35c&
14:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I liked gopls
14:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No .\_.
14:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> var number int looks like Java xd. I would just do number := 20
14:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> at first `:=` looked ugly for me
14:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So robsti is the last ddnet maintainer who does not use vim?
14:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> i suck at go, so i'm just reading through some docs atm `:=` is the same as `auto` right?, i find it fine, the thing i hate is multi line variable declarations, they look ugly af
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also use modern technology
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
14:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Eh admin maybe. Idk who counts as maintainer. Jopsti is also big windows vscoder
14:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> jupsti is graphics gigachad, he could use nano and i wouldnt mind
14:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> gpu accelerated type script editor
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> funnily in terminal i use a editor made in go
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> called micro
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/zyedidia/micro
14:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> micro nano pico
14:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> vim
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vs-macro
15:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
15:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> how is
15:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> `func main(x int, y int)`
15:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> easier to read than
15:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> `func main(int x, int y)`
15:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> :(
15:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273265097141125190/grafik.png?ex=66bdfc07&is=66bcaa87&hm=0226e61e646b0b2ba6fbf8c57353e6b4f6171dd60a4f893be19b1b78211b6ba7&
15:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I suck at vim bindings I just use it for the startup times xd
15:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea that also trolled me melon
15:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `func main(x, y int)` 😏
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> style discussion are always an endless discussion
15:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Some styles are superior
15:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's easier to parse for a computer, because it doesn't have to guess where the type ends
15:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like tabs over spaces
15:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's very cool. parsing C++ is very hard, for example
15:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think i'm just so used to c
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess the best argument for tabs is indeed that tabs are configurable in size
15:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think i'm just so used to c++ syntax that anything else looks odd
15:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And they work well with indented here docs in bash and Makefiles
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont u also write rust code a lot
15:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Intel or AT&T?
15:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye :justatest:
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also tbf.. data types are highlighted in a color
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it also makes functions more greppable
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it'sprobs that, which makes it ez to read
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can search for a rust function using `fn function_name`
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273266158895759380/image.png?ex=66bdfd04&is=66bcab84&hm=357a3bb1e7fcabb4fd412e84d1931857055b3886ac34309b3b4c048486b5edc5&
15:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> intel
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can directly see it
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without parsing xd
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't found an easy pattern for C/C++ functions
15:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good taste catto
15:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have no idea how to read AT&T syntax xdd
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s the worst
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s like Chinese
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No front fred but your lang has some complicated symbols
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am used to whatever IDA uses
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess intel like
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> espacially with things like function overloading(? is that the right word)  you have to basically grep the entire thing if you want a clear result
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```cpp
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> void CJsonOptionalField<char *>::ToJsonImpl(char *pBuffer, int BufferSize) const;
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> void CJsonOptionalField<char *>::ToJsonImpl(char *pBuffer, int BufferSize, int x) const;
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> for example
15:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> is that possible in go?
15:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok hackerman
15:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What did you use IDA for?
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i am hacker.
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i used it do inject code into a 32bit exe
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's all you need to know xd
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i havent touched disassembling since like 8 years
15:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also isn’t IDA this proprietary for profit ransomware?
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what?
15:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you do again try r2
15:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Isn’t ida pro like 40 bucks
15:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And it’s closed source
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> more like 4000 bucks
15:14 < bridge> <matodor> adaptive height dont work?
15:14 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273268449594052733/image.png?ex=66bdff26&is=66bcada6&hm=68be5482e271c83ba11e1ed11e62fa02400cb4328604c1e45a493dce4a2be2f1&
15:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh boi
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but there's a free version
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but there's a gratis version
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah ofc i used free version
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😉
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> `gratis` :gigachad:
15:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It caps some ratios it’s a feature I guess @matodor
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah our UI breaks, so 5:4 is smallest aspect ratio
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we already discussed letting ui break instead
15:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we decided to not support arbitrary aspect ratios
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u grep function names to find stuff. then you could also overload in rust using traits xd
15:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 12yo jopsti cracking lego starwars for windows gaming
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> psst
15:16 < bridge> <artemivashchuk> hello everyone I'm nen and just started playing ddnet tell me pls ddnet normal game?
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no it's AAAA
15:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> very normal game! - the core-game is teeworlds
15:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's actually AAAAA
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s good e-dating game
15:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> !timeout chillerdragon MilkeeyCat Jupstar 300 rude
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we have all kinds of ppl
15:17 < bridge> <matodor> imagine chiller implements adaptive ui instead of 07 support
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from doctors to drug dealers
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is no joke
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:17 < bridge> <artemivashchuk> okay thx i go playing ddnet bye all
15:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> bye artem!
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Have fun
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Watch out for herobrine
15:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:peeposcare:784828457993502741>
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem is that adaptive UI is that it's hard to support. also, people can develop the stuff that they want to
15:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is it about then? Cheating?
15:19 < bridge> <matodor> I think it would be easy if implement it in CSS style
15:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Viewport advantage?
15:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh I read a „isn’t“ xd
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if ddnet ui would be DPI aware it could already save lot of space
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often code in weird aspect ratios

15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like this
15:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When 0.5 font for dd-pg
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is 0.5 font
15:22 < bridge> <matodor> server name 5:4, maybe make map name less wide
15:22 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273270566115217501/image.png?ex=66be011f&is=66bcaf9f&hm=3196a5b2e15a5f8bfae36237656888a1867968d3785436541910e16bf3f156f7&
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did 0.5 use a different font?
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's about all UI
15:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jopsti steam player confirmed
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why?
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what did i leak
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i started exactly when 0.6 came out
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You never played 0.5?
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i started it once
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I also never played 0.5 xd
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah never played
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea idk your fonts look so unteeish
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's the 0.6 font
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No way
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just has no outline
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looks weird
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for UI it doesnt even matter i think.. for nameplates i gotta think about it some day
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> low prio
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo UI suffers more from the vibe than the nameplates
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean basically all text you ever see has no outline
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you really get used to it fast xD
15:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> readability is the bigger problem
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and that is mostly for stuff like nameplates with changing background
15:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye
15:31 < bridge> <louis> nameplates outline is nice
15:31 < bridge> <louis> but yeah the ui looks more 'clean' without the weird outline imo, not sure if its a good thing or not
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i never play with nameplates, so dunno xD
15:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> never?!
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think they block too much of the view
15:31 < bridge> <louis> i have a +toggle for them
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more annoying than good 😄
15:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> not even strong indicator?!
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah me too
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i rarely click it 😄
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can remember it
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on KoG there is also storng only
15:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:  yeah i can't
15:32 < bridge> <louis> play without all that stuff, its refreshing
15:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> i have a keybind to toggle it, so it's not always on
15:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> but i like to leave it on espacially in t0

16:14 < bridge> <zhn> freesans
16:14 < bridge> <zhn> freesans bold
16:14 < bridge> <zhn> + atlased
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would you 10/10 recommend it?
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a serious reason why i could imagine using a diff font is, that l and I look almost the same on 0.6
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that sucks
16:17 < bridge> <zhn> it misses like 70% of symbols but it's way better than dejavu
16:17 < bridge> <zhn> im playing with unpatched freesans bold rn
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> screenshot of server browser xd
16:18 < bridge> <zhn> wait

16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah that one
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i remember the ingame timer looked so fat
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in earlier versions
16:22 < bridge> <zhn> and its so good
16:26 < bridge> <louis> more symbopls is better though
16:26 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i like it

18:20 < bridge> <matodor> I even tried reinstalling the VPS
18:20 < bridge> <matodor> which way to debug?)
19:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I had similar issues on my own internet, it shouldn't lag all the time on Europian servers, but still lagspikes happened
19:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I used pingplotter to see whatsup, didn't find much.
19:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I figured maybe it's my DNS that is set up wrong, so my router is shitting on itself finding the best one. Switched to cloudflare WARP (application) and it solved most lagspike issues for me.
19:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (Mind you, cable internet had no difference, it was an ISP problem, better to call the ISP to help)
19:36 < bridge> <abricotiabricota> I've same lagspikes but i'm child can'r change cuz parents 😭
19:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well, that sucks
20:18 < bridge> <matodor> the problem is not only with me, but with different players from different regions
20:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well then, if it happens simultaniously, then it's server issue
