00:22 <@deen> Hm, have a problem with my new DB scheme
00:23 <@deen> A new player plays on 2 servers, while the replication is not working. Then he will have 2 different PlayerIDs. How to fix that?
00:24 <@deen> we could regularly run over the database and fix those cases (they should happen pretty rarely), but that's such a hacky solution, using external tools
00:26 <@deen> I guess we have to use the full player name as ID after all, ouch
00:27 <@deen> that was one of the main motivations for the DB scheme change
00:38 <@deen> oh well, same problem with MapID
00:39 <@deen> and CountryID
00:39 <@deen> stupid replication
