00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Learath your code doesn't really work
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Temmie> fix dat game.
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Temmie> :3
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @fokkonaut what was that
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a thing i will do tomorrow
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cant test right now, im on mobile
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But i know from my mod that the besttime stuff for file based score needs to get set after LoadScoreThread
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and bcs i dont know if that conflicts with sql i closed it
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> afaik this field between the playerboard and spectator list is unused. maybe it could be used like this so you know what you have while in freeze. might also show jetpack superjump etc.

03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> interesting idea
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and if you didnt collect the weapon its greyed out
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> great :feelsamazingman:
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> or just put it below shields
09:19 <+TeeSlayer> Hi. Does anybody know the name of the map where catch16 was often played on?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmh was trying to make something like this back then
09:30 <+TeeSlayer> somebody created catch64 for 0.7 and I want to host the old map :/
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Wasnt it something with bush in the name?
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Just filesearch
09:38 <+TeeSlayer> the thing is I don't remember the name
09:38 <+TeeSlayer> I've just looked at all maps with the name bush
09:38 <+TeeSlayer> on http://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/ and maps.ddnet.tw
09:38 <+TeeSlayer> no success
09:43 <+TeeSlayer> bridge: Do you think it was this map? https://lolinet.info/download/screenshots/catch16.png
09:43 <+TeeSlayer> eh n000b
09:43 <+TeeSlayer> I imagined it a bit bigger though
09:44 <+TeeSlayer> maybe because I was a noob back then, lol
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> This was one of the maps, there were a few like this
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Also the map grasscatch
10:41 <+TeeSlayer> n000b: I think it's the same map
10:41 <+TeeSlayer> grasscatch is probably the original name
12:04 <+TeeSlayer> Catch64 is now live on 0.7: search for L#07 :)
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Im 'corneum it is not unused, it shows the Server Limit (on ddrace its 0, and therefore its not shown). This weapon thing belongs to the heart and armor bar, i think HMH was it who created something like this already long ago.
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What is `GIT_SHORTRIV_HASH`?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What is `GIT_SHORTREV_HASH`?
18:11 <@deen> the result of git rev-parse --short=16 HEAD
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What is it used for?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> version info
