10:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Wouldnt it be a good feature if someone votes for a map x but there is a server running on this map everyone voting yes will connect to this server?
10:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> thought about it while playing on the kog gores servers
10:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i hate the vote system on those sever
10:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> No thank you
11:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> why?
11:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> If you are playing whit someone in otherwise empty server, changing maps will get annoying, since it might connect you to the other server
11:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Also will it change from Russian to Russian or from Russian to random
11:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Also would it change from Russian to Russian or from Russian to random
11:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> you could make it that there wont be x to y
11:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> like if u play on russia you will only get moved to another russian server
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> for example there are 3 servers
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Kobra 1 15/64 Player
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Kobra 1 10/64 Player
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Kobra 1 13/64 Player
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> this wont happen again if done right so there is 
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Kobra 1 38/64 Player
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Other map
11:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Other map
11:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> also what if 16 ppl vote yes and the target srv has 53? What should it do?
11:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Instead it should join to empty server and change the map
11:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And if no empty Russian, join to another Russia with that map
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> So if X votes "change map M" on C server and Q, W, and E vote yes, join X, Q, W and E to empty C, and change map to M, if no empty C server, join to another C server with map m.
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> 
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> C = country
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> M = map
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> X = Voter
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Q, W and E = voted yes
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> that would be an addon
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> So if X votes "change map M" on C server and Q, W, and E vote yes, join X, Q, W and E to empty C, and change map to M, if no empty C server, join to another C server with map M.
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> 
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> C = country, ex russian
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> M = map, ex kobra
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> X = Voter, 
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Q, W and E = voted yes
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> is the other developers agree with that I'd do that in my freetime i guess
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> thoughts?
11:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Or should it join them to another server only if vote fails
11:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i think that should depent on how many slots are free and how many voted yes
11:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Hmm yes
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> So if X votes "change map M" on C server and Q, W, and E vote yes and the vote failed, join X, Q, W and E to empty C, and change map to M, if no empty C server, join to another C server with map M.
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> 
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> C = country, ex russian
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> M = map, ex kobra
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> X = Voter, 
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Q, W and E = voted yes
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> So if X votes "change map M" on C server and Q, W, and E vote yes, join X, Q, W and E to empty C, and change map to M, if no empty C server, join to another C server with map M.
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> 
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> C = country, ex russian
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> M = map, ex kobra
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> X = Voter, 
11:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Q, W and E = voted yes
11:46 <+FlushA> Hello
11:46 <+FlushA> I have a question about compile DDNet on linux with cmake
11:47 <+FlushA> How just compile DDNet client without compiling server like bam client_release in old compile type
11:58 <+FlushA> and i want to know how compile for 32 bit linux on linux 64
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> imo ger server lags and gets ddosed due to the block servers
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> mb consider not hosting block :(
15:49 <+Learath2> don't think it's about block anymore
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> hmm why can't I change sv_rescue in rcon
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And why can't I force it using rcon
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe it can be only changeable on runtime
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to prevent cheating ?
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but hosting block servers on a different server than the race servers would be a good anti ddos idea anyways i think
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why we host block server?
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> idk
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> There's no enough block servers out there?
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :p
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye there is rly no need for ddnet hosting standard blmaps
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think so
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye true
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but it is nice for blockers to know that this is a serious server without fishy activity
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but i think this is not nough reason while these ddos days
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> blocker always caused problem, if I remember
