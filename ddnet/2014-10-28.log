00:24 < laxa> deen: idea !
00:24 < laxa> maybe that could work with account system if it's made one day
00:24 < laxa> but maybe synchrone ddnet_settings somewhere ? :p
00:25 < laxa> So everywhere you go, you have your settings !
00:25 <@deen> EastByte is working on account system i think
00:26 <@deen> but you don't want to sync all settings
00:26 <@deen> i don't know if it's useful
00:26 <@deen> like on android, laptop, desktop you may want different settings
00:26 < laxa> hum yeah
00:26 < laxa> skins / mousesens / binds
00:26 < laxa> mostly
00:27 <@deen> binds would break android client immediately
00:27 < laxa> fuck androit users !
00:27 < laxa> simple
00:28 < laxa> like everythjing
00:28 < laxa> make an option

10:41 <@deen> Doesn't even show my sound branch changes!
10:41 <@deen> I fixed some compilation problems and get something that kind of sounds like music, but something is still wrong
10:42 <@EastByte> yay
10:43 <@deen> nfoservers says they can probably get the high ping problem fixed =)
10:43 <@EastByte> :)
10:43 <@deen> i just have to report to them when it happens again, they show it to internap and they have to stop using the route over cogent
10:44 <@EastByte> sounds good
10:44 <@deen> because the issue only happens when they route their outgoing traffic over cogent
10:46 <@EastByte> and where will they route instead then?
10:46 <@deen> where they usually route, dunno
10:46 <@deen> they only switch at some times
10:46 <@EastByte> hm
10:48 <@deen> adding opus about doubles the compile time =/
10:48 <@EastByte> hmm
10:48 <@EastByte> and does it work on win/mac?
10:49 <@deen> no idea
10:49 <@EastByte> =)
10:49 <@deen> I'd be glad if it works on linux now
10:49 <@EastByte> hm on windows I think we should put a shared lib there
10:49 <@deen> why?
10:50 <@deen> we compile it statically now
10:50 <@EastByte> well if you are sure mingw/vs will go with it...
10:50 <@deen> i'm not sure at all!
10:50 <@deen> have to go, bye

11:05 <@EastByte> what did Nimda just do
11:05 < laxadedi> no idea xD
11:07 < laxadedi> Watched the code, I don't know what's happening...
11:08 <@deen> sorry, i just had to restart serverstatus^^
11:08 <@deen> removed persian
11:09 < laxadedi> That shouldn't make nimda do that <_<
11:10 < laxadedi> I guess the json strlen isn't 0 when you restart it somehow
11:51 <@EastByte> deen: ah hallowed is using a vpn now
11:52 <@EastByte> that's another option
11:53 < laxadedi> He just needs to proxy his skype to be safe from ddos I think
11:53 < laxadedi> maybe someone should tell him
11:53 <@EastByte> or just turn skype off while tournament
11:53 <@EastByte> (reconnect router first)

12:10 < KinG_> hi guys i'm back
12:13 < KinG_> hi BeaR is the sound thing added to clients or still waiting for?!
12:14 < BeaR> hey, it's already in the client 6.x+
12:14 < KinG_> how to add it to map?!
12:14 < BeaR> There is a new layer type, called sound layer.
12:14 < KinG_> ohum thanks
12:15 < BeaR> Simply add one to your group, bind a sound to the layer and add new audio sources
12:15 < BeaR> pretty much the same like quads (:
12:15 < KinG_> going to test it
12:20 < RafaelFF> Hello, there.   Any admin of the ddnet website online here?
12:20 < KinG_> BeaR: how to add sound from local source to map?!
12:20 < KinG_> RafaelFF: hi idk
12:22 < RafaelFF> ok, thanks.. I'm not sure what would it be the correct way for contacting him/her/them.
12:24 < KinG_> he just left for university he'll be back at night maybe
12:24 < KinG_> BeaR: u here?@
12:24 < KinG_> BeaR: u here?!
12:26 < BeaR> y, I'm here xd
12:26 < BeaR> what do you mean with local source?
12:33 < KinG_A> hi all any one here?ðŸ˜¶
12:34 < BeaR> hi

13:12 <@deen> hi RafaelFF. Love the archlinux package =)
13:13 <@deen> BeaR: do you want to look at my opus tries and maybe fix them?^^
13:13 <@deen> BeaR: I think we should replace wavpack with opus entirely for map sounds
13:14 < BeaR> deen: sure, why did you remove them at the first place :D?
13:14 <@deen> I hear something close to music now, but there is some cracking in it
13:14 <@deen> BeaR: i moved opus to Sounds branch
13:14 < BeaR> ah ok
13:14 <@deen> Sound*
13:15 <@deen> what's the current best practice for checksums?
13:16 <@deen> md5sums + sha256sums?
13:17 < BeaR> no clue, always using md5 :D
13:21 < BeaR> so much compiler errors :D
13:21 <@deen> yes?
13:21 <@deen> are you on windows?
13:21 < BeaR> y
13:21 <@deen> oh yeah, only tested linux so far
13:21 <@deen> no idea what to do^^
13:22 < BeaR> probably sth with inlcude files
13:23 <@deen> huh, I'm also getting include errors on my other machine
13:23 <@deen> but not on my laptop, strange
13:24 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
13:25 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
13:26 <@deen> ah no, didn't update this machine^^
13:29 <@deen> RafaelFF: Hashes should work now: http://ddnet.tw/downloads/
13:32 < BeaR> deen: you generated the opus headers via autoconf?
13:41 <@deen> ehm, i think i copied them
13:41 <@deen> which headers?
13:41 < BeaR> config.h 
13:41 <@deen> oh yeah, that might be a problem, i forgot
13:42 <@deen> it's just the result of running ./configure
13:47 < RafaelFF> @deen  sry, i was playing TW here and i didn't see your message
13:47 < RafaelFF> It is perfect!
13:48 < RafaelFF> Just please update it together with every new release ^^
13:51 <@deen> RafaelFF: will happen automatically
13:52 < RafaelFF> awesome, thanks a lot
13:58 <@deen> Thanks for the AUR package!
13:58 <@deen> installed it immediately when you uploaded it
14:00 < BeaR> deen: fixed it (:
14:00 <@deen> BeaR: awesome!
14:02 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #87: Fix opus sound loading (Sound...Sound) http://git.io/kojDqQ
14:03 <@deen> what about Windows? Did it compile after all?
14:03 < BeaR> (didn't fix windows build though, not sure how to do it the best way)
14:03 <@deen> ah, ok
14:03 <@deen> yes, i'm not sure either if the way for linux is good right now
14:03 < BeaR> added a changed config.h and version.h
14:03 <@deen> maybe we should just distribute shared libraries for all platforms and headers?
14:03 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #87: Fix opus sound loading (Sound...Sound) http://git.io/kojDqQ
14:04 < BeaR> yeah, I believe thats easier as it's pretty huge though
14:04 <@deen> Do you want to try or should I?
14:04 <@deen> There is this at least: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/opus/win32/opusfile-0.6-win32.zip
14:05 <@deen> but i guess we have to build the other platforms ourselves
14:05 < BeaR> do it if you have time, dunno what you have changed at bam (:
14:05 < BeaR> opusfiles is the encoder/decoder, isn't it?
14:05 <@deen> nothing big, just search for opus and you see it all
14:05 < BeaR> not the actual lib
14:05 <@deen> opusfile is a wrapper around ogg + opus, which we use
14:06 <@deen> "Opusfile provides application developers with a high-level API for decoding and seeking in .opus files."
14:06 <@deen> includes the ogg and opus dlls as well
14:06 < BeaR> ah ok
14:06 <@deen> i don't know when I'll have time =/
14:06 < BeaR> dunno can try it, but can't test it on linux atm
14:07 <@deen> having it work on windows would be a start
14:08 < BeaR> so I just need the opusfile.h ?
14:08 <@deen> oh, that would be cool
14:08 <@deen> hopefully yes!
14:08 <@deen> yay, sound actually works!
14:08 <@deen> good job, BeaR 
14:09 < BeaR> thansk (:
14:09 <@EastByte> yaay
14:12 <@deen> 1 minute music, halfway listenable at 260 KB
14:13 <@EastByte> people can't complain about >1mb mapfiles then :)
14:13 <@deen> yeah, sounds should stay about the size of images now
14:13 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/plsearch.webm
14:14 <@EastByte> we need something like this
14:14 <@deen> where did you get that from?
14:14 <@EastByte> I wrote it yesterday
14:14 <@deen> awesome!
14:14 <@deen> yes, that's nice to have, but you need it in so many placey
14:14 <@deen> places*
14:14 <@EastByte> player searchbars everywhere :D
14:15 <@EastByte> but there is a problem since the spectate selector requires a key to be pressed
14:16 <@EastByte> and I need to suppress other binds while typing a name
14:16 <@deen> =/
14:17 <@EastByte> maybe a second version of the spec selector would be good
14:17 <@EastByte> which works differntly
14:17 <@deen> sounds complicated
14:17 <@EastByte> and there is another thing I would recommend to add
14:18 <@EastByte> the abillity to select players
14:18 <@EastByte> (when having the cursor)
14:18 <@deen> i don't understand
14:18 <@EastByte> so by going into the menu using esc
14:18 <@EastByte> you can use the mouse to select a tee
14:18 <@EastByte> and use stuff like, whisper/add as friend/mute
14:18 <@EastByte> and show some detailed information about him
14:19 <@deen> yes, would be cool
14:19 <@EastByte> especially cool for streamers
14:19 <@deen> for the 1 streamer :P
14:20 <@EastByte> ddnet will grow :P
14:23 <@EastByte> hmm skychase is too hard
14:23 <@deen> Don't worry, new Tournament on Friday
14:23 <@EastByte> wut friday
14:23 <@deen> Halloween Tournament
14:23 <@EastByte> ah
14:24 < xRoThx_> Yo
14:24 <@deen> hi xRoThx_ 
14:24 <@deen> xRoThx_: did any ddos attacks happen?
14:24 < xRoThx_> Yes
14:24 <@deen> Nice, didn't notice anything
14:24 <@deen> Any information about them?
14:25 < xRoThx_> Got a couple e-mails, but I am in the netherlands
14:25 < xRoThx_> How is it ingame? 
14:25 <@deen> can you forward them to me or summarize them?
14:25 <@deen> pretty good
14:25 < xRoThx_> Everything fine
14:25 < xRoThx_> There is no information
14:25 < xRoThx_> Just the notification that they have been filtered
14:25 <@deen> I'm working with nfoservers/internap to get the high ping in the evenings resolved
14:26 < BeaR> Why are windows messages always so useful "Couldn't start application" ..
14:26 <@deen> i guess that's the server we should keep using, it's the best we've had in europe so far
14:27 <@deen> xRoThx_: when does the server run out?
14:28 < xRoThx_> 11-11 or something I  will check 
14:28 <@deen> thanks
14:28 <@deen> EastByte: and EUR?
14:28 < xRoThx_> 07-11
14:28 <@deen> 7., that's early
14:28 <@deen> have you decided if you want to prolong it or not?
14:29 < xRoThx_> I think I will not
14:29 < xRoThx_> I am planning on taking a bigger one
14:29 <@deen> oh?
14:29 < xRoThx_> And start hosting servers for players free/paying
14:29 <@deen> (this one is big enough for all of ddnet europe)
14:30 <@deen> xRoThx_: http://ddnet.tw/612.png (big image)
14:30 <@deen> GER2 is your server, did its job well during tournament
14:30 <@EastByte> eur Expires the 13 Nov 2014
14:30 < laxadedi> you don't use automatic prelevment oO ?
14:30 <@deen> laxadedi: who?
14:31 < xRoThx_> afk 2 min
14:31 < laxadedi> well, EastByte and xRoThx_ 
14:31 <@EastByte> why would I
14:31 <@EastByte> I get noticed months before
14:31 < laxadedi> you give autorisation and then it's automatic
14:31 <@deen> so here's the timetable:
14:31 <@deen> 2014-11-01  ger.ddnet.tw down
14:31 <@deen> 2014-11-07 ger2.ddnet.tw down
14:31 <@deen> 2014-11-09  fra.ddnet.tw down
14:31 <@deen> 2014-11-10      ddnet.tw down
14:31 <@deen> 2014-11-13  eur.ddnet.tw down
14:32 < xRoThx_> but ger2.ddnet is strong enough right? 
14:32 <@deen> Yes, seems so
14:33 <@deen> i was expecting much worse performance
14:33 <@deen> xRoThx_: So, do you want to keep hosting ddnet europe or cooperate in any way?
14:34 < xRoThx_> I am hesitating
14:34 < xRoThx_> What could be the arrangement for me? Credits is fine enough for me ;)
14:35 <@deen> Credits for sure. Do you have anything else in mind?
14:36 < RafaelFF> @deen: AUR package updated, with the md5sums.
14:36 < xRoThx_> Not really. Not sure what most others ask from you. For me the credits are enough. And a 'sponsor' rank o something on the forum
14:36 <@deen> RafaelFF: nice
14:37 <@deen> xRoThx_: mostly they want mod/admin access and some wanted to cheat on ddnet  servers :P
14:37 <@deen> outside of europe it was fine to have them as admins though, since I don't know the communities well
14:39 <@deen> Oh, and we could pay part of the server
14:39 <@deen> If the servers run well for about a month I'll consider readding donations
14:39 < xRoThx_> Sure, would be great
14:40 < xRoThx_> Mod/admin no need, in fact I would like you to delete another admin instead of adding me ;)
14:40 < xRoThx_> I hate admins on a server. DDNet is secure enough to run good without any admins
14:40 <@deen> if i buy my own server at nfoservers, I'd probably go with the 2 core one for 27 $ / month
14:40 <@deen> xRoThx_: which admin do you want removed?^^
14:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #88: Add opus as external library (windows only) (Sound...Sound) http://git.io/__x9Vw
14:40 < xRoThx_> all :P 
14:40 <@EastByte> deen: youuu
14:41 < xRoThx_> lol
14:41 <@deen> xRoThx_: which admins have you seen that did anything on ddnet?
14:41 < xRoThx_> None, Didn't play on ddnet really
14:41 < xRoThx_> Not such a racer :)
14:41 <@deen> we have Delo & Megaman, who are never online
14:41 <@deen> .me' only uses admin to troll laxa
14:41 < o_be_two> hi
14:41 < xRoThx_> I just hate abusing admins. Not personally, just standart
14:41 <@EastByte> didn;t even know we have admins
14:42 <@deen> Broken uses admin to enable fast emoticons on USA
14:42 <@deen> and I sometimes kick people who block, but mods do that as well
14:42 <@deen> and that should be about all administration happening on DDNet
14:42 <@deen> hi o_be_two 
14:42 < xRoThx_> o_be_two:  has a shitty admin. cyril is abusing a lot
14:42 < o_be_two> hes no more admin
14:43 < xRoThx_> Well deen  I will renew it. We will work something out later.
14:43 <@deen> xRoThx_: which server would you get?
14:43 < xRoThx_> hesitating
14:43 < xRoThx_> between 160$/month or a bit cheaper.. 
14:43 <@deen> xRoThx_: and I'm a bit afraid if you're hosting other people's projects alongside with our server =/
14:43 <@deen> teeworlds is not exactly a trustworthy community
14:44 < xRoThx_> I will not
14:44 <@deen> then i misunderstood your plan
14:44 < xRoThx_> DDNet keeps its linux server seperated
14:44 < o_be_two> think he use virtualization, deen 
14:44 <@deen> why do you think you need a 160 $ server then?
14:44 < xRoThx_> Sponsored by xRoThx :)
14:44 <@deen> do you want to run all on this dedicated machine?
14:45 < xRoThx_> No
14:45 <@deen> I think a dedicated machine for 160 $ is overkill, even if the entire European Teeworlds community plays on it
14:45 < xRoThx_> The server you have now will just keep running, For personal/other purposes I will take another server
14:45 < xRoThx_> Is that server enough for your needs? 
14:45 <@deen> the current one, yes
14:46 < xRoThx_> okay
14:46 < xRoThx_> Then notting changes for you
14:47 <@deen> oh yeah, and please don't get so strong ddos attacks that the datacenter goes down. it has only 20 gbit/s after all :P
14:47 <@deen> xRoThx_: do you know about teeserver.de?
14:47 < xRoThx_> I know about him 
14:48 < xRoThx_> I liked that owner
14:48 < xRoThx_> I proposed him to host my mod a couple years ago
14:48 <@deen> they were also offering servers for money and had huge ddos attacks
14:48 < xRoThx_> I liked him
14:48 <@deen> and they're planning to come back soon
14:48 <@EastByte> wut?
14:48 <@deen> http://teeserver.de/
14:48 <@deen> 22 days
14:48 < xRoThx_> You can let him contact me if he needs my help
14:49 <@deen> maybe you should work together with him
14:49 < xRoThx_> He has a company
14:52 < xRoThx_> So, about the creditrs deen 
14:52 < xRoThx_> You think its possible to add my name at the end of the server name? 
14:52 <@deen> i wouldn't like that, no
14:53 <@deen> at least for the DDRace servers, for block i don't care^^
14:53 < xRoThx_> Okay
14:55 < xRoThx_> for every tw server hosted on the vps except the ddrace servers for tournaments? 
14:55 < xRoThx_> actually only the servers you don't really care about
14:55 <@deen> hm, i don't really like this
14:56 < xRoThx_> Ok 
14:56 <@EastByte> the motd is okay I think
14:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #88: Add opus as external library (windows only) (Sound...Sound) http://git.io/__x9Vw
14:56 < xRoThx_> Oh, yes sure
14:57 <@deen> in my experience the hosters that want their name written everywhere want more after a few weeks and then stop hosting at all =/ (persgame, webafrica)
14:57 < hannibal> aw, are you getting ddnet new servers, deen ?
14:57 <@deen> maybe it's better if we just get our own server @ nfoservers, since you'd be running your own stuff on a separate server anyway, xRoThx_ 
14:58 <@deen> hannibal: we've been testing many new servers in europe
14:58 < xRoThx_> deen:  no problem for me
14:58 < xRoThx_> motd is fine
14:58 < xRoThx_> and we will see after
14:58 < hannibal> kk.. i don't have an overview deen. but i notice that my ping gets worse in the past 2 weeks
14:58 <@deen> hannibal: on GER2 or where?
14:58 <@deen> GER2 has only been up for 5 days^^
14:59 < hannibal> i guess the problem lies in my own connection. i'm not sure at all.
14:59 < hannibal> just i had 42, now i ave 63
14:59 < hannibal> i mainply play on EUR or GER
14:59 <@deen> =/
15:00 < hannibal> and i don't want to complain or anything. but i fail my hooks all the time since then :D
15:00 < xRoThx_> hannibal:  Where do you live? 
15:00 < xRoThx_> (city)
15:00 < hannibal> zurich, switzerland
15:01 < xRoThx_> You can look for a ddos protected server in zurich & maybe sponsor ddnet? :)
15:01 < hannibal> i can.
15:01 <@deen> they are expensive in zurich
15:01 <@deen> they have some good ones
15:01 < hannibal> how much?
15:01 <@deen> way too expensive
15:01 < hannibal> k
15:01 <@deen> i think 1 good server in europe is enough anyway
15:01 <@deen> multiple hundred CHF per month
15:01 <@deen> hannibal: can you compare ping to ger.ddnet.tw and ger2.ddnet.tw?
15:02 < hannibal> not right now, i'm at work. 
15:02 < hannibal> but i can get back to you at around 18:00
15:03 < xRoThx_>  deen I will renew the server if you are sure you will use it
15:03 < xRoThx_> Can do it now if you like
15:03 <@deen> xRoThx_: i'm not sure about the conditions you will have^^
15:04 < xRoThx_> My conditions; on the forum called Sponsor or something :D
15:04 < xRoThx_> with a nice color?? ^^
15:04 <@deen> yeah, that's no problem
15:04 < xRoThx_> maybe even a smiley & a star :p
15:04 < xRoThx_> jk
15:04 < xRoThx_> just the name. And the motd Hosting provided by xRoThx or something
15:04 < xRoThx_> thats it
15:05 < xRoThx_> Don't like to make everything difficult
15:05 <@deen> alright, sounds good
15:05 < xRoThx_> I will renew now
15:05 <@deen> we'll keep using the server
15:05 < xRoThx_> :)
15:05 < xRoThx_> ok
15:05 <@deen> and will shut down all other european servers
15:05 <@deen> hi GoJEGrEEN 
15:06 < GoJEGrEEN> hi deen
15:06 < xRoThx_> deen:  It has been renewed
15:07 < hannibal> where are your servers located, xRoThx_ ? :
15:07 <@deen> xRoThx_: awesome
15:07 < xRoThx_> In either case, Don't be affraid or something. If you don't like something or you want to say something. Just do it. Won't be closing it without telling you a couple weeks before
15:07 < xRoThx_> Its not like I will close in a rage and feel cool or so
15:07 < GoJEGrEEN> deen: i have problem with rcon and dummy . when u login in f2 and siwtch dummy when use wrong pw and switch your tee in f2 commands not work
15:07 < xRoThx_> hannibal:  FrankFÃ¼rt
15:08 < laxadedi> deen: where is the website going to go ?
15:08 < hannibal> Frankfurt? yeyy
15:08 < hannibal> that sounds like king ping for me.
15:08 <@deen> hannibal: it's the same server as GER2 :P
15:08 < hannibal> f
15:08 < hannibal> :D
15:08 < hannibal> were they not in strassburg?
15:09 <@deen> laxadedi: not sure yet. Maybe some cheap OVH or HarmonyHosting VPS
15:09 < xRoThx_> deen:  For webhosting I will have 100% ddos protected hosting
15:09 <@deen> xRoThx_: how?
15:09 < xRoThx_> deen:  In a couple weeks max
15:09 < laxadedi> I doubt the website will ever be ddos
15:09 < xRoThx_> That doesn't mather
15:10 <@deen> laxadedi: yeah, just want to get some cheap server that keeps running
15:10 < xRoThx_> But its the same hosting company as most online ddosers use
15:10 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: yes, known issue. i don't think i will fix it
15:10 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: just don't use wrong password^^
15:11 <@EastByte> xRoThx_: a hosting company being used for ddosing?
15:11 < xRoThx_> No, It is used to host the site itself
15:11 < xRoThx_> Not the power
15:11 <@deen> thanks a lot xRoThx_ 
15:12 < xRoThx_> The power are mostly shells, botnets or offshore servers
15:12 < xRoThx_> No problem deen 
15:13 < xRoThx_> I have to go no
15:13 < xRoThx_> I have to go now
15:13 < xRoThx_> Will be back in a couple houres
15:13 <@deen> bye, xRoThx_ 
15:13 < xRoThx_> Bye
15:15 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: you're running Persian Pro, right?
15:16 <@deen> I heard your servers are getting ddosed recently. Any idea who it is?
15:22 < Learath2> would host your website but my provider is an ass and rages even on the smallest ddos
15:23 <@deen> then definitely not^^
15:23 <@deen> even our empty ictf servers get ddosed
15:29 < xRoThx_> howso would kids want to ddos an empty server
15:30 < xRoThx_> Its not that after a ddos his name is in the motd.. 
15:30 < xRoThx_> don't see the benefits of ddosing an opensource and free community
15:30 <@EastByte> the kids can't keep the servers apart
15:30 <@EastByte> since we currently have two ips/servers for ger
15:32 <@EastByte> so I guess we are safe against "normal" ddos attacks now
15:32 <@EastByte> even our streamer protected him self
15:33 < xRoThx_> he could use chainproxy :)
15:33 <@EastByte> he uses a vpn now
15:34 <@EastByte> but would have been enough if he shutdown skype
15:34 < xRoThx_> g2g now
15:34 < xRoThx_> bb
15:34 <@EastByte> cya
15:34 < xRoThx_> back 3-5h 
15:40 <@deen> hahaha: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=552&p=5017#p5017
15:41 < o_be_two> deen, does your master.cfg use master1, master2 3 and 4 ?
15:41 <@EastByte> :D
15:41 < hannibal> i'll use it for my dummy :)
15:41 <@deen> o_be_two: i think so, why?
15:42 < o_be_two> cause i cant resolve master1 and master4, idk why
15:42 <@deen> they never worked for me
15:42 <@deen> only 2 and 3
15:42 <@EastByte> o_be_two: they are not all active
15:42 < o_be_two> oh ok so why 1 and 4 are in masters.cfg ?
15:42 < o_be_two> in case of need ?
15:42 <@deen> yeah
15:42 <@EastByte> the file is creatd automatically afaik
15:42 < o_be_two> ok so did you let them on your masters.cfg ?
15:43 <@deen> i didn't do anything, master servers are set by dns entries by the teeworlds guys
15:43 < o_be_two> ive a new tw serv that says he cant get registered, but other on same host can !
15:43 <@deen> that's weird, firewall rule maybe?
15:44 < o_be_two> ive editer firewall rules to allow icmp and dns yes, but it was working before
15:44 < o_be_two> and other TW on same host with same rules works
15:57 <@deen> working on linux with prepared libraries now
15:58 <@deen> now 32bit linux and mac
15:58 <@EastByte> how does that work?
15:58 <@deen> same as with mysql
15:58 <@deen> the .a file gets used
15:58 <@EastByte> ah
15:58 <@EastByte> okay still static linking cool
15:58 <@deen> yes, but don't have to compile it anymore^^
15:58 <@deen> oh, android will be problematic
15:59 <@EastByte> just keep audio out of android :/
15:59 <@deen> ^^
15:59 <@EastByte> oh wait, you wanted to use opus for everything?
15:59 <@deen> yes
15:59 <@deen> no
15:59 <@deen> opus for map sounds
16:00 <@EastByte> okay and old sounds remain the same
16:00 <@deen> for the regular ones it doesn't matter much i think
16:00 <@deen> they're small anyway
16:01 < hannibal> i don't understand much, but does it say that we're seeing progress with the sound thing? i gotta say i loved that presentation of hallowed & fels
16:01 <@deen> yes, progress on sound
16:01 <@deen> maps will not be as big
16:02 < hannibal> finish rooms will be real parties from now on :D
16:04 <@EastByte> which presenation?
16:05 < hannibal> they made a video. but it's not the presentation that i found impressing but the feature itself
16:05 < hannibal> impressive
16:05 < hannibal> :oo!!
16:05 <@EastByte> video?
16:05 < hannibal> wait
16:06 <@deen> http://www.hitbox.tv/video/298624
16:06 < hannibal> there you go.
16:06 <@EastByte> shitty flash required ofcourse
16:07 <@deen> it's just a map with a song playing^^
16:07 <@EastByte> I will see in 20 seconds
16:07 < hannibal> and hallowed mumbling something :D
16:07 <@EastByte> advertisment
16:08 <@EastByte> yep, funny
16:10 < hannibal> many people listen to music, so parts that require the sound feature
16:10 < hannibal> could be problematic?
16:10 <@deen> yes
16:11 < hannibal> hm
16:30 < o_be_two> oO what is banmasters on xxlddrace oO ?
16:30 <@EastByte> there was a master ban system somewhere
16:30 < o_be_two> awesome :D
16:30 <@EastByte> to trigger bans on multiple servers
16:31 < o_be_two> ddnet use something like that too ?
16:31 <@EastByte> ddnet is against ip bans
16:31 < o_be_two> i do banmaster by iptables lol
16:31 < o_be_two> well i remember ddrace are not with same annoying users than with blmap
16:35 <@deen> no, we don't ban people
16:35 <@deen> but i remember that i fixed the banmaster for ddmax back when i was banned there, so that tsin wouldn't have to follow m around all the time :P
16:35 <@deen> me*
16:35 <@EastByte> :D
16:38 < o_be_two> who can tell me if a serve is banned on master serv ?
16:38 <@EastByte> minus
16:38 < o_be_two> ty
16:43 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/RqdTcQ
16:43 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 30801c4 def: Add bind for dyncam to settings
16:43 <@deen> o_be_two: there is a list somewhere
16:43 < nuborn> hi
16:43 <@deen> hi
16:43 < nuborn> deen: I think I found the bug in the antiping-patch
16:43 <@deen> it's not just 1 bug
16:43 < nuborn> 2?
16:43 <@deen> maybe 3
16:43 < nuborn> oh...
16:44 <@deen> i don't know exactly what's happening
16:44 < nuborn> the bug is in the server, I moved the FireWeapons (because I struggled with the timing of the prediction). but that changes the timing of the server, so it should be removed
16:44 < o_be_two> looking for banlist
16:45 <@deen> yes, that probably caused it, nuborn 
16:45 <@deen> now i'm a bit scared to add back your patch
16:45 <@deen> nuborn: can you test whether shooting in freeze always works when you get lasered?
16:45 <@deen> as well as using grenade while in 1-second-freeze
16:46 <@deen> o_be_two: http://www.stats.teespace.de/?page=bans
16:46 < nuborn> deen: yes
16:51 < o_be_two> ty deen lets check :)
16:51 < o_be_two> seems to be "Nicht gebannt"
16:52 < o_be_two> !de-fr nicht gebannt
16:52 < Nimda> Translation: pas interdit
16:52 < o_be_two> Only 15 ips and there banlist oO
17:01 < nuborn> deen: how do I test the 1-second-freeze bug?
17:01 <@deen> nuborn: for example on the map FWYS Key 1 there are some freeze tiles that are only active for 1 seconds (look with entities, it says 1)
17:01 <@deen> use grenade and try to shoot while frozen
17:02 <@deen> should shoot normally
17:02 < nuborn> ok, I will try that map
17:11 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
17:12 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
17:14 <@EastByte> hm why havn't I seen teespace before
17:15 <@EastByte> they even have a json api
17:23 <@deen> so i'm compiling opus for android now^^
17:25 <@EastByte> heeelp
17:25 <@EastByte> why is m_paPlayerInfos[id].m_Latency only up to date when the scoreboard is open
17:25 <@deen> to save bandwidth?
17:25 <@deen> not sending unneeded information
17:26 <@EastByte> I thought the latency is in the snap
17:26 <@deen> no idea
17:26 <@EastByte> I mean you can look the latency up in demos aswell^^
17:26 <@EastByte> oh I see
17:26 <@EastByte> it's not up to date either
17:29 <@deen> ok, opus should be working on android
17:29 <@EastByte> nice
17:29 <@deen> just macosx still making problems
17:30 <@deen> (at least android compiled, don't even have a device to test^^)
17:30 <@EastByte> my smartphone is too slow :P
17:31 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
17:32 < nuborn> deen: it seemed to fix those two bugs
17:33 <@deen> nuborn: nice
17:33 < nuborn> and Im very certain none of the other code in the server could had modified anything (modifying info sent to the server)
17:33 < nuborn> client*
17:34 <@deen> ok, i would try adding it again, let's hope it won't bug many people again =/
17:34 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
17:35 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
17:35 <@EastByte> deen: okay I finaly found the player flag "PLAYERFLAG_SCOREBOARD"
17:36 < nuborn> do you want a patch, or do you see which lines are affected? (its the two/three modified lines in character.cpp with "FireWeapon()")
17:37 <@deen> nuborn: pull request or patch
17:37 < nuborn> ok, I can try a pull request
17:38 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
17:38 <@deen> hm, i should probably report a few bugs for opusfile
17:39 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
17:39 <@deen> their build setup doesn't work as well as libogg and opus
17:41 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
17:50 <@deen> and mac working!
17:52 <@EastByte> =)
17:52 <@deen> I'm surprised all platforms seem to be working
17:53 <@deen> BeaR: i think opus is working on all platforms
17:54 < BeaR> nice (:
17:54 <@EastByte> partytime!!!
17:54 <@deen> still needs more tests, whether everything works before releasing i think
17:55 < BeaR> compilaton works with visual studio
17:59 <@deen> nice
18:00 <@EastByte> oh the network protocol already has been extended using ddnet features
18:01 <@EastByte> deen: since there are people complaining about specific sounds and want them to be disabled
18:02 <@EastByte> would be cool if the client can inform the server that it doesn't want to hear specific sounds
18:02 <@EastByte> like tees crying
18:02 <@EastByte> client<->serverside configuration
18:02 <@deen> i think that's way too complicated
18:03 <@deen> just disable the specific sound client side?
18:03 <@EastByte> but some sounds have multiple meanings
18:03 <@EastByte> or not
18:03 <@deen> yeah, should still be good enough
18:03 <@EastByte> okay, then let's add more options
18:04 <@deen> sure
18:04 <@deen> i just added the options i needed personally
18:04 < BeaR> hm, just add volume sliders for the different sound channels ?:
18:04 <@deen> you want a slider for each sound?^^
18:04 <@EastByte> we could also generate a list of all sounds which can be disabled/enabled then
18:04 <@EastByte> yea slider for each sound
18:04 <@deen> if you want, go ahead
18:05 <@EastByte> BeaR: yea go ahead
18:05 < BeaR> hahaha
18:05 < BeaR> im just throwing in ideas :P
18:05 <@deen> I forked the huge android repo so i don't lose my opus and opusfile stuff for android: https://github.com/def-/commandergenius
18:23 <@EastByte> deen: any idea how the ddnet client can receive the current race time of another player without chat command or spec follow?
18:23 <@EastByte> maybe a new netmessage?
18:24 <@EastByte> the client just needs a timestamp of race start time
19:02 <@deen> there is no more space for new netmessages iirc
19:05 < BeaR> why :D
19:06 <@deen> i think we used up all available bits in the protocol
19:06 <@EastByte> wut
19:07 <@EastByte> so and you decided to use the last possible netmsg as Cl_ShowOthers?
19:07 <@EastByte> we need to go a layer deeper then :P
19:07 <@EastByte> higher*
19:08 <@deen> i didn't decide that, there were no more netmsgs available in ddrace long before ddnet
19:08 <@EastByte> ah so showothers is older
19:10 < BeaR> can't see where teeworlds is using bitflags for netmessages :d
19:10 <@deen> maybe i'm wrong, checked more than a year ago last time
19:10 <@EastByte> I'm searching
19:11 <@EastByte> hm
19:12 <@EastByte> msgid is just a packed integer
19:12 <@EastByte> so not even static sized
19:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] trml opened pull request #89: Add updated/fixed weapons prediction (DDRace64...fix_antipingweapons) http://git.io/t9Do9Q
19:13 <@EastByte> but there was something back then
19:13 <@EastByte> and there still is this comment: "# Can't add any NetMessages here!"
19:17 <@EastByte> no I don't see any reason for a limit there
19:19 <@EastByte> oh, hm
19:23 < BeaR> hm could be caused by this system bit
19:23 <@EastByte> I don't really understand it
19:23 < BeaR> :D
19:23 <@EastByte> int Sys = Msg&1;
19:23 <@deen> The people writing fly bots are asking me for help to merge new ddnet commits into their branches...
19:24 < BeaR> after everything is packed, there will be added a bit at the first byte of the packet
19:24 < BeaR> deen: lol
19:24 < BeaR> well already seen a few xd
19:24 <@EastByte> deen: and you didn't even commit the coding style change :P
19:25 <@deen> and they're even mad when i don't want to help them
19:26 < BeaR> the madness of merge :D
19:26 <@EastByte> BeaR: where does the system flag come from?
19:27 < BeaR> it's added at SendMsgEx
19:27 < BeaR> the first byte will be shifted 1 left
19:27 < BeaR> and this 1 bit will be used as System-Flag :D
19:27 <@EastByte> oh this is shit
19:27 < BeaR> maybe in combination with IntPacking it will be reduced to 5bits
19:28 < BeaR> as the extended bit will be removed from the first byte
19:28 <@EastByte> yea
19:29 <@EastByte> so it depends on the int kompression how many netmsgs are allowed
19:29 < BeaR> well no actually this ugly hack
19:29 < BeaR> int compression would be ok
19:29 < BeaR> but removing the extended bit breaks everything
19:30 < BeaR> bad /:
19:30 <@EastByte> oh now I understand why matricks called it hack
19:31 < BeaR> this is maybe the worst in the whole codebase :D
19:31 <@EastByte> argh
19:32 <@EastByte> and dynamic sized/data netmessages are not possible I guess
19:32 < BeaR> hm?
19:32 <@EastByte> the structure of every netmessage is defined at compiletime
19:33 < BeaR> yeah for safer serialization
19:33 <@EastByte> so we would need more hacks to add dynamic sized data for example
19:33 < BeaR> No, Netpackets are already dynamic sized
19:34 <@EastByte> yes they are
19:34 <@EastByte> but we can't modify their structure
19:34 <@EastByte> let's say we want to implement a sub netmessage protocol
19:35 <@EastByte> using one netmessage
19:35 <@deen> yes
19:35 <@deen> we had that somewhere
19:35 <@EastByte> how do you want to send dyanmic sized data over it
19:35 < BeaR> the same way it's done atm :d
19:35 < BeaR> client just needs to know how to unpack it
19:35 <@EastByte> but we only have strings and integers
19:36 < BeaR> what else do you want :D?
19:36 <@EastByte> so I want to transmit 500 bytes over this netmessage
19:36 <@EastByte> how would the structure look like
19:37 <@EastByte> one string (nullterminated) doesn't allow nullbyte
19:37 <@EastByte> integer compression would destroy everything else
19:37 < BeaR> You basically have a netmessage with ID = NETMESSAGE_SUB and then an extra netmessage as data of the container packet
19:38 < BeaR> Client first serializes the outer packet, then the subpacket
19:38 <@EastByte> howo does the client know the size of the subpacket
19:38 <@EastByte> the unpacker can only extract strings/integers/booleans
19:38 < BeaR> Packets have some sort of header
19:39 <@EastByte> but a subpacket is raw data
19:39 < BeaR> yeah but the client knows that it's a extra packet
19:39 <@EastByte> hm maybe
19:40 <@EastByte> so the ddnet client needs to handle the specific msgid differently or we add something like NetRawData() to the unpacker
19:41 <@EastByte> deen: you said there we have a sub protocol somewhere?
19:46 < xRoThx_> Yo
19:47 <@EastByte> hello
19:50 <@deen> EastByte: i thought someone was working on it before, but apparently not much came out =/
19:50 <@EastByte> okay
19:51 < xRoThx_> Is there anyone who can build some custom things in ddnet mod? :)
19:52 < xRoThx_> But I don't want it to be shared :)
19:52 <@EastByte> what kind of things do you want?
19:52 <@EastByte> rainbows? :)
19:53 < xRoThx_> Some joints for the tee's :P No, just kidding. A couple years ago, I used to be the only one having upgrades in my mod
19:53 < xRoThx_> I have 2 mods (+source) where upgrades is a part of it
19:55 < xRoThx_> Forgot to finish my sentence
19:56 < xRoThx_> I would like the upgrades to be in a custom mod built on ddnet
19:57 < xRoThx_> deen:  GB usage this month: 278.88 GB 
19:57 < xRoThx_> Those servers eat a lot bandwith 
19:57 <@deen> that's nothing
19:57 <@deen> old GER regularly hit 2 TB
19:57 <@deen> it also hosted website though
19:57 <@EastByte> well it didn't have a ddos protection
19:57 <@deen> yes, that as well^^
19:58 < xRoThx_> Well, I got up to 6TB max
19:58 < xRoThx_> after that I have to pay some more
19:59 <@EastByte> 200gb per month should be average
19:59 <@deen> what?
19:59 <@deen> 200 GB should be average for what?
19:59 <@EastByte> average ger tw traffic per month
19:59 < xRoThx_> its on a week EastByte  ;)
19:59 <@deen> EastByte: no way
19:59 <@EastByte> yes way
19:59 <@deen> chile has 600 GB every month
19:59 <@deen> without any attacks
20:00 <@deen> GER should have at least twice that
20:00 <@EastByte> eur currently has ~70gb
20:02 <@EastByte> hm blocker is a huge traffic waste
20:05 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
20:06 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!

20:09 < xRoThx_> has chile ddos protection?
20:09 <@deen> no
20:10 <@deen> and if it gets ddosed big again the server goes down permanently
20:10 < xRoThx_> oh shit
20:11 < xRoThx_> there is software ddos protection
20:11 <@EastByte> doesn't help if the whole datacenter is affected by an attack
20:11 < xRoThx_> why not trying that for ddnet?
20:11 < xRoThx_> oh..
20:11 < xRoThx_> yes..
20:13 < xRoThx_> deen:  what should I do, take small servers to host in usa + europa? or take 1 big in europe
20:13 <@EastByte> but I think attacks like we had this month won't repeat
20:14 <@deen> xRoThx_: i really have no idea what your plan is, but it seems scary
20:14 < xRoThx_> Howso does it seem scary? 
20:14 <@deen> you want to take ddnet, add some closed source stuff
20:14 < xRoThx_> Oh, yes, but that is just custom shit :)
20:15 < xRoThx_> personal. Notting to do with ddnet, exept using the most complete and safe source out there at this moment? :)
20:15 < xRoThx_> ^^
20:15 <@deen> ah
20:19 < xRoThx_> but deen 
20:19 < xRoThx_> what should I do, take small servers to host in usa + europa? or take 1 big in europe
20:21 <@deen> usa doesn't have many players
20:21 <@deen> i don't know what your plan is
20:21 <@deen> so i can't know the answer
20:21 < xRoThx_> I don't have a plan
20:21 < xRoThx_> Would like to learn some more on hosting
20:22 < xRoThx_> and get more experience with linux etc
20:41 < o_be_two> deen, are you running scripts for ddnet serv on github ? im a bit curious
20:41 < o_be_two> start script, test scripts, etc
20:43 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts
20:43 < o_be_two> ty
20:45 < o_be_two> how to suggest en edit on github ? By forking or there is other way ? (im noob on github)
20:46 < o_be_two> well just little thing i dont understand why you didnet user comment tag in this file : https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-setup
20:47 < o_be_two> maybe you need to try atop to monitor your server ^^ thats awesome !
20:48 < o_be_two> is it for debian ? why you dont use the easy way adduser or the direct way useradd instead of editing files directly oO ?
20:50 < o_be_two> oh ddnet use mariadb :o ! the ddnet tw is able to use mariadb ?
20:50 < o_be_two> you dont use master-master on mariadb ? was just to know if its more stable that by original mysql
20:53 < o_be_two> its a really good prod mind used here ^^
21:10 <@deen> i just like editing the files instead of using adduser/useradd, can never remember the syntax
21:10 < KinG___> hi all
21:11 <@deen> mariadb was better than mysql, and yes, we're using multi-master replication, which is really ugly, but i haven't foun a better solution unfortunately
21:11 <@deen> hi KinG___ 
21:12 < o_be_two> really ? multi master replication is ugly on mariadb too :o ?
21:13 <@deen> it's the same as on mysql
21:14 < KinG___> deen: yesterday u told me a name of a download manager what was that? i forgot ^_^
21:15 <@deen> aria
21:16 < KinG___> thanks
21:17 <@deen> Hm, Forris says his dummy randomly disconnected
21:19 < o_be_two> is aria better than transmission for torrent ?
21:20 < KinG___> deen: i had same problem on windows it disconnects suddenly and don't reconnect and sometimes when i try to connect it it connects but in the middle of screen always writes "Connection Problems"
21:21 < KinG___> and sometimes dummy didn't have any hook sounds when i hook unhookable the sound for it don't play or same for hookable
21:22 <@deen> weird =/
21:22 <@deen> no idea, never used aria
21:22 < o_be_two> KinG___, what about your connection and firewall ?
21:22 < KinG___> o_be_two: always off
21:23 < o_be_two> cause about sound and grenade explosion, TW devs told me that it could be happend when some udp packets are lost.
21:23 < KinG___> why there is so much "_" behind my name :|
21:23 < o_be_two> there is many king on qnet i think :p
21:23 < o_be_two> yes all other are already taken
21:23 < o_be_two> already took*
21:23 < KinG___> o_be_two: nah it only happend for some times and just dummy didn't have the sounds
21:24 < o_be_two> k but a dummy use connection too, its like having 2 ddnet launched at a time
21:24 < KinG___> !!i didn;t know that
21:24 < o_be_two> im in canada and i play on french servers, i have 100ms ping, but when using dummy i go to 110/120
21:25 < KinG___> wierd dummy don't make anything with my ping
21:25 < o_be_two> your dummy use a second connection, its sure
21:25 < KinG___> how much is your ping when downloading ?and how much is your full speed?!
21:25 < o_be_two> ok after that it could be a bug from the program :/
21:26 < o_be_two> i have a 30mbps download and 10mbps upload, full unmetered via cable
21:26 < KinG___> 30 megabit?!
21:26 < o_be_two> when donloading im running like 130/150ms
21:26 < o_be_two> yes
21:27 < KinG___> just reconfigure your router and check the "QOS(quality of service) checkbox maybe it will help your ping when u are downloading
21:27 < KinG___> my ping is 300 when downloading :P
21:28 < o_be_two> ...
21:28 < KinG___> okay this is wierd it's first time seeing laxa timing out!
21:28 < o_be_two> a little ping is better ...
21:29 < KinG___> laxa: what happend?:P
21:29 < laxa> KinG___: ?
21:29 < o_be_two> its cause laxa uses his own connection on an operator that restart it every 24h
21:29 < laxa> nop
21:29 < laxa> it restarts every 72h+
21:29 < o_be_two> ok ive stayed when it was really wanadoo ahah :D
21:29 < KinG___> what restarts?!
21:30 < o_be_two> the adsl connection restart every 72h+
21:30 < KinG___> ohum
21:30 < o_be_two> its a french provider, the most expanded in the country
21:30 < o_be_two> like Bell in US
21:31 < KinG___> i can't find google chrome on ubuntu store !!it's wierd!
21:31 < o_be_two> no itsn ormal
21:31 < o_be_two> Google Chrome is not on official repo
21:31 < o_be_two> you need to add it, please find the document on the official ubuntu docs
21:31 < KinG___> !!!!! firefox is official but chrome isn't?!!!!!
21:32 < o_be_two> you can download the package too directly on the google chrome official website
21:32 < KinG___> yeah but it's a bit harder
21:32 < o_be_two> KinG___, idk why, but there is Chromium officially in repo
21:32 < o_be_two> and chromium is free like mozilla softwares, it could explain a little
21:32 < o_be_two> chromium is the free edition of google chrome (opensource)
21:32 < KinG___> i found it
21:33 < KinG___> downloading now
21:33 < o_be_two> chromium has not all chrome features but its great too
21:33 < KinG___> i just want it's "save To" func
21:33 < o_be_two> Google Chrome is not Free and i think that Google just wants to keep his software up to date by themselve
21:34 < KinG___> they are mostly same 
21:34 < KinG___> chrome and chromium
21:34 < o_be_two> yes
21:34 < o_be_two> if you have 300ms, thats why you dummy get down ...
21:35 < KinG___> not actually
21:35 < KinG___> my ping is same under 100KB/s 
21:36 < KinG___> more than 100KB/s i get higher ping
21:36 < KinG___> 100~150 just makes ping get high by 10ms or less but higher than that is unexplainable ... :|

21:52 <@deen> EastByte: do you want to try out opus?
21:55 <@EastByte> deen: sure :)
21:55 <@deen> I'm also playing around
21:55 <@deen> we should really release it soon, people are making wavpack maps already
21:55 <@deen> and can't even upload to forum because of file size^^
21:56 <@EastByte> haha
21:56 <@EastByte> do I need the sound branch?
21:56 <@deen> yes
21:56 <@EastByte> koay
21:58 <@EastByte> DDNet bin got 0.7M bigger
21:58 <@deen> =/
21:58 <@deen> that's a lot
21:58 <@EastByte> nah
21:58 <@deen> but every map gets 2 MB smaller :P
21:58 <@EastByte> =)
21:59 <@deen> did you use strip?
21:59 <@deen> i strip the binaries before releasing
21:59 <@EastByte> I did bam release
21:59 <@EastByte> how do you strip it?
21:59 <@deen> strip -s DDNet
21:59 <@deen> 1 MB smaller :P
22:00 <@EastByte> oh cool
22:06 <@EastByte> I just need to encode a .ogg right?
22:07 <@deen> hm?
22:08 <@deen> make an opus file
22:08 <@deen> for example using opusenc
22:08 <@deen> or ffmpeg
22:08 <@deen> ffmpeg -i anyfile out.opus
22:08 <@EastByte> oh I thought in the end it's ogg
22:08 <@EastByte> okay
22:08 <@deen> it is, but the file ending ogg is usually associated with vorbis
22:08 <@EastByte> ah
22:12 <@deen> cris272: hi. want to test out opus support?

22:15 < cris272> hey deen, what is opus ?
22:15 <@deen> the opus audio codec: http://www.opus-codec.org/comparison/
22:15 <@deen> good quality, small files
22:15 <@deen> no in ddnet git as map sounds format
22:16 < cris272> cool
22:16 < cris272> ok
22:16 < cris272> i just have to update my git deo ?
22:16 <@deen> yes
22:16 <@deen> if it compiles that's already good^^
22:17 <@EastByte> [sound/opus]: failed to decode sample ()
22:17 <@deen> huh?
22:17 <@deen> does that come at start?
22:17 <@deen> or did you do anything?
22:17 <@EastByte> when I join my map
22:17 <@deen> your map with wavpack souds?
22:18 <@deen> or with opus sounds?
22:18 <@EastByte> opus
22:18 <@deen> embedded sounds?
22:18 <@EastByte> yea
22:18 <@deen> can you send me the files?
22:18 <@EastByte> map or audio
22:18 <@deen> both
22:19 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/priv/nimrod.map
22:19 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/priv/nimrod.opus
22:20 < cris272> i should try to add audio file in editor ?
22:20 < cris272> compilation worked
22:21 <@deen> cris272: nice, yes
22:21 <@deen> but only opus files work
22:25 <@deen> EastByte: adding it to a map manually works for me
22:25 <@deen> now i'll take a look at your map
22:25 <@deen> ah, it's not embedded in the map?
22:25 <@EastByte> but I did :(
22:26 <@deen> something went wrong with the embedding?
22:26 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/B.map
22:27 < cris272> i added a sound, a sound layer with this sound and i clicked on add sound, but i can not hear the sound ingame
22:27 < cris272> did i miss something ?
22:27 <@deen> cris272: sounds like you did everything
22:27 <@EastByte> deen: yea works
22:28 <@deen> cris272: did you embed the sound?
22:28 < cris272> ah no
22:28 <@EastByte> now we can make tw maps for coding talks :)
22:28 < cris272> deen: your map work
22:28 <@deen> EastByte: ...
22:29 <@deen> for me it works with embedded and non-embedded sounds, weird
22:29 < cris272> work with embedd
22:29 <@EastByte> man I lack of mapping skills
22:31 <@deen> EastByte: your map once segfaulted me, then it worked, then "failed to decode sample ()"
22:31 <@deen> what did you do?!
22:31 <@deen> looks like it's reading into random memory^^
22:31 <@EastByte> hah the same happened for me
22:31 <@EastByte> except it didnt work
22:31 <@EastByte> well maybe
22:31 <@EastByte> I added it as external
22:31 <@EastByte> select the audio in the layer
22:31 <@EastByte> and made it embedded afterwards
22:32 <@EastByte> can this go wrong?
22:32 <@deen> hm, maybe
22:33 < cris272> my sound file was in subfolder
22:33 <@deen> EastByte: no, still works
22:34 <@EastByte> hm
22:34 < cris272> and that does not work on external mod
22:34 <@deen> cris272: you can add it in editor but it won't play?
22:34 < cris272> now i copy it in mapres folder
22:34 < cris272> deen: it won't play as external if the file is in a subfolder
22:34 < cris272> i will test again
22:35 <@deen> cris272: isn't there the same problem with images then?
22:35 <@deen> ^^
22:36 < cris272> never tested, i always embbed image in subfolder
22:37 <@deen> yeah, same with images
22:37 <@deen> so that's ok probably^^
22:37 <@deen> but about EastByte's weird map file
22:37 <@deen> need to find out what's going wrong there
22:39 < cris272> what's wrong with EastByte's map ?
22:39 <@deen> it crashed the client^^
22:39 <@deen> and it should be a normally working map
22:40 < o_be_two> needeen omg :o
22:40 < o_be_two> ok i go c ya :D
22:41 < cris272> yeah, i have : XIO:  fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server ":0"
22:41 < cris272> Erreur de segmentation (core dumped)
22:42 <@deen> ok, fixed the crash
22:42 <@deen> but the file is still broken

22:42 <@deen> EastByte: if you try it again does it create normal files now?
22:43 <@EastByte> yea I just did it
22:43 <@EastByte> works
22:43 <@deen> weird. what might have gone wrong?
22:43 <@EastByte> hmm
22:43 <@EastByte> hard to reproduce
22:44 <@deen> somehow the map sound ended up empty
22:48 <@EastByte> 84.200.43.133:8303
22:48 <@EastByte> hm map dl too slow
22:48 <@deen> reduce opus quality
22:49 <@EastByte> ah right
22:51 <@EastByte> deen: is wavpack still supported?
22:51 <@deen> no
22:51 <@EastByte> hm so the maps are invalid now^^
22:51 <@deen> exactly why i want to quickly release this
22:51 <@deen> before people make so many 10 MB wavpack maps
22:51 <@EastByte> :D
22:51 <@EastByte> now you need to teach them how to encode properly
22:52 <@deen> need to find a windows tool
22:52 <@deen> that works simply
22:52 <@deen> and just start with the lowest bitrate possible and increase until it sounds ok
22:52 <@EastByte> yep

22:57 <@deen> because i tried about 10 times now and couldn't get any error
22:57 <@deen> I found another error though, and fixed it^^
22:57 <@EastByte> it's difficult to reproduce because I'm tired and I don't really know what I just did^^
22:57 <@deen> hm, ok =/
