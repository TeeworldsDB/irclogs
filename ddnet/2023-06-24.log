01:45 <+bridge> <BillionRay> hello friends, can anyone tell me how CNetObj_PlayerInput::m_Fire works? Does setting it to zero ensure no firing?
01:45 <+bridge> <nouaa> a bit late but in the cmakelist you have something to enable discord rich presence support, make sure it's ON
01:46 <+bridge> <nouaa> a bit late but in the cmakelist you have something to enable discord rich presence support, make sure it's ON (it's off by default)
01:46 <+bridge> <scar17off> i set it to ON, original ddnet client id works but my appllication id doesn't.
01:46 <+bridge> <nouaa> ah well
01:46 <+bridge> <nouaa> :ajidk:
01:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Bossman you are basically making a bot whether you intend to use it on ddnet servers or not. No one will help you with it üòÑ
01:48 <+bridge> <BillionRay> well i already got it
01:48 <+bridge> <BillionRay> sorry to dissapoint
01:49 <+bridge> <BillionRay> well i figured it out*
01:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Eitherway, you aren't getting help with it
01:50 <+bridge> <BillionRay> oh the horror ü¶î
01:51 <+bridge> <learath2> I was so not in the mood for another bot vendor, can you like release it later so I have more time to deal with the fallout?
01:51 <+bridge> <BillionRay> i wasnt planning on releasing it, but i can if you want me to
01:52 <+bridge> <BillionRay> not a fan of random noobs benefiting off of hours of my work
01:53 <+bridge> <learath2> that's even better, keep it to yourself
01:55 <+bridge> <louis.place> just give them incorrect answers ez bot now delayed due to bugs
01:55 <+bridge> <BillionRay> for a development channel you guys are sure hesitant to talk about development
01:56 <+bridge> <BillionRay> even if its for 'botting', security through obscurity isnt a great policy
01:57 <+bridge> <BillionRay> also i dont think its the average person you guys should worry about, its only a matter of time before someone with the right knowledge comes around and makes some advanced bot that can play tw better than any human
02:00 <+bridge> <scar17off> somehow commenting this cleargameinfo was a solution to me
02:00 <+bridge> <scar17off> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1121952894829211668/image.png
02:00 <+bridge> <scar17off> lol üß† üêò
02:11 <+bridge> <learath2> Hopefully the right kind of degenerate with the correct skillset never comes along. Because bot detection is definitely a losing battle. We are lucky it's only skiddies for now
02:14 <+bridge> <BillionRay> right, so my point is a script kiddie isnt going to make anything that will be a serious threat to ddnet with some casual help from this server, on the other hand a 'degenerate' with the right skillset will accomplish it regardless. Thus this whole crappy attitude to people who ask questions about the codebase for 'bots' is pointless
02:15 <+bridge> <BillionRay> anyway your server, your rules, i respect it
02:18 <+bridge> <learath2> It‚Äôs still a lot of work even detecting simple bots, it‚Äôs better for both the mods and us the less there are of them overall
06:52 <+bridge> <totar> I feel like every kind of cheat that's useful for ddnet has already been made and released at some point in time. I can't think of any kind of cheat that would cause significantly more damage than past cheats have done.
08:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not rly? lot of dev talk here, just not about botting
08:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u just took the wrong path
08:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No. 10000% disagree. You waste my precious awesome short lifetime to develop something i will never use for good reasons.
08:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Other developers ask questions to make something actually useful for the community.
08:15 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> when ddnet in this meme of a language
08:15 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd
08:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Strongly disagree. I haven‚Äôt tried any bot client but I doubt you can just spin up some client and finish any ddnet map 1try without skill or effort. Which is something that could be done. Also if slats gores bot is as stable as it looks on YouTube and easy to use. If that were released to the public it could disrupt kog. Imagine every player giving it a try because it‚Äôs fun and finishing some insane kog map with it. How are moderators su
08:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@totar)
08:32 <+bridge> <totar> I meant ddrace specificly. I think it's inherently more resistant to bots than gores, fng, or block
08:33 <+bridge> <totar> You can't make an ai or bot that figures out how to finish even a somewhat complex ddracr map, unless it's just replaying recorded inputs from someone else
08:33 <+bridge> <totar> You can't make an ai or bot that figures out how to finish even a somewhat complex ddrace map, unless it's just replaying recorded inputs from someone else
08:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs the thing. You can. Everything is possible
08:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@totar)
08:48 <+bridge> <totar> I think it's 100x harder than the starcraft ai
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its about the amount of effort
08:49 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> imagine relying on machine learning to finish a map
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its surely a matter of time until even such bots are easy to make
08:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so just accept the fact that machines are better than humans and have fun play without bots
08:50 <+bridge> <totar> I would consider it a breakthrough in machine learning if someone could finish even 5% of ddrace maps without seeing them beforehand
08:50 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and then online multiplayer games would die out
08:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u mean first try?
08:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or any amount of tries?
08:51 <+bridge> <totar> A reasonable amount
08:51 <+bridge> <totar> <5 hours
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not sure
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u'd say 95% i'd probs say yes
08:52 <+bridge> <totar> People can't even make an ai that solves all trackmania maps and that game is orders of magnitude less complex in terms of intelligent actions
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maps like brainfuck are defs brain fuck
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
08:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, trackmania has "normal" maps and these weird maps where u do saltos etc
08:54 <+bridge> <totar> Even the weirdest trackmania maps I think are less dimensionally complex than most ddrace maps. The fact you need to aim is a huge increase in complexity
08:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i dunno.. its mostly about patterns
08:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say at least ddmax maps have similar patterns
08:55 <+bridge> <totar> It's not like the map tells you which direction your even supposed to go btw
08:55 <+bridge> <totar> Just path finding the correct path seems a monumental challenge
08:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and still humans do it somehow
08:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would u have thought there will be AIs better at human language than any other humans existing?
08:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would u have thought there will be AIs better at human language than any human existing?
08:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> many maps are straight forwards. but there are definetely extremly hard maps even for a humans
08:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> many maps are straight forwards. but there are definetely extremly hard maps even for a human
08:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. escape, brainfuck, where u need to go back in the map with new weapons etc.
09:05 <+ChillerDragon> But it is not unthinkable that AI could solve those tricky maps better and faster than humans
09:06 <+ChillerDragon> but i think it doesnt even need AI to create a disrupting bot
09:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> AI cant think yet
09:06 <+bridge> <totar> I think people are over estimating the current state of abstract reasoning in ai
09:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the tricky maps are basically unsolveable yet
09:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but still, many maps follow a certain pattern
09:07 <+bridge> <totar> There's a lot of tests which are simple for untrained humans that ai cants even get over 20%
09:07 <+bridge> <totar> https://github.com/fchollet/ARC
09:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u vote a random moderate map, it will probably feel to you as u done it before
09:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i guess for such maps AI will be good enough
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder if there every will be a AI to generate maps
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> so mappers become prompt engineers xd
09:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well simply answer question: do you think AI will at some point be as intelligent as a human?
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> does it have to be for mapping?
09:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for _any_ map a human wants
09:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> but yea im not super sure about it
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> i have like 0 understanding of how AI works so its hard to tell for me
09:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> input, output
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> cant tell if we are close or not
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> if its doable or not
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> but im confident that it wont stay at human intelligence level for very long
09:11 <+ChillerDragon> and reach for humans uncomprehensible intellect quickly after reaching the human level 
09:11 <+bridge> <totar> In my opinion it's possible but only if you generate small segments
09:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we have a AI that can reason.. even if its on a level of a 12 years old child
09:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the game is over
09:12 <+bridge> <totar> My point is only that ddrace maps are sufficiently hard enough to ward off ai until it's at human level in many aspects
09:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs then u can have 7 billion 12 years old childs reasoning together
09:13 <+bridge> <totar> You could easily say chatgpt is as intelligent as 99% of 12 year olds
09:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh
09:13 <+bridge> <totar> I really think it is
09:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i understand what u mean
09:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but chatgpt has no will
09:13 <+bridge> <totar> But that doesn't mean it can do thinks a 20 year old can
09:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a 12 years old child that is about to die, has to get creative maybe
09:13 <+bridge> <totar> But that doesn't mean it can do things a 20 year old can
09:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chatgpt basically knows nothing about our real world physics
09:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it cant do math
09:14 <+bridge> <totar> It's limited because it can't effectively learn, remember, or work with out ais so it just acts as 1 person
09:15 <+bridge> <totar> It's limited because it can't effectively learn, remember, or work with other ais so it just acts as 1 person
09:16 <+bridge> <totar> I don't think infinite 20 billion 12 year olds assuming they can never learn or remember new information could make a super ai
09:16 <+bridge> <totar> I don't think 20 billion 12 year olds assuming they can never learn or remember new information could make a super ai
09:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the ai talking with someone isnt learning either, its just processing the sentence and answering that, its not modifiying itself iirc
09:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
09:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not a real interaction
09:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> static hardware is also inefficient in such things
09:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> our brain is a master piece in that regard
09:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye
09:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> analog too
09:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah thats indeed another issue with computers
09:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> analog may be better for ai
09:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4bits are simply shitty
09:19 <+bridge> <totar> I think a computer 50x as powerful as a 4090 is enough to make human level ai. I think we just don't know how yet
09:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> a human brain is like 12 watts
09:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> so in terms of thermodynamics thats all it would take right
09:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> so in terms of thermodynamics thats all it would take right?
09:20 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to me gpt-4 was the most advanced human language generator even including humans
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i read articles, book passages etc it never sounds as well expressed as gpt-4
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it simply knows the perfect word in every setence
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it let it summerize some stuff, quite a few times and was quite impressed how well it compressed the information without loosing the core points üòÑ
09:21 <+bridge> <BillionRay> you got access to it from europe? how?
09:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> credit card
09:22 <+bridge> <totar> If you compare estimated floating point operation cost of simulating a neuron I think 50x 4090 is close enough
09:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but talk about it about rust or vulkan.. u directly see it knows nothing üòÇ

10:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> huh
10:09 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Trying to understand line 61.. is the zero being passed to the lambda or whats the deal with it?
10:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> zero is bullshit
10:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's why clangd crashes
10:10 <+bridge> <BillionRay> The std::forward doesnt belong there right?
10:12 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Interesting little snippet, takes your mind on a journey
10:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
10:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't belong there

11:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why did they change it üò≠
11:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> upgrade was worth it. the new spectacle (basically better version of snipping tool on windows)
11:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is really cool üòÑ
11:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 when dark mode for dropdowns

12:04 <+bridge> <botondus> (@BillionRay)
12:06 <+bridge> <botondus> ik a ser
12:10 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6721#issuecomment-1584122282 like option D?
12:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks better than grey imo üòÑ
12:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> our UI is simply weird
12:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess if we want to have "transparency" we'd need to go with blur
12:11 <+bridge> <robyt3> yeah
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how to judge a place is freeze or not
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987> int CCollision::IsFreeze(int x, int y) const
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987> {
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987>     int index = GetTile(x, y);
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987>     return index == TILE_FREEZE;
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987> }
13:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wdym
13:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> use entities?
13:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i use this to judge
13:32 <+bridge> <vinson7987> but it dont work
13:33 <+bridge> <robyt3> What x and y positions are you using, for example?
13:33 <+bridge> <vinson7987> this is test in game
13:33 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122127337463488522/image.png

13:34 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i tried /32 and the origin
13:34 <+bridge> <vinson7987> both didnot work
13:35 <+bridge> <vinson7987> so which should i use
13:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> don't divide by 32 before calling `IsFreeze`
13:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> it's already done inside of `GetTile` which is called in `IsFreeze`
13:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh there goes the need for my dropdown edits too, epic üòÉ
13:38 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122128522463432744/image.png
13:38 <+bridge> <vinson7987> still
13:38 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122128591489073172/image.png
13:39 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i am confuze with this
13:41 <+bridge> <robyt3> first try it on a simple map
13:41 <+bridge> <robyt3> you are not handling freeze tiles in front and switch layers
13:41 <+bridge> <robyt3> so I assume the freeze tile in this map is not in the game layer
13:43 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122129757224587324/image.png
13:43 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122129831019167765/image.png
13:43 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122129980399292416/image.png
13:43 <+bridge> <vinson7987> so
13:44 <+bridge> <vinson7987> not the map issue
13:44 <+bridge> <robyt3> Maybe those maps also have the freeze not in the game layer...
13:44 <+bridge> <robyt3> What are you trying to do?
13:45 <+bridge> <vinson7987> judge a block is freeze or not
13:45 <+bridge> <robyt3> Any block? Or just where you currently are?
13:46 <+bridge> <vinson7987> anywhere i think
13:46 <+bridge> <vinson7987> so i write a function
13:46 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122130684031533056/image.png
13:46 <+bridge> <robyt3> Search for `TILE_FREEZE` in the code
13:46 <+bridge> <robyt3> You also need to consider tiles in the front layer and tiles in the switch layer
13:47 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122130835575930940/image.png
13:47 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how can the first one work
13:47 <+bridge> <robyt3> For the switch layer you also need to know which team the player is on
13:48 <+bridge> <robyt3> I guess we only use solid and nohook in the game layer
13:50 <+bridge> <vinson7987> the index return 0 every time
13:52 <+bridge> <vinson7987> yes
13:52 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122132214633726064/image.png
13:52 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how can i judge if the block is freeze
13:55 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> whats this for
13:56 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122133168133251174/image.png
13:59 <+bridge> <robyt3> As I've said, you need to consider front and switch layers as well
14:00 <+bridge> <vinson7987> fuck
14:00 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122134176179691541/image.png
14:00 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i found it
14:00 <+bridge> <vinson7987> it only return 1-4
14:01 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wtf why LOL
14:01 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i dont know
14:01 <+bridge> <robyt3> oh wow
14:01 <+bridge> <vinson7987> good
14:01 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122134484003868743/image.png
14:01 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i am a dumb
14:02 <+bridge> <robyt3> my original point still stands though, if you want to detect all freeze tiles
15:05 <+bridge> <myrkotov> :think_bot:
16:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> @vinson7987 what u makin?
16:51 <+bridge> <BillionRay> @vinson7987 looking through your other messages seems you are a bit of a botter, we should work together perhaps ü¶î
16:51 <+bridge> <BillionRay> on purely educational endeavors ofcourse
17:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @BillionRay mention bots one more time and you're muted
17:06 <+bridge> <BillionRay> For how long?
17:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> do not try to circumvent the rules
17:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't want to play games
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://novehiclesinthepark.com/
17:24 <+bridge> <chairn> damn, i thought it was like r/fuckcars
17:24 <+bridge> <botondus> are these bots in the room with us?
17:24 <+bridge> <botondus> (@heinrich5991)
17:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm talking about cheats in ddnet
17:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> pleases stop talking about those
17:29 < ChillerDragon> :robot:
17:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
17:34 <+bridge> <chairn> @chillerdragon still on narcissistic i see
18:16 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i am not going to be hired for moderator anytime soon
18:16 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122198537107677354/image0.jpg
18:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the "you agreed with the majority" seems bogus
21:16 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> does ddnet allow a mapres to be used in both a quad and tiles layer
21:16 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> seems saving is prevented
21:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should allow it
21:19 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> it s impossible
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i rephrase:
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the client allows it
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
21:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the editor is buggy dunno
21:20 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> when the map is loaded it removes one of the layers
21:20 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> it is omitted from  the binary map file
21:22 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> are you using current version
21:22 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> latest stable
21:31 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> ok empty quad layers are removed when u save
21:31 <+bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> theres no bug
21:35 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> lol
