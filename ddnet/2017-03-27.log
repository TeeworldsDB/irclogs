22:58 < Ryozuki> A user reported me a new troll behaviour, they are 2, and they have "program" to join a team instantly, what they do is invite someone to join a team, and when the user joins he gets instantly voted, and kicked in about 0.1 secs
22:58 < Ryozuki> they also can follow a player, for example, one random joins a team, then those 2 join instantly (with a program) and they vote kick him, instantly
22:58 < Ryozuki> and you don't have time to lock (from random user persepective, cause it's like 0.1 secs)
23:00 < Henningstone> There are so many kids out there who don't know what to do with their time :|
23:00 < Ryozuki> yes :/
23:01 < WolfAlex> Ryozuki: its even better if you know the name of the player you want to kick: join another server with the map, join with 3 clients, one named after the player you want to kick, reach startlinie with one player, save game, join server, wait till the one is not in a running game, load save, kick 
23:10 <@EastByte> I guess there shouldn't be full votekicking within teams and the load command is way too agressive
23:11 <@EastByte> a votekick in team could simply trigger a kick out of the team (an easy fix)
23:13 <@EastByte> and /load might work via invitation
23:22 <@deen> yeah, /load should show a decision thing and you can press f3/f4
