05:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> can someone tell me if there is a way in the debug mode to just show me the real position of my tee without any other information in the mode?

05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> using the debug mode for 100ping+ fng servers
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <johnquiiksheeez> is there any c++ dev who can help me? 😄
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_showhud_player_position 1
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Why not just say your problem
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Then the dev can decide if he wants to help you
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D

08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think you meant: `"I have a question about python but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it"`
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think you meant: `"I have a question about c++ but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it"`

08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <johnquiiksheeez> i just gave up with that shit, i dont need anything anymore xD sry
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> rip
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways yea dont be afraid to just ask the question here. ppl would be more invested to help if they know what they were getting into ^^
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🥹
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <johnquiiksheeez> i just wanted to know can i use firstore with c++. i couldnt do anything about it in 4 days :\
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait you were not trolling?
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I thought your question was a joke because it was formulated exactly like the don’t ask to ask example
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just the website predicts people to well
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Pro Website
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thing is i still ask to ask around my personal friends LOL
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont mean to, but i guess i just learned to be more formal in places like here
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> IRL or in chat?
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Imo ask to ask is especially pointless when you have desync and delay due to chat
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the one that applies the most in private messages is this one
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.nohello.com/
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If you ask someone irl if he is busy it makes more sense imo
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Why does no hello uses cookies
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://nohello.net/en/
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And span across my whole screen
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://no-hello.com/
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> That looks better
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh thisone is the good
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Omg Yes hello in DMs
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon hi
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It’s not dm
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So it’s Fine
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xyproblem.info/
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @fokkonaut\: loves to dm hello me -.-
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this too
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hmm XY yeas sometimes
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But then also sometimes I get asked things and get toooo much side info
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> @noby bro my ip address is the same for 1 month and that kid is changing the ip address I think I see her in the game my ip address is the same for 1 month and I'm playing kog you can check it out
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lmao im looking through the killfeed code and i just saw this
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this was way back in oy / matricks time
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1034360866432352317/unknown.png
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lmao im looking through the killfeed code and i just saw this
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the double x -= thing was added way back in oy / matricks time
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1034360866432352317/unknown.png
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways i made a very bugged but honest visual concept of how i want scrunched team kills to look like.
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> No idea how to work it, but it's the simplest change I can make so far. 
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Basically how I want to do this is make it so that if a team starts and is locked, it doesn't fill the entire board up with the killed members, but rather compresses it down to one message.
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> It would show a maximum of 5 tees and would display `Team [x]` as the name.

09:24 <+ChillerDragon> Is there another more common term for | than pipe? I mean just the character name
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Pipe
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tbh i dont even refer it as a name, i just call it *that symbol*
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its a pipe
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :ugpipe_right::pipe::pipe::ugpipe_left:

09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> factorio > satisfactory
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> By a lot
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lets open a srv & ask everyone to play it
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i should play factorio again
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They will troll
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is factorio pvp
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> u give them the game for free
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if there was a server id want to take care of factory building despite being noob at it
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nobo
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> This character has only the name pipe!?
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this game = download the .exe installer and share it to people who doesn't want to pay it
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ez
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just updates rip
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> The vertical bar ( | ) -- also called the vertical line, vertical slash, pipe, pipe symbol or upright slash
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> upright slash lmao
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> ok thats worse
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> wikipedia does not call it pipe o.O
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> pipe is shorter ironically
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways i think i should force myself to bed before i open factorio at 3:30 am
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tommorow i try to bash my head against the wall and tweak the killfeed thing for real
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tommorow i bash my head against the wall and try to tweak the killfeed thing for real
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ok american go sleep
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The commies are coming hide
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Europeans waking up
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OS professor used to call it either bar or pipe depending on his mood. But he was italian, not the best person to learn english words from 😄
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think it was named pipe because of it's usage
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sending a process's stdout to another process's stdin for eg
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea 1st time ever mentioned was in the unix presentation video

10:06 <+ChillerDragon> huffman moment xd
10:07 <+ChillerDragon> @ReiTW but the character was around before piping was around so it has to have another name
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> The pound sign is also not a hashtag just because social media used it for that
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> oh boi i developed way too big of an ``git push -f`` habbit i just did a force push instead of a pull without even thinking a split second shiet
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [src\main.rs:183] &text.len() = 34
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [src\main.rs:184] &compressed.len() = 18
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was doing huffman on rust too
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> you also did it in python right?
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> so there is a teeworlds client in python, js and ruby now :) 
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> sadly i just force push deleted my ruby version hehe
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> how ready was your python one?
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/edg-l/teelib
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> hm no no huffman? maybe i confused it with the packint
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd shellcheck alerts me about issues in googletest macos-presubmit.sh -.-

13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/rustyman
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I didnt copy the tw impl
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: git reflog might still have your old version somewhere? Or on github if you have the hash
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> @deen yea im currently on ma laptop and was about to pull the stuff i deved on ma desktop at home when i did the force push. I don't have the commti hashes with me sadly. So I gotta wait until im home :(
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> but this just showed me that i developed a unhealthy relation ship to the -f flag
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> i do have more respect when i do rm -rf than when i do git push -f
14:01 <+ChillerDragon> @deen the test comments should i keep them short? to fit in a 60 char wide terminal?
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> ok i just did something and force pushed again :D maybe i just need some tool that warns me when force pushing the main branch

16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> @noby 185.189.128.245 me ip adres
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah thats the ip of the person who keeps getting banned lol
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably shouldnt post it here publicly though
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> look at that ip address, when was it banned?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that ip range has been getting banned multiple times for months now
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most recently 4 days ago
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> bro i say yes i used cheat but i quit 3 weeks ago now enter in my name there is a person you can look at the ip address
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and very similar ips have been showing up in the banlist since january
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> "3 weeks ago"
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u were using it 4 days ago
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and also yesterday, but with a different ip
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u told skeith that u quit and begged for many second chances but never stopped using for more than a day
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> With this IP address registration, we will check again after 1 2 weeks to see if it has changed or not.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so ur telling me
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ur the soh that cheats with that ip
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but not the soh that cheats with a different mobile data ip when that one is banned
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u expect me to believe it
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> I'm a person who plays kog all the time and my friends say multeasymap there is fake
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why is ur ip getting banned on ddnet then
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the one u posted here is currently banned
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> believe it, i don't care
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just stop bypassing ur ban
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> stop cheating
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and stop lying
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> yes i don't have ip my ip address has been banned for a long time and i spoke learth
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > i dont have ip
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ???
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> I'm already using cheats
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i know
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> It's nice that you blame me for the fake
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its not fake

16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have proof its u.
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but even if i didnt, its fairly obvious
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> you believe what you know but i am using cheats, you just need to know that?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why not just stop
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> what ?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> stop cheating

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > arbitrary code execution is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but unconfirmed when stack canaries are present
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn googke
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stack Canaries are a secret value placed on the stack which changes every time the program is started. Prior to a function return, the stack canary is checked and if it appears to be modified, the program exits immeadiately.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im too lazy to google

18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is enough to make any web look good

18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try applying it to this website
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its amazing
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> did someone say css 👀
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly prefer specific fonts for websites rather than letting web browsers fill in. Maaaybe just for code sections it might be okay to leave it monospace. But usually you are going for a specific look rather than any sans-serif font e.g.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not for the web style chiller goes for
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Courier new looks rly rly ugly
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen do you only use gdb from the cli or do you use a cli gui?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh gdb itself has a tui mode
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gdb with ctrl-x ctrl-a to enable tui
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw I rarely need to drop into the tui. I split my screen with one half having gdb one half my code
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But when you do need it it is quite enough, don't ever really feel the need to fix the vscode gdb integration 😄
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> same
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> The 5 secs I spend in gdb tui i found super confusing. Imo prompts are less scary/confusing uis. In most cases cli/prompts > tui imo. Well except vim, weechat and k9s
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just want gdb tui to show me what line I'm at while I'm stepping through some code I'm trying to understand
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> Eventho I have to admit I had to get used to those tuis too before I started to like them. With commands the learning curve is not as steep. You goto stack overflow and find the one long as ffmpeg command that does what 100 button clicks and udemy courses try to explain for adobe premiere.
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> wait doesnt ``s`` or whatever the command was called show the line num? Ah but not the code arround. Yea that makes sense. I just always use print driven development instead of stepping :D
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The problem is when you run on a huge code base that you didn't write and don't understand, then you don't even know where to add prints. Then stepping through with GDB TUI is much more efficient
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> Yea I see
20:25 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should give that a try some day i find my self addig 100000000 print statements again :D 
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another place where tui is useful is stepping through assembly when reverse engineering stuff
20:25 <+ChillerDragon> ok hackerman
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GEF also helps with that alot
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> I use ``cmatrix`` when reverse engineering
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> whats GEF?
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> ghidra something something?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gdb plugin, shows some disassembly context +  registers and more on breakpoints
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> a shiet
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks like this
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1034533747422396596/unknown.png
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> ah yea think seen those on yt 
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a bit of a tui if you will
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> nana
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> its still a prompt
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> yea those gdb plugins a crazy i installed them and was super hyped when i found out about them
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> then i realized i can't even reverse engineer and rage quitted xd
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> did you checkout my network docs -.- @Learath2 or is the only feedback i get ryos rant about monospace xd
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does get in the way when you are debugging things you have the code for, like I honestly rarely care about registers when normally debugging
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't check yet, I just got home 😛
20:30 <+ChillerDragon> ok nice
20:32 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1666722670.png
20:32 <+ChillerDragon> omg tabs vs spaces
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder if vscode has something like ``:set list``
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://imhex.werwolv.net/
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tf rly cool
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what format they use for parsing the fileformats
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> imgui best
