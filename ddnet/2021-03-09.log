08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Was hoping those commits would be squashed üòÖ I've figured out the CLang-Format integration so that shouldn't be a thing going forward.
09:21 <@deen> Yeah, I could have squashed it
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> maybe do something about this üòÑ

15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Zodiac congratulations on your first controversial pull request
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @Learath2 haha thanks üòÑ I did try it on GER servers and the duplication was noticeable.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Good point, there might be improvements that could be made for repeats. I'll look into it.
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> üòä ‚úåÔ∏è
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> üëç
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I suggest you give it a couple more days. People usually get used to things in that timeframe
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac maybe we can even combine it in one list? Show the top 3 global players, followed by the next 2 best ranks from current server (but might be too confusing)
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Then it would usually look as before on GER, but would still show the best players on other locations
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I'll sit on it for a bit but there might be tweaks that could be made. @deen suggestion might solve for both. By using the global list but giving space to highlight where the top locals are in the global list
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about top5 global followed by top3 local unless the local times are duplicate
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, something like that. Just can't take too much space. The above is about the limit
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Zodiac you could look into a ui change too. We've been looking into decreasing the use of server messages for a while now. Maybe a good idea to move this into it's own ui maybe next to the scoreboard or as a second tab to the scoreboard?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or a replacement for the very meh hud element we have on the bottom right?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> even at 16:10 I don't think we have space next to scoreboard
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> especially now that @Jupstar ‚ú™ might it wider
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> A small widget - especially if it is temporary - would work. Just don't ask me to do it  üòÑ I am terrible with UI dev.

15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Something like a second page on the scoreboard maybe?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Only saw the lengthy debate on general now. Does seem like some changes are needed.
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Okay, in the interest of time. I thought the quickest fix would be to only show the local section if none of the top times are relevant to the region.

18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> what mean ZAF?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> south africa
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 7
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i think  (global) it's   enough alone
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i play in all servers why should be care about top in south africa or anyplace
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> The recent change in the feature will mean nothing will change for you then. It is for those communities you don't care about and for them to see their peers time.
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> These servers being:
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - KOR
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - CHL
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - USA
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - ARG
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - CAN
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - POL
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - SGP
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - TUR
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - ZAF
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> - IRN
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> Not chl
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> feature is so good but need new command
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> There is a potential update incoming - will see how that is received.
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> Just add new command and it will be fine
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> Noone will complain about it with new command
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, it is possible a new command will solve it. However, vast majority of the complaints are people who play on the GER servers and/or compete on a global level. The potential update will mean that for those communities it will only show the global ranks i.e. act in the same way as it currently does.
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> top5 shows only top3?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> @Zodiac
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @<B¬µmM> I am aware of the complaint. I have addressed it in detail here:
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/818862021583962172
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> There is a change pending that will mean that the local ranks aren't shown when there are duplicates i.e. GER servers will never see the local ranks
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> There is a change pending that will mean that the local ranks aren't shown when there are duplicates i.e. GER servers will likely never see the local ranks
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Noone will complain about a new command because no one will use it...
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have so many unused features because of this
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but they would use it if it was a good command
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not if they never even hear about it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> others would tell them its a good command
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We need to have good defaults and not rely on word of mouth to get everyone to learn about a feature
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This mindset of assuming everyone has to become a poweruser is why new players look at the game play a bit and just disappear
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but is it a good default if most dont like it
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do most not like it or do the people that don't like it shout way too loud?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why I like to give these kinds of changes a couple days to see how the wide community receives it and not just the 4 people on discord that are already against any change anyway
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u go to multeasymap servers asking if ppl like x feature?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is where the most active members are
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its normal to respect their opinions
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most don't really have opinions past "don't change" anyway. So it's better to be conservative
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If they care to make actual arguments once in a blue moon ofc it's worth listening to
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you could do a vote in announcement like deen did a couple times
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could, but why bother, we all know this change needs a bit of fixing and it'll get it. After we like how it ends up then we can get a vote on it if people still claim it's the worst thing ever
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why not make the changes before puting it on the srv
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats why people dont like changes at all then
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @Ryozuki ofc it is important to take in opinions from discord, but it is worth knowing that this discord represents power users. Not to discount their voice but to still try cater for the avg player
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Point is one of the imo most important ideas behind this change was to get more interaction in local communities. If we put it behind a new command people will just never hear about it
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> than give us a new command for old /top5
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even think they care about top ranks they wont achieve anytime soon
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was a little busy the last month or so. I intended to give feedback on this but forgot about it
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> The worst can - as in this case - is that the feature has been iterated on. The top ranks and larger communities will get to keep it the same, while the smaller get to benefit
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the maintainance nightmare we are trying to avoid. We can't add a legacy mode for every single change we make because some people liked it the other way around
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have hundreds of options, dozens of commands. Combinations break all the time
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> dont u think its bad to ignore the people who play the game the most
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> these people make the actual top ranks
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> but its annoying too see only the top3..
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ignoring is bad. So is only valuing their experience
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @jao we aren't ignoring you. After the complaints, I literally updated the feature within 2 hours and pushed an update to it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There needs to be a balance
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This will be better for GER as soon as the new update rolls out
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'll think of something for the other regions. Maybe a ui change that people will hate on aswell. So exciting
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Zodiac isn't it extremely fun working on the ddnet code? You code for about an hour and have long debates about minor issues for 5. Rinse and repeat until you end up only ever doing bugfixes
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'll have to probably get this into a command of it's own as your latest change is only enough to fix this in GER. CHL also has some fundamentalists that won't be happy about this
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> It will fix it for the other servers should they have a good enough time. You are right though there may still be some complaints but I can't see much justification to it without the duplication issue.
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, I don't mind constructive criticism but it isn't great how extremely vocal and  angry people get over a relatively minor issue.
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And this was like extremely minor, try doing some ui changes next. Guaranteed way to become depressed
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> haha I'll give that a miss. Will try for an easy win with /swap.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> it is very cool but spectators take up too much space imo
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in what matter, too much space?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not filling the whole space yet
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> well if there is like 7 spectators
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it scales them down if there is no space
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> i see
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> u can just add auto-message about it
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> or add /cmdlist
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i mean nobody care XD i think (global) enough for all
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Yeah why not
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was about where are you from maybe
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but it's about the server
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> example i now in GER server
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> they not until half german
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/818956613670797372/unknown.png
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so yeah nobody care becasue nobody german üòõ
