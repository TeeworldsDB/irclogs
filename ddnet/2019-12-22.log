12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Are all map changes/fixes/releases logged in here? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/commits/master
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Is there any way to find out if a map has been fixed?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao do you happen to know a problem with the demos?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ScReeNy i would hope so. @jao why not?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 boci had a problem
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, couldn't figure it ou
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen if you fix a map multiple times per day, only the last fix will be logged there
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> true
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> anyway thats fine for me then, thanks
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really hope there is nothing wrong with the demo thing
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he said all the demos he recorded with the new version were broken
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> did you test it?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It works completely fine for me
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the new demos won't work on old clients though
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's normal
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Maybe something more went wrong at boci, his update failed a bit. Did he do clean download?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hopefully it's his computer being weird
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Is it a wanted mechanism that if there are too many tees around the spawnpoint, that for the next tee the game acts like there is no spawn on the map?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> you can fully occupy a server like that tho
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> is it true that it was possible to reset time on solo maps by hitting finish again? If so, around what time did it get fixed
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> nvm found
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> nvm found in version 10.1.1 around 2016-05-22
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's the mappers responsibility to make sure their map isn't blockable that way and the person releasing is responsible to not release such a map
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know if there is a nice way to fix that tbh
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Hey out there. In switch layer the description says, i can deactivate <no hit> for single weapons. sadly i cant deactivate <no hit pistole>. is it possible to add it ?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/658319422993334280/screenshot_2019-12-22_15-42-13.png
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> it starts counting at 0
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> ya, i tested every number, or did i make mistake ?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> gun has no hit effect anyways
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> on teleport gun it is important to me, or u can spam tele to playert
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> on teleport gun it is important to me, or u can spam tele to player
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh true
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> good point
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that is one thing we didn't think about ðŸ˜›
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure the telegun code doesn't bother checking the nohit flag
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> my map works with teleport grenade and no hit grenade now, but it sucks to be honest
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> with pistole its way smoother
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> had to make alot of grenade tuning to work around it
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe do no collisions?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there was something else wrong with nohit switch
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but i dont remember what
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> the idea of my map was, to shot back and end at the beginning of a part. its activated all the time. with no collisions i ruin everythin xd
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> the idea of my map was, to shot back and teleport at the beginning of a part. its activated all the time. with no collisions i ruin everythin xd
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> if you want to deactivate gun, maybe try it with tune zone gun_lifetime 0
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> but in that case, i cant use it to teleport, cuz gun wont reach anything
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but if its no hit wont it still not tp? i dont understand lol
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Making telegun nohit should be pretty easy, small change in projectile.cpp:L178
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i can make a short demo of my problem, if it helps to understand
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh learath can just fix it lol
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> would be a nice thing
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @jao was the other problem that nohit weapons still show up as hammer in entities?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think its that serious
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> why mobile client is banned from ddnet ?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bxlxr> official ddnet mobile client LOL
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> shares the version with a bot client
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i am so confused. seems like there is a way to do no tele to player with activated tele gun. does someone know how ?
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> seems like the solution is hidden somewhere in bomb raid 2 xd
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @bxlxr use pre-last version instead
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> no hit gun and no hit grenade is the same tile, but server message says only you cant hit others with grenade
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @bxlxr https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.2.apk
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think someone compiled a new one with a different version number
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 how about if someone would do so with new version number and updated entites? xd
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> guuuys, i have weird problem since last few days... when I connect dummy, when I hit, dummy also hits, and the dummy aims in me. When I enable the dummy_copy_moves, then it also keeps aiming in me, even if I want to shot up
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> fixed the demo issue? @Learath2 ?
