06:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning
06:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Morning
07:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don't miss having 5 different electron instances and thus demo apps
08:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Bcs I bought a new overpriced SSD bcs amazon, nice company as they are, gave 20%, and my old SSD was always full, which annoyed me.
08:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> And teero, clever as he is, posted casheyos link 1 day before i got that, so was perfect timing xdd
08:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but yeah, already annoyed by how many packages are not in pacman
08:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> self compiling when amd has a marketshare of like 60% on desktop is just useless

08:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice idea
08:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u dont use gentoo iguess its good

09:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> have some cats
09:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw if u raise ur pc by like 5 or 10 cm idk u reduce the dust by a shitload
09:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> how so
09:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> wont dust then also come from ground too.. additionally xD
09:37 < bridge_> <Cellegen> Pog
09:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> i try not to put it on the floor
10:13 < bridge_> <Assa> good morning ^^
10:14 < bridge_> <Assa> No, I promise to fix any bug I am causing as long as I know hoe to fix it
10:15 < bridge_> <Assa> No, I promise to fix any bug I am causing as long as I know how to fix it
10:21 < bridge_> <Assa> I am convinced that map rendering is not the slowest part in rendering anymore, text and skin rendering is kinda slow
10:22 < bridge_> <Assa> at least on extreme cases, like linear (easy map rendering, lots of players and chat spam)
10:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> We'd need to batch more. Not impossible with modern api. But would create a lot of extra cases for ogl1.x
10:45 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> That graphic bug got fixed in ddnet client. This is the DDNet discord. You can report that on the Teeworlds discord
10:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> gm  king
10:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> fps Jesus
10:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oh thatâ€™s onbgy
10:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It showed just discord user to me xd
11:02 < bridge_> <melon> :topkekMate:
11:02 < bridge_> <melon> would you recommend CachyOS currently?
11:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> For arch users 100%
11:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It's arch with a nice installer and faster packages
11:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> I only used it around 2h tho. Will try later. But i mean what should one see.. The packages are the normal pkgs xd
11:40 < bridge_> <melon> i guess you could run some of t***'s benchmarks and see if the optimization has immediate impact on cpu performance, tho exact benchmarking won't work ever because your main system is bloated xd
12:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but honestly my system probably mostly feels faster bcs my new ssd has basically 2x performance.. latency, io read write, random read write, 4k read writes
12:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ofc that is faster if harddrive is less of a bottleneck lmao
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i did that btw
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> you can read the chat
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but he has 0 kernele calls, and almost no dependencies
12:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> so it's not really faster on other distros
12:12 < bridge_> <melon> fair
13:03 < bridge_> <pluskz> Hi, uhhh weird question, would unlocking zoom on old NOT DDNet supporting game modes be considered a banable cheat? It will not work if game info flags are received without ALLOW_ZOOM flag
13:03 < bridge_> <pluskz> 
13:03 < bridge_> <pluskz> Asking to not get banned or something if I add this to my client xd
13:04 < bridge_> <pluskz> (I want this since i play on a big screen and playing zoomed in feels weird)
13:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for PvP zooz is cheat
13:10 < bridge_> <pluskz> What about other non-pvp gamemodes
13:12 < bridge_> <remakepower> That will make this feature meaningless.
13:13 < bridge_> <pluskz> Not in mods like monster xd
13:14 < bridge_> <remakepower> ðŸ¤”
13:15 < bridge_> <pluskz> Also now im looking at allthehaxx (a very used client) and seems they restrict zoom only on Vanilla and FNG https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/blob/a11a30f9e7d342674d2fec9554e97838005bd4db/src/game/client/components/camera.cpp#L306
13:16 < bridge_> <remakepower> But you can't recevied the snapshot obj out of your view in the server side.
13:18 < bridge_> <remakepower> As for some modes, they even use special maps to prevent this happening.
13:20 < bridge_> <pluskz> Then there should not be a problem on having zoom on these, would be like playing with a different kind of dynamic camera since you can't see away from a certain distance
13:21 < bridge_> <remakepower> I don't think so.
13:23 < bridge_> <pluskz> Since allthehaxx is a allowed client maybe would be good to restrict zoom for the same game modes that allthehaxx restrict
13:23 < bridge_> <pluskz> I just need to make sure if Isvanilla() really means just vanilla xd
13:23 < bridge_> <melon> allowing zoom should be up to the server, not the client
13:24 < bridge_> <remakepower> I think we only allow the safe version.
13:25 < bridge_> <pluskz> It is that way, it won't be allowed if game info flags does not allow zoom
13:25 < bridge_> <pluskz> Like ddnet-insta
13:25 < bridge_> <remakepower> :thonk:
13:26 < bridge_> <pluskz> So yeah maybe this feature would be even more limited in my client than allthehaxx xD
13:28 < bridge_> <remakepower> Oops, your words reminded me that I haven't worked on my client for two weeks.
13:29 < bridge_> <pluskz> xD
13:30 < bridge_> <remakepower> :frozen:
14:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://openzl.org/
14:43 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What is with Facebook and compression algorithms? I'm not complaining...
14:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xD
14:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they got so much user data they gotta invent novel compression
14:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1426191447681667123/image.png?ex=68ea53ca&is=68e9024a&hm=b494ac407080d18a993d217c9ebff46b674c6f1afc81bcd8ef3f68a575d622ce&
14:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> looks insane tho
15:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @pluskz: well ideally every server is ddnet based. But I know in reality that is not the case. For non ddnet servers I would not allow all modes other than vanilla. But maintain an explicit whitelist of gametypes where zooming is okay.
15:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Deciding which gametypes should allow zooming is also not straightforward because there might be different opinions. Should probably discuss with the server hosters.
15:40 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I am not sure if for example city/mmo servers like you to zoom. I doubt anyone has hard feelings about monster tho.
15:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But non vanilla would include zcatch, fng, gctf and so on where zooming is considered a cheat by the majority of the playerbase
15:56 < bridge_> <pluskz> well, most serious servers today use ddnet-insta for game modes like zcatch, fng, gctf, ictf and others so the feature would be restricted on the serious servers but not in chill casual servers
16:13 < bridge_> <remakepower> Actually, we CHN PVP community still use ddnet-pvp rather than ddnet-insta more often as ddnef-pvp has a room system.
16:14 < bridge_> <pluskz> ddnet-pvp is ddnet based so the feature shouldn't work there
16:14 < bridge_> <remakepower> Actually, we CHN PVP community still use ddnet-pvp rather than ddnet-insta more often as ddnet-pvp has a room system.

16:15 < bridge_> <remakepower> You means zoom? Yeah, that's correct
16:17 < bridge_> <remakepower> Although TsFreddie has deprecated it, there is still active development fork at present with new DDNet features.

23:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> any frontend devs in chat
23:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> do u have an opinion on semantic HTML
23:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> i'd imagine naming elements with nonstandard names and referring to them as such within the CSS is faster, and i've heard it's good practice, but not necessarily future proof
23:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> should i prefer to label ad-hoc shit with a class or use element type
23:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> in the past i've just done class
23:25 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't really do frontend dev either, but it definitely seems clearer to me than creating a bunch of `div`s. Browser compatibility may have been a concern especially in the past though.
23:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
23:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think a part of the concern is if they add new elements to the specification, but that should never be an issue if you use explicit enough names
23:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think i'll just go the semantic route
23:53 < bridge_> <peter0x44> I cannot even imagine manually typing html into a file anymore
23:53 < bridge_> <peter0x44> pure vibe code for me
23:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> as a human with little else to do i enjoy a little manual coding
23:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> even if it is tedious
23:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> i enjoy my ability to think so i do not use the ai
23:54 < bridge_> <peter0x44> I never enjoyed it at all so I'm glad to leave it behind
