00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or does it include some kind of "time until next tick" info
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh new day already
00:00 < bridge> <totar> the client does not include that info only the server
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but does it send in a fixed rate?
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how else can the server guess if the timing was off
00:00 < bridge> <totar> the client sends the "intendedtick" along with the input
00:01 < bridge> <totar> so the server looks at its own gametick and references the input's intended tick
00:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sure but how does the server know the client was 2ms too late
00:01 < bridge> <totar> the server knows it's sub tick timing
00:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so the client sends in a fixed rate?
00:01 < bridge> <totar> no not really
00:01 < bridge> <totar> it sends whenever it feels like it
00:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but when the client sends 20 inputs for a single tick
00:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> all were off or what
00:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the client basically sends: this packet is supposed to ariive at "12:00:00.000"
00:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so a timestamp?
00:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the server sends back the timestamp then?
00:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and then the server says "your packet that was supposed to arive at "12:00:00.000" actually arrived 0.120s late
00:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and then the server says your packet that was supposed to arive at "12:00:00.000" actually arrived 0.120s late
00:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> your input was for tick 25, which is in 5ms
00:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this?
00:02 < bridge> <totar> it says "input for tick 25 was 5ms early"
00:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the "tick" is the timestamp here
00:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which client and server share
00:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, and it sends it back in the snapshot packet i guess?
00:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's a separate packet
00:03 < bridge> <totar> not currently
00:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> NETMSG_INPUTTIMING
00:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but sent in the same packet as the snap
00:03 < bridge> <totar> it could be in the snap if bandwidth was a concern but it's not that big
00:03 < bridge> <totar> oh maybe it is
00:03 < bridge> <totar> does it flush?
00:04 < bridge> <totar> ok it doesnt
00:04 < bridge> <totar> heinrich is correct
00:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think only connection establishment stuff, NETMSG_INPUT and NETMSG_SNAP flush
00:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd still say this information is already in the ping + snapshots packet timing
00:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, I'm off to sleep. good night ðŸ™‚
00:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gn8
00:05 < bridge> <totar> gn
00:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but manually acking has one huge advantage, it includes the overhead of the network code
00:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
00:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even if it might be small, CPUs ofc also generate a bit of jitter, and this must be handled by a margin for example.
00:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but manually acking has one huge advantage, it includes the overhead of the network code (on server & client)
00:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
00:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even if it might be small, CPUs ofc also generate a bit of jitter, and this must be handled by a margin for example.
00:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> (it must be handled by a margin, if it wouldnt be so accurate as with normal ack'ing ^^)
00:08 < bridge> <totar> isn't manually acking already what happens?
00:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> my old version used ping + snapshot timing only
00:08 < bridge> <totar> ah you mean dd pg
00:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah ðŸ˜„
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @totar does your issue about the prediction code also help with ping jitter, or was that unrelated?
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like that it resets the auto prediction margin all the time
00:15 < bridge> <totar> idk
00:17 < bridge> <totar> you would need to spike to 800+ ms for long enough that the m_PredictedTime smoothtime reaches a high enough value to trigger the prediction reset. which maybe takes 0.2-0.4s of input timing messages from the server.
00:18 < bridge> <totar> it can certainly happen but only for super major lag spikes, not really normal jitter
00:19 < bridge> <totar> the other issue with csmoothtime being wrong does have a huge impact on ping jitter
00:19 < bridge> <totar> csmoothtime should really be re-written because it's not very good at it's job but if you patch that one issue it becomes kinda ok
00:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh ok
00:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i thought the reset was related to an early packet arriving
00:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> vs slow ones
00:21 < bridge> <totar> another issue with csmoothtime is that the speed it adjusts your prediction amount is proportional to your ping. so if you have 500ms it literally adjust like 20x faster than if you have 30ms. so people with high latency will experience small jitters much worse
00:22 < bridge> <totar> reset can't really happen from a single packet, you need a real high ping connection
00:22 < bridge> <totar> well
00:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah
00:23 < bridge> <totar> actually maybe it can happen for a single packet if the server sends you one that says you're like 20000ms off? lol
00:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i swear, a good prediction timer is harder than a vulkan backend
00:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not joking xD
00:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i struggle so much with it
00:23 < bridge> <totar> hmm
00:23 < bridge> <totar> trml did a lot of good work to make the cpp version much better
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how do you react to laggs
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how fast should you consider a connection stable again
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how far back should your ping/timer data reach back to give a good automatic prediction margin
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how to deal with packet loss
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and so on
00:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so many factors
00:24 < bridge> <totar> have you found any articles describing how to implement this system? I know that other games also use client prediction in the same way as ddnet but I haven't found any that explain their methods
00:25 < bridge> <totar> only that overwatch GDC talk explains it a little bit but they do not talk about the deep specifics
00:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nope, i couldnt even find math/statistics that is directly connected to it.
00:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
00:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i only find things for physics that are similar to a ping jitter from the curves
00:27 < bridge> <totar> also this article but it's not a full implementation https://gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html
00:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i sometimes write test cases with specific start conditions and jitter and see how it evolves xD
00:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1275219586714697728/image.png?ex=66c51849&is=66c3c6c9&hm=aecbd661351d79af97d0e614180b7029e089681aa990a8d6f84971634dd67ce8&
00:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for the prediction timer, which is basically csmoothtime in the cpp version i guess
00:30 < bridge> <totar> https://tenor.com/view/cat-touch-dont-gif-9258567
00:30 < bridge> <totar> cpp version is basically this gif
00:30 < bridge> <totar> except the fish is dropping an input message on the server
00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> my version still suffers insanly from when the lag initially happens, once it's stable, it's kinda ok
00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1275220581100421190/lag.mp4?ex=66c51936&is=66c3c7b6&hm=5beaf7c171e17436679714078c746703ea80404742705a89cf89d837b2d251c9&
00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on the right you see the ping jitter etc.
00:32 < bridge> <totar> I didn't still any insane suffering lol
00:32 < bridge> <totar> I didn't see any insane suffering lol
00:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok i show you, don't laugh xd
00:32 < bridge> <totar> cpp version also has insane suffering so I don't think it can be much worse
00:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1275221233012834304/laggyaf.mp4?ex=66c519d2&is=66c3c852&hm=9674ab4c562ed86fe7750b26578418213ac7e5034474f68994080be74290b788&
00:33 < bridge> <totar> if you introduce delay instantly there's physically no way you can smoothly adjust without misprediction
00:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it is
00:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i still struggle to find a way to make the lag not too impactful
00:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but if this would be ddos, rip
00:34 < bridge> <totar> have you tested this also on cpp?
00:34 < bridge> <totar> it looks similar tbh
00:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it cannot deal with it without your issue being fixed xD
00:34 < bridge> <totar> ah
00:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but yeah it adjust to the lag faster, but you cannot really play well with the lag
00:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mine adjust extremly bad, but once it's adjusted it's playable
00:35 < bridge> <totar> idk I was waiting on trml to give me his ancient wisdom on what "prediction time reset" does before I delete it
00:36 < bridge> <totar> I guess we can just increase MaxLatencyTicks() to 3s without any issues but the predicton time reset can still cause issues
00:36 < bridge> <totar> I guess we can just increase MaxLatencyTicks() to 3s to fix high ping but the predicton time reset can still cause issues
00:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok gotta head out, else i die by sleep loss xd

09:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: did you include the stencil thing that we never merged in 0.7
09:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~i actually don't like that we now intentionally used different default asset from teeworlds, but that's just me and probably doesn't matter that much.~~
10:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rich experience
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie nah because im not porting it to vulkan
10:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @jupeyy_keks help
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed
10:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my thought exactly really
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti biggest 0.7 supported can do it
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie what different default asset?
10:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what different?
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you said that
10:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh, the souly pr
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we can also send a pr in teeworlds
10:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not sure if our 0.7 is directly copied from 0.7 to begin with tho
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure oy will merge it
10:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> helped
10:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: do you know if we actually want the adaptive marking tho
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @soulyvevo send same pr in github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
10:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can learn vulkan and do it || probably ||
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie i do want it. soli does want it.
10:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye that's what I mean, does anyone apart from souly wants it lol
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oy?
10:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we have to update all marking assets too
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that would introduce a stencil buffer.
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if we are ready for that
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Stiopa
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Sonix
10:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's pretty trivial in 0.7's sdl
10:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or are you talking about we just don't want to enable stencil buffer for this one particular use case
10:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i would agree enabling an entire buffer for this is a lot
10:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah i guess this
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> plus overhead per tee
10:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait. aren't scrollrect already stenciled
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> clipped
10:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh right
10:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i remember now
10:17 < bridge> <soulyvevo> wasnt there one already?
10:17 < bridge> <soulyvevo> or at least i remember some talk about it
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also remember some talk
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1398
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this?
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is this what caused it xd
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i care too little about the feet to search for me they all look the same
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao fred
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1400#issuecomment-139928311
10:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it looks cool tho
10:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kek:
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> raytracing also looks cool ðŸ˜¬
10:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> call it DDNet2 so the fps drop is expected
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in my opinion the 0.7 skin system isnt good enough anyway.
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> changing some markings is cool yes.
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But look at our "normal" database for skins:
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.org/skins/index.php?search=%24type%3Anormal
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for 99% of the skins the 0.7 concept simply aint working
10:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i thought that's why we kept both
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if you really want to do a modular skin system you have to plan what you need before hand.
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like if u want hats, your base skins must never include hats or ears or other stuff that blocks hats
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but that is quite some work.. also ppl seem to enjoy having a database behind it. the 0.7 database defs has more overhead
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it needs to query per changable item e.g.
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but that is quite some work.. also ppl seem to enjoy having a database behind it. the 0.7 database defs has more overhead (would have9
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but that is quite some work.. also ppl seem to enjoy having a database behind it. the 0.7 database defs has more overhead (would have, if it existed)
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imo 0.7 skins are already planned out too bad.
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ears shouldnt be part of the main skin
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ears shouldnt be part of the base skin
10:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> i don't think we need to have whether 0.7 skins are good idea just to avoid stencil
10:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> i don't think we need to have whether 0.7 skins are good idea convo, just to avoid stencil
10:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> i'd like to stick to whether we should try to implement the adaptive markings
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then you have adaptive markings and then?
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u still cant have hats xd
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it sounds to me like this is just one idea of a new better skin system generally
10:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i have no words. i won't touch it then
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wont prevent you from. but you should make clear that we add a buffer that has to be cleared every frame, and has overhead for every tee rendered
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for markings xd
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on 0.7
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xDD
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @tsfreddie the idea is cool tho
10:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919> i mean i kinda want your help
10:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't think i can make vulkan work in a short amount of time
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd love to see some mmo teeworlds that allows to wear custom clothes etc ðŸ˜„
10:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if it is not immensely complicated we could benchmark a bit to weight our options before merging.
10:35 < bridge> <meloÆž> ahaha thats one way to revive teecity!
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's dead?
10:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> I dont See many people playing it - its AFK city
10:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> It was really cool Back then tho - No Zoom meaning you actually Had to follow the signs, getting oneshot by npcs etc
10:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean it's not like ddnet currently runs terribly. *unless it is, cuz i haven't played it for quite some time now*
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but e.g. stencil buffers are not core in ogl 1.x, so we have to make sure it runs on every hardware and stuff like that
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's quite a bit of complexity
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u want to try out, you can also start with opengl
10:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we already did in 0.7
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and its not merged, and not realed to public
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and its not merged, and not released to public
10:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not merged sure, not sure how released to public relates to anything.
10:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you could say it's not thoroughly tested, that i would agree.
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how does it play together with multi sampling?
10:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> that's why i think we need your help
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
10:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> iirc in 0.7 i drew the border on top of the markings to hide the edges so i actually never checked how it looks by itself
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess it's no secret that i'd prefer if we don't depend on 0.7, which is a dead project for me.
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if we want a better skin system, then it's not 0.7 ones IMO
10:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
10:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we know that
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> at least you didnt explode
10:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
11:36 < bridge> <Peakies> maybe having skin system with attachment feature (hats, glass, earing, glowing effect or particles) would be better than having 0.7 customized skin system that even not work on most of DDNet's skins that currently exist in skins database
11:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866> if chiller can add 0.7 into ddnet, someone could add new skin system too. it's just no one took the liberty of designing the thing, probably due to fear of potentially throwing a huge amount of efforts to waste.
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tru ðŸ˜„
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and you need artists that help you design your concept
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i also never thought chiller's 0.7 pr could go anywhere
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i'm apparently wrong
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i just hope we get android & accounts this year
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and don't put too much focus on other things
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I like hope
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i wish i could help, but my life is weird rn
11:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 2024 year when ddnet gets accounts
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and apparently has been for years
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we have 4 months left
11:44 < bridge> <matodor> 2024 year when ddnet gets accounts_FINAL_123123_TEST.psd
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> speedrun time
11:44 < bridge> <matodor> 2024 year when ddnet gets accounts_FINAL_123123_TEST_2025.psd
11:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> does chiller work?
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no, he chills on the beach
11:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i wonder how he can pump out so many teeworlds projects
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> since 1 year
11:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
11:45 < bridge> <learath2> he is paid by the 0.7 consortium
11:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe i should stop throwing myself into difficult situations and just accept that I should have a normal job
11:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
11:46 < bridge> <sans._.> he secretely lives inside a tw map, probably with a beach and a hut
11:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i forgot to have lunch again...
11:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's 5:46pm
11:47 < bridge> <sans._.> don't have lunch at that hour, have dinner XD
12:05 < bridge> <Peakies> maybe focusing on android release and accounts is best purpose for now other thing will get implementation by time, so far DDNet really improved from time that I was played for first time I think that was DDNet 6 or 8 with DDRace tournament of map Kobra 2 I think

12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :lol:  dont trick the system
12:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes he is
12:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He is the â€žbest manâ€œ I was talking about
12:31 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I agree
12:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I just pinged headbot because he ported ddnet to every console on the planet
12:31 < bridge> <Peakies> he's hard trying on ddnet
12:31 < bridge> <Peakies> Oh yeah I remember now
12:32 < bridge> <Peakies> I don't know that consoles but we have ddnet on all of them
12:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yeah xd
12:32 < bridge> <Peakies> I think he's trying to port on smart watches
12:33 < bridge> <Peakies> cuz we want to play DDNet in bus or in toilet
12:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I play zCatch on my smart fridge thanks to headbot
12:33 < bridge> <Peakies> thank you Headshot for porting DDNet to all kind of devices
12:34 < bridge> <Peakies> do we have it on smart tv ?
12:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Donâ€™t think so .\_.
12:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just attach a pc duh
12:34 < bridge> <Peakies> hmm I think it's need android version first
12:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Smart tv = android
12:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Somehow
12:34 < bridge> <Peakies> of course I don't have even any kind of console just pc ðŸ˜„
12:34 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I noticed after I asked
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @diariesvexar: when become ddnet contributor and help with android version?
12:35 < bridge> <Peakies> is there any wiki or guide to learn ddnet UI edit ?
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Letâ€™s go
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is a smol ddnet dev wiki
12:36 < bridge> <Peakies> I can just test it on arm-8a as 64 cpu if robyt need it ðŸ˜„
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And a blog from king Edgar
12:36 < bridge> <Peakies> oh Ryo educated that too hmm
12:37 < bridge> <Peakies> then I should check it
13:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: are you available for hire
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie mostly not. What do you need?
13:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> nothing, just asking lol

15:21 < bridge> <soulyvevo> kinda hard to argue because most skin combinations dont work at all, try using random skin option there, it's just awful :justatest:
15:22 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think that just stacking a few images on top of each other doesnt quite work that well
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If I'd do a pro vs cons what i think 0.7 skin system does better:
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Pro:
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - Better color range
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - Colorize markings individually (1)
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - Colorize hands
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Cons:
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - Different markings make the skin ugly very quick (2)
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - Decorations don't work at all (3)
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - Coloring eyes doesn't convince me either (4)
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Except for coloring markings individually, all other pros could be done with our current skins too, I think

15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> (eyes could ofc also be colorized in current system, just dunno if that works out considering lot of skins have very specific eyes)
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Neither 0.7 nor 0.6 scale for decorations or different markings tho. They will look very ugly on many skins making the tee look like trash
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> A real working system would need to be designed differently from ground up
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I don't see this happening very soon, since that also requires motivated artists
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the last motivated artist vanished after he noticed he doesnt like rust ðŸ˜¬

15:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> +1
15:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> 0.7 skin system had higher resolution skins iirc
15:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> look in the ddnet skin db and you will find ugly skins as well, I'd assume
15:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> (first con is no con)
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but you cant create them
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> louis could pull out his ban hammer and remove it

15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> `cl_skin_community_download_url https://ddnet.org/skins/skin/community/uhd/`
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then u have HD skins too
15:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's good
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they should already be colored
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> `cl_skin_community_download_url https://ddnet.org/skins/skin/community/uhd/`

15:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> I don't know how much customization people actually used on 0.7. You had the tools to combine everything but did players actually use that flexibility there
15:50 < bridge> <eghwand> i need to add TextRender()->TextColor thing?
15:50 < bridge> <eghwand> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1275451941744541718/image.png?ex=66c5f0af&is=66c49f2f&hm=4f0140dc2ec8948f9e763ec1a436d46d5c6face488e8792c26e147b6d66d6444&
15:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> in general I liked the skin system better just for tue flexibility but dunno if that flexibility is needed.
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but this is what u get
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1275452060824899726/image.png?ex=66c5f0cc&is=66c49f4c&hm=a5261a0da95c8e559d5412e2038c8666ea84c4727c44047a60149527083cca36&
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> broken skins
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even on a skin i like in 0.7
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> with tsfreddies marking thing it would at least not look as broken
15:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's the problem, especially for graphics people
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's nearly impossible to test one new added marling with all other body parts in the db
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> marking
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> or at least marking + all body variants
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes but that just tells me that this system doesnt scale
15:52 < bridge> <louis> ravie still somewhat around
15:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> it might make sense to only allow a subset of those 0.7 body parts
15:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> which do not collide
15:54 < bridge> <learath2> Move the TextColor line before the start of your if statements
15:55 < bridge> <louis> hmm i guess u need to implement some sort of intersection code for the skin body and the marking, is that what 0.7 does?
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no that screenshot is from 0.7
15:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> or keep as is, because when you combine a super thin body with feet that are far apart, you also get ugly combinations
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tsfreddie did smth like that using the stencil buffer
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but it wasnt merged
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> It won't happen, we can't maintain 3 skin systems lol
15:57 < bridge> <louis> drop 0.7 skin system, implement new one and give accessories to main database skins :brownbear:
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> Can't, we added it once, now we need to support it until 2052
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and another bad thing is simply that we go from 1 key to multiple keys
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imagine skin parts as hashmaps, then u have many hashmaps.
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Currently 0.7 only works because there is no lazy loading involved
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> otherwise it would either need to load the whole skin, or load from many hashmaps
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or does it already use different hashmaps
15:59 < bridge> <louis> an idea for hats in 2052: each main db skin can be given a "bodyshape" attribute or smth and each hat has "supported_attributes"
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> havent looked into the code yet xd
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, that could work indeed, but defs also complex ðŸ˜„
16:00 < bridge> <robyt3> All the skin parts are in one vector ðŸ‘€
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh ok
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xdd
16:00 < bridge> <louis> is it rly complex? if skin.shape in hat.supported_shapes : render ðŸ˜¹
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well if u add a hat that probably wont just work on all skins that _could_ have hats
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so u have other type of hats
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD

16:05 < bridge> <louis> yeah thats kinda what i proposed
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> So silly of us not to have logged the errno aswell
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> farm commits
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> `EEXIST` is probably unlikely
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> `ENFILE` maybe if something else was opening lots of files
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> `ENOSPC` could happen if you are on a full disk but that breaks a lot more you'd notice
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> 
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> I can't really see any of the others really being possible
16:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> disk isn't full, nothing else running on my system
16:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have the coredump?
16:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should contain the error
16:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should contain the errno
16:13 < bridge> <learath2> Extremely unlucky ASLR and the OS not cleaning up the last ddnet execution properly for some reason, could perhaps lead to `EEXIST`
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> filesystem hardest api
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> graphics, buggiest api
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> network, slowest api
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do coredumps exist on mac? @learath2
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> if you enable them, yes
16:16 < bridge> <0xdeen> nope!
16:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> something like crashpad would be amazing
16:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so users could send bug reports automatically, if they wish
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> Did they remove them? This macbook I'm on has them inside `/cores` still, on Catalina though
16:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Is it possible another process randomly used exactly the same semaphore name? Our way of generating names on macOS is not globally unique and from what I'm reading semaphore names are global and multiple processes can act on them
16:26 < bridge> <eghwand> i just want the admin part to be this color
16:26 < bridge> <eghwand> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1275460891307020343/image.png?ex=66c5f905&is=66c4a785&hm=3d0231422cf3f815f0fb57583351de8a9e19fb5f93fcab6d756d789cbdd6e2fa&
16:26 < bridge> <eghwand> but full name is red now
16:26 < bridge> <robyt3> Reset to default color after rendering the admin text
16:38 < bridge> <0xdeen> I remember it was extemely difficult to enable coredumps on ARM macs, so I just use my Linux server

17:04 < bridge> <soulyvevo> should be easy to do i guess
17:04 < bridge> <soulyvevo> considering how lazy some of them were in the first place :justatest:
21:10 < bridge> <0xfaulty> @robyt3 could we migrate from JsonStringWriter to nlohmann::json? It is hpp single header lib file. I could make pr in this case (for server info)
21:10 < bridge> <0xfaulty> I know that you added JsonStringWriter and it much more lightweight, but less convenient
21:10 < bridge> <0xfaulty> https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.3
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     nlohmann::json InfoJson = {
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"max_clients", MaxClients},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"max_players", MaxPlayers},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"passworded", g_Config.m_Password[0] ? true : false},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"game_type", GameServer()->GameType()},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"name", g_Config.m_SvName},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"map", {{"name", m_aCurrentMap},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>                 {"sha256", aMapSha256},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>                 {"size", m_aCurrentMapSize[MAP_TYPE_SIX]}}},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"version", GameServer()->Version()},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"client_score_kind", ScoreKind},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"requires_login", false},
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         {"clients", nlohmann::json::array()}};
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty> 
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty> instead of 
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty> 
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     CJsonStringWriter JsonWriter;
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.BeginObject();
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteAttribute("max_clients");
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteIntValue(MaxClients);
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteAttribute("max_players");
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteIntValue(MaxPlayers);
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteAttribute("passworded");
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteBoolValue(g_Config.m_Password[0]);
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteAttribute("game_type");
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteStrValue(GameServer()->GameType());
21:11 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteAttribute("name");
21:12 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     JsonWriter.WriteStrValue(g_Config.m_SvName);
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems overkill to add a 25k line inclusion to save 50 lines while writing json. This library also includes json parsing so at that point we should ditch the existing json parser, which would require changing a lot of code
21:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> There is also risk in switching
21:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> Is something not working with what we currently have?
21:22 < bridge> <learath2> It's just not as cool and as hip
21:23 < bridge> <robyt3> I like whatever this macro is https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/9cca280a4d0ccf0c08f47a99aa71d1b0e52f8d03/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp#L2613-L2742
21:26 < bridge> <learath2> :PepeCross:
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wonder if our formatter would leave the good looking one as is
21:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> single header lib sounds bad. linux distributions don't like that. does that also have a normal library?
21:31 < bridge> <0xfaulty> I completely agree with this, it is indeed true, I just found it convenient and use it in many places in my modification, and including I changed the Info generation to this approach, if you are not comfortable with this I don't insist on it
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> It's the most common json lib afaik btw
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> c++ seems to have a bad library story if "single header library" sounds goo
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> d
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this means that the whole library needs to be parsed for every compilation unit that includes it
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> C++20 modules woooooooooo :Celebrate:
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> I actually don't know if compilers utilize it properly yet. But it should allow this
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> last time i used it (~3 years ago) and enabled auto modules for standard includes, it improved compile times by like 5-10%
21:52 < bridge> <godly13> Guys why u add fin and Ukraine servers, but not romanian or bolgarian servers
21:53 < bridge> <godly13> Ita very need bc if u live in turkey u dont have normal servers
21:53 < bridge> <godly13> All servers start at 80-90 ping
21:53 < bridge> <godly13> Only tur servers 20 ping but all ways have ddos
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you can simply sponsor one to ddnet, i guess
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if it's so important to you
