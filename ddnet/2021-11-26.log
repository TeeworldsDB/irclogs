04:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Robyt3 don't really know what to do with it. don't have a windows computer where I could test it on right now :/
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> so no more swap for now?
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> for now, yes
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> the fix by deen is in the code but not deployed yet
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> All servers restarted already (version 0.6.4, 15.7) have swap enabled again

09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > PHP 8.1 is a major update of the PHP language.
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It contains many new features, including enums, readonly properties, first-class callable syntax, fibers, intersection types, performance improvements and more.
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> welcome php to 2021 ðŸ¥³
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate that php uses \ for namespaces/paths
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no wonder its an ancient language
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> i think you missed adding the two changes from wide\_argv to new\_argv to the commit. You could also add dbg_assert(wide_argv != NULL, "CommandLineToArgvW failure"); to handle all the potential WinAPI errors
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> PHP is not ancient, I think it's rather that it started as a hobby language. 1994 release for a programming language is pretty new, Python (1991) and Haskell (1990) are older and still modern languages. Ancient languages would be C (1972), Fortran (1957), Lisp (1958), Cobol (1959)
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> python 3 was on 2008
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddnet cobol port when?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 port ddnet to Ada
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its really secure
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> european aproved
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more than secure i guess its "reliable"
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> port ddnet to xiaomi mi band 4
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> there should be a /report feature, since it would be the most effective way to report someone
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> like when doing /report [name] [reason], it can send a message in a private discord text channel to all mods, with name, reason and ip
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i just dont know how to code
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We had one. People spammed it with racial slurs
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need accounts to make ingame reporting feasible
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> just ban people who abuse report system
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and it will happen less
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Towards the end of it they were using multiple vpns to spam it
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With fake names ofc
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and how about making the report system exclusive to people who connected their discord account with the game?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need an account system for that :D
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but discord accounts could replace an account system, wouldnt it?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ignoring the fact that iirc discord doesnt provide a login with discord, there is no way we'd be okay with forcing people to use a closed source service just to get an account
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i meant to just make a discord account system for the people who wanna use the /report feature
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No easy way to do it from what I see in discord api
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk i've seen alot of services offer a connection to discord
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess maybe we could have the client persist a token from discord, but that is so annoying to code
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and it would be also useful for other features that otherwise could've been spammed
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> ye idk like i said idk how to code
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 discord supports oauth2
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im against this too
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no closed source
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, we could do the flow from the client and then have the client include the auth token on each report, but so much pain
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> maybe i should learn coding
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> what coding language would that be in?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> C style c++

14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> max
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u need a discord bot which messages a discord account when that player tries to connect to discord, then you have to enter a code from it ingame or write to some approvement to the bot via discord, or both
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that could be done via @DDNet
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> creating a code depending on the user discord token?
