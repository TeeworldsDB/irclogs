00:05 <@deen> too tired to study. i guess we can't just fix all these oldschool maps =/
00:06 < laxa> yes you could, but you decided not to.
00:07 <@deen> but they have had these bugs for years
00:07 < laxa> maybe
00:07 < laxa> or a third choice
00:07 < laxa> remove map from server
00:07 <@deen> eh?
00:07 < laxa> well
00:07 < laxa> you don't wanna fix cheat
00:07 < laxa> you don't wanna reset times
00:08 < laxa> you can remove map maybe
00:08 <@deen> we never remove maps on ddnet
00:08 <@deen> except if the mapper asks us to
00:09 < laxa> well then you made your choice
00:53 < laxa> Gn all.
00:53 <@deen> good night laxa
08:13 < EastBite> deen: piko wasn't talking about spoofing recently
08:13 < EastBite> so ddnet has an ovh server now?
09:39 < laxa_work> yeah, France is a Kimsufi server from OVH
09:41 < EastBite> which one?
09:45 < laxa_work> DDNet FRA
09:45 < laxa_work> it was launched yesterday at 20:30
09:54 < EastBite> I mean which kimsufi plan
09:59 < laxa_work> KS-4
09:59 < EastBite> ah
10:10 <@deen> Hi
10:10 < EastBite> 64 bytes from fra.ddnet.tw (176.31.125.151): icmp_seq=174 ttl=60 time=2.42 ms
10:10 < EastBite> hi deen 
10:11 <@deen> I like the french server
10:11 < EastBite> :)
10:11 <@deen> Will just have to see how the ddos protection works
10:11 <@deen> and it's clearly overpowered
10:11 <@deen> using 5% of RAM and 0% of HDD right now^^
10:12 < EastBite> normal for a dedicated server :P
10:12 <@deen> Yeah, but now I've been optimizing everything to take as little memory as possible, so I can't even think of anything to use these 16 GB
10:13 < EastBite> I used my KS-2 to mine primecoin for some weeks
10:13 <@deen> and tournament is planned for 21 September
10:13 < EastBite> earned about 50$
10:13 < EastBite> 21 September
10:14 < EastBite> looks like you have to wait to test the protection :D
10:14 <@deen> or provoke a few ddosers
10:15 < EastBite> hey you! ddos my server NOW!
10:15 <@deen> GER server regularly gets attacked, even without tournaments
10:16 < EastBite> hmm
10:16 <@deen> usually when I go on a few servers and ask a few people who i think are ddosing why they do it, i get another ddos
10:17 < EastBite> well, if there are many players on fra it might be easy
10:19 < EastBite> ah you alerady made a news entry for that
10:32 < laxa_work> deen: already awake ? :)
10:34 < laxa_work> EastBite: from where is that ping oO ?
10:35 < laxa_work> if I ping ddnet FRA from my dedi, I have 4.7ms
10:35 < laxa_work> oh, from your kimsufi ?
10:35 < EastBite> yes
10:35 < laxa_work> ok, that explains it !
10:35 <@deen> Hm, it's a waste to have 2 servers in Europe
10:36 <@deen> I wish I had a tournament map ready for next Sunday
10:37 < EastBite> now you have a 10gbit one and a ddos protected one
10:37 <@deen> ^^
10:38 < laxa_work> deen: I thought about another principle for hall of fame, pretty sure it's like you wanted it
10:39 < laxa_work> principle : If a player has a #1, on a map finished by more than X people and if map is released for at least 2 weeks, he then can send us the demo, and we make a video of it
10:40 <@deen> those rules are useless
10:40 < laxa_work> well
10:40 < laxa_work> making videos of maps finished only once isn't really a good run
10:41 < laxa_work> and if someone makes rank 1 just on release, it's not a good run either
10:41 < laxa_work> that's why I think some ground rules would be nice
10:45 <@deen> yeah, probably
10:46 <@deen> alright, that's fine
10:48 <@deen> So I'm just asking for a tournament map in forum now^^
10:49 < laxa_work> could add a rule about length of run too, not sure people would watch run which are longer than 30 minutes.
10:49 <@deen> long runs are best
10:49 < laxa_work> xD
10:49 < laxa_work> ok
10:49 < laxa_work> no rule about that then
10:49 <@deen> Short runs are mostly Novice and Moderate
10:49 <@deen> I'd prefer to see the Brutal maps
10:50 <@deen> But hm, I think these videos might make people play less
10:50 <@deen> and watch more videos instead
10:51 < laxa_work> I'd rather think (and hope) that more people would run maps
10:52 < laxa_work> and novice/moderate/solo maps would be real run
10:52 < laxa_work> when brutal maps would be more hard maps being finished by pro, not really runs
11:06 <@deen> but people like to watch good brutal runs
11:06 <@deen> Someone told me he watched the Adrenaline 3 video 5 times^^
11:10 < laxa_work> Hum, should I add a rule about number of runners too ?
11:10 <@deen> no
11:11 <@deen> I think I can't throw away GER now, because FRA's bandwidth is too low
11:11 <@deen> I tested it a bit, and the server would get laggy when the website gets a lot of requests
11:33 < laxa_work> you only got 100mb on FRA right ?
11:35 <@deen> exactly
13:13 < laxa_work> deen: still there ?
13:13 <@deen> ?
13:15 < laxa_work> can you make a forum Hall of Fame please ?
13:15 < laxa_work> So people will post their demo inside it
13:16 <@deen> So how would that work?
13:17 <@deen> They follow the rules and upload their demo
13:17 <@deen> and artkis makes a video of it?
13:17 <@deen> where do we put the video then?
13:17 <@deen> I don't think people should post demos on the forum
13:18 < laxa_work> we put video on youtbe
13:18 < laxa_work> I'll make a DDNet account tonight
13:18 < laxa_work> I'll give a mail then
13:18 <@deen> but demos include text messages by other people
13:18 < laxa_work> hum...
13:18 <@deen> Couldn't we just have a demo upload site?
13:19 < laxa_work> Well, maybe, I don't know
13:19 < laxa_work> but either we use forum to upload demo, or I provide an email
13:19 < laxa_work> like that
13:19 < laxa_work> halloffame@ts.ddnet.tw
13:20 <@deen> Sort of like http://ddnet.tw/upload
13:20 < laxa_work> Yeah you could, but then you have to forward the demos
13:20 <@deen> No
13:21 < laxa_work> what do you do of the demo then ?
13:23 <@deen> Upload here: http://ddnet.tw/halloffame/upload/
13:25 < laxa_work> ok nice
13:26 < laxa_work> I'll make the post explaining it now
13:41 <@deen> afk
13:55 <@deen> laxa_work: mind if i edit your forum text?
13:56 <@deen> too many bugs, i'm fixing
14:00 <@deen> ok, edited
14:09 < laxa_work> I'll need the ddnet logo in a common format if possible
14:10 < laxa_work> dont even know .svg
14:10 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ddnet.png
14:10 <@deen> or http://ddnet.tw/ddnet2.png
14:10 <@deen> oh no^^
14:10 <@deen> is the first fine?
14:12 < laxa_work> Well
14:12 < laxa_work> Is the text part of logo ?
14:13 < laxa_work> there is no text in logo ^^
14:13 <@deen> what?
14:13 < laxa_work> Well, I should be working. I'll see that tonight
14:51 < o_be_one> hi :)
14:51 <@deen> hi
14:52 < o_be_one> hey deen , i think ive tried to add you on skype
14:52 < o_be_one> but i dont remember the skypename
14:52 <@deen> read PM
14:53 < o_be_one> well no problem, maybe you can help me, just want to know why my DDnet server set gametype as DDrace (test cmds 0) or testddrace (test cmds 1) ? i want to show DDNet ...
14:53 <@deen> because the gametype is DDraceNetwork
14:54 <@deen> you just can't read the Network I guess^^
14:54 < o_be_one> ok thank you 'ill try this :)
14:54 <@deen> no, i mean the text shown is DDraceNetwork
14:54 < o_be_one> so i need to set sv_gametype DDraceNetwork
14:54 < o_be_one> oh ok !
14:54 < o_be_one> why i havent thinked about that >.<
14:55 <@deen> no, you don't need to set anything
14:55 < o_be_one> ive seen you have opened a server in france, can i know host ?
14:55 <@deen> it's just DDraceNetwork and not DDNet
14:55 <@deen> http://kimsufi.com/
14:55 < o_be_one> oh ok, kimsufi offer a good ddos protection :)
14:56 < o_be_one> well i'm sorry but maybe you dont know me ^^ ?
14:56 < o_be_one> ive checked, yes its ddracenetwork, thanks a lot :)
14:56 < o_be_one> i've tried to talk with you and added you on skype when you have shuted down all ddnetwork ... :(
14:57 < o_be_one> someone told me it was cause of too many lamers ... you was bored
14:58 < o_be_one> thats why i've tried to talk with you, cause i like your work (first time use it was yesterday but i know your work as opensource and just for that i'm pretty sure you think like XXLTomate or me ...)
14:59 <@deen> I don't know how XXLTomate or you think
15:07 < o_be_one> sorry deen i'm at work
15:07 <@deen> np
15:07 < o_be_one> well XXLTomate made XXLDDrace
15:08 < o_be_one> is a nice developer, and friendly
15:08 < o_be_one> you can talk with him without problem and if he can help you he will do it
15:08 < o_be_one> i think you are like that, i've seen your github and seen all is available ... it's a very good mind for me
15:09 < o_be_one> (XXLTomate work with eeeee too and fisted)
15:09 < o_be_one> (i've already worked with eeeee, he offered me official ddwar server with scoreboards)
15:10 < o_be_one> i'm just an hoster, i've a good french community of gaming, our main line is Minecraft, but we host too Farmining Simulator, StarBound, StarMade, TeeWorlds ...
15:10 < o_be_one> maybe you already know r0x.fr, these are mine
15:13 <@deen> ah yeah, i know them
15:13 <@deen> well, we got the french servers because of ddos protection
15:13 <@deen> I want tournaments again and we always got DDoS-attacked
15:13 < o_be_one> sure we have the best !
15:13 < o_be_one> i work with great hosts like ovh so i know what you mean :D
15:14 < o_be_one> but even with ovh, some ddos are very hardcore ^^ but for 99% of noobs, you are ready :D
15:14 <@deen> i don't think we're getting noob ddos attacks
15:15 <@deen> but we'll see, nothing better i can do for now
15:17 <@deen> i couldn't find any good and cheap servers with ddos protection in Germany
15:17 < o_be_one> no all are in France :/
15:17 < o_be_one> it just coming in Canada cause of OVH ...
15:17 < o_be_one> OVH is now in Canada too :)
15:19 <@deen> but now the problem is that noone expected tournaments to come back so I have no map for next Sunday
15:23 < o_be_one> oh shit :( ...
15:23 < o_be_one> i know some map designer but i think they are not good like you need ...
15:24 < o_be_one> ive some "exclusive" maps too
15:26 < Savander> hello
15:27 < o_be_one> hi Savander 
15:29 <@deen> hi
15:31 < o_be_one> deen, do you want i ask my level designer when i see them ?
15:31 < o_be_one> maybe i can convince bip to do one too
15:32 <@deen> no, i need a finished tournament map by a popular mapper
15:32 <@deen> not someone i don't know to start today
15:32 < o_be_one> hum ... Bip is just the creator of blmapV3ROYAL ^^.
15:35 <@deen> Any popular non-blocker maps?
15:36 < o_be_one> your tournament run other things than blocker map ?
15:36 < o_be_one> i dont know about non blocker, i'll ask him
15:38 <@deen> Eh, we're a DDRace server
15:50 < o_be_one> you dont host blocker map :o ?
15:51 <@deen> mainly we're focussed on DDRace
15:52 <@deen> We do host some other stuff too, like ictf, zcatch, openfng, vanilla, block
15:52 <@deen> but they are just standard, without any new features or anything special
16:12 < o_be_one> ok
16:13 < o_be_one> and what is your goal ? Cause today i think you have made the most wanted system on TW
16:14 <@deen> Hm?
16:14 <@deen> What's a "wanted system"?
16:15 < o_be_one> most wanted app ? client and server ddnet are just awesome and powerful
16:15 <@deen> My goal is to make DDRace more fun worldwide
16:15 < o_be_one> i dont know why matricks doent work with you to enhance TW. ..
16:15 <@deen> Matricks?
16:15 < o_be_one> you are an active dev, XXLTomate, eeeee and fisted are no more active :(
16:15 <@deen> The TW devs hate DDRace
16:15 < o_be_one> why ? :o
16:16 <@deen> they say it destroys teeworlds
16:17 < o_be_one> well it's cause they dont own it and dont know how to manage it ... They dont understand that all game have mods to get more fun
16:17 < o_be_one> hum for me they are like kids ... What they dont own is not good for their game ... too bad.
16:18 < o_be_one> we can work together to do a better game, TW is awesome, all gamemodes are very funny ... TW destroyers are people like shaddix.
16:18 < o_be_one> or Candy ...
16:18 < EastBite> it's not about how good a game is or whether it makes less fun without mods
16:18 < EastBite> teeworlds is a small 2d shooter
16:18 < EastBite> .
16:18 <@deen> i'm a bit busy, fixing crashes right now
16:19 < o_be_one> sure no problem, i'm happy to meet you deen, i'll stay here :).
16:19 < o_be_one> and if i can help, no problem for me.
16:19 <@deen> ok, nice
16:26 <@deen> but something really is wrong with this community
16:26 <@deen> every day i hear of new people who attack people in Teeworlds in various ways
16:27 < EastBite> I mentioned that before :)
16:28 <@deen> yeah, but it's getting worse and worse
16:28 < EastBite> you think?
16:28 <@deen> i heard of 4 new people today who are DDoSing us and crashing DDNet clients
16:29 < EastBite> hm
16:29 <@deen> and they sound like they're about 10 years old
16:32 < o_be_one> deen, sure its very bad ... Good guys like us are very hard to find
16:32 < o_be_one> there is many many many traitors
16:32 < o_be_one> some people who are like your friend but when they can they do bad things
16:32 < o_be_one> some talks about hacking someone or ddosing ...
16:32 <@deen> Right now I'm getting threatened with a DDoS
16:32 < o_be_one> when they loose they just make all they can to crash the ennemy or the entire server ...
16:33 <@deen> because I'm not helping someone fix a bug in his own mod
16:33 < EastBite> why do I never get threatened :(
16:33 < o_be_one> every day players says "i'll down all r0x.fr" ... i'm like "yeah ok no problem, its free for you so if you think its good to attak something free, youre in the wrong way"
16:33 < o_be_one> they cant crash entire R0x.fr, there is too many dedicated but we cant tell them "yes, do it stupid kid", theyll work more to make shits.
16:34 < o_be_one> ive like 200 players at the same time every day ...
16:34 < o_be_one> i have many of these lamers ...
16:34 < laxa_work> deen: go ask them to ddos DDNet FRA
16:34 < o_be_one> some are life banned, range life banned to cause they come again with bnc
16:34 < o_be_one> with proxys*
16:34 < o_be_one> laxa_work, but they can make big lags for 5 seconds, even if its ovh ...
16:35 < o_be_one> you cant tell them to try to do it cause thell work hard to find the better way to do it
16:35 < laxa_work> I want to see if someone can manage to bring my servers down too
16:35 < o_be_one> theyll pay guys that have botnet if they can ... you just cant imagine
16:35 < o_be_one> OVH is not the god ... lag is many for players
16:35 < o_be_one> a good ddos cause 1 or 2s lag on OVH servers
16:36 < o_be_one> a very good ddos cause 5s lag
16:36 < laxa_work> my server is at Online
16:36 < laxa_work> not ovh
16:36 < o_be_one> its not mutch, but when they do this for 10 min ... hard
16:36 < EastBite> o_be_one: that sounds pretty good for a ddos protection
16:36 < o_be_one> Online ... poor ddos protection
16:36 < o_be_one> easy to down.
16:36 < o_be_one> EastBite, sure 2s is just awesome, but they just need to repeat it 100 times ...
16:37 < o_be_one> a 10 min ddos is useless, but 100 2s ddos are awesome.
16:37 < o_be_one> they dont understand that, 90% of stupid kids use just payed booters, too expansive for them
16:37 <@deen> o_be_one: 1-2 seconds is only for expensive OVH servers
16:37 <@deen> i think we have to wait 2 minutes until ddos protection even kicks in
16:38 < o_be_one> deen, in my kimsufi (ive just one small ks), i can set the firewall in forced mod, do this if you can :)
16:38 < o_be_one> its a free feature in firewall setting on ovh.com/manager
16:39 < o_be_one> laxa_work, when i was at online, someone found the good idea to just ddos at the limit of the antiddos, causing like 2h unavailablity ... evey with ddos protection option.
16:40 < o_be_one> just the limit when ddosp rotection starts, so you get "ddos protection on ... off ... on ... off .. on ... off ..." and fucking the entire network.
16:40 <@deen> will take a look at the firewall settings
16:40 < o_be_one> yes you need
16:41 <@deen> but now i need to announce tournament this Sunday!
16:41 < o_be_one> i work everyday with hosters, ive free dedicated at online, ovh and netissime ... ive worked with them to enhance my protection
16:41 < o_be_one> the only one who can support the biggest ddos is ovh
16:41 < o_be_one> deen, hope you'll can do your tournament :)
16:43 < EastBite> hm, in my manager I only can add firewall rules
16:44 < o_be_one> ovh too ?
16:45 < EastBite> yes, kimsufi KS-2
16:45 < o_be_one> ahah you too ^^ KS2G me :p. Ok let me see if this option exists at this time, the design has changed ...
16:46 < EastBite> I hate the new interface
16:46 < o_be_one> thats better than before .. i was in managerv3 ...
16:46 < o_be_one> EastBite, what TW serv you host ?
16:47 < EastBite> I don't host any
16:47 < o_be_one> oh ok so what you do with your dedicated ? personnal stuff ?
16:47 < EastBite> yep
16:48 < o_be_one> well has you can see here
16:48 < o_be_one> http://screen.obeone.fr/sc_14-09-11_10-48.png
16:48 < o_be_one> mitigation : permanente = forced mod
16:49 < EastBite> okay I understand
16:49 < o_be_one> and in the option i can set mitigation to auto
16:49 < o_be_one> lol this server is just a bungeecord for my minecraft servers x)
16:49 < o_be_one> 3€/month :D
16:50 < o_be_one> and laxa_work what you do you ?
16:51 < o_be_one> EastBite, you see this option on your side ?
16:51 < EastBite> yes
16:52 < o_be_one> ok so maybe deen can do that too
16:52 < o_be_one> the forced mode use more bandwidth cause it check ALL packet
16:52 < o_be_one> but it make your network safer against ddos
16:56 < laxa_work> I host bunch of shits on my dedi, like TS3 server and TW servers
16:58 < o_be_one> nice, which gametype of tw laxa_work ?
16:59 < Savander> impossible ;/
16:59 < Savander> 39.69 GB of 2 TB Used
16:59 < Savander> no way
17:00 < Savander> When xd
17:00 < o_be_one> Savander, what are you talking about ? Oo
17:00 < Savander> on my VPS
17:00 < o_be_one> at ovh ?
17:00 < Savander> i don't have nothing special
17:00 < EastBite> 2tb vps?
17:00 < Savander> and servers have 2 weeks
17:00 < laxa_work> yeah, 2tb vps lulz

17:00 < Savander> but no no
17:01 < Savander> bandwidth
17:01 < Savander> xD
17:01 < EastBite> ah
17:01 < o_be_one> not unmetered bandwith ?
17:01 < laxa_work> o_be_one: I host : race / ddrace / zcatch laser / inQ servers
17:01 < Savander> Bandwidth	39.69 GB of 2 TB Used / 1.96 TB Free
17:01 < EastBite> looks like unlimited
17:01 < Savander> no
17:01 < laxa_work> o_be_one: ddracepro.net/status
17:01 < Savander> xD
17:01 < o_be_one> laxa_work, you have players on the ddrace ?
17:01 < laxa_work> not really xD
17:01 < Savander> and its weird
17:01 < laxa_work> but I dont really take care of them anymore
17:01 < o_be_one> Savander, ovh.de so ?
17:02 < o_be_one> cause france and canada are unmetered ...
17:02 < Savander> no
17:02 < Savander> filemedia.de
17:02 < Savander> ..
17:02 < o_be_one> oh ok
17:02 < Savander> server in frankfurt
17:02 < Savander> its CloudVM
17:02 < Savander> new virtualization or smth
17:02 < Savander> idk
17:02 < Savander> xd
17:02 < o_be_one> lol
17:02 < Savander> but looks great, and i have no lags
17:02 < o_be_one> maybe openvz :D
17:02 < Savander> no 
17:02 < Savander> its kvm
17:02 < Savander> but in cloud
17:03 < o_be_one> they say cloud when its running virtualization system ...
17:03 < o_be_one> and its clustered
17:03 < o_be_one> well there is ddos protection in it ?
17:04 < Savander> don't know
17:04 < Savander> sorry :p.
17:04 < EastBite> I don't think there are any differences between vps providers and clouds
17:04 < o_be_one> ok, seem to be not bad ^^
17:04 < o_be_one> EastBite, just backup/snapshot are different ive seen
17:05 < EastBite> ^ yes maybe
17:05 < Savander> DDForce is hosted on this..
17:05 < o_be_one> with a "cloud" thing you must have something with 99.9% SLA ... no problem possible with that ... we hope :D
17:05 < Savander> and i haven't seen problems yet
17:05 < o_be_one> DDForce ? what this :o ?
17:05 < Savander> my servers :p
17:07 < o_be_one> ah ok maybe i need to try it :)
17:07 < laxa_work> empty ddrace servers
17:07 < laxa_work> like mine
17:07 < o_be_one> ill search this night ^^
17:07 < o_be_one> oh ok :(
17:07 < o_be_one> too bad
17:08 < o_be_one> i host only 1 ddrace server with map vote
17:08 < o_be_one> and 1 ddrace server with a dedicated map, but there is never someone
17:10 < Savander> i host, ddrace, zcatch, openfng
17:10 < Savander> zcatch and openfng most played xD
17:10 < Savander> iCTF, and vanilla types
17:10 < laxa_work> 5 more minutes and gooooooooooooooooooooooo
17:11 < o_be_one> i have an openfng setted by fisted and noone plays on it :'(
17:12 < Savander> yester day
17:12 < Savander> i had 16/16
17:12 < Savander> on fng :P :D
17:12 < Savander> to night
17:13 < o_be_one> awesome :D !
17:14 < o_be_one> i have a canadian ovh server, i must host 1 or 2 blocker >.<
17:14 < laxa_work> block is shit
17:15 < laxa_work> boring gameplay
17:15 < laxa_work> it's for noobs mainly
17:16 < laxa_work> going back home, don't flood to much please :P
17:17 < EastBite> don't expect any shitstorm here
17:31 < EastBite> I love android development
17:32 <@deen> Really?
17:32 < EastBite> NOPE
17:32 <@deen> it looked very painful
17:32 <@deen> I'm so glad I could just steal the TW port for android
17:32 < EastBite> my internal storage fills while dev
17:32 < EastBite> well I'm not going to touch the tw android thingie :D
17:35 < o_be_one> tw android is hard to play lol
17:35 < o_be_one> laxa_work, i love block :'(
17:38 < Savander> boring for me
17:38 < Savander> but yes, block is really popular
17:38 < o_be_one> i love it :D
17:38 < o_be_one> i waste all my time on blmapV3ROYAL ... Stupid shit ^^
17:38 < EastBite> I never understood it
17:39 <@deen> i don't understand block either
17:39 < o_be_one> you cant like if you cant block
17:39 <@deen> I love to help people
17:39 <@deen> not block them^^
17:39 < o_be_one> ahah deen thats why many wants to block me
17:39 < EastBite> on join you get pulled by some noob into freeze and that's it
17:39 < o_be_one> i help everybody everytime :D
17:39 < o_be_one> (without cheat, im never logged in lol)
17:40 < o_be_one> maybe thats why i like blocker ...
17:41 < o_be_one> cause it needs every time help
17:41 < o_be_one> and sometime i have body guards lol
17:46 < o_be_one> well when you come first in a blocker, all will block you
17:47 < o_be_one> but when they remember your name, you are like their friends so theyll dont block you, they have to many players to block already
17:47 < o_be_one> and this start a team play, so you help "your friends" every time ... And their friends comes your friends, etc.
17:47 < o_be_one> sometime there is traitors :D
17:47 < o_be_one> but its funny :)
17:47 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=407
17:48 <@deen> New tournament announced
17:48 < EastBite> what about the GER one
17:49 <@deen> no tournament on GER
17:50 <@deen> rest of the world only
17:50 <@deen> but FRA should be fine
17:50 <@deen> o_be_one: i can't login @ ovh.com/manager
17:50 <@deen> i think you need a real ovh account for that, not kimsufi
17:51 < EastBite> kundenkennung: mk*****-ovh
17:51 < EastBite> does kimsufi have seperate accounts?
17:51 <@deen> yeah, mine ends with -ks
17:51 <@deen> not -ovh
17:51 < EastBite> hrr
17:52 < o_be_one> deen, possible, but i have some ndds too, maybe its thats why. I dont know the ks panel
17:53 <@deen> well, shit
17:54 < o_be_one> have you somethign to manage ip on ks panel ?
17:54 < EastBite> back then the cheap dedi plans weren't even presented as kimsufi
17:55 <@deen> yes
17:56 <@deen> but the only setting there is reverse dns entries..
17:56 < EastBite> no "enable firewall" ?
17:56 <@deen> no
17:57 < o_be_one> oO curious
17:57 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/kimsufi.png
17:57 < o_be_one> new gen ks :(
17:58 < o_be_one> ok :(
17:58 < o_be_one> seen the screenshot i see you cant
17:58 <@deen> you need ddos-protection pro for what you describe
17:58 < o_be_one> i havent it, but my ks is 1 year old
17:59 <@deen> i guess they removed that then
18:00 < o_be_one> yes im reading the about, they mark "forced mode" as not available :(
18:00 <@deen> where do you read that?
18:01 < o_be_one> http://www.kimsufi.com/de/about-ks/
18:01 <@deen> yeah, shit
18:02 < o_be_one> i go eat
18:02 <@deen> maybe i should have made an OVH account first, and then bough the KS server =/
18:02 < EastBite> seems like the KS-2 really was the best plan on market last year :)
18:06 <@deen> ok, that doesn't evne work anymore =(
18:06 < EastBite> :(
18:10 < EastBite> deen: do you know what the firewall settings are for?
18:10 < EastBite> it does not on the dedi does it?
18:11 < EastBite> it does not run*
18:11 <@deen> what?
18:11 <@deen> i don't know of any firewall settings
18:12 < EastBite> oh wait, you only had dns reverse settings
18:14 < EastBite> mistake, I somehow thought you had firewall settings but not the "forced mode"
18:17 < EastBite> deen: why didn't you buy multiple KS-1 instead of the KS-4, is there a limit?
18:17 <@deen> and set everything up on every single one?
18:18 < EastBite> sure
18:18 <@deen> seems annoying
18:20 <@deen> also, I'd be afraid that even 1 server on one of them could get laggy when it has 64 players
18:20 <@deen> the KS-4 seems to have 17 times the CPU power
18:21 < EastBite> you think one core 1.8ghz is not enough?
18:21 < EastBite> tw runs in one thread
18:21 <@deen> yes, but on GER with 64 players 1 game can go up to 50% CPU
18:21 <@deen> and that's a pretty strong CPU
18:22 <@deen> Lots of n^2 code
18:22 < EastBite> ye
18:23 <@deen> also, I plan FRA to be only temporary
18:23 <@deen> I'd still prefer to have GER with DDoS protection
18:23 < EastBite> okay
18:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/YN_grw
18:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 dcfe0a7 def: Fix Visual Studio compile
18:24 < EastBite> haha
18:25 < EastBite> I really like how cl.exe behaves on that 
18:26 < EastBite> "syntax error : missing ';' before 'type'"
18:26 < EastBite> you know exactly what's the problem
18:26 <@deen> Haha
18:26 <@deen> Took me a bit to figure out
18:26 <@deen> Especially since I don't have Visual Studio
18:27 < EastBite> vs uses an old C standard
18:27 <@deen> No uploads to the Hall of Fame so far =/
18:27 <@deen> Except for my own :P
18:28 < EastBite> did I miss something?
18:28 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=406
18:28 <@deen> Best runs on maps, which will be made into videos and presented on ddnet.tw
18:29 < EastBite> hm interesting
18:29 < EastBite> another goal which I won't ever reach
18:29 <@deen> What goal?
18:29 <@deen> Making a first rank?
18:29 < EastBite> ya
18:29 <@deen> It's not as hard as you think
18:30 < EastBite> well I was first before :D
18:30 < EastBite> but then "The map has been released for at least 2 weeks"
18:30 <@deen> Choose an obscure map noone likes and train it
18:30 < EastBite> hmm
18:30 <@deen> but i don't know if we still have any obscure maps
18:31 < EastBite> xd
18:34 <@deen> phew, just looked like a ddos was incoming
18:34 <@deen> but i guess someone was just uploading maps to the test server^^
18:35 < EastBite> so uploading a map looks like an attack?
18:35 < EastBite> ah multiple maps
18:37 <@deen> i just monitor the traffic coming in on the server
18:37 <@deen> and it's always very low, except when a map is uploaded or an attack is starting
18:39 <@deen> EastBite: but the idea isn't bad
18:39 <@deen> to get multiple small servers instead of one big
18:40 <@deen> the GER server really gets hammered when it's full like now
18:40 <@deen> 40% CPU on all 6 cores
18:41 < EastBite> lol
18:45 < EastBite> I wonder how many players a modern cpu core can handle
18:46 <@deen> with the current algorithms?
18:47 <@deen> you could also fix the sourcecode and make everything faster
18:47 <@deen> I guess 100-150 could work
18:49 <@deen> so hm, still working on this client crash bug
18:49 <@deen> something is overwriting the sprites
18:49 < EastBite> you were talking about players crashing ddnet clients?
18:50 <@deen> no, it's a server
18:50 <@deen> that's crashing the clinet
18:50 < EastBite> okay
18:50 <@deen> on Windows at least
18:50 <@deen> on Linux I get weird graphics
18:51 <@deen> how would i find out what's overwriting the data? =/
18:51 <@deen> afk
18:51 < EastBite> hmmmmm
18:53 < laxa> deen: should advertise the hall of flame on servers :p
18:54 < EastBite> deen: is this bug only ddnet client related?
19:06 < o_be_one> im back
19:07 < o_be_one> EastBite, at online they was the "dedibox kidechire" @ 3€/month, it was 1 month ago
19:08 < o_be_one> ahah seriously tw use nothing on a poor vps i have made :D
19:08 < EastBite> where is online?
19:09 < o_be_one> deen, let me host your FRA 64 slots if you want.
19:09 < o_be_one> online is a french competitor of ovh
19:09 < o_be_one> the second best hoster in frannce
19:09 < EastBite> and it's hard to find because of his name xd
19:09 < EastBite> srsly
19:10 < o_be_one> online.net ? lol
19:10 < EastBite> find that on a search engine ;)
19:11 < laxa> Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
19:18 < R3Routed> hello deen!
19:18 < EastBite> hi R3Routed 
19:18 < EastBite> deen is afk right now
19:19 < R3Routed> ok i have question about updating server may i ask?
19:19 < EastBite> sure
19:20 < R3Routed> i added dbg_enable_threaded(); to server but when i run server all texts in console windows loops!
19:21 <@deen> hi
19:22 < R3Routed> hey deen
19:22 <@deen> R3Routed: do you use Windows?
19:22 < R3Routed> yeah
19:22 < laxa> deen: 2 issues, first on upload of halloffame, apparently Sickcunt encoutered an "invalid" thing.
19:22 <@deen> R3Routed: why do you add dbg_enable_threaded by hand?
19:22 <@deen> it's already enabled in ddnet server
19:23 < laxa> deen: then on your Art of Movement demo, I got an error, seems like I don't have the map
19:23 <@deen> laxa: yeah, some characters probably don't work
19:23 <@deen> have to rename the filename a bit to remove weird stuff
19:24 < R3Routed> i did every thing correctly that were in commits! 
19:24 <@deen> EastBite: no, all clients are affected by the bug i think
19:24 <@deen> R3Routed: i don't understand what you're trying to do
19:24 <@deen> R3Routed: just download from github and it works
19:24 <@deen> don't add changes by hand
19:25 < o_be_one> well as worst player you can have, there is captain_teemo and vali ...
19:25 < laxa> deen: I got this launched your Art of movement demo : "map differs from the server. 8eac1440 != 7767be44"
19:26 < laxa> don't highlight pm please, I am recording now
19:27 <@deen> oh wait, the petjack is already online^^

19:27 < R3Routed> i downloded src(4.9.1) from git and make some changes on it,every things works correctly, and today when i updated it from commit i confront this problem 
19:27 <@deen> oh shit, and art of movement too
19:28 <@deen> forget my videos then^^

19:29 <@deen> R3Routed: when you download from github directly, does it work?
19:29 <@deen> R3Routed: and what servers are you running? I've never heard of you
19:29 < R3Routed> for version 4.9.1 yeah 
19:29 <@deen> no, from github, most recent version
19:29 <@deen> without your changes
19:29 < EastBite> no audio?
19:30 <@deen> audio sucks!
19:30 < R3Routed> i didnt test current version yet
19:30 <@deen> i haven't had audio in teeworlds for a year
19:30 < EastBite> lol I really need it
19:30 <@deen> i only need for ictf
19:31 < EastBite> btw. I think it's not worth it to fix client crash bugs
19:31 < EastBite> there are too many ways to crash the client
19:31 <@deen> EastBite: but a mapper lost their map =/
19:31 <@deen> because of it
19:31 < EastBite> lel
19:31 <@deen> as i said, shit community
19:31 < EastBite> but
19:31 <@deen> Welf said he was mapping something, and then the server admin decided to kill his client
19:32 < R3Routed> is it possible to being some changes in master src and they dont register in commits?!
19:32 <@deen> R3Routed: don't think so
19:32 < R3Routed> :\
19:33 <@deen> R3Routed: you are with Persian Pro?
19:33 < R3Routed> i did every things step by step but...
19:33 < R3Routed> persian pro???
19:33 <@deen> so it works with current github version?
19:33 < R3Routed> whats that
19:33 <@deen> Persian Pro also runs a custom DDNet server with their own changes
19:34 <@deen> and without any mention of it being based on DDNet^^
19:34 < R3Routed> my server is private , i run it on my game net pcs
19:34 <@deen> ah, ok
19:34 < laxa> deen: I have a minor problems, people can't send mail through ts.ddnet.tw
19:34 <@deen> laxa: of course not
19:34 < laxa> it seems my server reject it
19:35 <@deen> don't do mails with ts.ddnet.tw please
19:35 <@deen> setting up mail properly is difficult
19:35 < laxa> doesn't point towards my server ?
19:35 <@deen> why would you even want that?
19:35 <@deen> it makes no sense to have mail addresses for teamspeak
19:35 < laxa> lol
19:35 < laxa> ts.ddnet.tw = IP of my server
19:36 <@deen> not for emails, no
19:36 < laxa> so, TS has no relation with it
19:36 < laxa> oh
19:36 < EastBite> deen: still... just tell the mappers to not play on foreign servers while mapping
19:36 <@deen> anyway, i don't understand this
19:36 < EastBite> als to save often
19:36 <@deen> EastBite: i'd prefer to fix it, but this seems hopeless
19:36 <@deen> something is just overwriting memory
19:36 <@deen> and the admin won't help me even though he knows how it works
19:37 < EastBite> I know atleast 2 ways to crash the client
19:37 < EastBite> and there are a thousands more
19:37 < R3Routed> for updating server i just have to make changes for server files .h /.cpp files or both of server and client?!!
19:37 <@deen> no
19:37 <@deen> R3Routed: also system.c
19:37 <@deen> and there are some more shared modules
19:37 < R3Routed> system.c and system.h and server.cpp
19:38 <@deen> do you do the changes by hand? have you tried git's automatic merging?
19:38 < R3Routed> no i mean files that are in client folder in source
19:38 <@deen> yeah, you shouldn't need to change files in client directory
19:39 < laxa> deen: I'll have a demo for Naufrage 2 #1 !
19:39 < R3Routed> yeah i did it by hand , i had problem with C89 standard for compiling with visual studio i fixed it but still doesnt work
19:39 < laxa> deen: but maybe this HallofFame thingie should be on /motd or something else, so people know :)
19:40 < R3Routed> clients can connect to server , but texts at console loops! :|
19:42 <@deen> laxa: I plan to do that, but first we need to get a few videos
19:43 <@deen> better to show the finished product than just talk about it
19:43 <@deen> RedFight can send you 20 demos for Solo
19:43 <@deen> Gridwyn too
19:44 < EastBite> I can help encoding :D
19:44 <@deen> R3Routed: i also fixed the c89 standard thing
19:44 <@deen> R3Routed: maybe it works now?
19:45 <@deen> Hah, found the reason for the crash!
19:46 < EastBite> u did?
19:46 <@deen> i think so
19:46 < EastBite> where is it
19:46 <@deen> or maybe i didn't
19:46 <@deen> i think the weapon number is -1
19:47 < R3Routed> yeah i see the fix after i fix problem , i used your fixed code to but result was same !
19:47 <@deen> but the client shouldn'T accept Weapon < 0
19:47 <@deen> weird
19:49 < R3Routed> if set client weapon to -1 client fucked up :D i tested it before
19:49 <@deen> R3Routed: how can you set it to -1?
19:49 < R3Routed> in character.cpp
19:49 < R3Routed> 1 min
19:50 < R3Routed> m_Core.m_ActiveWeapon = -1
19:51 <@deen> Thanks!
19:51 <@deen> Just did the same, crashes me
19:51 <@deen> and gives me the same bugs!
19:52 <@deen> hah
19:52 < EastBite> interesting
19:52 < R3Routed> i think its possible to fix this bug at client isnt it?
19:52 <@deen> yes
19:52 <@deen> just ignore everything < 0
19:52 < R3Routed> yeah
19:54 <@deen> R3Routed: about your problem, do you have the source code online somewhere?
19:54 <@deen> so I can try it out?
19:55 <@deen> or you could just disable the threaded message writing
19:55 <@deen> then it should still work
19:55 < R3Routed> all of src file?
19:55 <@deen> yeah, like on github
19:56 <@deen> But seriously, does the client not check these values anywhere?!
19:56 <@deen> m_Weapon should never be -1
19:56 < R3Routed> hmm no i dont have it on online site
19:56 < EastBite> as I said, the client is really vulnerable
19:57 < R3Routed> when i makes threaded function as command my problem gone 
19:57 < R3Routed> threaded logger makes performance better?
19:58 <@deen> R3Routed: yes
19:59 <@deen> oh lol
19:59 <@deen> they clamp the values, but don't use the clamped values at all!
19:59 < R3Routed> for adding threaded logger we should update 3 files? right? system.c system.h and server.cpp
19:59 < EastBite> deen: where?
19:59 <@deen> R3Routed: right
19:59 <@deen> EastBite: everywhere...
19:59 <@deen> EastBite: the clamp is never done
19:59 < EastBite> wut?
19:59 <@deen> never saved* i mean
20:00 <@deen> let me check if vanilla does the sam
20:00 <@deen> maybe it's my fault
20:00 <@deen> nope, vanilla also does no clamping
20:00 < R3Routed> i copied all of system.c and system.h from master src in git and just add 1 line to server.cpp dbg_enable_threaded();
20:00 < EastBite> is it in the network protocol?
20:01 < EastBite> ClampInt("m_Weapon", pObj->m_Weapon, 0, NUM_WEAPONS-1)
20:01 <@deen> Exactly
20:01 <@deen> ClampInt returns the clamped value
20:01 <@deen> but nothing is done with the returned value
20:02 <@deen> or do i look at the wrong ClampInt?
20:02 < EastBite>  22     if(Value < Min) { m_pObjCorrectedOn = pErrorMsg; m_NumObjCorrections++; return Min; }
20:02 < EastBite>  23     if(Value > Max) { m_pObjCorrectedOn = pErrorMsg; m_NumObjCorrections++; return Max; }
20:02 < EastBite>  24     return Value;
20:02 < EastBite> Min or Max is returned
20:02 <@deen> yes
20:02 <@deen> and what happens with the returned value?
20:02 < EastBite> oh
20:02 < EastBite> you are right
20:02 <@deen> this is really funny
20:03 <@deen> no wonder everything crashes so easily!
20:03 < EastBite> we should contact matricks about that
20:03 < EastBite> this is really funny
20:04 <@deen> see, it's still worth investigating crashes
20:04 < EastBite> that was luck :P
20:04 <@deen> I'd bet this fixes half of all crashes :P
20:04 <@deen> of course it's luck
20:05 <@deen> but when searching for crash reasons i sometimes read through 20 files and find 10 other possible crashes^^
20:05 < R3Routed> all of works that i have to do is update system.c and system.h and add 1 line in server.cpp?? (final question about this problem...)
20:05 <@deen> R3Routed: yes, i think so
20:05 < R3Routed> thanks
20:05 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/49682f4a8dc9d8dc1fc6d82ec0195f1ea6077ea3
20:05 <@deen> Like here
20:07 < EastBite> I guess they expected ClampInt to take the value by reference
20:08 < EastBite> nvm
20:08 < R3Routed> i did all of them but i dunno where is problem :| , some times c++ forced me to suicide! :|
20:08 < R3Routed> thnks deen Cya

20:08 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3439fef def: Fix clamping in network objects to prevent many crashes
20:08 <@deen> R3Routed: ok, bye. thanks for your help!
20:08 < EastBite> return ["ClampInt(\"%s\", pObj->%s, %s, %s);"%(self.name,self.name, self.min, self.max)]
20:09 < R3Routed> yw
20:09 < EastBite> k
20:10 <@deen> EastBite: so, how do we tell the TW devs?
20:11 < EastBite> just open an issue and post the link in #teeworlds
20:11 < EastBite> also highlight matricks :D
20:11 <@deen> hm
20:12 <@deen> I think i fixed more vanilla related bugs and never reported anything
20:12 < EastBite> ya I know :)
20:12 < EastBite> the 0.7 branch is nothing combared to yours
20:12 < EastBite> except of the tons of ddrace features
20:13 <@deen> what do you mean?
20:13 < EastBite> the ddnet base is less vulnerable then the master branch of tw?
20:13 <@deen> yeah
20:15 <@deen> well, attacks on Vanilla server are not as bad as on 2 hour long ddrace maps
20:16 < o_be_one> 2h long map omg :o !
20:18 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ranks/brutal/#map-At_Sundown
20:18 <@deen> At Sundown, average time 271 minutes
20:18 < EastBite> deen: we could test something on the tournament
20:18 <@deen> some players played over 10 hours
20:18 <@deen> EastBite: yes?
20:18 <@deen> "    Im hear highlight sound, but its not normal "piiiip" but its "pop", im think u know ;D. Im hear sound.. from team in normal TW, this "pop", im need normal highilgt sound from normal TW. Im deleted cfg, downloaded new DDnet, but anything working."
20:19 <@deen> This guy... He told me for weeks his sound isn't working and now this is the whole reason
20:19 < EastBite> :D
20:20 < EastBite> deen: we could gather some kimsufi servers and use them as udp proxy to your server and keep its ip hidden
20:20 <@deen> EastBite: yeah, but ping would be higher
20:20 < EastBite> since they are in the same datacenter there is no delay
20:20 <@deen> ah
20:20 <@deen> and why would we do that?
20:20 < EastBite> multiple ips for one tw server
20:21 < EastBite> so attackers have to take down 4 ddos protected servers
20:21 < EastBite> when using 4 proxys
20:21 <@deen> yeah, would be interesting
20:21 < EastBite> and we could analyse the attacks
20:21 <@deen> i guess that would also be the advantage of using 4 smaller servers
20:21 < EastBite> in the same datacenter^
20:22 < EastBite> o_be_one wanted to help you and I can offer mine too
20:22 <@deen> I just wanted to try if this 1 would do fine
20:22 <@deen> maybe the ddos protection is good enough, we will see
20:23 < EastBite> yep, let's see
20:23 <@deen> how do you compile tw 0.7??!!
20:23 < EastBite> didn't try it a long time
20:24 <@deen> ah
20:24 <@deen> bam game
20:24 < EastBite> xd
20:24 <@deen> before i make a pull request i should at least test it^^
20:27 <@deen> I'm not sure if it's correct
20:27 < EastBite> hm I'm on master branch and only have version 0.6.2
20:28 < EastBite> strange
20:31 <@deen> Maybe the client/server should instead ignore invalid packets
20:31 <@deen> i don#t know
20:31 <@deen> but why would you clamp then?
20:31 <@deen> You could as well just throw an error
20:33 <@deen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1264
20:33 <@deen> but i think instead they wanted to use the unpack_check somewhere but forgot that
20:34 < EastBite> maybe
20:34 <@deen> because an error message is set, but used nowhere
20:39 < EastBite> I guess matricks will mention something like this ^
20:40 <@deen> yeah, but meh
20:40 <@deen> this is important enough that i will release in a few minutes
20:40 <@deen> can do a proper fix later
20:42 <@deen> bor: Persian server is really laggy =/
20:42 <@deen> i think that's the main reason people don't play there
20:51 <@deen> phew
20:51 <@deen> just a moment before releasing i realized that the windows client broke^^
20:52 <@deen> it's the threaded console output but i don't understand why
20:52 <@deen> it loops, just like R3Routed said
20:53 <@deen> R3Routed: haha
20:53 < R3Routed> :|
20:53 < R3Routed> :D
20:53 <@deen> R3Routed: I just discovered that I have the same problem as you!
20:53 <@deen> But only on Windows
20:54 < R3Routed> yeah
20:54 <@deen> text messages also loop for me
20:54 < R3Routed> i tested it now
20:54 <@deen> so, what's wrong here? =/
20:54 <@deen> it seems like the locks don't work
20:54 <@deen> on unix they are pthread mutexes
20:55 <@deen> on windows critical sections
20:55 <@deen> maybe they work a bit differently?
20:55 < EastBite> didn't you do something on logging recently?
20:55 <@deen> yeah
20:55 <@deen> i made it threaded
20:56 <@deen> and that doesn't work on Windows
20:56 <@deen> the locks don't seem to lock strangely
20:56 < EastBite> ah
20:56 <@deen> at all
20:56 < R3Routed> locks works on windows correctly i think , i tested it on memberlist
20:56 < R3Routed> for writing user records on file
20:57 <@deen> hm, but that's the only part that's different than on UNIX or not?
20:57 < R3Routed> hm idunno exactly i dont see all of code still
20:58 < R3Routed> i try to compile src on windows with mingw , it compiles correctly but anti virus detect it as virus :D
20:58 <@deen> yes, i know^^
20:58 < R3Routed> why?
20:58 <@deen> stupid virus detection!
20:58 <@deen> they don't like mingw i heard
20:59 <@deen> i could try using semaphores instead of locks
20:59 < R3Routed> locks cuase loops problems?!
21:00 <@deen> I think so, yes
21:00 <@deen> it's the only part that's different on Win than on Unix
21:00 < R3Routed> u used boost libs for sql right?
21:00 < R3Routed> u can use boost libs for threading !
21:01 <@deen> i could, but i don't want to
21:01 <@deen> now i implemented my own threaded queue, could ahve used boost as well :P
21:01 < R3Routed> built-in system  is better ^^
21:01 <@deen> but boost is only needed for sql and noone runs ddnet with sql
21:01 <@deen> better to keep it like this
21:02 < R3Routed> but if there isnt boost folder in source we cant use server_sql_release isnt it?
21:02 <@deen> you need boost installed yourself
21:03 < R3Routed> i dont have installer i just have archive of it (zip/tar)
21:04 < R3Routed> you write logger's code your self?
21:04 <@deen> yeah
21:05 < R3Routed> i got this errror on my win xp x86 : unknown endian
21:05 < R3Routed> for leatest src
21:05 <@deen> oh
21:05 <@deen> what's that?
21:05 < R3Routed> i dunno
21:05 < R3Routed> its for engine.cpp file
21:07 <@deen> but i changed nothing there recentl
21:08 < R3Routed> yeah i know
21:08 < R3Routed> i dunno whats the reason for this error
21:08 < R3Routed> it loops 
21:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/hxXSUg
21:12 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 1c8ca26 def: Use semaphores instead of locks
21:13 <@deen> R3Routed: new try, maybe it works now
21:14 < R3Routed> u tested it?
21:15 <@deen> no
21:15 < R3Routed> ok 
21:15 <@deen> it still works on linux
21:15 <@deen> windows takes long to compile for me, so i have to wait a bit
21:16 < R3Routed> ok i test it now and say result
21:16 <@deen> hah, it works!
21:18 < R3Routed> yeah 
21:18 < R3Routed> nice work
21:19 <@deen> but i don't know why
21:19 < R3Routed> u used semaphor instead
21:19 <@deen> yes, but why do locks not work?
21:19 <@deen> for me a lock is just a semaphor with 0 and 1
21:20 < R3Routed> for you yeah but not for operating system ! :D
21:27 < o_be_one> omg AWS North America down guys ...
21:27 < o_be_one> no more amazon, ebay, netflix ...
21:28 <@deen> oh no, there are no semaphores on mac os x...
21:28 < EastBite> haha
21:29 < EastBite> hahaha
21:29 <@deen> not funny!
21:29 < EastBite> :(
21:31 < R3Routed> is it possible to fix this problem with #ifndef and WINDOWS FAMILY? semaphore for win and mutex lock for other
21:32 <@deen> yes
21:32 <@deen> but do i really want this?
21:32 < R3Routed> is it any other way?
21:33 <@deen> this stuff is so ridiculous
21:33 <@deen> So POSIX defines the interface for semaphores, but not what they're supposed to do, so Mac doesn't implement them
21:33 < R3Routed> as i know locks should works on windows too but i dont know why it doesnt now !
21:34 <@deen> noone runs servers on mac anyway
21:34 <@deen> i'll just make it non-threaded
21:36 < R3Routed> you mean that delete threaded logger from server?
21:36 <@deen> i remove it for mac only
21:36 < R3Routed> aha
21:36 <@deen> and leave it for windows and linux
21:38 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/K_5a2w

21:50 <@deen> Finally released
21:50 <@deen> Test please
22:37 < laxa> deen: I think you broke something
22:38 < laxa> I play ddrace right now, and my personal timer isn't displayed.
22:38 < laxa> Only the time of serevr
22:41 <@deen> where?
22:41 < laxa> on top of the screen
22:41 < laxa> it displays time of the server on the map
