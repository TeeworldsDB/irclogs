07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <conny> my game jumps to 144fps after like 10-20s. I can get back to 1000 by tabbing out-in. Bug?
07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <conny> latest version. These are the settings

07:37 < s_ssss> hello
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @conny maybe SDL thinks that you are not actively in the game. Try cl_refresh_rate_inactive 0
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i cant turn off chat notifications in editor right? \:(
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> dont make maps in-game
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You always have the oddest feature requests that I can't imagine anyone else ever using
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> just use /dnd chillerdragon
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah right
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> gerdoe ðŸ§ 
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @fokkonaut\: when add /dnd in fddr
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lmao
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, why is dnd a server command anyway?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> germany voting today :monkalaugh:
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I regret the day I installed mono on my server, what an absolute mess of a project
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> C#
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it has hastag in the name it must be trending
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ye it sucks hard
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c# itself sucks
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant install mods on linux for kerbal space program
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder who'll take the win, SPD was performing very well in the latest polls after the greens destroyed their lead
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because mono has some bug
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why dafaq u know ger politics?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there any anti-europe political leader in germany that has chances?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that would be hilarious
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz germany is the heart of europe right
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chillerdragon did u vote
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> watfak
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Wat
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Politix
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well chiller u should know german politics are kinda important for europe as a whole
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i sok politics
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I enjoy politics in general, I like the EU, Germany is like technically the EU, so it's natural I follow their politics ðŸ˜„
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Politics sok
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Usually
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i didnt vote yet
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you don't vote I'll bonk you, people not voting is the cancer of modern democracies
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh well
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes there just isnt any good option
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lately i feel like that here
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in germany they have proportional representation, there is always an option
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless you are a nazi, nazi parties aren't allowed, so I can see there not being an option in that case ðŸ˜›
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> proportional ye, but for example catalonia is way more progressive minded than all other spain regions, and since we belong to spain at the end of the day we cant do shit
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fueller> people who do not vote are apparently not interested in their future
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/TheFckngSameMa1
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love this twitter account
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't look into spanish politics much, but if you have proportional representation at the country scale, you absolutely can vote for more progressive candidates
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \/parties
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spanish politicians that say they are "leftist" (but i consider them far right) are against catalonia as is
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing is
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being anti-catalan brings lots of votes
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from spain
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so they are all anti catalan
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Being pro-catalan is probably political suicide ngl, supporting a technically separatist movement is such an extremely dangerous move
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/891665981527695390/unknown.png
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it funny
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how catalonia
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is always different color
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the election results
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ultimately we cant change anything
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nsdap :troll:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (catalonia is top right)
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> we know ryo
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe u dont
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know russia
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or ur country
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cataluns are right-top wing :trollq
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :troll:
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :admiralMC:
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey polit jokes are too unfunny
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> without troll emoji
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The situation in spain seems very unworkable to me, I honestly don't know what should be done with these enclaves in different countries
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 spain should be more federalist and it would work more
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they are focused on being rly centralized
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is spain a federation atm?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we have "autonomous communities"
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> that's the main problem then
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ultimately everything goes through madrid
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the main gov
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we cant do major laws
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it's pain in ass to move into federation from unitary country
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> look at ukraine with their maidan
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also being federation means there can be some wars in country
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Federations are just not popular, that's the issue. Even suggesting the notion in turkey lost erdogan 10%. In the UK just the possibility of an alliance with SNP lost Labour a lot of vote in worker towns
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like chechnya in 90s russia
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeai  just want independence
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and also tatarstan
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but we outmoved them with our own constitution kekw
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You want independence, but is it really feasible? Doesn't Catalonia generate a vast majority of the economic income for Spain?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we do and they treat us like shit xd
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no way they will let you go, so I think the goal should be more to make federal structures more popular amongst the mainstream
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant change them from inside
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they collectively go againstu s
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> kill 'em :troll:
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any democracy wont help here
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they always using the excuse "lets vote for catalan independence but in all spain not just in catalonia"
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdddd
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> just make your own polls
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like russia did with that land in urkaine
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we did make one ilegal referendum and got beaten by police while going to vote
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bruh
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was there
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then im getting why cataluns have separatists thoughts
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You most definitely don't have the gun power or the man power to get out. You don't have popular support from outside Spain creating pressure. The only way I can see it happen is changing peoples minds
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well some people think russia may help us
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since russia wants to create havoc
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in europe
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they are wrong xd
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe doesnt putin like to meddle with europe
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> meddle?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what would have been great? Scotland leaving the UK and joining the EU on their own. That would set a nice precedent, maybe some global recognition for separatist movements
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nice word never seen that one kekw
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "create political instability in europe"
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wai a second
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there is no profit in making that shit
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah all catalan pro indep support scotland obviously
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk bro
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> catalonia
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is in a position
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ehe? There is enormous profit in that shit. Increase tensions inside the EU so the eastern block aligns/trades with you
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> between spain and france
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a rly good point for geopolitics
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they are anyway working with russia more
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Having satellite states is immensely profitable
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this cant happen, nobody in Europe would support that
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but since we have no good prom just interrupting in eu will make nothing
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> prom?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> France cant support this as its equivalent to shooting itself with its own independentist (Corsica & Brittain)
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> *industry
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Ryozuki: what about going ETA ðŸ˜„ ?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mean convincing the political elite, they have their own goals. Convincing the people is what is important. With time anything is possible
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes i have thougths about some bombs would do good :monkalaugh:
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats after getting beaten by police just for going to vote
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone would hate them
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly dont know them
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they rly like beating catalans
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they send police all from spain
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> give them some cocaine
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let the rain start
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A federal europe would be such a good idea, but the political elite don't want to give up power, and their huge propaganda arms spend millions on convincing the public that federation = bad
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so is beating a national sport?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ppl from their cities yell
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "a por ellos oeoeoe!!
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka "go for them!!!"
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as if they were going into a war
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hilarious
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when the police leave their own cities
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/hilarious/awful ? ðŸ˜„
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to come to catalonia
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe Catalonia is their traning camp ðŸ˜„
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM_e_RvXsik
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> proof
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "a por ellos"
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when police was leaving their own city
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> imagine federation for small countries kekw (without ethic small provinces in it tho)
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to come to catalonia
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chinese do the same too, they use police forces from different parts of the country to suppress riots in others. It's a very very efficient strategy
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> USA do the same
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they use white people to beat black people
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> very efficient ðŸ˜„
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> off-topic kekw
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah its better to bring brain washed ppl by local media to the place where they tell u they do all bad things
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> that's how politics work ryo
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love hierarchical structures. Federated countries, in federated blocks, in a greater federal europe would be amazing imo
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt germany federated?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast thats my impression
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> only if ppl will be good tho
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> people don't want to loose their national identity
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or it will become in corruption with russia sizes
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they like symbols, and federation remove symbols to a newer upper being
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/891670022345351228/unknown.png
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that they don't know and fear
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but making federations means to make new states with national identity
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> depended on territory
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what identity would you make for Europe?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> murica is a federation :monkalaugh:
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they still feel pretty murican
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean they can keep their own identities? The US states are a great example at how federations can work, it's not perfect by any means but it works enough that some states can even ban abortions
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do you think tatars are russians or tatars are tatars?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> because they weren't anything else before
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer to being called european than spaniard
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or bashkirs are russians?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> States got to keep a lot of power while being part of a federated structure
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is there any multi lingual federation in the world?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> tatars?
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A more integrated example is the UK, Scots still have their own identity, so do the Irish. I don't really get where the fear of losing your identity comes from
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> catalans have  their identity too, but its becoming less, the way to lessen it is to send more ppl from the mainland there , eventually ppl dont learn the local language, culture, etc
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not familiar with any. Maaaybe if you stretch the federation definition a lot, China could be considered one with the Hong-Kong autonomous region speaking a different flavour of Chinese
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> making federation -> group territory with national identity of ppl that live here
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> canada
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, maybe Switzerland?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They speak 3 languages, and they are extremely federated
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and if you are not talking about oficial languages then russia counts too
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> official*
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> china is unitary country
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @gerdoe what are the other languages spoken in Russia?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i will just drop list here
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did say stretch the federation definition a lot ðŸ˜„
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wait a minute
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8#%D0%A7%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> seems like this
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can't find normal formatted list
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 152 langs
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> http://jazykirf.iling-ran.ru/list_concept2020.shtml
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wow, are these more like variations on Russian or proper different languages?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they're all part of different branches of langs
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> slavic languages as czech, bulgarian, ukrainian, belarusian, slovac, polish are variations of old-old slavic language
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and russian ^

21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :poggers:
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> relying on sqlx concerns me, but I'll take a look ðŸ˜›
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dont think sqlx is that bad
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what problems u had
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but after using it for months its p good
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not that bad, but it might inherit the problems I've been having with it
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what problems
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works fairly well as long as you only support a single db and don't rely on the offline mode
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i knew it
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never used Any i just chose a db like 99% of cases
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u always do weird stuff
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is wanting to support any db a bad thing?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hard
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and most of the time you want to choose 1 db
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and optimize ur queries for it
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That would be the killer feature for me, ngl the compile-time verification doesn't excite me very much
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At that point i'd rather just use a library to support the singular db choice I have
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not useful at al
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz with sqlx u already feature gate the db drivers
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u are only compiling what u want
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is it not useful though? It's as useful as sqlx minus the compile time verification stuff
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well less useful
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually kinda like the compile verified queries
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> What is the reason we cant reconnect unlimited times to a server and we get timed out?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> ...i mean if the server is full
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you are stressing network with your reconnects
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> afair there was topic on teeworlds.com where dune said to client modder to delete reconnect function
