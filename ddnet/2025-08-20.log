02:27 < bridge> <teero777> is it possible to turn off the `demo_recorder` and `ghost_recorder` log messages? they are super annoying when filtering logs
02:27 < bridge> <teero777> is it possible to turn off the `demo_recorder` and `ghost_recorder` log messages? they are super annoying when looking at logs ingame
07:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Because they restart on race failure? Sounds like a skill issue
08:01 < bridge> <Assa> they restart on finish as well, super annoying if you hunt a 10 sec race map
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> well I'm playing race xd
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> 59/60 tries are respawns because I'm not perfect
08:07 < bridge> <teero777> Well actually every try is a respawn
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning x86_64 kernel devs and vulkan devs and others
08:56 < bridge> <Assa> good morning ^.^
08:56 < bridge> <Assa> at what point am I a vulkan dev?
08:57 < bridge> <Assa> does making a single shader and expanding one buffer command count? I guess yes
09:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ‚ú™ any chance you could quickly check if https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10706 is broken? otherwise i would merge it in pretty soon
10:09 < bridge> <Assa> > You marked this as resolved? Looks unchanged ü§î
10:10 < bridge> <Assa> 
10:10 < bridge> <Assa> Look at me overwriting my own changes because I worked from 2 different PCs and force overwrite my change :pepeW:
10:12 < bridge> <Assa> what should be broken about it? it doesn't introduce new code, just splits one class into two and adds the header
10:13 < bridge> <Assa> tested ingame, and renders maps
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's more than 20 loc
10:26 < bridge> <Assa> This week I don't have a small LOC PR for you üôÅ I know I still have my weekly token, but chiller is too fast merging all my small PRs
10:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> u have done so much for ddnet-rs xd
10:39 < bridge> <Assa> I have a question, should particles be rendered over the foreground or over the physics layer?
10:40 < bridge> <Assa> because currently particles go over everything and I am not sure if they should do that or all should do that
10:42 < bridge> <Assa> hmm explosions should go over, freeze I believe not, ninja should go over, bremsspuren schould go under (or even stopped by solids)
10:44 < bridge> <Assa> I believe we already have that, death animation also doesn't go through walls, but is rendered over it huh
10:46 < bridge> <Assa> guess it's fine as is
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> May I introduce to you ‚Äîforce-with-leash idk if it even helps if your the author on both xd I never used it
10:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> E `‚Äîforce-with-lease`
10:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> L ios uses gpt minus instead of double minus bru
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it's an em dash and it would be correct if not for chat gpt's overuse
10:54 < bridge> <Assa> fixed it btw
10:54 < bridge> <Assa> I noticed even before you wrote me
10:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hi ‚Äî Ewan how are you today ‚Äî sir
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> that's not correct
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it can pretty much be used in place of a semicolon
11:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hi, Ewan how are you today, sir
11:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @mpft: can I use it to terminate C++ statements?
11:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> `int a = 2‚Äì`
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> im pretty good
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> about to go to bed

11:27 < bridge> <whitest_duck> why i have to do this
11:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @fokkonaut: I think the friend class feature is smoother than the \#define private public hack xd basically has the same result and git conflict surface
11:27 < bridge> <whitest_duck> cant i just talk to admin
11:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> where a deen
11:28 < bridge> <Assa> you mean moderator, admin mail is for more important things which need admin permission

11:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @whitest_duck: you are welcome
11:36 < bridge> <whitest_duck> especially Assa
11:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you block again I won‚Äôt unban you this fast!

11:36 < bridge> <Assa> :justatest:  you're welcome
11:36 < bridge> <whitest_duck> Thank you for putting up with my stupidity so long Assa
11:37 < bridge> <whitest_duck> i wasnt blocking but OK
11:37 < bridge> <Assa> they all say that
11:37 < bridge> <whitest_duck> i was looking for my friend
11:37 < bridge> <whitest_duck> then a guy attacked me
11:37 < bridge> <Assa> I wasn't hacking, I was just using this undocumented unsecured api endpoint
11:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> WHO was the moderator?
11:37 < bridge> <whitest_duck> he frozed himself and i was trying to defend my self
11:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Let‚Äôs get him fired
11:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds like abuse
11:37 < bridge> <whitest_duck> thank you guys again bye üòá
11:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Happy blocking my friend
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> can a moderator check on him in the servers?
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> can a moderator check on him in the servers? :kek:
11:41 < bridge> <whitest_duck> guys Is using bad names a reason for a ban
11:43 < bridge> <Assa> absolutely
11:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao you can grant read access to public repos?
11:45 < bridge> <whitest_duck> i have a guy in my server
11:45 < bridge> <whitest_duck> his name starts with P
11:45 < bridge> <whitest_duck> i cant say that
11:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @sollybunny: go accept invite so you appear in the GitHub dropdowns
11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs so annoying that GitHub limits the users you can assign to issues or search their prs and all that kinda stuff. All the drop downs only have like 3 names you can chose and they are the owner of the repo
11:46 < bridge> <whitest_duck> do you guys want to ban him
11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I will talk to him @whitest_duck
11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A team of moderators is investigating your matter!
11:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh maybe that‚Äôs the role I had in ddnet. The one that was pretty op! With like labling open close issues and prs. @sollybunny pls no trolling I trust you souly
11:49 < bridge> <whitest_duck> guys
11:49 < bridge> <whitest_duck> how did you become moderator
11:49 < bridge> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: dont worry i wont troll
11:51 < bridge> <whitest_duck> guys how to be admin
11:51 < bridge> <whitest_duck> i mean moderator
11:53 < bridge> <Assa> first you need to be trusted by the community. Since you have been recently banned, you won't be a mod.
11:58 < bridge> <whitest_duck> oh
11:58 < bridge> <whitest_duck> dang :(
12:00 < bridge> <whitest_duck> not even a small chance?
12:01 < bridge> <whitest_duck> assa can you ban someone i have a blocker in this server
12:01 < bridge> <whitest_duck> he is not in playground im trying to run from him
12:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it multeasymap ._.
12:02 < bridge> <whitest_duck> but he is not in playground
12:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> mods dont really care about blockers there
12:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> u can go into solo and avoid blockers
12:02 < bridge> <whitest_duck> wow
12:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes just solo
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller

12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> you should try tailscale
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> oh public
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> still could work
12:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon (replying to ping)

13:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can also do HEAD^^^^
13:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or HEAD^ multiple times xd
13:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf pure magic
13:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can also get oldest commit hash and do ``git rebase -i 25ee083cc562d0eca4054e35d96f7365beac7ff9^``
13:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then keep first pick and replace all other picks with squash

13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> Date:   Sun Aug 17 15:49:14 2025 +0300
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato>     add a basic readme
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> wall of text
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> i did last 3 commits from github maybe i should have done git fetch or something
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk git
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am 60% sure you want dis. ``git checkout master && git reset --hard 25ee083cc562d0eca4054e35d96f7365beac7ff9`` but go try if log looks good
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** your push  -f deleted it on github xd
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh yes u need to pull before that too
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** once you have the 4 commits again go delete 3 and then ammend
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did it work?
13:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes i now have all the changes in my directory
13:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> now i need to squash
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon YOUR CMAKE IS BROKEN
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat the cmake do
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cant find libs
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did u clone?
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** submodules?

13:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> same build dir
13:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok its better now
13:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have 2 commits
13:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> not 4
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** guys can u stop dos my irc pls
13:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> shit i messed something up again
13:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> now the author of the commit is deen
13:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> xddd
13:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> git-blame-someone-else
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** looks the same to me @soulyvevo 
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so does it to me
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it no build
13:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> im just gonna rm -rf and start over
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat it say
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato use branch btw
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** master bad
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> u must install freetype to compile the ddnet client
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** freetype xd
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (replying to my big block of text)
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that i figured but the text did not fully arrive on irc
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it was too many lines you got the bridge banned
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lmao
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** very lmao
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> after undoing the reset for checking the diff between u and master
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it works
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://tenor.com/view/cat-gif-16258174987336597266
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so its a u issue
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i didnt...
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** souly the cmake breaker
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how
13:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller i figured it out
13:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> stackoverflow did
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato i noticed
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** looks good
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but idk the web repo
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so i cant merge
13:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> git reset --soft HEAD~2  works too
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh yes
13:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> wym u dont know
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also git reset --soft sha
13:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> something can break
13:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> if i add a readme
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can misguide ppl
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** because its actually pyson django not jykelly ruby
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i wouldnt know
13:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> 2 people a year look into that repo
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lemme try ur commands
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hopefully not a backdoor into my pc
13:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> my readme aint hurt nobody
13:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> git commands?
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** readme commands
13:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> oka
13:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> it will barely work
13:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> like 10% of the website will be available
13:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> switching theme also doesnt work xd
13:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so far so good
13:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this jekyll looks good
13:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes see
13:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> im a genius
13:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe i should use it for teeworlds protocol
13:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> or mdbook
13:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> written in rust
13:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how did u figure this out?
13:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> ryozuki commented that the website uses jekyll
13:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> i tried jekyll serve in root directory it didnt work
13:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> cd www
13:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> and it worked
13:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> ez
13:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/issues/166
13:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> one issue less i guess
13:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> trying to serve the entire website would be pure pain
13:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> only deen knows how
13:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller im gonna continue doing prs without ever touching c++
13:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> text maintainer
13:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato i have the feeling deen has to do these commits by hand. They involve ddnet.org rank lookups and complicated math https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/commit/3145b8b23824b1793e4ff3976eceab6bcbf2299a
13:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go write a script for him to create this commit
13:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** takes name and euro amount as input
13:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its basically a security vuln
13:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the deen can be ddosed with 1 euro donations
13:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> xddd
13:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> i wonder how ddnet is still alive with all these scripts
13:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> written in python 2
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We are missing the Facebook employee with python 3 merch
13:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait did u mention that ddnet website uses django
13:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait nvm its not possible
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://youtu.be/LJByWKOcW24
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ruby, python and php?
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Real website
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah pages are generated with python
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> php is used for whatever reason
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> who is gonna lead python 2 -> 3 migration for ddnet
14:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can identify with that lady
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Will drop 0.7 merch soon
14:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh btw not all python scripts are used
14:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet website also relies from libtw2 rust scripts
14:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hacker
14:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Add some C\# component @kollpotato website needs it
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok will do
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> one language/framework per component
14:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I need a deen
14:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I want a tshirt that says ‚Äûwhere a deen‚Äú xd
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> ez design
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407697657194872842/image.png?ex=68a70c1b&is=68a5ba9b&hm=f9bb7756367be8c77636331ae2fbf74f8847e9f3263df19b8512c3ce6c9d1634&
14:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> use mdbook for protocol documentation https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/
14:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> i will contribute more
14:11 < bridge> <Assa> put "where a deen" at the back
14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> i actually did that xd
14:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> didnt want to clutter this channel
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> yeah about that
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 10 @chillerdragon don't clutter this channel so much
14:12 < chillerbot> Helo Assa I will remind you at Wed Aug 20 2025 14:22:29 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
14:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> what did chiller do
14:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> he is a proud and independent maintainer
14:13 < bridge> <Assa> true
14:22 < chillerbot> yo @Assa keep in mind to: @chillerdragon don't clutter this channel so much
14:29 < chillerbot> Elo @chillerdragon I just wanted to remind you that: missing arg
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> hello
14:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> hi anti ddnet dev
14:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> !ping
14:55 < chillerbot> pong
14:55 < kolpotat> !ping
14:55 < chillerbot> pong
14:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller i wonder if i change my name to bridge how will the bot react
14:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont have perms to do that
14:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> :(
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> when you write code and it compiles without error but it contains a bug. And you see where the bug is, and wonder "what in the C++ syntax how does this even compile?"
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> show example
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:01 < bridge> <Assa>         for(int Channel = 0; Channel < 2; ++Channel)
15:01 < bridge> <Assa>         {
15:01 < bridge> <Assa>             const CEnvelopeHandler::CEnvelopeExtrema &Extrema = m_pEnvelopeHandler->GetExtrema(m_QuadRenderGroup.m_PosEnv);
15:01 < bridge> <Assa>             aQuadOffsetMin[Channel] += Extrema.m_Minima[Channel];
15:01 < bridge> <Assa>             aQuadOffsetMin[Channel] += Extrema.m_Maxima[Channel];
15:01 < bridge> <Assa>         }
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:02 < bridge> <Assa>         for(int Channel = 0; Channel < 2; ++Channel)
15:02 < bridge> <Assa>         {
15:02 < bridge> <Assa>             const CEnvelopeHandler::CEnvelopeExtrema &Extrema = m_pEnvelopeHandler->GetExtrema(m_QuadRenderGroup.m_PosEnv);
15:02 < bridge> <Assa>             aQuadOffsetMin += Extrema.m_Minima[Channel];
15:02 < bridge> <Assa>             aQuadOffsetMin += Extrema.m_Maxima[Channel];
15:02 < bridge> <Assa>         }
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> aQuadOffsetMin and Max (lol yet another bug) are arrays and I am adding to the pointer instead of the channel
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Heh, that does happen from time to time üòÑ
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Why isn't it named `pQuadOffsetMin`?
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> or `paQuadOffsetMin` if it's a pointer to an array
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> it's an array reference
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> `bool CRenderLayerQuads::CalculateQuadClipping(int aQuadOffsetMin[2], int aQuadOffsetMax[2], bool Grouped)`
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> not even, it's just an int pointer internally
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> I am going to update rendering one last time big time
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Now I don't understand, an array reference you wouldn't be able to +=
15:09 < bridge> <Assa> this is just an int pointer so pointer arithmetic
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, like this, hm I probably would do `int (*pQuadOffsetMin)[2]` if you want the checking
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, like this, hm I probably would do `int (*pQuadOffsetMin)[2]` if you want the size checking
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, like this, hm I probably would do `int (*paQuadOffsetMin)[2]` if you want the size checking
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> (Yours doesn't enforce the size really)
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think we do it in ddnet code but `std::array<int, 2> &aQuadOffsetMin` is the modern way
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I now know as well, we could touch that here
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> Or `int (&aQuadOffsetMin)[2]` now that I think about it, might even be prettier üòÑ
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> I think the std::array is prettiest ^^ we use it in the same file as well
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> Do we use `std::array` in ddnet code though? I don't think so
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> bet?
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> like I bet it is in for 10‚Ç¨ donation
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> Too late to bet, I checked
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> Jupman used a lot of them in the gfx stuff it seems
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> I would have won anyway, because I put it in as well xD
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> like this is how I build the lookup table for tex coordinates: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d4b7d08b8818c5ead3c1a2b112af1a3ef92e4732/src/game/map/render_layer.cpp#L55
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> (I find `std::array`s to be pretty ugly in general, especially the way they just don't mesh with normal arrays at all)
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> Like passing a normal array to a function expecting a `std::array` has to be the ugliest thing ever
15:25 < bridge> <Assa> in this case I needed an array which is fully filled and known on compile time
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon if we get this one through, I am going to implement quad clustering and then it's gg for rendering, the graphics card can only handle 256 ungrouped quads at a time anyways, removing unclipped clusters will speed up ‚ö°
15:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> blazingly fast linear gameplay
15:33 < bridge> <Assa> the more vram you save, the more skins you can load üß†
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> I should do some benchmarks again between 18.0, 19.0, 19.1, 19.3 and this, will do when 19.4 comes out, so people actually upgrade
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> not to be the guy, but rust arrays/slices are better
15:44  * bridge <Assa> caughs in python
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know if python uses gmp for its unbounded big numbers?
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> the only good thing python has is arbitrarly size nums
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think they arent performant xd
15:45 < bridge> <Assa> java also has BigIntegers but performance is also in the mud
15:45 < bridge> <Assa> imagine just a vector of bytes and you make it bigger on demand and do bit operations on it's normal integer operations on the full vector
15:46 < bridge> <Assa> I bet Boost has something like that
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> gmp is the bigint library
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> most perfomant
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> they use asm too
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> flint maybe
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://flintlib.org/
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.0dc632e9-5de4-4334-8191-5db4b63c765b.png
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki u very much are "that guy"
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know i was making a joke
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> there is a rule, that you can ignore everything before a "but"
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fonni
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dummo
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
15:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa ye its so true
15:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if you have aura you can predict the "but" while someone is being suspiciously nice
15:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and then you say that nothing before a but means anything. Then they continue talking and will stutter when the but comes and you instantly devalued their entire statement
15:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ez conversation pvp skills
15:53 < bridge> <Assa> not with me my friend
15:53 < bridge> <Assa> there is no "but", only facts
15:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** only works in vocal conversation i guess tho
15:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> chicken but
15:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa i think u need another maintainer for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10728
15:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk wat any of that stuff is
15:56 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon you know what a group clip is?
15:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
15:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think xd
15:57 < bridge> <Assa> we already do the same thing for quads, fully automatic
15:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u mean the basic editor clipping feature?
15:57 < bridge> <Assa> yes
15:57 < bridge> <Assa> you have a clip region, X, Y, W, H, and if you're outside of it with your screen it doesn't get rendered
15:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** do you use kaffeine skin btw?
15:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes that much i get about how the editor currently works @Assa but nothing about ur pr xd
15:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** what even are grouped or ungrouped envelopes?
15:59 < bridge> <Assa> I use this one https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1396765951218946108
15:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** discord link
15:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gg
15:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i saw ur skin the pr clip
15:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** reminded me of kaffeine
16:00 < bridge> <Assa> head protection is important, especially when things are under construction
16:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** isnt ``std::shared_ptr`` reference counting or something like that? So basically garbage collector? are you rewriting the client in blazingly slow C++ java ah bloat lang? road to 0fps?
16:01 < bridge> <Assa> A grouped quad layer is, when all the quads have the same envelops and same offsets, this can be used for a huge optimization, see #10340
16:01 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10340
16:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i guess i should learn some C++ to step up my maintainer game
16:02 < bridge> <Assa> road to 0fps? Are you insulting me? everything I did so far improved fps, you improve fps by reducing gpu calls
16:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa is grouped quad and grouped envelope the same or what?
16:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so its not user facing but only technically internally for optimization?
16:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa everytime I see C++ I panic. All the ``std::`` stuff is not the holy C I know and love xd
16:03 < bridge> <Assa> A grouped quad layer, all the quads have the same envelopes, so you can save the envelope in the group instead of checking an individual quad
16:03 < bridge> <Assa> yes

16:17 < bridge> <Assa> I wish we had an dev important channel, where only contribs and maintainers and the github bot would be able to post, so you can ping fore review or ask important things
16:17 < bridge> <Assa> currently this feels more like dev-topic üòÑ
16:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** as long as contrib can post u have a spamming chilor

16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh xd
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon i guess everything important just belongs on github
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this is funzone channel
16:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: this is for issues https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:ddnet/ddnet+type:issue+state:open and this for prs https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:ddnet/ddnet+type:pr+state:open
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ofc the fun stops as soon as you start to question branch naming
16:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> fun stops when heinrich comes back to discord
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon nonono we do 666 issues
16:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 420 is impossible

17:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato come to https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
17:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u have off-topic there
17:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> where does it go
17:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** irc
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> Just create a channel? Quakenet has much space
17:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
17:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 but being alone is scary
17:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** all my homies are on discord
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> It seems the channel on libera is not linked up to the discord, nor the quakenet channel
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> Curious why we didn't just completely move over to libera or just not have a channel on libera
17:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hm?
17:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** quakenet is linked to discord
17:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am sending this from quakenet
17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah u mean libera is disconnected
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> quakenet is, libera isn't
17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye idk
17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** libera cring
17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** same as freenudes was
17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** quakenet is the goated gaming irc
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> no u
17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we probably miss the occasional gigachad dev chatting into libera xd
17:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.0be87797-61b4-42b9-ba69-eba1e86c6530.png
17:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** F this libera chatter
17:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> i can try to figure out how to make a bot in matrix
17:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did swee ever reach us?
17:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> whats swee
17:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the guy who chatted into libera
17:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where nobody listened
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> he looks like he'd be a good dev, if only we noticed he existed
17:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** faak
17:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** WE NEED LIBERA FIXED ASAP
17:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> can i do bot then
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> He seems to have highly distributed personal portfolio page
17:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i like this guy
17:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we did really miss him didnt we
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> and seems to draw furry art, truly never misses
17:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he joined a dead irc thinking the game is dead like many other projects
17:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fak
17:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://swee.codes/
17:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> is this the guy?
17:18 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, hope he comes back around and finds us in discord or quakenet
17:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kolpotat i signed up xd https://git.swee.codes/ChillerDragon
17:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 nope we broke the bridge its on us to find him!
17:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> xddd

17:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> go find him
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> Seems he only ever sent a message in #bugs , I don't think you guys have that available on matrix
17:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://p.swee.codes/sweezeroquotes/cd977035352e49beb6611f051b450cf6
17:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lmao
17:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 we have plenty of bugs on matrix 
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> he is still on this server ._.
17:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller why did u even remember him
17:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> what did he do

17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use it
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill setup forgejo on my home server
17:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and why does compiling a gamemode take so long

18:07 < bridge> <ddneter1488.> Hello everyone, tell me what to do if you've been banned for a nickname for a very long time
18:09 < bridge> <Assa> write a ticket, press ban appeal and explain your situation
18:12 < bridge> <bomab> if the nickname is banned get another nickname
18:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for some reason i feel like there was at one point such a thing as half a hp
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> So I implemented quad clustering on a testbranch, it in some cases it works exceptionally well, in others I see barely a difference
18:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> Now prove it's performance gain
18:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> Now prove its performance gain
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> that's always so much hassle, need to have a demo, collect data beofre and after, compare data üôÅ
18:19 < bridge> <Assa> conceptually it should be faster, because I am culling more quads
18:19 < bridge> <Assa> overhead comes if the culling is not working because I still need to render all
18:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> Theoretical proof*
18:23 < bridge> <ddneter1488.> Is the IP address required?
18:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ??
18:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you're asking about how bans work you should go to #questions
18:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you're trying to use a banned nickname it's very unlikely that it'll get unbanned
18:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg a deen
18:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> DEEN A HERE
18:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :deen_star:
18:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why does hammer damage multiple times?
18:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does it have an "explosion"
18:46 < bridge> <Assa> this is extremely localized, like on Abyss at the start - 100 FPS, anywhere else + 500 fps
18:46 < bridge> <Assa> I can't even do a proper benchmark, I'd need to benchmark multiple demos of proper gameplay
18:49 < bridge> <Assa> what I find interesting, it stabelizes fps a lot
18:51 < bridge> <Assa> left is clustering, right is 19.3, and the clustering graph is much smoother
18:51 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407769141309341716/screenshot_2025-08-20_18-50-08.png?ex=68a74eae&is=68a5fd2e&hm=023f01703c3dd91ffdd53787f1df1d1a30cd8a695bbb390c674bce8ba1018c6e&

18:52 < bridge> <Assa> oh maybe this is because robyt changed how the graphs render
18:52 < bridge> <Assa> can't even compare that <.<
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> So you decreased fps by 100 in some cases :ganyu_scared:
19:01 < bridge> <Assa> this is the crux of culling and optimizing
19:02 < bridge> <Assa> like you implement more culling, but the culling doesn't prevent anything from rendering in some cases, so it's just overhead then
19:04 < bridge> <Assa> I could now play with some render distances, like split a quad cluster if the start and end quad are very far away from each other
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon wake up how do i set skin colors
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im just egtting gray D:
19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is it supposed to be lsh?
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> lhs? Where did you ever see lhs used for anything?
19:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk!?!?!
19:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whatever i try doesnt work and my brain is so squishy i cant figure out the relation
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> What are you trying to work out? Teeworlds colors?
19:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sever ovveriding skin colors
19:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its just "int"
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> It's packed HSL, but you are not directly supposed to manipulate it anyway
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> We have functions for it in `color.h`

19:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats what i got
19:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so why is it GRAAAY
19:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ermm
19:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it works
19:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im so pro
19:49 < bridge> <Assa> I now have 2 magic numbers which magically enhance the fps sometimes
20:10 < bridge> <melon> I 3D printed something at work this week

20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can you 3d print me a bed?
20:11 < bridge> <melon> A total of 40 hour printing time and 5 parts clipped together to charge iPads
20:11 < bridge> <melon> Ok gimme 400‚Ç¨ and 3 months
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gimme your paypal
20:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> i can give u 2 burgers and we have a deal
20:18 < bridge> <melon> A total of 15x7 hour printing time and 5 parts clipped together to charge iPads
20:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> it works tho...

20:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> a bit ugly
20:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> so lovely
20:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> just a bit ugly
20:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> idk if this looks good
20:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407797507882356767/730e5bd35bc991fe.png?ex=68a76919&is=68a61799&hm=1a215fc819c2e29cd08ae0fd5de2eed7308918e8c1789826a05575eb17b47586&
20:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> what if i already have a server running
20:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> and i need another one
20:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> will the button be there
20:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> only shows if none is found
20:47 < bridge> <pioooooo> at least satisfies my usecase
20:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> imo it should be available at all times
20:57 < bridge> <Assa> you still have the start server option on the mainpage, it also doesn't magically spawn 2 local servers, like for what?
20:57 < bridge> <Assa> I think it looks good, at least good enough üëç
20:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> i thought there was a talk about removing run server button from the main menu
20:59 < bridge> <Assa> @pioooooo maybe I'd change the text to "start server" like on the mainpage and not connect a player to it immediately
20:59 < bridge> <Assa> why? I like it, it's simple, I use it a lot (really!)
21:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> no idea maybe i hallucinated
21:00 < bridge> <Assa> on the other side, maybe the mainpage button should be start and connect to a local server
21:00 < bridge> <Assa> on the other side, maybe the mainpage button should be start and connect to a local server and immediately connect you ü§î
21:00 < bridge> <Assa> because why click this button if you don't want to connect to it anyway
21:01 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder if there should be a "server configuration menu" like in other games
21:01 < bridge> <Assa> like a map or gamemode selector
21:01 < bridge> <Assa> thinking of warcraft 3
21:03 < bridge> <justik_nakix> Hi guys, in short, I was playing ddnet, I went away for literally 10 minutes, I come and they gave me a ban, although I don‚Äôt have any cheats, I‚Äôm completely clean, is there any way to unban me, because I was standing there AFK, I come and this is the picture
21:03 < bridge> <justik_nakix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407802213132144670/image.png?ex=68a76d7b&is=68a61bfb&hm=af0787648632e018898176db95d9fbe0177a0aefb04f8c07d81fd08437b46b41&
21:03 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
21:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> do ban appeal in #‚úâ-create-a-ticket
21:04 < bridge> <Assa> oh if you lied I'll personally make your ban longer
21:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> but u are not a mod
21:04 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't stop me
21:07 < bridge> <justik_nakix> can you clay the ticket?
21:08 < bridge> <melon> wat
21:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> wat
21:10 < bridge> <justik_nakix> I say look at the unban ticket, I was banned for nothing
21:17 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh didn't see chat
21:17 < bridge> <pioooooo> put it as is for now
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> I went through the list and this are the results:
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> - Mud: 19.3: ~800 fps, Nightly-w-quadclusters: 4500 fps
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> - Gummy: 19.3: 4300++ fps, Nightly-w-quadclusters: 4500++ fps (hard to tell very unstable)
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> - Atomic: 19.3: 4200 fps, Nightly-w-quadclusters: 5K+++ (the game is unsure but a lot)
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> - Victory 2: 19.3 1300 fps, Nightly-w-quadclusters: 3400 fps (what the heck is this map doing?)
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> - run_world_war_zero: 19.3: <700 fps , Nightly-w-quadclusters: 4600 fps (hard to tell, bit unstable)
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> 
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> it appears only Abyss seems not to benefit a lot :thonk:  the rest looks extremly good
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> run_world_war_zero on nightly-w-quadclusters but ogl1: 300 fps, deep mud
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> run_world_war_zero on nightly-w-quadclusters but OpenGl1: 300 fps, deep mud
21:29 < bridge> <learath2> That's actually quite interesting that Abyss seems to be the only regression. But those numbers look very good
21:29 < bridge> <learath2> GL1 regressing is a little concerning. People who have to use GL1 already use toasters
21:29 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently doing a draft PR if you want to take a look
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> Could you check whether the gl1 regression is across the board independent of map?
21:30 < bridge> <Assa> this is not a regression
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> ogl1 did never go much up
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> it doesn't benefit from all of this optimiztions
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> this optimizations work so well, because I minimize gpu calls, which I can't do for ogl1
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> Ah I may have misunderstood you there, I thought you meant gl1 lost 300fps there
21:34 < bridge> <Assa> no it **has** 300 fps :justatest:
21:35 < bridge> <Assa> this sounds so weird i know, 4.6K on vulkan vs 300 fps
21:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how do i set who the killer was, just using Die() with a custom id doesnt show the kill msg
21:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> NVM I AM MORON
21:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hoiwdo i make the kill weapon a hook
21:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or is that a client feature
21:51 < bridge> <Assa> this is a client feature
21:51 < bridge> <Assa> you kill sb else with "weapon_world"
21:51 < bridge> <Assa> but ddnet client should just show nothing as weapon
21:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i see, i think there should be a specific "hook" weapon
21:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to distungish between magic and hooking them into spikes
21:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how infclass client does it
21:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hope it isnt just using the next items downwards
21:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and has picked some random numbers to avoid collision with future
21:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or even better different netmsg
21:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i couldnt be bothered to check tho lmao
21:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Instead of reading the FPS graphs (which influence FPS), you can start the client with `connect localhost; benchmark_quit 30 benchmark_mapname.txt` while a local server has that map to test on it. Then let the client run for 30 seconds without touching it and the frametimes will be written to the file.
22:01 < bridge> <Assa> I know, I made a benchmark guide in one of my other PRs
22:02 < bridge> <Assa> but my time is limited, it's currently only a draft PR and real benchmarks with graphs are hard and take time
22:02 < bridge> <Assa> especially since it depends on another one which is not merged
22:05 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs if you're interested, I made a small benchmark method thing [here](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10081#issue-3001946643>)
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we should write a small script to generate benchmarks on a list of maps
22:06 < bridge> <Assa> it's best to benchmark on demos btw, because you always render the same things
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> Something like `./quick_bench.py "Multeasymap" "Back in Time 2"`
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> It could support demos too, hm I might give it a quick go
22:07 < bridge> <Assa> and then? You also need older clients to compare
22:07 < bridge> <Assa> hmm actually, with an automatic download script ü§î
22:08 < bridge> <chairn> just rebuild them no?
22:10 < bridge> <Assa> maybe
22:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He chatted on dead irc
22:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea sounds reasonable
22:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont get pinged in embeds
