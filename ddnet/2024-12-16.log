00:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ wake?
00:43 < bridge> <teero777> Hi chiller
00:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur still here?
00:44 < bridge> <teero777> I'm in bed
00:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> me too!
00:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to wake up and find some coffee
00:44 < bridge> <teero777> xdd
00:44 < bridge> <teero777> Where tf do you live xd
00:44 < bridge> <teero777> what time is it?
00:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 7:44 bali
00:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dox
00:49 < bridge> <teero777> wow
00:49 < bridge> <teero777> 0:50 in german
00:49 < bridge> <teero777> dox
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> hi
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> 5:00 pm colorado
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> dox
02:32 < bridge> <StormAh~> Is it possible to got server uptime atm?
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> $ddos
03:26 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> !ddos
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> type /ddos
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesn't even show uptime actually
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like it did :<
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> idk in that case
04:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I sometimes add commands to the server that either do not work or crash the server when put into a config or passed as a cli argument.
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> That makes sense and is fair because the console should execute these commands early so that configs can affect the initialization process. But sometimes i want to run something on server start that depends on initialization.
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> After running into that problem multiple times and having to come up with some weird workaround every time i finally solved it once and for all in ddnet++ introducing the rcon comamnd ``defer s[command]`` which allows the user to delay commands until the server is intitialized.
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734320958.png
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if this has a chance of getting merged into ddnet ill gladly open a pr if not i rather not waste my time on discussions
04:50 < bridge> <StormAh~> that's sadge ;c
05:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Maybe commands could always be executed after init?
06:11 < bridge> <tailung0054> /login HenTai pideras
06:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut yea i also thought about that. Configs in the beginning and commands in the end. But ``defer`` is more flexible because i also had config chains that would crash on server start. Which of course should never happen but sometimes i just cba while testing.
07:02 < bridge> <teme10_> what EUR?
07:42 < bridge> <vappy19> Ope
09:12 < bridge> <tasnet.seller> !ping
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pong
10:42 < bridge> <teero777> 64 bytes from chillerdragon: time=3,000,000 ms
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> had a look at the ddnet protocol today. Am I seeing this right? DDNet did remove the null bytes for the reflection attack protection that teeworlds has?
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo @teero777 go check simplex
10:50 < bridge> <teero777> I can't on phone xd
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> I don't have it connected to the same db
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> I'm home in 4hrs
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea tragic i have it phone only clearly we both suck at using simplex
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> xd
10:52 < bridge> <teero777> All the data is stored on a local db right? So copy pasting that onto the other platform should work
10:52 < bridge> <teero777> Will check later xd
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its probably a matter of scanning one qr code
11:09 < bridge> <.mogant841> –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–π—Ç–µ –≤ –∫–ª–∞–Ω [KBK]–∏ –±–ª–æ–∫–∞–π—Ç–µ –≤—Å–µ—Ö –Ω–∞ 4nubs —Å —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–∫–æ–π
11:15 < bridge> <teero777> I hope so
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wazzup
11:53 < bridge> <teero777> chiller wtf do you live near git git?!
11:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No not near :D but same island
12:01 < bridge> <teero777> what language do you speak there?
12:01 < bridge> <imilchshake> Rust
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> English like a proper tourist
12:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> Btw do you see emojis and/or reactions to messages? :owo:
12:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not in irc
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so what's the matter
12:08 < bridge> <teero777> chiller do pidgeons exist in bali?
12:08 < bridge> <imilchshake> :feelsbadman:
12:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In matrix I see this
12:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh wait I can‚Äôt send images from matrix ‚Ä¶
12:08 < bridge> <imilchshake> At least they are decently named hehe
12:08 < bridge> <teero777> lov u chiller :iubwibfasibfi2141ahs:
12:09 < bridge> <imilchshake> :hsisgejssvssjey_rust_Xd:
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 5seconds i despawn again, then you need to resummon me
12:09 < bridge> <imilchshake> Damn these new ddnet emojis
12:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah
12:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I was wondering why u didn‚Äôt merge the pr
12:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> SVG
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt know if he fixed your stuff
12:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I didn‚Äôt understand that the reply to (null) was for me ^^
12:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt recall seeing any why?
12:15 < bridge> <teero777> nothing I was just imagining a city without pidgeons
12:15 < bridge> <teero777> weird
12:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We got lots of stray dogs
12:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> Chiller when invite me over for beach?
12:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> I just follow you after Munich meetup
12:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sure I know a cool beach in Munich
12:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> :poggers:
12:27 < bridge> <teero777> can the dogs fly tho
12:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Flughunde
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller will your subs get a 2024 recap this year?
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with you programming on the beach you went ever day
13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ I will try
13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Okay after looking at 0.6 a bit i have finally found my new favorite network protocol! Its not 0.7 and its not ddnet! Its 0.6.5!
13:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The flag packet flag shifts in 0.7 were totally random and unecessary. The ddnet token extension with magic bytes and bytes slapped at the end of the packet are random adn unecsssary. Everything was solved in a clean and backwards compatible way in 0.6.5
13:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> i gave up on understanding how the protocol works
13:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> :cammo:
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i recommend implementing it from scratch in a different programming language every 2 month it helps getting to know it
13:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> understanding it bit by bit is important if you want to boost your gores gaming skill
13:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i would really like to have a community submissions part in the video this year. Want to contribute a recording of your setup?
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you mean my hardware, or my desktop?
13:52 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon "T = flag token (0.6.5 only not supported by ddnet)" but "0.6.5: ORNCT-AA" has T?
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs yes ddnet is not 0.6.5
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its using dinosaur 0.6.4 technology
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ just take some short clip where we can see some tees and something behind the screen
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like this https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734266940.png
14:14 < bridge> <kebscs> ah the english is just weird then "only not supported by ddnet" hard to understand what means
14:14 < bridge> <kebscs> ah the english is just weird then "only not supported by ddnet" hard to understand what it means
14:14 < bridge> <kebscs> thought T is not supported by 0.6.5 and its atypo
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes my english is not the yellow from the egg
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller i still have a north korea whiteboard magnet that i could put into the back lmao
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318210196836847686/image.png?ex=67617e6a&is=67602cea&hm=2bbe5d5f32643652b72a98d9ea2899476cf5c92a05caf6902830e1e3eef5409b&
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah i could think about smth
14:53 < bridge> <teero777> just in case korea attacks this is your get out of jail card
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lol
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: i hope this suffices
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318222912704086026/5404575881244042018.jpg?ex=67618a41&is=676038c1&hm=35f9d2fa7a90c3a6d76ef96b66bb5b8f35b56827542d68d4dfc99bddb54c7511&
15:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> nice magnet
15:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Oh no it's an official Rubik's brand
15:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (and a Quest 3 but I can't complain about that wholeheartedly because I know other things are expensive)
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also have a speedcube, but it's missing faces
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318224238993215500/image.png?ex=67618b7d&is=676039fd&hm=f1b2dc9755dbc7e2e50916dd6140899f4fe42c5fa805d688a7075d8875312378&
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the rubiks is untouched since like 12 years üòÑ
15:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you care at all you should get a new one, they've come really far and are a joy to use
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I stopped doing speed cubing 12 years ago xd
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is probably also the age of this cube
15:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't really practice at all anymore but I still often pick up my cube and solve it, using it kinda like a fidget toy
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think i cannot solve it with the fast algos anymore xD
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how old r you @inv41idu53rn4m3 ?
15:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 25
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> make video of how you solve it üò¨
15:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh no...
15:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not very fast
15:56 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> @jupeyy_keks best lighting submission so far but also only an image .\_.
15:57 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> could you make it a short video?
15:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also which name would you like to be credited under?
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf what kind of video do you expect
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just some slight movement of the same thing
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno just credit me as jupstar xd
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to make it more dynamic than just a picture
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use ai
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can do that tomorrow or smth. the light isnt good enough in germany anymore
16:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> its a beautiful day today wdym
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's getting dark already in north of germany
16:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dark side of germany

18:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: if i wanna implement a teeworlds server, does that mean that i have support both 0.6 protocol (even partially) and 0.7?
19:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you wanna implement a server for Teeworlds players (with DDNet client considered secondary) then you support 0.7
19:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you wanna implement a server for DDNet players then you support 0.6
19:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Only if you wanna be especially nice to all clients do you support both
19:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at least this is my opinion

19:14 < bridge> <DDNet> Hi! Most of us communicate in English. If you‚Äôre having trouble with English, use <https://www.deepl.com/en/translator> to help you out.
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok then i do 0.6 so it works for both
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> thank you smart man
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 0.7 works for both
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> hmmmm
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> the problem is
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> i cant distinguish the packets
19:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> like connless exists only in 0.6?
19:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 0.6 only works for DDNet and old versions of Teeworlds
19:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> the only problem i have is connless
19:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> im not sure how to parse the packet header correctly
19:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> and then send a correct reply
19:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> for some reason the connless id and response token are mixed
19:28 < bridge> <zhn> no
19:28 < bridge> <zhn> afair the have some difference in their header
19:34 < bridge> <isowner> hi, my game crashing when i‚Äôm connecting to the game, i‚Äôm debugged, this occurs due to variable that contains it:
19:34 < bridge> <isowner> vec2 localpos = m_pClient->m_PredictedChar.m_Pos
19:34 < bridge> <isowner> i think he does not containing anything at that moment(due to not having time to load)
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> what client do you use though?
19:44 < bridge> <isowner> default ddnet client(sources from ddnet github)
19:52 < bridge> <zhn> master branch with last commit crashes too?
20:05 < bridge> <lolkildal> Does db.ddstats.org/graphql work for anyone, or am i just dumb? because every query i try fails. and is that an official source or not?
