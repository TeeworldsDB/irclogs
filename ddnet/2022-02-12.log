11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> deen when issue 4572
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Found this in my news feed.
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://github.blog/2022-02-11-getting-started-with-project-planning-on-github/
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Idk maybe was mentioned above, but thought I would post
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I have found like no information about how to start coding for ddnet.
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Even if code is open source, documentation should be more accessible.
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Website does not link to any hack/dev guide.
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Even wiki has no dev section. 
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Teeworlds.com has a Docs section, in which you find some dev advices.
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> At least some gems like edgarluque's guide could be linked inside a ddnet.tw/dev page.
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Even indexing wiki or forums tutorials links in one dev page would be very helpful for beginners.
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Isn't there like a small documentation about what role each class is for?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Wohoo you could prob look at chillerdragon's videos
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Ah nvm it's on tw vanilla, not ddnet
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> system.h is documented
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Wohoo https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Resources#Blog_Posts https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Resources#Documentation
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> here you can find some documentation about various things
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki make sure your blog posts gets linked somewhere ðŸ™‚
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki make sure your blog posts get linked somewhere ðŸ™‚
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are in the wiki link patiga sent
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> glad u liked them :D
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> what a buried treasure is: https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Resources ?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I could not understand the this page importance from wiki.
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Cmon it's near trashmap link :feelsamazingman:
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> And github page has no doc section too
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> what a buried treasure is: https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Resources ?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I could not understand this page importance from wiki.
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Cmon it's near trashmap link :feelsamazingman:
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah there is not much info
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea I agree the resources link should get more visibility
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> My video series is using the teeworlds vanilla code. But I do mention everything that is different in ddnet. So technically you could follow along and if a video is not working at all in ddnet code I mention that
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@ReiTW)
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @ReiTW yeah so @Wohoo ^^^
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah so @Wohoo ^^^
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Your YouTube teeworlds programming  playlist does not seem to appear in the wiki page
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> are we still working on the SVG implementation? if so, are there any images i can try to accurately form an SVG out of?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sure we currently try to have all images in the data directory as SVG
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so we can add a high res option @Voxel
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for mapres and skins would be nice to make them accurate as you say, for GUI stuff personally i'm also ok with redoing them, just the formats(width, height) have to fit
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im going to try and tackle the map res ones. they seem kinda fun to do
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice \:D
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Quick question- Does anyone know what font is used for basic_freeze here?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/942115118316138506/unknown.png
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if you need to know for making it hi res i wouldn't worry about that part
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> alright
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well then basic_freeze and sun are done
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tho idk how to  remove the export path in an svg
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesn't rly matter
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and imo you could spend your time with better things but if you want to remake a bunch of mapres then have fun lol
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean, are other people already doing this? or
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yes
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> we can do it
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> it's more a reminder, but the CI would fail anyway, so it's fine ðŸ˜„
