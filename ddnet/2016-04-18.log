10:26 <@deen> eeeee: want to hear something funny? Our Chilean hoster now blocked access to DDNet's own database server
10:30 < Gabee_> deen: how did it happen?
10:31 < Gabee_> Are they censoring the network access to some places?
10:45 <@deen> Gabee_: they have an ok connection in-country, but in Chile it's difficult to get a good line out of the country
10:46 < Gabee_> So is it low/slow or really cut off?
10:46 <@deen> it's extremely slow, often packet loss, cuts off entirely for a few minutes
10:46 <@deen> and I guess their method of living with this is to block the ips that cause the most traffic
10:47 <@deen> which happened to be eeeee's http://teewebs.net/ and now DDNet's DB server
10:54 <@deen> that's what you get when you choose the cheapest hoster in a country I guess
10:58 < Gabee_> not really the cheapest in a country
10:58 < Gabee_> but you have to add south america in the variables :P
22:36 < eeeee> lol, did they also send an abuse report claiming that database server attacks it with sql query responses?
23:54 <@deen> no idea, the ip was just unreachable and every other ip i tested was fine
23:54 <@deen> after I reported it they immediately fixed it and claimed they had never blocked it :P
