01:39 < cris272> hey, is it impossible to set sv_test_cmds to 1 while the server is running ?
01:44 <@deen> indeed, cris272 
01:44 <@deen> to prevent cheating
01:45 <@deen> you have to set it to 1 in the config
01:45 <@deen> and then the server is called TestDDraceNetwork
01:45 < cris272> and still register ?
01:45 <@deen> it still registers
01:45 < cris272> ok thx
01:48 <@deen> you're the cris from ingame, right?
01:50 < cris272> yes
01:50 < cris272> tblue mouse
01:50 <@deen> it's about the p2z servers?
01:50 <@deen> =)
01:50 < cris272> yes
01:52 < cris272> i would test a map, but i could not change the settings on my server for enable cheat.whereas settings was correct on my home server
01:53 < cris272> i did not map since a while, so i thought i forgot how enable cheat :D
01:53 <@deen> good that you're mapping again!
01:53 <@deen> and no, i just made enabling cheats impossible
01:53 < cris272> :)
01:53 <@deen> otherwise i would cheat on ddnet all the time when i see poor players fail after 3 hours
01:53 < cris272> lol
01:54 <@deen> now i always have the excuse "i can't enable cheats"
01:54 < cris272> but on old DDRace mod, if we enabled cheat, time was not saved
01:55 <@deen> oh, i think i didn't know about that
01:55 <@deen> or it wasn't working 100%
01:55 < cris272> maybe
03:29 <@deen> EastByte: EUR CPU load can't be trusted at all. It shows 20% even though none of our processes is doing anything. I think that's a VMware thing. Performance still seems to be fine though from an initial look. Have to see how it is with full servers. Also, I can't sync ddnet github repo, maybe we should enable tcp to 9418
04:24 < eeeee> huh why 9418 when you can sync over ssh (with pubkey auth)
04:30 < eeeee> i think github only exposes https and ssh, not 9418 git
06:58 <@EastByte> I'll open https
07:00 <@EastByte> hm I won't be able to access the manager until 4 pm :/
10:16 < laxadedi> Oh man, <3 The Beatles !
10:16 < laxadedi> Hi everyone :).
11:05 <@deen> EastByte: it's not a problem
11:10 < Savander> hi
11:19 <@deen> hi
11:23 <@deen> eeeee: git is also exposed, i usually use it when i need read-only access

16:06 <@EastByte> hello
16:07 < cris272> hello
16:20 < laxadedi> Hello EastByte <3
16:21 < laxadedi> Is it me, or 90% of developpers are really dirty ?
16:21 <@EastByte> dirty in coding?
16:21 < laxadedi> coding like shit I mean
16:21 <@EastByte> yea
16:21 < laxadedi> for example
16:21 < savander> im shit
16:21 < savander> in real life
16:21 < laxadedi> correctly fixing a method in C#
16:21 < laxadedi> the guy use "var" everywhere
16:21 < laxadedi> instead of string...
16:21 < laxadedi> var can replace any type and will adjust to the type in C#
16:22 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!

18:00 <@deen> EastByte: i've found out why I can't access /proc/net/dev as a user: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8955724/regular-user-cant-read-proc-net-dev/16921848#16921848
18:01 <@EastByte> ah
18:01 <@EastByte> hm have you tried screaming for a while?
18:02 <@deen> ^^
18:03 <@heinrich5991> =)
18:05 <@EastByte> deen: but you haven't had this problem neither on kimsufi nor at HH right?
18:05 <@deen> right
18:05 <@EastByte> no ovh kernel used there?
18:05 <@deen> but HH runstheir own servers, so no ovh kernel
18:05 <@deen> and kimsufi isn't a virtual machine
18:06 <@EastByte> hm atleast the ovh arch linux runs a custom kernel
18:06 <@EastByte> (kimsufi)
18:06 <@deen> oh, strange
18:38 < xRoThx> o_be_one: 
18:38 < xRoThx> Are you here
18:39 < xRoThx> I strongly advice you to change your Administrator password. Cyril is abusing. It is not the first time that I saw that. Uses invisible, and move me with TeePull to the freeze
18:39 < xRoThx> He also has a kind of special command that makes his username in another color
18:40 < xRoThx> and then he is insensitive to freezes and has like endless hook thing
18:40 < xRoThx> Eventhough you probably know and don't really care, He is abusing. Not good 
18:58 <@deen> hi xRoThx|Afk.
19:00 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: https://www.flickr.com/photos/zipckr/4580812339/
19:00 <@heinrich5991> there's always someone looking down at oneself and thinking how shitty one programs
19:02 < laxa> I am not saying I am at the top
19:02 < laxa> but using var for every variable in C# is quite awful
19:02 < laxa> don't you think ?
19:03 <@heinrich5991> I don't know C#, sorry.
19:03 < laxa> well
19:03 < laxa> instead of doing string toto;
19:03 < laxa> you can do var toto;
19:03 < laxa> well
19:03 <@heinrich5991> will that infer the type or will it be typed at runtime?
19:03 < laxa> infer I think
19:03 < laxa> I am not sure when it's done
19:03 <@EastByte> compiletime I guess
19:04 < laxa> not sure, since it's suppose to be used when you don't know what type it's going to be
19:04 < laxa> so I guess runtime
19:04 < laxa> or maybe both
19:04 <@EastByte> I don't think cli allows that
19:04 < laxa> but you can do that : var toto = "toto";
19:04 < laxa> but then, it's really bad
19:05 <@EastByte> why is it bad?
19:05 < laxa> you would like to maintain a code where every variable is typed "var" ?
19:05 <@EastByte> in languages like rust or nimrod you don't need to specify the type either
19:05 <@deen> nimrod!
19:05 <@heinrich5991> rust!
19:05 <@EastByte> both!
19:05 <@heinrich5991> that's what I think, at some points it's useful to not repeat the type
19:05 <@deen> it depends, sometimes i write the type to make it clear, sometimes not, because it's obvious
19:06 <@heinrich5991> CVeryLongClassName *pClass = new CVeryLongClassName(); vs auto *pClass = new CVeryLongClassName();
19:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: you're coding in nimrod?
19:07 <@deen> so far only a few libraries and this: https://github.com/def-/nimrod-unsorted
19:07 <@EastByte> he held a talk about nimrod in 2008 iirc
19:08 <@deen> EastByte: that was 2014 but thanks :P
19:08 < laxa> 2008 oO ?
19:08 <@EastByte> ogh
19:08 <@EastByte> well
19:08 < laxa> it would have looked younger on the video EastByte :p
19:08 < laxa> *he
19:08 <@EastByte> yea
19:09 <@deen> that reminds me that i need to fix my bigints library for nimrod =/
19:10 < laxa> EastByte: 21-06-2014
19:10 <@heinrich5991> deen: link to the talk?
19:10 <@deen> it's not that good
19:10 <@deen> the slides are ok though: http://felsin9.de/nnis/nimrod/nimrod-gpn14.pdf
19:11 <@deen> (and in german)
19:15 < laxa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_(programming_language)
19:15 < laxa> <_<
19:15 <@deen> Yeah, I know. They said my talk wasn't serious enough
19:15 <@deen> so it didn't count as a source :P
19:21 <@heinrich5991> deen: in fact, I've seen the slides before
19:23 <@heinrich5991> deen: can you give me a link to the talk?
19:23 <@heinrich5991> (despite you not liking it)
19:28 < laxa> It's easy to find
19:29 <@heinrich5991> he sent me the link
19:45 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: what do you think about nimrod?
19:45 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: not sure yet, the only thing I really noticed is that it seems to be very small
19:46 <@heinrich5991> still browsing
19:46 <@EastByte> ah
19:48 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: what do *you* think about nimrod?
19:50 <@EastByte> hmm
19:52 <@EastByte> for me it's a nice "replacement" for C
19:53 <@EastByte> feels a bit like python and platform independent dev is fun
19:53 <@EastByte> I wanted to keep using it for local projects
19:55 <@EastByte> mostly because I hate header files and external build systems
20:06 < Wohoo> hi all
20:06 <@EastByte> hi
20:07 <@deen> hi Wohoo 
20:08 < Wohoo> hi deen,
20:08 < Wohoo> were you not convinced about pull request? :D
20:09 <@deen> not quite
20:09 <@deen> and i think it had a bug
20:09 <@deen> but i had to quickly fix a more important bug, so i reverted it
20:12 <@deen> i think when you locked in a team and killed, sometimes not all players were killed
20:12 <@deen> with your pull request
20:13 < Wohoo> mmm.... i cycled all over. However you can check again later if you want :)
20:13 < Wohoo> deen: what about add a Minimize button top right corner near Quit, Setting, Editor?
20:14 <@deen> doesn't windows have a minimize button?
20:14 <@deen> or whatever window manager / operating system you use
20:14 < Wohoo> not in full screen
20:15 <@deen> i don't think it's necessary
20:15 <@deen> in full screen people use alt+tab or win+d
20:15 < Wohoo> and bind m minimize doesn't work in server browser
20:15 <@EastByte> oh there is a minimize command
20:15 <@deen> i didn't know either
20:15 < Wohoo> in my linux machine both shortcut doesn't work :(
20:16 < Wohoo> is it normal that bind works only ingame?
20:16 <@deen> yes
20:16 <@deen> oh right, i can't get out of fullscreen programs in linux either^^
20:16 <@deen> but i never run anything fullscreen
20:17 <@deen> just a borderless window at the size of my screen
20:18 < Wohoo> i use Mate, it was fine with borderless windows in Mate 1.6, but Mate 1.8 seems bugged
20:18 < Wohoo> bottom panel bar stays on top
20:19 <@deen> hm, that's bad. no idea =/
20:19 < Wohoo> i want to say that maybe it is a common problem
20:20 <@deen> any other opinions?
20:20 < Wohoo> F1 -> min -> TAB -> ENTER :D
20:22 < Wohoo> i report it as a cosmetic bug. nothing serious of course. however i yet added a button for my local version :P
20:23 < eeeee> var in c# behaves mostly like auto in c++ (i.e. compile-time)
20:25 < eeeee> and c# IDEs (msvs) would usually have a clippy which gives you protips on when you should use var
20:25 <@heinrich5991> :)
20:26 < eeeee> like 'var str = "IM A STRING";' is good coz it's obvious that type is a string
20:26 < eeeee> but 'var obj = IDontEvenWhatTypeThisReturns();' is bad
20:28 <@deen> ddos incoming
20:29 < eeeee> duck and cover!
20:30 <+o_be_one> DDoS in the hole !

21:57 <@deen> anything special today?
21:57 <@deen> servers look rather full
21:58 < KinG__> any one know c# here?
21:59 <@EastByte> laxa: 
21:59 < laxa> EastByte: yeah ?
21:59 < KinG__> hi laxa :D
21:59 < laxa> KinG__: what ? Hi !
21:59 < KinG__> laxa:  i need a few tips about c#
21:59 < laxa> ok go on
22:21 < laxa> want another funny story about my work ?
22:25 < laxaa> The lead programmer on my project is commiting on TFS without any comment !
22:26 < laxaa> What about that ?
22:26 < laxaa> :)
22:28 < eeeee> isn't tfs like slow and buggy
22:29 < eeeee> on my previous work they had to migrate their c# codez from tfs to svn
22:32 < laxa> tfs is shit for what I have seen
22:32 < laxa> but I mean, tfs/svn or git, commits without comment, nice idea :p
22:47 <@EastByte> ** east finished in: 26 minute(s) 35.62 second(s)

22:51 <@EastByte> he made it just for training rfly
22:51 < laxa> I want a simple one
22:51 < laxa> seems pretty damn hard xD
22:51 <@EastByte> it gets harder from part to part :P
22:51 <@EastByte> the first one is nooby
22:51 < laxa> I want a moderate map
22:51 < laxa> like 2 stars or something
22:51 < laxa> not brutal 3 stars
22:52 < laxa> or even more according to what I see
22:55 <@EastByte> yea maybe, themix seems to be the only one who ever finished it
22:59 < savander> EastByte:  you should add animation to you tw-webgl xdd
23:00 <@EastByte> animation?
23:01 < savander> ye
23:01 < savander> smth like in mapeditor
23:01 < savander> anim button and then
23:01 <@EastByte> you mean quad movement
23:01 < savander> ah yes
23:01 < savander> :P
23:01 <@EastByte> yea wanted to add that
23:01 < savander> woah! :D
23:01 <@EastByte> but stopped dev there
23:02 < savander> so not nice
23:02 < savander> :./
23:04 <@EastByte> oh I stopped developing exactly one year before
23:42 < KinG__> i go to sleep bye all
