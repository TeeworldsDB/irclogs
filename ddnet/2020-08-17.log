12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should have marked the steam version somehow so we could keep track of how many people are playing through steam
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not too late, add something in the version?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But then I have to build 2 separate builds for each platform, but no problem I guess
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add a -s
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something

13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> merica is sleeping tho
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> steamdb already does that
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `<iframe src="https://steamdb.info/embed/?appid=412220" height="389" style="border:0;overflow:hidden;width:100%"></iframe>`
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://steamdb.info/app/412220/graphs/#js-embed-code
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen maybe u can add this to stats
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if having a small http server running on every server for serverinfo purposes would be nice
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen does the steam version get steam updates or autoupater ingame updates?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Steam peobs
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> autoupdater is big illegal
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Steam doesnt provide serversor anything right since its a free gamw
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> where is "clear_votes" situated?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> grep for it in the source code
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> oh, always forget about this xd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.andrewt.net/mines/ < annoying
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/744948476319629404/screenshot_2020-08-17_10-58-37.png
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> Players tab on top left and players tab in options have the same name.
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be useful to change the one in options to "Identity" so players don't get mixed up.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> one says players and one says player
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 any idea what's up with macos github actions? intermittent failure? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/994464494?check_suite_focus=true
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see any logs for it at all, is that normal?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no logs
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's what I'm seeing as well
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but no downtime on githubstatus.com yet
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I'll try again later
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lmk if it ever generates logs
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hi! Don't know if this is a right place to ask but let's try.
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've just compiled a fresh DDNet client+server from github.
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Then i've borrowed a map from some infClass server: logged to it and copied the map from `downloaded_maps/` to `maps/ folder` (with a proper name) then converted it with a `map_convert_07` and placed it to `maps7/` folder.
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> The problem is when I am starting a server I am getting a lot of messages like this:
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```[2020-08-17 19:09:30][collision]: something is VERY wrong with the Game layer please report this at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet, you will need 
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> to post the map as well and any steps that u think may have led to this
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> after connecting with a DDNet client to my server it crashes with segfault instantly. After connecting with a 0.7 client I am getting a strange behaviour like jumping on every input (even mouse move). Could anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe this is a noob question and there is a guide with common caveats?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> start by using a map that works, fix the map issue separately
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But it works in the same client...
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> when I am getting it from a different server (0.6 one I believe)
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> is this behaviour something well known or odd?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Pure_luck map is known to be odd
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> infclass maps
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'm not certain of what infclass does to it's maps but you can find that very distinct error message in the code easily
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok... I have opened the map in DDNet editor and resaved it. It made no difference
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Oh... I have opened the map in DDNet editor and resaved it. It made no difference
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean just use ctf5 or something and fix the rest of the bugs u described
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I was hoping it should strip everything it doesn't recognize
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and after that try to fix the map issue
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is what i would do
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 I think I will. It's just I am asking for a common knowledge about it if there is any.
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, it's seems to be very specific
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will start with a ctf map and then will try to debug. Thanks
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will start with a ctf map and then will try to debug "wrong" one. Thanks
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> is there some kind of "sanitizer"? that could convert 0.6 map to ddnet one stripping all the errors?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah i had a wacky map once and it had that error
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> any info on what was the cause there @louis ?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even know what kind of oddity would make the map incompatible
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nah i just spammed a bunch of unused front tiles i believe, and it somehow crashed the server
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> is there some kind of "sanitizer"? that could convert 0.6 map to ddnet one stripping all the incompatible entities and layers?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 me either, lol ðŸ˜„
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u need to be careful with infclass maps on ddnet because they dont really use the same things
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, nice part is that I can just get rid of all infclass layers
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> cause I don't use them in my mod
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I hope that will work. Thanks for the info!
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, then nice part is that I can just get rid of all infclass layers
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Problem wasn't in infc layers... ok
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it seems that ctf maps are crashing my client too when downloaded from 0.6 server, weird
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but fng one is ok
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u mean the map from my server afaik there are no embedded images or anything
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe that is related
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> wow, nice. Map from your server worked! And sixup works!
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Managed to connect with DDNet and 0.7 client to my server at the same time and interact with other's client character. Sweet!
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck no idea what infclass maps have special, i only tested for ddnet maps.
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 so it seems that we can update this info :)
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://ddnet.tw/news/sixup/
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you have any issues with sixup don't forget to create an issue for it, while it's pretty stable there are still things that need polish
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Khejanin> Where does it check whether a new player started the game ?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can trace it back from the welcome message but I think it uses the fact that there was no settings file loaded
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Khejanin cl_show_welcome 1 I guess
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Khejanin> Hmm can you help me a bit with a crash course, this is my first time with this codebase :S
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> grep for ClShowWelcome
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Khejanin but the search text is just entered as the default in src/engine/shared/config_variables.h, see BrFilterString
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's cleverer than I thought ðŸ˜„
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Khejanin> Would it be ok to change max ping default setting ?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i would keep it at max
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the dark red ping color should be enough to tell you what to expect
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Are teeworlds and ddnet dual licensed? I see it is both copyrighted to Magnus Auvinen,  Shereef Marzouk and Dennis Felsing and also have apache license.

19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can just read this and its not that hard to comprenhend
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Can you please point where are MIT or zlib licenses about core sources in that file?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have read this 3 times already. But maybe I am missing something.

19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mit license
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its really easy to recognize
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But what is the purpose of the first 3 lines?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just to state
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the authors
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being MIT license doesnt mean  ucan forget who did something
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look part 1.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of mit license
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u must not claim that u wrote the original source
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what the first 3 lines
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh thanks
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I haven't realized the mit boilerplate in fact includes those lines
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so they're part of it
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "mit boilerplate"
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u must not have seen many licenses
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> MIT is really clean
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and short
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just cannot remember proper word
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> for framework... draft...
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> dunno
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah well
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok thanks
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe the 3 points
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are not original
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to mit
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but added
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> template
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> template, right
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep its added
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to not forget authors
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Just in my mind (c) is like synonym of "all right reserved", that's why I've wondered
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I see that it's used in MIT template in different way so it's legal so it's ok to combine
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (c)
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only means copyright
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I realize now that "(c) author year" doesn't means he still reserves rights
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u dont see anywhere saying (c) All rights reserved
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that a propietary would do
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> TIL
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not a legal expert
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont trust me much
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've got what I wanted to know, thanks
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki teeworlds/ddnet is zlib, not mit
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @<BÂµmM> hey, we're currently looking for some maps to bundle with the ddnet client, preferably 1 star novice. your gold mine map would suit. could you release it under a license CC-BY-SA, CC-BY or CC0 so we can ship it with the client?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CC-BY-SA and CC-BY say that people who modify the map have to credit you
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CC-BY-SA also means that people modifying the map have to allow for further editing, too
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CC0 just allows anyone to do anything, even without crediting
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen we can take gold mine, @<BÂµmM> gave us CC-BY-SA license
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 fixed itself, status page now says actions is "degraded"
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 cloud-saved settings_ddnet.cfg would be awesome
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how would that work
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would work by looking at the steam api and how it works
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd prefer to not have steam-specific features
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> poll the other developers if they feel differently
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to make the poll
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just ask other active contributors, e.g. via discord
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. @Learath2, what do you think?
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it rly that hard to keep steam stuff in a way it doesnt conflict with possible git merges
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh man, cloud-saved settings_ddnet would mean I would no longer lose these from time to time due to dumbness
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its not that hard
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not hard technically, I agree with that
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm philosophically opposed to offer more features in the closed source part of our distribution
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one could work around that 'steam-specific' thing by hosting our own cloud-saved settings
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Accounts are needed before any of this
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> settings can contain mod and admin rcon binds
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that'd also make it Steam-independent in case of... anything
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> mine do xD
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> accounts are not needed if you use steam cloud save
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean so we can offer it to everyone not just steam ppl
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know perfectly accounts wont be added any time soon
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so we can already forget about this
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I agree with heinrich on providing features to just a portion of the community
21:39 <+ChillerDragon> @Soreu use git to not lose them again
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd rather just create new Discord server, make TW channel there, and from time to time try to upload zip with settings, gameskin, entities etc
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > I'm philosophically opposed to offer more features in the closed source part of our distribution
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > one could work around that 'steam-specific' thing by hosting our own cloud-saved settings
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> How about a modular ddnet server? So people could compile/download modules that provide non-core functionality?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've talked about this before I know ðŸ˜„ would be so cool if one could take vanilla ddnet/tw sources or even compiled one and add functionality on top of that automatically w/o need to merge sources by hand.
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There could be a repository of plugins and even a 'package manager'.
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That Steam cloud config could be a module that could even be developed intependly like a third party plugin.
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That Steam cloud config could be a module that could even be developed interdependently like a third party plugin.
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you're more talking about client plugins?
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> s\/more/rather
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No, about server plugins.
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but cloud config would be a client feature
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have examples of features that plugins in the server could provide?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hm... I was under impression that a person requested that talked about a server config. Ok
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Server plugins could be:
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * new game type mods
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * stats system
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * anti-cheat systems
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * registration system
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * unofficial helper libraries for modders (with functions that are useful in mods but don't make sense in vanilla game types)
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Server plugins could be:
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * new game type mods
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * stats system
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * anti-cheat systems
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * registration system
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * unofficial helper libraries for modders (with functions that are useful in mods but don't make sense in vanilla game types)
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * experimental supplemental protocols (like HTTP master server API client)
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though the latest one makes sense as a client plugin too
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> tuning on 0.7 bridge seems broken
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Currently to reuse other modders code is hard because tw/ddnet servers were not made with modding/modularity in mind.
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> it says `player_collision 5.00`
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Currently it's hard to reuse other modders code because tw/ddnet servers were not made with modding/modularity in mind.
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> before adding plugin systems or anything similar, tw would really need a clean base, the current code is really bloated enough
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the idea of having a nice extendable base would be nice
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> vote description on bridges is empty and sometimes the caller is wrong =\
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think that 'adding' a modular system is in fact would be a rather deep refactoring and modularizing the code itself.

22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But the good part of it is that more modularity in code is usually a better OOP.
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am currently at the start of my quest of porting infCroya (0.7 infClass rewrite) back to ddnet server code.
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So I can document the process as I go and I will try to remove all infCroya-specific features to separate files.
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gl with that
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> couldn't even tell if thats easier than rewritten most stuff
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think that it will still be coupled rather tightly to core tw classes and will not be clean enough.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But at least I can try separate it and list tw classes that would be nice to have a better interface for modders.
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the problem.. vanilla tw was never really modular and ddnet just put their code into it
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yeah all those megaclasses and tight coupling.
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its just bunch of code that works for ddrace, but anything else would result in alot of dead code
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u write your mod into ddracce code u basically remove all ddrace gameplay stuff just to add urs again xD
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I can imagine.
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I hope I will not break in the middle of it ðŸ˜„
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> We will see. Thank you for your support
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Can you see how many people downloaded DDNet on steam? Im curious
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent couple dozen hours trying to get vanilla more mod friendly so we can have more modular mods, however there are parts of vanilla that are very tightly coupled too
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CGameContext and IGameController are very tightly coupled
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have like 6 branches all trying to reduce IGameController to an ABC
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @NeXus 2285 so far
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> wow
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> stonks
