16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what can i do when my gametime margin graph is having spikes. it doesnt ususally lagg
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> hi , how can i set NEWS on my client?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> see or set?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @ChillerDragon  Its my personal client , i want to set NEWS on client but i dont know how
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> You have to set up a new server. I never looked at it how it works exactly in ddnet but im sure it connects to something like news.ddnet.tw
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L4027
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Seems like all info is at the same info.ddnet.tw  url and there are also the news
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @TcTc changing the url there and then setting up a server that spits out json in similar format should work fine
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @ChillerDragon  thanks

21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you happen to know how CNetBan works?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, haven't studied that so far
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh, I guess I'll have to decipher it after all
