00:00 < bridge_> <cauldron1> because default zoom is 10 and default cl_mouse_max_distance is 400, but when i put zoom 5 and cl_mouse_max_distance to 200 my cross is not at the same point
00:01 < bridge_> <cauldron1> my goal is to set cl_mouse_max_distance to the same distance of ddnet tiles no matter the zoomlevel
00:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Thanks

07:31 < bridge_> <syrinok> This issue is happening on nightly
08:07 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> the website is so slow wtf
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea it‚Äôs archive site
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> need lots of cheap cheap $$$
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> storage space
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> dammn it
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> it‚Äôs hdd slow
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> prob #1 consumer of old hard drives
08:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its zwelf web
08:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> o
08:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> zzzzzzwwwz?
08:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
09:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not slow for me
09:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in what way is it slow?
09:18 < bridge_> <deen> When I scroll it takes 1-2 seconds for the text in new location to load
09:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> probably location, self hosted or not on a cdn so it‚Äôs fast where zwelf is and slow where we are
09:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> when I scroll, text is already there, but images will load
09:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> interesting
09:20 < bridge_> <sergeyshukhyan> Hi
09:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hi
09:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> wassahg
09:21 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Maybe you have some data in cache
09:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think the text is a simple html website
09:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> or images have their sources set by js so it can only begin loading when the page is done loading
09:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so it should be fully loaded after a bit
09:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (the text)
09:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh they just never load
09:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
09:24 < bridge_> <deen> after 10s waiting the site fully loaded, then everything seems fast
09:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the page is 16 MB, but curl tells me it loads the website in 1 second
09:49 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> me too
09:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> do you need something/
09:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> do you need something?
09:57 < bridge_> <sergeyshukhyan> Your time zone
09:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> :justatest:
10:29 < bridge_> <zwelf2> yeah, its on a cheap vps. I didnt think it would matter, but probably because those reddit place threads are huge html trees with many subresources.
12:11 < bridge_> <reitw> did anyone test <https://garudalinux.org/> ?
12:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ugly web
12:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but no
12:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gentoo serves me
12:27 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki being a gentoo enjoyer now is certainly very unexpected
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> since i used it i like it
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i agree
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> openrc is good
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i cant talk about making my own service
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> somehow i havent had the need yet
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/daily-gentoo/
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> self insert
12:29 < bridge_> <learath2> Idk Arch Linux was like a part of you, it feels wrong
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> I had garuda, its fun to use if your Focus is Gaming (preinstalled Drivers and reps) Other than That its pretty boring
12:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> And every Other distro works just as Good, Gaming Comes down to having vulkan, Proton and your respective gpu drivers imo, they are installed in 5 Minutes on everything Else
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gentoo works better
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz u natively compile everything
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its just how it is
12:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Never used and scared to ever try lol
12:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not scary rly
12:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u just follow a guide like every other
12:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u dont rly manually compile anything
12:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> portage is god
12:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Gentoo is sometimes referred to as a meta-distribution due to the extreme flexibility of Portage, which makes it operating-system-independent.[2][3][4][5] The Gentoo/Alt project was concerned with using Portage to manage other operating systems, such as BSDs, macOS and Solaris. The most notable of these implementations is the Gentoo/FreeBSD project.
12:52 < bridge_> <learath2> You do learn how linux works very well while using it
12:53 < bridge_> <learath2> I wish gentoo freebsd survived, it was really interesting
14:19 < bridge_> <Jurai!> snail said any feedback about redesign the map releases?
14:26 < bridge_> <teero777> not fun when you have a 5‚Ç¨ cpu :justatest: :justatest:
14:27 < bridge_> <teero777> takes about 5-10min for me to compile the ddnet repo on release
14:28 < bridge_> <teero777> *with multicore
14:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wat
14:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 20 secs for me
14:30 < bridge_> <teero777> I have 2x Intel xeon E5420 on a server motherboard
14:30 < bridge_> <teero777> So 8 cores
14:31 < bridge_> <teero777> Sadly the CPUs are a huge bottleneck to the gpus
14:31 < bridge_> <teero777> I have 2x Intel xeon E5420 on a server motherboard. 2.5ghz btw
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 @chairn did u know about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCchi_automaton
14:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Hadn't seen it before
15:03 < bridge_> <sergeyshukhyan> @essigautomat hey Is there any progress?
15:06 < bridge_> <Assa> @Aa yes, I am doing a lot of progress at work today
15:06 < bridge_> <Assa> @sergeyshukhyan  yes, I am doing a lot of progress at work today
15:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:27 < bridge_> <chairn> haven't seen that before, but it looks like a specific case of FSM
15:27 < bridge_> <chairn> the automata given in example is an exercise i give to students
15:28 < bridge_> <chairn> i try to make them feel how to regex with FSM (but they don't know regex yet)
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> well i'm searching a distro for my weekly network & sysadmin routine lmao
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> was thinking about:
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> - debian
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> - arch
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> - manjaro
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> - fedora
15:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sysadmin?
15:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> debian
15:28 < bridge_> <reitw> why not others tho
15:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> is it possible to like control rightclick  to find a quad
15:31 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> nvm just found the quad manually lol
15:34 < bridge_> <reitw> so not a rolling release based distro
15:36 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @_voxeldoesart
15:36 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> you gotta see this
15:36 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1135566592957227058/image.png
16:07 < bridge_> <learath2> But I guess it's not very common to analyze whether the acceptence state is hit infinitely many times for an infinite input
16:08 < bridge_> <chairn> i dont know, but i don't do that. It's theory that i don't know about
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah me neither, @ryozuki where did you encounter this? when looking at chess or at compilers? üòÑ
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> someone at my work slack mentioned it
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> https://tenor.com/view/bocchi-bocchi-the-rock-anime-mental-breakdown-cringe-gif-27026754
16:11 < bridge_> <learath2> My favourite automaton
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/autoskript.pdf
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 300 pages of theory
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 11.2
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is about
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> buchi
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 11.2 B ¬®uchi automata
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > B¬®uchi automata have the same syntax as NFAs, but a different definition of acceptance. Suppose
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > that an NFA A = (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, Q0, F) is given as input an infinite word w = a0a1a2 . . . over Œ£. Intuitively,
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > a run of A on w never terminates, and so we cannot define acceptance in terms of the state reached at
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > the end of the run. In fact, even the name ‚Äúfinal state‚Äù is no longer appropriate for B¬®uchi automata.
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > So from now on we speak of ‚Äúaccepting states‚Äù, although we still denote the set of accepting states
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > by F. We say that a run of a B¬®uchi automaton is accepting if some accepting state is visited along
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > the run infinitely often. Since the set of accepting states is finite, ‚Äúsome accepting state is visited
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > infinitely often‚Äù is equivalent to ‚Äúthe set of accepting states is infinitely often‚Äù.

16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:15 < bridge_> <Assa> hmm
16:15 < bridge_> <learath2> üòÑ
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 did u read oyasumi punpun
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh wait
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the anime i recommended u watch
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> watamote
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/wata-mote-gif-11424040
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> watamote is worst than bocchi
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u will see
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lots of fun
16:18 < bridge_> <learath2> The only thing I've read lately is hundreds of pages of electronics textbooks
16:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the same anime for both wouldntr work if the mc was a guy tho
16:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz a sad boi is boring
16:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> how does ddnet retrieve and send data with mariaDB? am i just using SELECT [] FROM [] WHERE [] ? i just know sqlite handles it this way so i thought its the same with maria, doesnt rly work for me tho
16:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> as always, sry if stupid
16:20 < bridge_> <learath2> We do normal SQL queries, through the library, not quite sure what you are asking
16:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> :pepeW:
16:21 < bridge_> <Assa> it's just the backend that changes, you are probaly using some kind of query builder, are you?
16:21 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> tried using dbForge, didnt work for me
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Who is a db forge?
16:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> https://mariadb.com/kb/en/dbforge-query-builder-for-mysql-mariadb/
16:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> how does ddnet retrieve and send data with mariaDB?
16:23 < bridge_> <Assa> apprently not, lol https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/210a2a8bb96f46f7484c7b374d0c58714e1457d4/src/engine/server/databases
16:23 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd suggest learning some SQL instead of relying on tools like this
16:24 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> sql hard
16:24 < bridge_> <learath2> but you can surely generate queries and use them inside the code later
16:24 < bridge_> <Assa> you need to understand SQL in order to use tools like that
16:24 < bridge_> <learath2> SQL is glorified english, you'll pick it up in no time
16:25 < bridge_> <learath2> https://oberstar.eu.org/share/Documents/The-Manga-guide-to-databases.pdf here this should help
16:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i understand the very basics, i never tried working with an already existing db before tho so i am really confused as to where to find x/y
16:28 < bridge_> <screeeny> this is useful to play around with some examples : https://ddnet.org/stats/sql.js/ or else https://db.ddstats.org/ddnet-6e97d68
16:28 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ScReeNy lingering in dev chat. fuck :-<
16:29 < bridge_> <screeeny> hihi melon cant sqlü§≠
16:29 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> -.-
16:30 < bridge_> <learath2> SQL was made for humans, so it's pretty easy to learn, businessppl needed their non-technical employees to learn it to check stocks and stuff
16:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i am worse than non-technical employees, and i am unpaid for aswell you say?
16:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> big yikes
16:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> for legal reasons yes i turned that sentence around
16:32 < bridge_> <Assa> `Statement must be a SELECT` üò¶ no drop table
16:34 < bridge_> <Assa> `You can only execute one statement at a time.` Darn
16:42 < bridge_> <Assa> `Queries took 47930.5ms` guess you are save with your side, just added some load üôÇ
16:57 < bridge_> <screeeny> ddstats.org isnt the live databse, its a copy running on ryos server i think
16:57 < bridge_> <screeeny> ddstats.org isnt the live database, its a daily copy running on ryos server i think
17:18 < bridge_> <sergeyshukhyan> Ok
17:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sql is actually easier than a orm
17:37 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> jokes on you
17:37 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i suck at both
17:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> weekly
17:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yes
17:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur load barely makes a dent dont worry
17:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dasette just uses 4 cores of my 12
17:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i have 64gb ram
17:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the db itself is on memory
17:58 < bridge_> <elifTe> Can someone help me
17:58 < bridge_> <elifTe> Although I normally get 200-300 FPS when I enter the game, this fps has dropped to 10-15.
17:58 < bridge_> <elifTe> And I can't solve it
18:53 < bridge_> <Assa> @elifTe try switching through the graphic backends. Usually you get the most performance with vulkan, but this may depend on your system and switches a few updates ago
18:56 < bridge_> <elifTe> i tried but the game is so slow when starting up that even the mouse moves slowly. I don't think the problem is with the graphics
18:56 < bridge_> <Assa> you can also change your settings by modifiying your settings.cfg
18:57 < bridge_> <elifTe> How?
19:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> I had these Problems with vulkan - updating it aswell as gpu drivers solved it for me, maybe try that ?
23:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> One of them is at the bottom of my fridge
23:48 < bridge_> <Assa> is this a captcha that veriefies, that you are chat gpt?
