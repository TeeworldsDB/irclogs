05:16 < LastAvengers> Hello, did anyone know how to kown if a  player online or no by script?
05:16 < LastAvengers> Did teeworlds offer any API?
05:17 <@heinrich5991> do you want to know whether a particular player is on a specific server? or on any server?
05:18 < LastAvengers> heinrich5991: on any server.
05:21 <@heinrich5991> I think there might be some libraries for doing that
05:21 <@heinrich5991> quick googline gives me this php library:
05:21 <@heinrich5991> https://code.teele.eu/twrequest
05:23 < LastAvengers> heinrich5991: thx, let me have a look.
05:34 < LastAvengers> heinrich5991: it looks that i should sycn all server to kown if a player online.
05:34 <@heinrich5991> uhm yes
05:34 <@heinrich5991> there's no central place where that information is stored
06:02 < LastAvengers> heinrich5991: thx for you answer. :D
06:02 <@heinrich5991> no problem :)
10:57 < laxa> heinrich5991: eastbyte made an API for that. Nimda is using it.
10:57 <@EastByte> well, I don't like that code anymore
10:57 < WolfAlex> join with a bot in this channel and use !twp :D
10:58 < laxa> You can whisper to the bot commands to avoid spamming btw :)
10:59 < WolfAlex> :(
16:08 < _Leandro> deen are you kidding me? i have VPNs, i can continue stalking, etc., and you know that i know how to bypass anti-ddos protections, if you don't remove the ban then i'm gonna attack the teeworlds master servers until teeworlds die.
16:08 < _Leandro> and my name is Leandro Bolivar Ramos Ventura, from dominican republic
16:09 < _Leandro> i am not afraid about the police
16:09 < _Leandro> Wolf can confirm its my real name and my real country
16:09 < _Leandro> good bye!
16:16 < ImYFU> Oh, this guy, some kind of a creep
16:16 < ImYFU> Already had to deal with him
16:22 < Sadale> another script kiddie
16:24 < ImYFU> I am most interested in reasons he does it
17:12 < _Leandro> I got the answer, you banned this VPN... The most idiot people of the world is here, This is a free VPN (FrozenWay), my paid VPNs can't be banned easily, cuz you can't ban using host ban and they have a lot of ip ranges, so i can continue stalking and thanks for the fast answer, now i can attack the master servers when i want, and when i start i'm gonna kill teeworlds. Good bye!
17:12 <@deen> we didn't ban anyone, GER is having network problems, the hoster has been contacted^^
17:13 <@deen> oh wait, i didn't see Leandro here before
17:13 <@deen> not sure if anyone actually banned him
17:18 <+ImYFU> afaik, a case can be opened against him
17:19 <+ImYFU> sexual harassment, I'd guess
17:46 <@EastByte> deen: you are always removing the most important firewall rule :p
17:47 <@deen> EastByte: intentionally.
17:47 <@EastByte> do you think the network problems have to do with the rules?
17:47 <@deen> the hoster says the packets go through to our server and our local firewall is blocking them
17:47 <@deen> but i can't find the firewall rule that causes it
17:47 <@EastByte> what packets
17:47 <@deen> many people can't access DDNet GER
17:47 <@deen> at all
17:51 <@EastByte> hm I have no clue
17:51 <@deen> yeah, i don't see any firewall rule that could cause it
18:18 <+WolfAlex> wuu
18:19 <+WolfAlex> voice
18:19 <+Rafael> xD
18:19 <+WolfAlex> heinrich5991: > Henningstone 
18:19 < Henningstone> huh?
18:19 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: ?
18:19 <+WolfAlex> oh
18:20 <+WolfAlex> nvm
18:20 < Henningstone> xD
18:21 <+WolfAlex> thought +m is still active
18:54 <+o_be_one> hello
18:54 <+o_be_one> !ddnetpeak
18:54 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 410
18:54 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
18:55 < Henningstone> øıµĸ
18:55 <+o_be_one> oh lol Leandro uses same VPN has me
18:55 <+o_be_one> thats why i dont see 97% of ddnet servers
18:57 <+o_be_one> deen, you sure its not banned on firewall ? Cause i can only see south africa
18:57 <+o_be_one> even CAN i can't see them
18:58 <@heinrich5991> why do you use a proxy?
18:58 <+o_be_one> anyway the vpn he uses has 3094 hosts ...
18:58 <+o_be_one> heinrich5991, cause you accept to go on a server that you dont manage called illuminati ?
18:59 <+WolfAlex> heinrich5991: the question is when do you start using a proxy :D
18:59 <+o_be_one> ive bought this vpn when illuminati was open, cause i just dont want DDoS and other stupids stuffs from haters & co.
18:59 <+o_be_one> it was for them the best way to get most of players ip
18:59 <+o_be_one> and i dont trust new hosters too ..
18:59 <+o_be_one> i only trust ddnet.
19:00 <+WolfAlex> <- ? :D
19:00 <@heinrich5991> mh. so they get your hoster's IP address. is that different? otherwise they'd get your provider's IP address?
19:00 <@heinrich5991> -?
19:00 <+o_be_one> heinrich5991, they get my vpn provider ip, and it comes with ddos protection and other stuff, its ok for me
19:01 <+o_be_one> never got any problem
19:01 <@heinrich5991> ah
19:01 <@heinrich5991> can say the same without proxy, never got any problem
19:02 <+o_be_one> i pay for premium service, its really fast, i can switch on every country and many ips on each countrys, and i can hide my ass everywhere on the web. Skype resolver cant let them know my ip, and i'm able to surf on France website from Canada (cause like TV streaming is open only to France)
19:02 <+o_be_one> heinrich5991, ive asked to change 3 time my internet ip 2 years ago ...
19:03 <+o_be_one> getting ddoses on it everytime (stupid skype issue)
19:03 <@heinrich5991> oh, in germany I get a new one every day
19:03 <@heinrich5991> not sure about here
19:03 <+WolfAlex> heinrich5991: thats what i think about that:if you have a shared ip nothing is different(ofc. except for ddos protection), but if the ip is dedicated to you, all attacks on the ip are going to eat up your bandwidth
19:03 <+o_be_one> here you have a fixed ip, you change only if you didnt connect since a long time or if you ask to change it
19:04 <@heinrich5991> ah, in that case I understand it :)
19:04 <+fstd> it's probably your router that requests its old IP
19:04 <+o_be_one> but dont forget too that it opens access to many website too
19:04 <+fstd> (using IPCP (Internet Protocol Control Protocol))
19:04 <@heinrich5991> I don't have such a problem (yet)?
19:04 <+o_be_one> cause some bank & channel website are blocked to the country only
19:05 <+o_be_one> fstd, you cant manage the modem here
19:05 <+fstd> can't you run your own gateway?
19:06 <+o_be_one> it comes already active (batery inside), the provider fix it on the cables (you cant remove them without using a tricky way), and you can just add your router
19:07 <+fstd> some modems can be told to just hand back and forth PPP(oE) traffic, but yours probably can't do that eitehr then.. fair enough
19:14 <+o_be_one> yes :(
19:23 <@deen> o_be_one: we just have network problems with DDNet GER, no idea why
19:23 <@deen> many people can't connect to it
19:24 <@deen> traceroute doesn't work to any IP
19:25 <@deen> from other servers at the same hoster it works
19:25 <@deen> and i removed all firewall rules
19:25 <@deen> so no idea what's going on
19:26 <+o_be_one> and ger2 deen ?
19:26 <@deen> o_be_one: that one i don't dare to start after it had network problems and got ddosed to oblivion
19:30 <+o_be_one> wtf :(
19:35 < ChillerDragon> hui
19:35 < ChillerDragon> Ger servers are offline?
19:36 <@deen> no, just unreachable for half of the world
19:36 < ChillerDragon> oh
19:36 <@deen> i'm trying to solve the issue, but no idea why it happens
19:36 < ChillerDragon> hmm
19:36 <@EastByte> the problem definitely doesn't lie on our side
19:37 <@deen> EastByte: well, i think it does
19:37 < Henningstone> everybody has issues…
19:37 <@EastByte> deen: why would the vps drop packets from random ips
19:39 <@deen> EastByte: no idea. why would the other vps's not drop packets?
19:39 <@EastByte> ip address routing issues
19:39 <@EastByte> maybe due to a ddos mitigation system on a completely different layer
19:39 <@EastByte> who knows
19:40 <@deen> remotely possible, but improbable
19:40 <@deen> that they would even have a ddos mitigation on another layer
19:40 <@deen> it's a more general problem
19:40 <+o_be_one> vrouter (new ddos protect on other layer) is active only for clouds.
19:41 <@deen> my ssh connection to GER sometimes doesn't work
19:41 <@EastByte> yea, noticed that aswell
19:41 <@deen> about 50% it fails
19:42 <@deen> I guess time to cancel the tournament
19:42 < ChillerDragon> :c
19:42 <+o_be_one> is it on WolfAlex serv ?
19:42 <@EastByte> also can't be coincidence that this happens today
19:42 <+WolfAlex> o_be_one: ?
19:43 <@EastByte> ger ist nfoservers
19:43 <@deen> EastByte: there have been network problems on GER for a few days
19:43 <@EastByte> okay, I didn't know
19:43 <@deen> strange packet drops
19:43 <@deen> they restarted the server because of that
19:43 <+o_be_one> ger is on nfo oO
19:43 <@EastByte> yes
19:44 <+WolfAlex> well i have no problems connecting to GER
19:44 <@deen> WolfAlex: try ssh ger.ddnet.tw
19:44 <@deen> WolfAlex: try it a few times in a row
19:44 <@deen> ehm, ssh -p 6546
19:45 <@EastByte> interesting, can't connect now, but my old session is still online
19:45 <@deen> EastByte: right
19:45 <@EastByte> and udp is completely dropped for me
19:47 <+WolfAlex> hm
19:47 <+WolfAlex> still no problems
19:47 <+WolfAlex> ssh -p 6546 ger.ddnet.tw
19:48 <@deen> so not even that is consistent
19:49 < Hallowed1986> hiho
19:49 <@deen> hi
19:49 < Hallowed1986> stream is on
19:49 <@deen> tournament is getting cancelled probably, sorry
19:49 < Hallowed1986> und wollte fragen wies schaut und ob man helfen kann?
19:50 <+ImYFU> "probably"
19:50 <@deen> ImYFU: ?
19:50 <+ImYFU> sounds promising
19:50 <+ImYFU> as promising as devs joking about release date
19:51 < Hallowed1986> broadcast sagt noch 9 min?
19:52 <@EastByte> that's an automatic counter
19:53 <+o_be_one> WolfAlex, disable game firewall to try
19:53 <@deen> Hallowed1986: sorry about that =/
19:54 < Hallowed1986> meiner Meinung nach, einfach starten. 120 Personen auf den servern
19:54 <+WolfAlex> deen: ^ this
19:54 <@deen> mit lags und haufenweise beschwerden von leuten die nicht auf die server kommen
19:55 <@deen> servers are emptier than when we have no tournament, so obviously something is very wrong
19:56 <@deen> there is a general packet loss for some pattern of packets, but no one knows why
19:57 <+o_be_one> what says mtr ?
19:58 <@deen> it says ???
19:58 < Hallowed1986> es kommt die frage auf ob es verschoben wird?
19:58 <@deen> Hallowed1986: nein

19:59 <+o_be_one> there is a fiber cut in north america but cant be this
20:00 <+ImYFU> People spamming #tournament in chat
20:03 <+WolfAlex> Hallowed1986: can not connect to hitbox ._. "The connection was reset"
20:11 <+o_be_one> i dont understand
20:11 <+o_be_one> the ger ddnet is at nfo ?
20:12 <@deen> yes
20:12 <+WolfAlex> yes in frankfurt iirc
20:12 <+o_be_one> i was thinking it was game server from WolfAlex 
20:12 <+WolfAlex> wtf?
20:12 <+WolfAlex> i have _nothing_ to do with ddnet
20:13 <@deen> apparently there is some kind of DoS attack against GER
20:13 <@EastByte> see
20:13 <@deen> they blocked it at nfoservers, now ssh is stable, but other people still can't access the server
20:13 <@deen> and no idea why the DoS didn't show up in network, maybe it was small packets
20:15 <+WolfAlex> deen: i guess thats routing problems
20:15 <@EastByte> I guess there was just a different mitigation system that was activated
20:16 <@EastByte> deen: did they say it was dropped at nfo?
20:16 <@deen> EastByte: no, they just entered it into the firewall thingy
20:17 <@deen> don't think it was related anyway, the ssh problem is back^^
20:17 <@EastByte> do you mean the 85.5.236.47 block?
20:17 <@deen> yes
20:18 <@EastByte> oh wow...
20:20 <@EastByte> the support clearly cannot help in this case

20:52 <+ImYFU> Planned shut down
20:56 < Ryozuki> i tought ddnet would shut down after tournament (wich i dont want it to happen)
20:56 <+WolfAlex> Ryozuki: no tournament => no shutdown (?)
20:57 <+WolfAlex> xD
20:57 < Ryozuki> i hope
20:58 <+ImYFU> WolfAlex sounds legit
21:01 <@EastByte> still not a single icmp packet coming through to ger.ddnet.tw
21:01 <+ImYFU> Heard that ^ Ryozuki? 
21:02 <@deen> chile is also totally broken today btw
21:02 <@deen> and has been getting worse the last days
21:03 <@deen> ping went from 200 to 600 and stuff like that
21:03 < Ryozuki> mmm
21:15 <+WolfAlex> internet is sick
21:19 <+ImYFU> Cure it with the hammer
21:26 <+WolfAlex> turn it off and on again
22:01 < LOL__> HELLO?
22:01 < LOL__> any mods here?
22:02 < LOL__> someone just unleashed a ban wave on one of your servers
22:02 <@deen> LOL__: i see, looking into it
22:02 < LOL__> at least 15 people got banned for 100000 minutes xDDD
22:02 < LOL__> ok cool just wanted to tell you guys
22:02 < LOL__> thx and good luck LOL
22:05 <+WolfAlex> hm
22:08 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: logs durchsuchen, hophop
22:08 <@deen> had to change the mod pw
22:08 <@deen> he went from server to server, banning everyone
22:08 <@deen> also, my messages might not go through, ddos on ddnet.tw
22:08 <@EastByte> oh w/c
22:09 <@EastByte> deen: well no timeout in irc yet
22:09 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, i just get a message "delay: 20" in my irc client
22:09 <@EastByte> ah, that's fine
22:10 < Ryozuki> hi
22:11 <@EastByte> hellow
22:14 <+WolfAlex> EastByte: <- ? why me
22:14 < Ryozuki> deen , "2013-09-15 12:19  158.58  Cenarrius & Zerodin  GER  [1]" the 158.58 is = 1,58 mins or how?

22:15 < Ryozuki> oh ok thx
22:25 < Ryozuki> whoa
22:25 < Ryozuki> i will neeed a lot of time to do the video of just fly
22:25 < Ryozuki> well, i have all christmas :D
22:25 < Ryozuki> at the firts 3 there is no diference at all
22:25 < Ryozuki> just some fails
22:25 < Ryozuki> then appers the hook fly
22:25 < Ryozuki> then speedfly
22:26 < Ryozuki> and then the speedfly moving .-.
22:26 < Ryozuki> and fasat hf to hookfly
22:26 < Ryozuki> i'm talking to a blank page :D
22:26 <@deen> i find it pretty crazy how they can keep improving so dramatically after 2 yeras
22:26 < Ryozuki> i too
22:27 <@deen> they halfed the time from 2 years ago
22:27 <@deen> and back then no one could beat that for 8 months
22:27 < Ryozuki> speedfly ^^
22:27 < Ryozuki> but how darky controls it is pretty amazing
22:27 < Ryozuki> its not easy
22:28 < Ryozuki> i wonder what will be the next
22:28 < Ryozuki> is it even possible?
22:28 <@deen>  	The machine hosting your VDS is again having the strange network problem it had before. Another machine in Frankfurt of the same type is having the same problem this time, which makes us strongly suspect that it is due to a Xen/Linux change (such as a new driver bug).
22:28 <@deen> We have scheduled a reboot for 23:00 CET. This should result in approximately 15 minutes' downtime for your service. As part of the reboot this time, we will be slightly upgrading Xen/Linux to the very latest version. 
22:28 < Ryozuki> thats the good thing of games where you race to get best time
22:28 <@deen> so GER will be down in 30 min
22:29 < Ryozuki> Upcoming reboot early Dec. 16  Dec 14 2015 03:40:44 PM PT	Between 12:30am and 4am local time for your service on Wednesday, December 16, we plan to gracefully shut down your VDS, upgrade the machine hosting it to an updated version of Xen/Linux, reboot it, and bring your VDS back online. We expect for this process to cause approximately 30-60 minutes of downtime for your service.
22:29 < Ryozuki> hehe
22:29 < Ryozuki> oh
22:29 < Ryozuki> that was time ago
22:29 < Ryozuki> xd
22:31 <@EastByte> wut
22:31 < Ryozuki> nothing
22:31 < Ryozuki> xD
22:32 < Ryozuki> i had 9 ddos attacks in a week
22:32 < Ryozuki> thats sad :s
22:32 <@EastByte> "The machine hosting your VDS is again having the strange network problem it had before. Another machine in Frankfurt of the same type is having the same problem this time, which makes us strongly suspect that it is due to a Xen/Linux change (such as a new driver bug). "
22:33 <@EastByte> oh deen already posted it
22:33 < Ryozuki> yep
22:33 < Ryozuki> maybe announce the downtime in servers?
22:33 < Ryozuki> so people dont think its other think
22:33 < Ryozuki> thing*
22:33 < Ryozuki> u know what i mean
22:33 <@EastByte> not rly
22:33 < Ryozuki> hmm
22:33 <@deen> EastByte: it's a bit unfortunate that it always takes 10 iterations of back and forth until i get to talk to the CEO, he seems to be the only to take me seriously
22:34 <@deen> Ryozuki: i'm announcing
22:34 < Ryozuki> good :)
22:34 <@deen> Maybe next time I should write to the CEO directly
22:35 < Ryozuki> what is ceo?
22:35 < Ryozuki> sry for my ignorance :D
22:35 <@EastByte> you need to ask really specific questions then :p
22:35 <@EastByte> like I did with the firewall
22:35 < Ryozuki> "Chief executive officer"
22:35 <@EastByte> Ryozuki: head of nfo
22:35 < Ryozuki> oh ok xD
22:37 <@EastByte> also wouldn't suprise me if the CEO is the only engineer at nfo
22:37 <@EastByte> nfo kinda looks like a hobby project
22:38 <@deen> it looks more professional than all the hosters DDNet is hosted at :P
22:38 <@EastByte> well, yes
22:38 < Ryozuki> is ovh better?
22:38 <@EastByte> ovh is horrible
22:39 < Ryozuki> :o
22:40 <@deen> and nfo is the only one with good and cheap ddos protection
22:40 < Ryozuki> thats true
22:40 < Ryozuki> i had 9 ddos
22:40 < Ryozuki> and all them have been filtered
22:40 <@deen> i think without nfoservers ddnet would've been down looong ago
22:40 <@EastByte> yep
22:40 < Ryozuki> thanks a lot to them then  :D
22:40 < Ryozuki> and the money .-.
22:41 <@deen> EastByte: sorry for removing your firewall rules btw^^
22:41 <@deen> i made a screenshot before removing them
22:41 <@deen> i panicked a bit before the tournament and tried everything to get the packet loss controlled
22:41 <@EastByte> oh nice, because I don't have a backup :p
22:41 <@deen> i thought it might be like the fritbox packet filter
22:42 <@deen> it's very buggy if you have certain rules
22:42 <@EastByte> sometimes it is kinda strange
22:42 <@EastByte> on a test server I dropped all incoming packets via nfo firewall
22:42 <@EastByte> and google dns still came through
22:43 <@EastByte> for some reason
22:43 <@deen> maybe they redirect all dns requests to their internal dns server
22:44 <@EastByte> well the firewall is running on the same host
22:44 <@deen> (i read about some companies doing that)
22:44 <@EastByte> so maybe the dns also runs on that host
22:44 <@deen> yeah, but maybe they have a rule in the firewall before your custom rules
22:44 <@deen> and that redirects the dns somewhere else already
22:44 <@deen> or whitelists google dns already, dunno
22:45 <@EastByte> also the ratelimit for getinfo was more like trial and error
22:45 <@EastByte> "fall through for the rest" whatever that means
22:45 <@deen> it means the next rules will be applied for the rest
22:46 <@EastByte> yea, makes sense
22:46 <@EastByte> but iirc and drop/accept the rest didn't work like I expected
22:46 <@EastByte> nvm
22:47 <@EastByte> well, I would rather use iptables to set up more advanced firewalling, but debian 7 doesn't have bpf support
22:49 <@deen> i guess it's higher performance to filter it out earlier
22:50 <@EastByte> the CEO told me there wouldn't be any difference
22:51 <@deen> hm, ok
22:51 <@EastByte> (I didn't question that though)
22:51 <@deen> depends on how the networking is virtualized i guess
22:52 <@EastByte> yes
22:53 <@EastByte> but I'm pretty sure that the nfo firewall won't affect the vds' cpu performance
22:53 <@EastByte> which would be a reason to use it
22:53 <@deen> yep
22:59 < Ryozuki> good night bye
22:59 <@EastByte> cya
23:00 <@EastByte> lol, the nfoservers staff page speaks for itself
23:01 <@deen> haha
23:01 <@EastByte> looks like one engineer and 7 gamers
23:01 <@deen> yeah, he hired former players of his servers
23:02 <@deen> see their application page "We are primarily looking for applicants who are: [...] Current or former customers of NFO"
23:02 <@EastByte> yep
23:03 <@EastByte> I actually would like to take part and help working on ddos protections for gameservers
23:03 <@EastByte> but that's kinda huge
23:04 <@deen> i don't think they can do much with relation to ddos attacks
23:04 <@deen> better get a job at internap
23:04 <@EastByte> well depends on nfo's bandwidth
23:05 <@EastByte> and internap feels way more commercial and intransparent
23:05 <@deen> their bandwidth is low, 20 gbit/s in frankfurt
23:05 <@EastByte> they'll have to get a bigger fibre at some point :p
23:11 <@deen> let's hope that the kernel update fixes it
23:11 <@deen> i'm not that convinced
23:11 <@EastByte> I'm absolutely convinced :D
23:26 <@deen> now it works again but we can't connect to the mastersrv on ger again...
23:27 <@EastByte> I don't understand how this can happen
23:28 <@deen> i guess same problem
23:28 <@deen> the kernel somehow throws away some packets
23:28 <@EastByte> ah, well
23:28 <@deen> in this case udp packets from the server to itself
23:29 <+eeeee> what if you hardcode 127.0.0.1 as an ip for the master in /etc/hosts?
23:29 <@deen> right now i hardcode the ip of another master^^
23:29 <@deen> but let me try
23:30 <@deen> the master selection in teeworlds is a bit strange
23:30 <@deen> it keeps trying the same master server forever
23:30 <@deen> even if it doesn't work
23:30 <+eeeee> yeah whole masters thing needs rework
23:30 <@EastByte> agree
23:31 <@deen> when the master servers were under ddos, i had to hack around in /etc/hosts too to get all ddnet servers registered
23:32 <@deen> nope, 127.0.0.1 doesn't seem to work
23:32 <@EastByte> maybe try some netcat udp stuff and check for lost packets
23:33 <@deen> yeah, i guess
23:40 <@deen> dunno, basic udp seems to work
