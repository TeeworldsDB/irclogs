00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> you guys know that tech conscious people make up very little of the browser market
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> the only possible way for Firefox to even have survived as long as it has is for them to market
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> and if this is their marketing strategy i actually see nothing wrong with it considering their competitors
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i liked their :// logo personally
00:16 < bridge> <Solly> :// was like web standards
00:16 < bridge> <Solly> but now that i think about it yeah it kinda sucekd
00:16 < bridge> <Solly> but less than green flag
00:18 < bridge> <totar> idk what future mozilla has without the google paycheck, no one likes firefox for some reason
00:18 < bridge> <Solly> firefox logo rocks tho
00:18 < bridge> <totar> maybe if google nukes ad blockers hard enough people will switch
00:18 < bridge> <totar> also idk how they make money even if they have a larger marketshare
00:36 < bridge> <Solly> as for chrome, safari and edge theyre all just burning money (well edge isnt cuz its just chrome) to just platform lock people
00:36 < bridge> <Solly> chrome it sorta makes sense because google? but.. then it pays everyone else to use google aswell
00:37 < bridge> <Solly> so mozillas sitting there without the rest of the faang
00:37 < bridge> <totar> for them it's a loss leader but it still makes them money overall, mozilla has no second order benefits from making a browser
00:37 < bridge> <Solly> how does safari or edge make money?
00:38 < bridge> <totar> safari integrates into the apple ecosystem and contributes to people buying Macs
00:38 < bridge> <Solly> ive used safari, its not like... any better than the rest of them
00:38 < bridge> <totar> sure but that's what it does
00:38 < bridge> <Solly> its just different enough thats its hard to switch
00:38 < bridge> <Solly> i guess thats part of locking people in
00:39 < bridge> <Solly> then what about edge
00:40 < bridge> <totar> you can't just say it's about locking people in when safari has been around for 20 years, long before there was any sort of similarity and standards between browser
00:40 < bridge> <totar> apple made something because they thought they could do better than everyone else
00:40 < bridge> <totar> edge is the same
00:42 < bridge> <totar> you can't just say it's about locking people in when safari has been around for 20 years, long before there was any sort of similarity and standards between browsers
00:44 < bridge> <totar> I think safari is also genuinely a unique enough product to justify its existence, macos NEEDs to ship with a defualt browser and I can't imagine them picking google or microsoft for that in a million years
00:45 < bridge> <totar> I think safari is also genuinely a unique enough product to justify its existence, macos NEEDs to ship with a default browser and I can't imagine them picking google or microsoft for that in a million years
00:46 < bridge> <totar> this is a common theme btw, everything they do it this
00:46 < bridge> <totar> this is a common theme btw, everything they do is because of this
00:55 < bridge> <Solly> firefox :D
00:55 < bridge> <Solly> m4a my beloved
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> do you actually believe they would ship Firefox by default
01:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie I blame china. Fix your ping and move to germany. I never got that bug in germany. But I get it here in indonesia all the time. It happens when you press login multiple times in the login screen. I cba to fix it just press login once -.-
04:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean, we should probably set it properly on steam or declare a deprecation first or something
04:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: do we have validation code for clamping NetIntRange or is it only a 0.7 thing?
06:43 < bridge> <EGYT> aac my beloved
06:43 < bridge> <EGYT> 
06:43 < bridge> <EGYT> (ogg/flac is better imo)

07:28 < bridge> <vadim670543> Help please
07:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am pretty sure 0.6 has it too. But I would need to check to be 100%
07:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It shouldn’t clamp tho. It will drop the message if it contains values outside of the range.
07:32 < bridge> <vadim670543> what to do?
09:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> noted. i couldn't really find the code where it drops regardless
09:31 < bridge> <xassol911> ищу тима играю не долго
09:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> netobjhandler.cpp, generated code
10:01 < bridge> <learath2> Reason is that no one has even heard of firefox. They don't control 3 of the most popular websites on earth where they can add a popup telling you to "install chrome for best experience"
10:03 < bridge> <learath2> I am surprised they don't ship a reskinned firefox or something based on firefox. It would be free for them and relieve them of the burden of maintaining an entire browser engine. Though maybe the license doesn't allow it
10:09 < bridge> <totar> Idk why they would give up safari when they also maintain their own silicon, graphics api, and OS. They have the entire tech stack under their control which must have some value.
10:11 < bridge> <totar> as much as I don't like apple their goals are pretty straightforward, they do everything exactly how they want it.
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> webkit is the most standards-abiding toolkit around iirc
10:12 < bridge> <teero777> gm
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> webkit is the most standards-abiding web engine around iirc
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s smooth and nice feeling on apple devices
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> great integration
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> worth
10:13 < bridge> <totar> This might be true but I've always heard safari causes the most edge cases for web developers.
10:15 < bridge> <Ewan> they should have followed the standard :pepeW:
10:18 < bridge> <totar> Web standards are in large part what the browsers do, and what websites serve. If your browser follows the spec exactly and had no legacy features you would not be able to load millions of still active pages.
10:20 < bridge> <totar> There's lots of stuff in the spec that browsers refuse to implement and lots of stuff that browsers (usually chrome) do implement that aren't in the standard.
10:21 < bridge> <totar> Then the standard adds it because one or more browsers implemented it and websites started using it
10:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> Do we understand why Win7 stopped working with DDNet? Maybe we can cheaply make it work again for a year or two if many are still using it
10:26 < bridge> <0xdeen> Referring to https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/592882992704140019/?tscn=1733667504
10:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the code reads really weird @tsfreddie i just checked it xd it looks like clamp but its actually dropping lol
10:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait or is it clamping? xd
10:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was so sure it was dropping
10:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are you interested in snap objects/game or system messages @tsfreddie ?
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> win7 should be super ez to maintain atm
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> that error msg looks like it might come from the app manifest
10:29 < bridge> <0xdeen> I thought so too, maybe just need dome flag when building the libs
10:30 < bridge> <avolicious> But Windows 7 is EOL even with extended security patches 😄
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> usually with breaking API changes not reflected by the OS you’d literally just see entry point yadda yadda not found in whatever dll
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> usually with breaking API changes not reflected by the manifest you’d literally just see entry point yadda yadda not found in whatever dll
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> derp
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i cant fathom what flag you might use
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> is that a build from the CI or do you run cmake manually
10:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie dude my 0.6 knowledge is almost 0 haha seems like dropping only happens in 0.7 and ddnet clamps it actually
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like ddnet never got the bleeding edge 2014 patch from teeworlds that replaced ``ClampInt`` with ``CheckInt``  https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/4e5d713f7549a0ea61ad71528bd6ea935978388c/
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyways validations are applied in a few places for example server side game msg read drops here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cfefe25c3d5e0e50963cadb4f5601276e07e66f0/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L2010
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> client side snap item read drops here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cfefe25c3d5e0e50963cadb4f5601276e07e66f0/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2218
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo developers I got stuck. Somehow after all these years working with the server code I still get bamboozled by this. But I have a vector defined in gamecontext and I would like to keep its elements across map changes. Somehow this seems harder than it should be.
10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The gameserver gets destructed on map change. I know there is persistent data but that seems to be more for per player basis and i see no git conflict free way of using it. I am close to just abusing the server.h as permanent storage for something that for sure does not belong there.
10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xfaulty i am sure you have encountered this issue at some point. Any recommendations?
10:51 < bridge> <0xfaulty> static vector :)
10:51 < bridge> <0xfaulty> or move it to server
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well normally they can't even use the steam version on win7.
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But @0xdeen maybe you can update it, since it's not true anymore anyway
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1315618169632718869/image.png?ex=67581066&is=6756bee6&hm=acaa17bf2a94403103647bad022455fe777af0fb0ba13089242117db04cc0edc&
11:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> done
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thx
11:04 < bridge> <0xdeen> We should at least mark the last working versions for winxp and win7 on ddnet.org/downloads
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @headshotnoby what is last winxp version? :DD
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is the last win98 version

11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is the last win98 version
11:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> haha, i think win98 was with comp. layers
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does static survive the destructor? o.O @0xfaulty i am going for the server one right now but it feels so wrong ._.
11:26 < bridge> <sas05237> Goog
11:26 < bridge> <sas05237> Deen
11:30 < bridge> <teero777> static survives anything generally
11:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Check how it's done for the vote option heap aswell as tunings. I've used this in F-DDrace aswell.
11:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 
11:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> CGameContext::Clear()
12:03 < bridge> <headshotnoby> last ddnet version supported on XP? i don't remember
12:03 < bridge> <headshotnoby> second edition
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah too bad 😄
12:06 < bridge> <headshotnoby> second edition
12:06 < bridge> <headshotnoby> 
12:06 < bridge> <headshotnoby> or if you meant client, this is the vanilla client running under KernelEX
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut ah nice thanks idk how i did not see it. That is exactly the good style approach i was looking for! But it creates so much git conflict surface :( I think i will go with server.h just for merging with upstream reasons
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if only #7777 had a better outcome i could pr to ddnet to make this processer cleaner for forks
12:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
12:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> Til you saying #7777 doesn't trigger bot
12:10 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777

12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe melon as well
12:30 < bridge> <learath2> Melon would join us np
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who else would join

12:37 < bridge> <teero777> yea just opensrc ddnet cheats
12:37 < bridge> <learath2> githubwrapped? It worked fine for me
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on firefox?
12:37 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe your ff settings are more paranoid?
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> Ddnet leaderboards for solo maps would be gone
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> either way angry github issue it is
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> aye, I never use chrome unless the site is absolutely broken

12:41 < bridge> <teero777> Everything I do is private mostly
12:41 < bridge> <teero777> But I'm doing smth for opensrc currently
12:41 < bridge> <teero777> Will make public soon
12:41 < bridge> <learath2> All my contributions this year were to company repos, so it looks like I have contributions almost every day but it totals to +1000 LoC
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1733744539.png
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> developer skill clearly is measured in LoC
12:43 < bridge> <learath2> This is true. My coworker that accidentally commited 200k lines of training data is the most skilled

12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where can u generate that?
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.githubwrapped.io/
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but you have to star their github repo
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its basically a star farming scam
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the data is basic af
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah xD
12:45 < bridge> <learath2> Jokes on them, I unstarred it
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice and i can still see your profile
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imma do the same
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow takes very long xd
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> their backend is probably too busy
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that is fair tho i assume the biggest bottleneck is gh speed and ratelimits
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> Wow I was actually useless in 2023
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf xD

12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just the ddnet-accounts repo is already like 10k  lines
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait jupstar
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reload again
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> until it stops saying incomplete on the top
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt say so
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Actually I have been useless since covid 😭
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you got scammed
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh wow your stats suck
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it probably cannot deal with new repos or smth xD
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1733744915.png ryo proud
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's still just wrong
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let alone all branches of dd-pg repo
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should always increase it by like 100k LOC

13:05 < bridge> <imilchshake> I'm doing the gores random map generation stuff, maybe u have seen that :D
13:05 < bridge> <imilchshake> But I mainly play gores, I'm a ddnet noob :(
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes that was in my browsing history
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller it's all because you refuse to use discord
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats on discord
13:06 < bridge> <imilchshake> I think that's hella based
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You'd be part of our secret group chiller
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Where we plan to make Teero the richest man alive
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the map gen looks impressive btw last time i checked i can not remember images of such goresy gores parts @imilchshake 
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No but it would be easier to do voice calls
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the matrix thing we did last time was smooth af
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ do you see me in your github feed? https://github.com/
13:11 < bridge> <imilchshake> Thanks for the kind words :3
13:11 < bridge> <imilchshake> Matrix is very nice!
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @imilchshake i was kinda hoping to finish ChillerDragores6 before such tools get published -.-
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1733746433.png
13:14 < bridge> <imilchshake> Dont worry it can't and will never compete with maps that are handcrafted with love :owo:
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean its gores ...
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its just a tunnel. And your screenshot looks like any kog map to me
13:15 < bridge> <imilchshake> Especially easy-hard maps are very solid, but just not as interesting as handcrafted maps by good mappers ^^
13:16 < bridge> <imilchshake> I'm also hosting test servers with "live" generation if u want to look at different difficulties :)
13:16 < bridge> <imilchshake> Generating fair/fun insane maps is rather challenging tho xd
13:16 < bridge> <imilchshake> Generating fair and fun insane maps is rather challenging tho xd
13:17 < bridge> <learath2> Does this take a year to complete?
13:18 < bridge> <imilchshake> I love the occasional Smileys :D
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes but you can take breaks @learath2 i have platforms to chill in there that are bigger than dm1
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> So it's like a yearly adventure
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> you start, you save, you leave, you come back
13:21 < bridge> <imilchshake> Ooh does kog support /save?
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea and some parts are intentionally annoying for t0 players because you can fall pretty far back
13:22 < bridge> <imilchshake> :justatest: :poggers2:
13:22 < bridge> <imilchshake> Imagine dying to lag after 5h
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> always having a teammate on a platform is part of the adventure
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but that teammate is the one who falls 3 times down while trying to climb this and costs you 2 hours in one part
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1733746981.png

13:28 < bridge> <learath2> ObjectiveC is a language I surprisingly enjoyed a lot. Does that make me a bad person?
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> I also like/d it
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> back when i was actively mapping and testing gores maps i always did run through the map with super to estimate the rough length. I never had the patience to finish this map with super. And some parts are really bad time sinks if you start to fail as a team.
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant do an estimate but its long @learath2 
13:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> Chillerdragorani 3* extreme when ?
13:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> Asking for a friend.
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ChillerDragores3 is a map that kamillentee once planned as tournament map actually xd but my windows pc crashed during the save of the map and corrupted the file
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i had to restore an really old backup and i never recovered emotionally from that backset
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> making a map with ai and submitting it to kog seems a bit weird
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> Btw do we do saves properly now? With a save + swap file?
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> Btw do we do saves properly now? With a save + swap files?
13:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nowerdays i think yes
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> good good
13:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the incident happend before robyte was born
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean nowerdays i also track my maps in git^^
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> sounds like a meh use of git
13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> binary blobs
13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its still really good
13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can map on my laptop and git pull on my desktop
13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> have free backups sponsored by microsoft
13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and can easily check out old map versions 
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> using a tool i am very comfortable with
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> inspired by my role model ddnet https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its also so nice for pulling new maps on the server where the game servers run
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and dicussing map changes with pullrequests when working on it with others

13:55 < bridge> <teero777> Chillerdragon: I'ma make a tas of it
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cool! but itll probably be a boringly long watch. With some relaxing music it could be used as background vibe.
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i never read me feed xd
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gh feed op
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i try not to turn everything into social media that i use xd
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller btw
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u ignored my call for vanilla pros xd
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which call can u resend?
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u can fire up matrix
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u should be able to see this or not?
14:06 < bridge> <teero777> Are there dms on gh?
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> public dms there are 😂
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller also likes to ping me inside a commit
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> I guess all these make some sense
14:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1315668921084284929/Screenshot_20241209_211822.jpg?ex=67583faa&is=6756ee2a&hm=293d51fb65780c9ce76dcc9e2b7e0fd37537d880de634c90d6c6bcd5fe45c5c6&
14:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh no
14:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm so high level you can't even see a native language here
14:20 < bridge> <teero777> xd
14:21 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> i guess im not vanilla pro enough i saw no issue
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk how tw does it but if the first two have 10 kills can someone with 0 kills win with 1 kill?
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that seems wrong
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but winning by catching up to first rank score seems fine
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 you can create a private repo invite someone and then chat privately
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> XD
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> nice hack
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the chat is live
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no reload required and it feels like a proper live chat
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> noice
14:24 < bridge> <teero777> show me
14:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its getting later but i can show you another time
14:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why do i feel like ive dealt with this before
14:24 < bridge> <teero777> oki
14:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i may or may not have used this already for serious conversations
14:24 < bridge> <teero777> He doesn't see replies afsik
14:24 < bridge> <teero777> He doesn't see replies fredi
14:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> matrix doesn't see replies?
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am mostly on irc
14:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fair enought
14:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fair enough
14:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not that it matters, i feel fine being ignored
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 i unlocked some free time still here?
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got better at reply guessing but for this one i had to check matrix @tsfreddie did you deal with that in ddnet-pvp or another game?
14:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably, just a feel tho
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont even recall ever finishing a game with sudden death or wondering about which winner gets chosen
14:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i've done that
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i prefer score limit over time limit
14:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i can't remember what it does
14:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean if you want to be 100% fair then it is technically possible to go into sudden death with score limit
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would assume the player with the highest score wins as soon as there is only one player with the highest score
14:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sounds like it
14:36 < bridge> <pioooooo> why are we still using clang-format 10
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> > i mean if you want to be 100% fair then it is technically possible to go into sudden death with score limit
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> when two same score tees get final scores on the same tick.
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pioooooo because making the new formatter work is hard
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7034
14:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also messes up commit history and git blames when something like this happens
14:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> some people don't like that
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is a fix for that
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/formatting-revs.txt
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imo git conflicts are a bigger problem than blame log 
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yes it should be updated its just that nobody is there to make it work
14:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can just download the old clang-format 10 binary and use that for now
14:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~which we all did unwillingly i'm sure~~
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still have bam4 in my PATH 
14:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i've run into bam version compatibility issues before
14:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> iirc
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes bam 5 breaking changes is a classic
14:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> right
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet++ supports both bam 4 and 5
14:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is matricks still updating bam?
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i might have broken bam support when merging from ddnet 9 to ddnet master 
14:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably not right?
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> teeworlds pipeline currently fails
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because bam cant handle new macos arm pipelines
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but last bam commit was 3 months ago
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its kinda still there
14:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> holy
14:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is he still using it for work or something
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont think so
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but he is alive and he merges prs of contributors
14:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he is active*
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think there are people out there that still create new projects to this day with bam because they like it
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lua is better than cmake script you can not argue with that
14:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't mind it, but i've never manually updated bam.lua before either
14:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also it just sounds better
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also have to admit after all these years fan boing bam my cmake skills are much better these days than my bam ones
14:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lucky you. i can work with exactly 0 build tools
14:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanna learn auto tools
14:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~ are you building cars ~~
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean the gnu m4 ./configure ./autogen.sh legacy madness
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which uses some cursed shell like environment
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats the stuff that runs the world
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok afk @teero777 we do another time
15:00 < bridge> <zaer1n> How can I download every map (excluding the cfg files) from the ddnet-maps repo?
15:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cfg files are really small. i don't see why you can't just download the repo.
15:01 < bridge> <pioooooo> anyone would like to run clang-format for me on #9365?
15:01 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9365
15:01 < bridge> <pioooooo> i really don't feel like download clang-format 10
15:02 < bridge> <zaer1n> I only need the maps for a project
15:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, so why not just download the repo and delete the cfgs
15:04 < bridge> <zaer1n> makes sense
15:06 < bridge> <zaer1n> like this?
15:06 < bridge> <zaer1n> `rm ddnet-maps/**/*.cfg`

16:57 < bridge> <Solly> but the map didnt use to... tank my fps in libasan
17:55 < bridge> <.puch> chillerdragon is there any way to force 0.7 on a bridge server?
17:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> Iirc he gets pinged like this: ChillerDragon: u sux
17:56 < bridge> <.puch> oh ok sry xd
17:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> Iirc he gets pinged like this: Chillerdragon: u sux
17:56 < bridge> <.puch> ChillerDragon: is there any way to force 0.7 on a bridge server?
17:57 < bridge> <.puch> i should install irc just to chat with him really
17:57 < bridge> <.puch> before he was answering his pms directly in discord
17:57 < bridge> <.puch> but it was years years ago
18:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You can disable 0.6 connections easily, yes
18:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But it requires code change
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 i think u recently found a fix for these?
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They apparently still happen even without any dummy connected
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1315737999899889774/image.png?ex=67588000&is=67572e80&hm=4ca666464a889a1e932de70d90d3372a8d5bd12cbf26b9e76c05c8b1f03579f9&
18:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Is this on latest master? Maybe after quickly reconnecting? I only see one assignment of `m_LocalStartTime` which only happens after receiving the second snapshot on the main connection
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's latest steam ver
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yes it was after a map vote
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is this and why does it change the colors of my hook lines only in UI, but never ingame xd
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1315739950339330138/image.png?ex=675881d1&is=67573051&hm=e9d8f3411ec5e89843f217d51a670c23b349ffbb0da57a05fcd152d0f68cf036&
19:01 < bridge> <robyt3> It's for previewing what you would see with `+hookcoll` pressed
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?XD
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i press my bind
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it still shows my normal colors
19:06 < bridge> <robyt3> It only inverts the color if you enabled always showing hook collision
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮
19:07 < bridge> <robyt3> I suppose the settings preview doesn't cover that case
19:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah yeah now I see that
19:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But yeah not really intuitive as shown in the UI 😄
19:20 < bridge> <robyt3> `demo_extract_chat` crashes with stack overflow :monkaS:  `sizeof(CSnapshotDelta)=524560` and `524288` of that are for debugging, changing to `uint64_t` recently doubled this
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In rust you have to be extra careful bcs it often creates your stuff on the stack before you move it on the heap xD.
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But gotta say in rust I never create huge buffers on the stack.. like char buffers or similar
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uninitialized buffers are simply not the rusty way

22:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Anyone got some historic demos (with chat and broadcast) that we can use for testing?
22:06 < bridge> <Solly> whats "historic"
22:07 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know, some well known runs or ctf/fng matches maybe
22:08 < bridge> <teero777> before or after 2010
22:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess it needs to be a playable demo
23:43 < bridge> <Solly> if what
