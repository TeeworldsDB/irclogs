09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon  can you make me a client with a simple X and y blocks per second speedometer? The one in the debug menu is too small and weird. I would actually use your client this time😅
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> try to make issue here https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/rust?id=c77c8025525c36c9d2b9d82e4539403701276a1d
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 :poggers: :poggers:
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I’m guessing the idea is to allow building mostly auxiliary parts of the kernel from rust? Like drivers
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye for now
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust takeover soon :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh:
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cool, been a while since we had a new language in tree
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If by soon you mean maybe within the last quarter of our lifetimes, yes , it’s looking possible 😛
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 25 years :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh:
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should do a toy kernel in rust
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is a wiki for stuff like that
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Osdev iirc
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would be a fun experiment to see how much of something intrinsically unsafe we can wrap with rust
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is redox-os
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OSDEV is a great resource indeed, probably the only one out there for this kind of information even
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, someone already did it 😦
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Obviously
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hard to be the first at something these days
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 drivers run in userspace
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only we were born earlier and we could grab the low hanging fruit
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guys I have a brilliant idea, how about we do mail but over the internet. Genius
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or or or, how about mail, but it goes thru instantly
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> actually, email is worth replacing i think
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Phones, but instead of using telephony we use the internet
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s replacement is also already invented, so nothing to find there
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> really?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 im watching a anime called planetes, made in 2003 iirc, its about space stations and such, i love how they use cards and stuff that looks like old tech now but its prob futuristic back then
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, instant messaging architectures easily replace email already in most peoples lives
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but.... these are different
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> email is more formal
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really, they get a message from A to B. They solve the same problem
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because we pretend it is. It’s still messaging
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hello sir Learath,
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You can find attached a waifu image.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Kind regards.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See very formal
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> well, the only problem is that you can't run your own Discord server 😄
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Try rocker
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me give you an example, the turkish government is already running a pilot program digitizing bureaucracy. With a verified IM account you can actually do quite a few things like requesting official documents now
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rocket
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or smth like that
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or slack?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Slack, come on 😄
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean we pretend mail is this very decentralized concept but corporations hold a very tight leash on it
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, Google and Microsoft are trying really hard to discourage people from running their own email infrastructure
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even going from your private mail server to someone elses private mail server you might actually want google to deliver your emails to make sure they get through the totally unbiased spam filters that definitely don’t check whether the mail originates inside this oligopoly
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I currently have an even worse problem. My own mail provider is marking my own outgoing emails as spam 😄
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Self hosting is not that hard tho
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The downside is mx records cant be protected by cloudflare
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you get a cheap VPS for self hosting chances are high that your IP is already on dozens of blocklists
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, but remember how your mail landed in my spam even though you did everything google suggests?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> getting your emails accepted by GMail is very hard these days
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Use ur own mail servee
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If everyone does it
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Less control for em
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, but we live in cloud age 😄
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> People also like to believe that the big draw of Crypto is that it is decentralize, but most people use a centralized "bank" e.g. wallet.  At the end of the day the average person doesn't care much about control.
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A mail coming from a server that implements the highest levels of security still doesn’t make it through googles “spam” filter but shitty marketing spam always does. Because the actual criteria isn’t security or spam, it’s how much money you have
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac took me a moment to realize you mean cryptocurrency not cryptography 😄
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so true
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I have everything and they put me in spam yeaj
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Spf dkim tls etc
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> The average person certainly doesn't care about cryptography 😛
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Average person doesn’t even comprehend what problems we are looking to solve with decentralized technologies. They are so used to the “if you got nothing to hide you got nothing to worry about” rhetoric that privacy actually sounds like a bad thing to some
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Toss in some terrorist here and there and they will defend centralization more
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I probably mentioned my math teacher in high school that thought people who contributed to the tor project were complicit in terrorist actions taken on the platform
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Privacy and decentralization don't necessarily go hand in hand. In fact, the problem with bitcoin is that you have no privacy. All your transactions are public
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There are coins that truly hide it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Monero
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> You can the same level of privacy from cash/gold. We just have regulations for fraud detection
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But you do, there is no actual way to associate you to your wallet except if you rely on centralized structures
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That’s why the registration to coinbase feels like a colonoscopy nowadays
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, but legitimate organizations have to abide by KYC
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, so maybe coins with more builtin privacy are indeed better
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zcash and monero both do better at hiding transactions
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> My bank does a pretty good job at hiding my transactions 😉
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sure
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But anyway this idea of cryptocurrency is dead on arrival. The only reason they didn’t pull the plug on it yet is that rich ppl are making so much money on market volatility
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS: 👍
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I know I am in the minority here, especially among tech individuals, but I feel the only thing crypto is disrupting is regulations (which in of itself is a good thing). Makes us questions why we are so stringent on certain laws
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I know I am in the minority here, especially among tech individuals, but I feel the only thing crypto is disrupting is regulations (which in of itself is a good thing). Makes us question why we are so stringent on certain laws
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In an ideal world for the people in power there would be no cash either. Privacy is awful if you want to keep an iron grip on your people
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Make sure to watch 5 stallman videos a day on your favorite libre peer video website
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> If it is an authority that is trustworthy having transparency and accountability can be a good thing. That said, there are a lot of countries where this is not the case
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it’s been good to see how far we could stretch our current understanding of laws
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> As an example, it isn't a good thing that someone could easily hire a hit on someone without any traceability. It also isn't a good thing that authoritarians can abuse this knowledge.
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Banking regulations? Usually because some bank did something bad and we learned from that
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Geohot has an extreme position on this idea. He thinks we should crowdsource ALL the data on earth and host it all completely publicly so we are all on even footing against the malicious entities. I personally think it’s insane but you might find it interesting to listen to him talk on it
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2008 :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh:
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Regulations like knowing your customer, understanding that the money you are receiving isn't "dirty", and inter-country transactions.
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ this a 1000% Turkey has incredibly strict banking regulations that work so well even to this day, because banks nearly destroyed the currency within months
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I am also not defending banks. I feel they are terrible institutions. Would be great to have a community bank
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Banks are most probably the biggest oligopoly out there right now
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Sure, will check him out. That does seem extreme though. Don't want people knowing my search history 😄
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Through visa, mastercard and maestro they control entry into the market. If you want to do something disruptive they will never allow you in
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine a bank whose cards you can’t use anywhere :p
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, not the entire market. In China you use Alipay, and I've seen quite a few shops in Germany that also accept Alipay 😄
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> That is also the advantage of crypto, it is eating into their market
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> That is also the advantage of crypto, it is eating into their market (or threatening).
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or a bank who can’t send money to other banks except physically lol
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A couple banks actually looked into RIPPLE to break out of the incredibly annoying SWIFT process, ultimately not enough banks joined so it didn’t work out but it was interesting seeing banks actually not being fond of the process either
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you need banks if u want to build a home
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I'm off 🙂 Love these sorts of discussions though. Will check in again later 💪
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why? And what do you mean by build a home?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cya, I should also get back to abstract linear algebra yay
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> unless you are rich u need to ask the bank for money to build a house
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> few 100k€
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah loans, I mean we could work out schemes where people more democratically get capital together to hand out loans
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Credit Unions are close to this idea
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is becoming more and more a thing here in italy too. Even chain supermarkets sometimes take alipay
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but its very unsafe
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are banks any safer? Banks are so unsafe that they destroyed the global economy like 3 times
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no the banks
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you need to know if the guy can return the money
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's how Volksbanken (People's Banks) were started in Germany btw
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well how do banks do it? They take your house if it gets there, similar regulations exist for private loans too. If I loaned you money and you couldn’t pay me back I could definitely annoy you as much as a bank
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i think banks do research and interviews
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the specifics can be discussed, but I’m sure we could interview our recipients too. I’m not really a financial professional so I’m not familiar with all aspects of the process but Credit Unions and maybe Volksbanken in Germany can be a good starting point to figure out what do
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_banking
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats why a lot people dont get loans from real banks
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because the bank doesnt think you will be able to pay it back
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There were a lot of cooperative banks here in catalonia, but spain slowly erased them
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Americans are also the most insane on this matter too. Private companies keeping track of your credit record lmao
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You apparently need to pay them to do operations on your credit record like requesting a freeze and stuff in case of identity theft
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to pay them to unfreeze it too
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You even pay for extra security, like a pin before someone can do an operation altering your credit from what I gather
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Truly peak civilization 😛
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> weird
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> murica has some very strange finanical systems
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U pay 5k for ambulance
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Murica has some very strange anything systems
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I guess there is only one system in play in america. Hypercapitalism
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> blackrock where they have 2 sides where they work against each other and are expected to not talk with the other employees
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They made the economy charts in murica look this good in covid by printing money like crazy
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS: :monkaS: :monkaS:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> American govt: `for(;;) { if(!entity->isPrivate()) Privatize(entity); }`
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess iterating thru all state entities would have been wiser 😛
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know the context, but intuitively this makes sense to me. When you're that large (managing 9 trillion $) you might want to try multiple approaches internally for some competition instead of betting all on one approach and getting beaten by an outsider
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but they can manipulate the market if they talk with the other side
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you cant control whether they actually are independent
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Paper money is suuuch a scam. I reaaally hope it doesn’t blow up in my lifetime. USD literally has infinite demand so they print as much of it as they like. The day america loses an inch of power we all might be veeery screwed
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> On the other hand you sometimes want to print money and distribute it to improve efficiency, because otherwise if there is no money around nothing useful gets done. That's the usual argument for printing money and state spending projects. I don't think the US is unique in this regard, and probably not immune to inflation.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (when the market is afraid, and no one is lending money)
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they do it all the time
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but they change the rate
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They should be very well protected from inflation though. Almost any country on earth would be very happy to exchange their currency for more USD
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure how inflation applies when your currency is the one the entirety of the world economy runs on, so actually not very certain of the argument there
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean turkey can print all the turkish liras they want but no country wants turkish liras, since the demand for turkish liras is finite printing more of them actually devalues it. Meaning you can buy less with your liras
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I need to read more 😛
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum noted here https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/issues/20 ill ping u next year when its finished
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thanks king
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Im 'corneum do you by chance have a powerful gpu capable of mining bitcoin? just a hypothetical question
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if so then i'll make the client for u
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its probably already mining for many people
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when i dont have task manager open my pc fans spin up
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ouch
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You should really reinstall that system and only install trusted software
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but im to lazy
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> keep task manager open
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yea thats what i do
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> put speedometer in official ddnet client
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> `cl_show_advanced_info` maybe that shows x: y: coords along with speed values
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah thats debug 1
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesnt that show other ugly stuff
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do u need that
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in the very rare cases u do u can use debug
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can use it for a lot of stuff
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like consistent 3-freeze jumps
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like consistent 3-freeze edge-to-edge jumps or whatever
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats cheating
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we shouldnt promote that
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> not
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well theres already like 50 cheats already in client
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, without consistent inputs you can’t actually get it consistent
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no theres a bind that does `+jump; +right` or whatever lol
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and theres 3 coordinates on each side that u can just use that bind and then it does it
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> doesnt mean we have to add it more
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh that bind sounds annoying to me
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cheaters :angery:
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> u can get it consistent just by pressing both keys at once
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Takes quite some work to get that consistent
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> not relaly
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, boss
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> skeith watched me do it a lot
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hopefully he banned u
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can do it too, we’ve both been here for quite some time now
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh btw is there any way to lock cursor to fullscreen instead of a circle radius
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :monkalaugh:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can also mostly do a jump thru a 3 freeze consistently without looking at coordinates nowadays
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :think_bot:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :nobythinking:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, actually maybe not anymore since I stopped playing every night
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait are u guys actually considering fixing some bugs like kill skip
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can’t be fixed as we after hours and hours of arguments agreed that it’s very not nice to change physics
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think some physics should change
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like weak :justatest:
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or the puller bug
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unlikely since it might make older ranks impossible
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk i feel like it'd do the opposite
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you want better physics, make new tiles and deprecate the old ones
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, this is the way we decided to handle changes like these
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has extreme maintainance cost imho, but it’s the best way to keep backwards compatibility and ranks legal
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well u cant really do that for stuff like weak/strong
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> definitely for better stoppers and speeders tho
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it could change
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> stoppers changed too
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wish speeders were changed to a correct thing
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk how they were released so buggy
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but there are mappers who think its cool to have some random bug part i guess
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i actually like stuff like sg bug now but things like speeders are just bugged in every aspect
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We only made changes that we can reasonably argue that aren’t used in maps
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The grenade one was the most unexpected to me
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats possible for kill tile bug too
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are we sure that there aren’t ranks skipping kill tiles out there? Or maps where it’s used as a speed check of sorts?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> not adre 6
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah there are some maps
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes but only a few
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but its not too much i guess
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> other bugs are worse than killskip tho
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> killskip is kinda cool as a "easter egg" kinda thing
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> nvm
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not really
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean it makes intuitive sense that if u have enough speed u could skip over a kill in a tick
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sgbug, speeder bugs, and weak/strong dont make sense on the other hand
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ticks are raaarely intuitive. Humans don’t understand the concept of ticks, our time is smooth 😛
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 if we had thought it more maybe we could have added a column to the ranks db called flags, so that we can save if a rank used killskip
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teehistorian has all the information if we ever want to extract that
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Haha ye go parse tb of data only available to admins
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I was supposed to check mod activity for this month
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers: :poggers: :poggers:
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hm well maybe its just ppl that have played other tick based games
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Anyway having it in a db is more accessible
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which is basically any other game actually wait
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant if we want the info we can atleast get it, it’s not lost was my point
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u know 3b1brown right?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Search Manim on github
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill try it with ddnet data when i get home
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, I think he is one of the best sources on math in youtube right now
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Manim is MIT
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used manim for a couple things
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Showing people vector fields in the math discord
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Used for his animations
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough I also think it’s one of the best visualization tools available right now
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Matplotlib is so meh to use
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It sucks
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> @Learath2 When bit2 :monkalaugh:
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not tonight :P
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @Learath2 hello can you tell to this fucking exec/vali to stop promoting my server? he said "join our new server" in the exec discord. i think want master ban me bcs i perma banned vali . thanks
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @Learath2 hello can you tell to this fucking exec/vali to stop promoting my server? he said "join our new server" in the exec discord. i think he want master ban me bcs i perma banned vali . thanks
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> sorry wrong channel but its a short message
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> you can tell that to other ddnet/teeworlds admins pls
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> vali wont listen
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just ignore him and put "notexec server" in motd
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already did a masterban
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You'll probably have better luck asking heinrich in the teeworlds discord server
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> k
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> wait im so confused by your request 😅 you don't want vali to promote your server -- meaning you don't want people to join your server?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> huh i dont need this message to have players :3
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well you cant ban someone for promoting your server
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yeah 😅
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> wait
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 2sec
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> its not promoting but faking xd
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/822172893239967784/unknown.png
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> fluffy is vali
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> and that my server
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and why would that be bannable
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bcs exec is already master ban, if heinrich see that maybe i want to the same
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah, that makes sense
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :justatest:
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he can not ban you but he cant ban vali for it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bcs exec is already master ban, if heinrich see that maybe i want do the same
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> why not add a new feature in the next ddnet update, like if people change name to "vali" he's instant banned of all server
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> why not add a new feature in the next ddnet update, like if people change name to "vali" he's instant banned from all server
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😂
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 👍
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah, that makes sense
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> edit: why did you edit your message, now it doesn't make sense anymore lol
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i think this is the best idea i ever had
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bcs exec is already master ban, if heinrich see that maybe i want do the same
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> edit : i dont remember what i changer
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bcs exec is already master ban, if heinrich see that maybe he want do the same
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bcs exec is already master ban, if heinrich see this maybe he want  to do the same
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why they are advertising the ip btw. There is a masterban
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 on gentoo do you compile your compiler or use a prebuilt compiler to compile your compiler is native optimizations?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> S/is/with
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The true gentoo way would be to write   a small c compiler urself on asm and then compile the compiler :monkalaugh:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc I compile my compiler
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 but u are comitting a sin by using a prebuilt binary in gentoo
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the real way is to create the motherboard with iron and silicion yourself by banging together some rocks, then etching in the whole of linux OS by hand
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I use the gcc binary in stage3 to compile a new gcc
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I compile the new gcc with the new gcc
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh: 👍
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats how bootstrapping compilers work
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Man wtf dis
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/822221814330818600/20210318_223545.jpg
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm so spending the time to move my laptop to gentoo aswell
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Damn udevd man...
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Probably some hardware device not responding?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> took a REISUB to get out of it
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> IPS glow there
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 🙂
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds like that
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> when u will fix this annoying bug
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when we find a way to reproduce it
