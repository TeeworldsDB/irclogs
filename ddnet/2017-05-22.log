00:29 <+eeeee> pinkieval: can you try profiling it to confirm that the multithreaded rendering is the cause?
00:31 <+eeeee> or maybe you compared ddnet vs multithreaded vanilla?
00:31 <+eeeee> ddnet has many other additions and not all of them can be properly reviewed and tested for cpu regressions before they are merged
00:46 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: can you interpret this error? https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heinrich5991/ddnet
00:47 <@heinrich5991> theoretically, this swap function from non-std shouldn't interfere with std::swap used by some list function, right?
00:47  * Learath2 is back home
00:47 <@heinrich5991> wb
00:47 <@heinrich5991> you can teach me a lesson of c++ too, if you want :) ^
00:48 <@Learath2> so verbose I can't even read it anymore :P
00:49 <@heinrich5991> ctrl-f 'error '
00:49 <@heinrich5991> with space at the end
01:01 <@Learath2> very interesting
01:04 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: is using std::swap a good idea?
01:04 <@heinrich5991> I changed it to use std::swap
01:05 <@Learath2> yeah i've seen that
01:06 <@Learath2> m_Keks? looks like you forgot a test variable :P
01:07 <@heinrich5991> indeed :)
01:09 <@Learath2> well does compile with std::swap and I don't see why it wouldn't work
01:11 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: tests successful :)
01:11 <@heinrich5991> 'tests'
01:11 <@heinrich5991> compiles successfully
01:11 <@Learath2> :D
01:11 <@Learath2> how does one test a game anyways?
01:11 <@Learath2> run it headless and see if it connects to a server?
01:11 <@heinrich5991> there's a lot of code that could be tested
01:12 <@heinrich5991> for a start, one could test that generation and parsing of server info stuff works correctly
01:12 <@heinrich5991> but yea, one could also test some network stuff
01:19 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: can you take a look at it today/tomorrow? :)
01:19 <@Learath2> the uuid patch?
01:19 <@heinrich5991> yep
01:19 <@Learath2> did you change anything after I last checked it out?
01:19 <@heinrich5991> fixed the bugs
01:20 <@heinrich5991> i.e. it now compiles, and I removed the debug messages
01:20 <@Learath2> i'll give it a look over tonight if i don't pass out, if not tomorrow :)
01:20 <@heinrich5991> ^^
01:22 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: is the mysql linkage easy to fix for cmake?
01:22 <@Learath2> i'd really appreciate it if you could get it out of the way
01:23 <@heinrich5991> I can try to take a look tomorrow
01:23 <@heinrich5991> bit buried in homework, should be better on tuesday
01:24 <@Learath2> no rush, just hoped you knew the problem/fix already :)
01:24 <@heinrich5991> no
01:24 <@heinrich5991> not yet
01:25 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: seen the kotlin on android announcement?
01:25 <@Learath2> no i don't even know what kotlin is
01:25 <@heinrich5991> kk
01:26 <@Learath2> is it any good?
01:26 <@heinrich5991> if the only other option is java, definitely :)
01:26 <@heinrich5991> but I guess that's kind of a low bar ^^
01:29 <@Learath2> I guess depends on who you ask, some say java is the best thing after the computer itself
01:42 <+eeeee> heinrich5991: i guess the error is because the stl implementation is not using a hardcoded std::swap internally and also considers other implementations of swap that are available, to let you specialize swapping for your custom types for more efficency
01:44 <+eeeee> not sure what exactly is going on however because i never did any microsoft c++ and a newb in c++ in general and also i'm on a beach in hawaii atm :P
01:45 <@Learath2> :D

19:00 <@Learath2> force_pause currently pauses someone to spec even if spec is disabled on the map
19:00 <@Learath2> forgot to ask whether that was wanted behaviour
19:23 <@deen> definitely not wanted since it allows cheating maps
19:38 <@Learath2> oh nvm i already asked and changed that when making it
19:52 <@Learath2> deen: did you write the bot that announces finishes in discord?
19:55 <@Learath2> nvm i see it'
19:55 <@Learath2> is just a webhook
20:11 <@Learath2> and from where do you get the event?
20:17 <@deen> yes
20:17 <@deen> ssh ddnet.tw crontab -l
20:18 <@deen> ~/servers/scripts/discord-ranks.py
20:18 <@deen> basically just check every hour
