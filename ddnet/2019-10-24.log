16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the point of the placement new here? `m_pCharacter = new(m_ClientID) CCharacter(&GameServer()->m_World);`
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is from `CPlayer::TryRespawn`
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think its overloaded here:
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f761330d0b376de135566b495829838a41ca6469/src/game/server/entity.h
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the idea is basically to reuse the same memory every time
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, I missed the overload

19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't those numbers took too round to be true? ðŸ˜›
19:21 <@deen> looks like some estimation :D
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't really show me a clear hog like I hoped though ðŸ˜¦
19:22 <@deen> what tool did you use?
19:22 <@deen> in OS software I'd use valgrind --tool=callgrind
19:22 <@deen> and then look at it with kcachegrind
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: I don't think I can profile ddnet with callgrind on the servers, way too slow
19:24 <@deen> true
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was hoping to see where a GETINFO attack actually causes lags
19:24 <@deen> we have a great tool with low performance overhead for that at work, but unfortunately not open source :/
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: some dynamic translation like callgrind or call stack sampling?
19:25 <@deen> call stack sampling, but looks much more accurate and useful than the one you showed :D
19:26 <@deen> and also returns you a dot file in the end
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: is it something you made inhouse? maybe you can convince your ppl to open source it ðŸ˜›
20:08 <+Ryozuki> :o
20:10 <+Ryozuki> its funny cuz when i dont have time i want to program ddnet and when i have time i dont
20:10 <+Ryozuki> fuck life
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 just tried to apply your AuthManager commit, it fails building

20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cannot overload a function with c-link (?)

20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i tried to apply your authmanager commit, but it fails building due to the md5_finish functions, which exists twice
