10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "2.33% perf"
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Our experiments show >2% performance
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> improvement on clang bootstrap, ~1% improvement on Google workloads and
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1.6% mean performance improvement on SPEC IntRate 2017.

14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> how does the colorization for the particle after you kill work?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> or is there a way to disable it so it shows the same color as in the particle file?

14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> it changes the color
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> somehow
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> but idk how
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> We need something like a teamsolo that u can join anywhere in the map to get through stucking parts
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> *and also leave again
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> you want a feature to join a team while in t0?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Technically yes
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But maybe it could be added as a mappers gametile or something, to force people doing a part 2p in a team 0 map
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> There are just often parts that can only be done 2p and its hard and everyone is blocking in team 0
15:35 <+ChillerDragon> better fix maps :D
15:36 <+ChillerDragon> derelease all maps where author is not konsti they have good t0 gameplay
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i don't know if that would be a proper solution for this.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> would be weird to join a team while playing. you would have to make it like a zone where to join and a line where you leave.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> 
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> fixing maps wont really work out since especially drag parts are a famous mapping style and people wont stop mapping them (it would be wrong to stop mapping them imo)
15:36 <+ChillerDragon> you can map drag parts that work with more than 2 players
15:36 <+ChillerDragon> mostly mappers dont even try
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i can't imagine that? you need a reset point and on multiple trys, players will walk around each other etc.
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> walking backwards can be made less annoying if there is enough space to not run into people doing the part
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> there are a few tweaks one can do looking at the part again and imagine a big team there
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> What mappers can do is deactivate collision. I don't see how you want to avoid people running into each other. Even if you fix that, people will still be like playing behind each other (2 players doing a drag part next to each other) and block each other if they don't play carefully.
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure one has to look around while playig with multiple tees im just saying that mappers can support that not fix all problems but help a bit
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ChillerDragon play DDRace again pls
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> my solution would be that mappers, who create a lot of parts for teams for 2, should put those parts into one map and don't mix them too much with t0 maps
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> my solution would be that mappers, who create a lot of parts for teams for 2, should put those parts into one map and don't mix them too much with t0 parts
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> We should just disallow teamforce on non dummy maps or open maps that would be heavily cheatable 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And heavily cheatable doesnt mean that u can do parts other than the mapper intended!
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> We should just disallow teamforce on all non dummy maps except open maps that would be heavily cheatable 
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And heavily cheatable doesnt mean that u can do parts other than the mapper intended!
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> that idea is interesting, but i would only apply that to new maps
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet does not support my skin :/
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ur skin ia greensword
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 0.7 skins are fucking ugly
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ur skin is greensword
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> have u tried upgrading to 0.6 client
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ChillerDragon minecraft when
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> everyday
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> 0.7 look the same as 0.6 just higher quality
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> 0.6 is so pixalated :/
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 0.7 looks shit xF
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 0.7 looks shit xD
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Also ur playing with entities, Imagine crying about pixels
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chillerdragon is a troll
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i dont play w entities
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> and vanilla 0.7 looks so much better than vanilla 0.6 imo
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> the menus look different, yeah. Ingame it's still mostly the same... I just dont get why people cry about that so much. After all it's just personal preference
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought people complain because the way the client looks isnt the greatest reason for splitting the community in half knowing at least some players will stop playing because of it
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ie long time vanila players who see vanilla die on 0.6 and dont get the memo that its moved to 0.7
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> yea the split is bad that why we should update? 
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> most vanilla players moved to 0.7 i think
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes most vanilla did move
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> There looks nothing better in 0.7
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ur just having super strange viewa
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ur just having super strange views
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> you opinion
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> your*
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but "updating"usually involves a significant amount of work on the part of the hosters to make their servers compatible
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> unless they want to force everyone to use worse client
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> qshar and kamillentee were super annoyed from ur trashtalk about teams and spec
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> it's not like tw breaks compatibility every few months
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Qshar said wtf i must have been drunk when i let this guy in KoG
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 0.7 main menu  is cool
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> today 0.7 may be worse for ddrace, i agree on that
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> .7 is literally unplayable for high dpi screen lol
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> for vanilla ddnet does not really give me advantages
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not having antiping is irritating too
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but there are very severe bugs that happen with high dpi screen
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> imagine Saying something is better cuz ""better""" design
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that never happened on 0.6
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> better more like annyoing
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> played on 14" wqhd. no issues
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 is ugly in ways i couldnt even imagine, have you looked at that fcking ugly chat? they literally destroyed it in the worst way a human could
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it makes for horrible fps + clipping bugs + things being cutoff and unusable == generally frustrating experience
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its insane
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the skins look so retarded
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like nouis
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant handle it
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Ryozuki your opinion
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i get 400 fps on ddnet and my laptop is cool
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 0.7 i get 200 fps and the fans spin af
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my opinion > ur opinion
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> faxx
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats not an opinion
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> okay 😄
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its fact
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> redix is a vanilla whiteknight
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hey i like vanilla too
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vanilla 0.7
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but 0.7 client runs horribly
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for me
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on my laptop with its screen
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the epitome of bad design
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and ive reported these things several times and the only ppl to help me were 0.6 devs lol
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> i played long before ddrace even was a thing... i played some ddrace and i still play a lot vanilla 😄
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im not sure if the mod matters too much
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> i played race long before*
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Vanilla is cool
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> On 0.6
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> +
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I dont get the use of 0.7
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 is a disasted but the circlejerk is big
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well there were a couple good fixes in 0.7 like the reflection attack thing
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but imo they couldve done this in a similar way to 0.6.5
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> as this was a netcode fix that maintained some amount of compatibility
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt they also add a patch to the client which makes modding harder now
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz oy cares shit
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> there are a few things like the name+clan changing. That definitely wasnt a good decision
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also always try to keep client features that modded servers can take advantage off off by default
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like colored broadcast
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they rly want the fcking vanilla to be 1st
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its just plain boring
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes but this is a minor (albeit dumb) decision like, what is more confusing
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> "tee" changed name to "player" 
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> "tee" left the game
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> "player" entered and joined the blue team
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they should focus on modding
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if the lack of namechanging was supposed to prevent confusion from different names
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they failed
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> since everyone just rejoins to change name
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Oy is already way more open towards modding than some years ago
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye maybe 2%
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u praise him to much
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> in 0.7.0 there wasn't any broadcasting at all
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol how are u not towards modding in a game like tw
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mods keep tw alive
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> i'm not praising him, i'm just saying that he was okay with merging some things
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if he were about going to improve modding we would have big changes like custom server side controlled UI, custom text drawing etc
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he cares shit
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> a few years ago (or with matricks) that would have been impossible
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most online games survive thanks to modding
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its undeniable
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> true
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most old small open source online games for sure
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old small
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> minecraft
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> terraria
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> xd
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kerbal space program
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> small
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol wat i dont think terraria survived just due to modding
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well sure
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ryouzki is old and small
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but modding adds even more
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> play calamity mod
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> too complicated
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://calamitymod.gamepedia.com/Calamity_Mod_Wiki
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ah yes i enjoy killing the 5000th worm of eydolin in order to get the most overpowered book in the game
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nouis u dont get the point
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u dont have to enjoy every mod
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate caring so much about this game
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wasted effort
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol im sure its a good mod, the texture  pack is nice but like i wouldnt play it
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i  agree mods keep a lot of games alive
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best modding api
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> but when talking about server controlled ui, modding api and stuff... for a long time tw dev was 100% dead. ddnet would have had the possibility to add all these. until today there are just a few mostly hardcoded things, everybody is still concerned about being compatible with ancient ddnet clients and tw 0.6.
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Implementing a proper, flexible modding system isn't that easy
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think ddnet played a big part in keeping tw alive
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> i don't deny that
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @redix thats bad because you don't want to make a pvp mod with a custom UI based on ddnet code
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > everybody is still concerned about being compatible with ancient ddnet clients and tw 0.6.
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think it is because a majority of players (? i think) are still using 06 based client
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> at least if u break it down by the amount of time spent playing
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the majority of playtime comes from 0.6 users
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> but some ui would have been good... adding chat commands for everything it really not user (or at least beginner) friendly. People here tend to love console interfaces... most people just dont
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can migrate to 0.7 without taking the things we don't want, it's just the amount of work
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i just see alot of the upgrades/possible upgrades for 0.7 as things that couldve been added to 0.6
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see anything in 0.7 that would justify the move though
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im still waiting for ddnet to go standalone
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bye bye chiller :greenthing:
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> that's what i was talking about with supporting 0.6 and old ddnet versions 😄
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only see disadvantages. Missing features, network roadblocks
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and messy code
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ugly skins
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> breaking compatibility gives new opporunities and you can remove a lot old crap
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah 0.7 is better than 0.6 in terms of code cleanliness
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a ddnet standalone with a protocol breaking change, where everyone is forced to update, would bring us the opportunity to cleanup the protocol and lot of stuff
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is the new token protocol which is cute
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's it
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would even get optimized
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better time precision, less things in the snapshot used only for vanilla
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> well the ugliest part of ddnet is probably the phsyics code :D
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> no way to rework this without breaking a huge amout of maps
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol: 🔫
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/740948839761969172/unknown.png
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> in some situations is looks good, in this obviously not
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> but it's not like the blurry outlines used everywhere else look perfect
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no one uses shadowed text nowadays
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it looks like 2000
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly bad
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> the whole ui is old-fashioned as fuck
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [9:59 AM] Learath2: I don't see anything in 0.7 that would justify the move though
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my opinion confirmed by a real de
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my opinion confirmed by a real dev
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 🙏
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> it happend tho
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> stop fighting it
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chiller
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill fight u
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets fight
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1on1
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😤
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> if you guys were more involved in the vanilla dev process you could have mentioned it before not after
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how would that have changed antyhing lol
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they think the chat is rly good
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> its not like you can expect vanilla to downgrade now
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better than before
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> let's just be real... nobody would have cared
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vanilla is downgrading itself
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> nobody=Oy 😄
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> upgrading to 0.7 protocol does not mean using vanilla 0.7 chat design
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont have to upgrade to a dead game
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we are the game
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "upgrade"
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> and still much work was put into the bridge thing...
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 0.7 > 0.6 guys !! 111 1 
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but teeworlds 0.6 > teeworlds 0.7, obviously...
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz learath for some reason cared enough
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> first one is just math
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also you should know most tw main devs hate ddnet with passion
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with good reason, its too good
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> main tw devs=?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oy dune that guy with a virtual face etc
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oy literally said it on forum
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he hates it
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=119733#p119733
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is oy minset
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will never expect anything from vanilla
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Teeworlds always has been about simplicity and minimalism and that's not going to change. It's not turning into an anti-Teeworlds like ddnt or become mod-friendly etc..

17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any plans to allow envelopes to activate when a certain switch has been pressed?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would allow for some very sweet and very useful map designs
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> if you add that, you should add sound effects on button press, too
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye

17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but no vanilla compat
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesn't infclass have something similar
