00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah ty works
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MtKuma> hey i saw a video where the dummy dont hammer every "x" second but he hammer only at the good timing, exist a bind for better hf with dummy ?
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> I don't think so but you can start and stop the hammerfly when you want to just by pressing the key
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> There is a bind but i don't have it rn
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> bind x "+toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0"
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> I think this is it @MtKuma
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye the deepfly bind is the best for hammerfly
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Gwendal that is not the deepfly bind
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> bind mouse1 "+fire; +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0"
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 35 Boss> what happens when you write NaN or inf
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> Yo guys im currently "attempting" to make my first map. Just im confused with the hookthrough stuff.
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> 
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> Before you needed to put all those things around it but now you can just right click > game tiles > hookthrough. And thats it right?
15:09 <@heinrich5991> deen: 4‚Ç¨ for a vps? pretty cheap
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Avio look how it's done in other maps (good advice in general)
15:13 <@deen> heinrich5991: for a single month, I'm cancelling it after that
15:13 <@deen> see #admin for the reasons
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> On older maps i see the "all things around" stuff.
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> And recent maps just the game tiles > hookthrough. 
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> 
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> So i guess the last is the best?üòã
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (it's the least buggy one at least)
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avio> Thanks, will doüëå
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @n000b he doesn't want the deepfly bind
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hi
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i wanna ask something
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i wanna compile ddnet, so i installed msvc++ 2017, python 3, cmake and ddnet-libs
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i have placed these ddnet-libs to folder with source-codes, but CMake returns error which talks that i dont have these libs in ddnet-masters.
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what i must to do?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche>

20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> where is someone((
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765 work?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and what about searching someone's nickname by tab in cyrillic language? when you searching someone's nickname in english language (nickname = Fox, for example) you can type 'f' or 'F' - no matter, and press Tab. Nickname will appear. but if you searching russian "–õ–∏—Å–∞" you must type "–õ", but not "–ª". Does someone noticed it?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, teeworlds doesn't properly support non-latin character
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> s
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Is it possible to fix it?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> it's really annoying. nowadays in teeworlds a lot of players with unusual nicknames which we can't type by usual keyboard layer.
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, one could implement that
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's possible ‚Äî but currently I'd think it'll not get done
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could open a github issue about this
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i don't have "git for windows" in list of individual components
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the installed components or in the installable components?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> installable
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm. sounds like I need to update the tutorial
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps it's included by default these days
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you see a search box?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if so, try "git" and say what you find
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> no
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i don't see search box
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but i have russian translate
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> if i already installed python 3 (out of msvc), is I must download it again in msvc?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> —Ä—É–Ω
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hey
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 these iran vps arent cheap xd they are actually pretty expensive for the qualoty they deliver lul
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is the quality bad?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i didnt spend too much time with it but i noticed the website is trash
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the certificates were invalid
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the server seemed to only have one open port also for the connection
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and the server was unusable slow and using some win server remote gui thingy instead of ssh + ping was an unacceptable user expierience
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i am no expert. I just have the feeling that my vps that costs twice as much is 50x times better.
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Arseniy Zarche no, you don't need it again I guess
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon so what vps are you using in iran?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh i use a ger vps and there is probably no good way of comparing that
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I just had access to One of these iran vps and didnt like or
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it*
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Who the fuck plays from Iran
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> or countries around that
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Huge community in Iran, largest after Europe and Chile
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But they have their own private servers in their intranet
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with their own private client, someone sent me a screenshot recently showing that the community is still quite active, even if we can't see it from outside Iran
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>

23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 "but currently I'd think it'll not get done" sounds like a challenge üòÑ
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen awesome üôÇ
