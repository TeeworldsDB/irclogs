07:28 < ws-client> wait is that really three in php? xd
11:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It's best to know your enemy/rival
13:33 <+breton> hi folks, ddnet servers are getting spamed with this:
13:33 <+breton> bah i can't even copypaste without getting weird symbols
13:34 <+breton> anyway, Kisao is spamming and advertising his server
13:36 < bridge> <Learath2> @Moderator if anyone can take a look, I'm outside
13:36 < bridge> <Learath2> Funny the bot didnt delete my message
13:36 <+breton> it is not an acute problem, the spamer got kicked by vote, but it seems to happen on several servers
13:37 <+breton> oh, it is acute again
13:37 <+breton> ddnet rus 37.230.210.231:8348
13:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe it's time to invest some devtime in some spam detection, this is getting more and more common
13:38 <+breton> or maybe you could exclude the spammer's server from the master servers
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> breton so next i spam the ip of all my competitors to get the banned from master too? ez
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> them*
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> you should ban nudelsaft from ddnet too im sure they use his js lib for the spamming!
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> breton: but for real its not that dramatic. just mute the guy in your client and be done with it. theyll stop soon when they realize nobody follows server ads in tw
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> !jup interesting idea imo https://github.com/tr7zw/Exordium
14:35 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> lower cpu and gpu usage on hud to boost in game fps
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure if that would be feasible for ddnet tho. You have to draw every frame right? Otherwise its lost. Or is that exactly what those texture container thingies are doing?
14:56 < bridge> <Voxel> vulkan isnt a rival tho :justatest:
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it could help, but our HUD is also not very intensive GPU and CPU wise
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we are at the edge of where redrawing is as fast and using a previous buffer, which has to be guaranteed to not be written to while being read
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> especially my last point is a problem
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am talking about opengl xD but ye opengl isn't a rival to vulkan.
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 'The Vulkan API was initially referred to as the "next generation OpenGL initiative", or "OpenGL next"[22] by Khronos, but use of those names was discontinued when "Vulkan" was announced'
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its basically opengl 5 xd
17:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah xD I mainly wrote it to write smt
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> @deen Can you add the current git revision to the file names for the nightly debug symbols?
17:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 come irc i wanna send nudes
19:54 < Vexar> Hello
22:57 < ws-client> <test> hello2
22:58 < bridge> <gerdoe> hey test
22:58 < bridge> <gerdoe> change nickname tho
22:59 < ws-client> <gerdoe> hmm hmm
23:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> duh
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
