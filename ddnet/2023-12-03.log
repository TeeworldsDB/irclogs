11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> colision viewer xd
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> odd my result is not correctr
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> smh
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> error in the matrix
11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> always
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: r u happy with ur intel chip?
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no laggs in games etc?
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> new ryzen will probably "only" be zen4. so i am seriously thinking about switching to intel again xD
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i really hoped next gen would be more mind blowing :/
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the 14900k is ~70% faster single threaded than my current
12:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only thing it‚Äôs good for is compiling ddnet fast xD
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok done
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ez
12:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> CS2 feels so ass I did not manage to finish a single game
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
12:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ddnet hangs for a full second sometimes. But that might actually not be the cpu I‚Äôm on to something I think it was a ddnet update
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
12:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe it‚Äôs Linux tbh
12:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yea single core power is super important in general
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, for many apps it still is
12:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Trading single core power for more cores is never a good deal unless you wanna sell cheap vps axaxaxa
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a.k.a. minecraft
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
12:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think the E-cores, p-core design generally makes sense
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> many cores are good too, but probably not for gaming
12:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at least not soooo many xd
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> make -j32
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> use ninja
12:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> use bam
12:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Robsti GitHub trixter
12:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I love how every pr checklist recommends contributors to write bash code hehe
12:17 < ChillerDragon> dood new openbox as nice as it is to move windows is a trap
12:17 < ChillerDragon> gdm3 somehow remembered im openbox enjoyer now and i waited 2 minutes for my screen to turn on to then realize it booted openbox in all black xd
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDD
12:32 < ChillerDragon> ok im onto nothing anymore the client freezes still happend in a known to be good version
12:33 < ChillerDragon> cant test if its gnome because openbox is even worse
12:33 < ChillerDragon> lets blame the cpu
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe you should invest into a liquid nitrogen factory
12:33 < ChillerDragon> im sure the i9-13900KS would fix it
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon:
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://youtu.be/_NxOZyfDYPs?t=427
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> >1000 fps in CS2
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all u ever needed
12:36 < ChillerDragon> fps wont save you if the game feels ass
12:36 < ChillerDragon> but sounds good yea

13:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/dart/
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> /// In Dart, Everything is an Object.
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> /// Every declaration of an object is an instance of Null and
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> /// Null is also an object.
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> bad start

16:59 < ChillerDragon> jopsti i think i fixed my game freezes by switching from opengl 3.3 to vulkan
16:59 < ChillerDragon> pog
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's bad tho
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why ogl laggy
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when did nvidia drivers get so shitty
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 10 years ago they were best. now they often have problems xd
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> odd i have no problems
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah well
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use vulkan
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi im ur local app dev
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1180905746511171605/image.png?ex=657f1f2e&is=656caa2e&hm=77dc33def14819adff8298e40dfa61d489d81b7adaf63abb437c13e91a581413&
17:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I thought you already have an idea
17:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> no xd
17:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I usually learn towards ideas not learns stuff and get idea later
17:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think im a good dev but im a bad ideator
17:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> üò¨
17:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I had some idea but I didn't note them down
17:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> now i have nothing
17:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> mobile app wise
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> gg
17:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how big do you want it btw
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> that sounds lewd
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> im joking xd
17:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like a weekend fun project or year long behemoth
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> not so complicated
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> week or month
17:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok
17:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i definitely had some web app idea, let me check my note
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> well if its web works too
17:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can probably make web app into an app app
17:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> flutter does that
17:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think i stop taking notes when i'm stressed
17:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok i really have nothing
17:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I did wanted to make a chat platform that is solely for "board game-ish party game" but for people with no IRL friends.
17:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like drawful / werewords that kind of game, just inside a chat platform
17:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess that's a game
17:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ---
17:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> drifting bottle tic tac toe. you play a move of tic tac toe and write a message in your move and randomly dispense it to another user
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm so u are more into games than regular apps
17:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean i am a gamedev..
17:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok less gamey. let me think
17:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean usually apps are built on top of services. i'm assuming you don't just want to make a front-end of some other APIs
17:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean you could make a ddnet front end
17:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for querying, following friends records. record push notification for subscribed map. that kind of stuff
17:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you are down to integrate native code. i would like a mobile mod tool for teeworlds
17:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
17:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> mobile rcon lmaor
17:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1180913567915069551/2023-12-03_20-43-17.mp4?ex=657f2676&is=656cb176&hm=90bf3556970bf886594af37c750b8526426a27fd37c4f25ebf277d5b3e214e8d&
17:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> check out this shader i just made i guess
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
18:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wish someone at work would say nice to me
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1180918726229512333/3sbh2cq4004c1.png?ex=657f2b44&is=656cb644&hm=a56d9e1da6c0ea7b538dded4786e798289aa3ece4986f209fd598e8dba15db71&
18:20 < bridge> <louis> make a card game launcher
18:20 < bridge> <louis> with ranked modes :justatest:
18:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym launcher
18:21 < bridge> <louis> idk like a game hub
18:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
18:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that would be cool
18:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i had some idea about making a board game scripting language but i don't think it would work. but coding each game separately is a lot of work for one person
