00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i already see your windows not working anymore xD
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I'M TRUSTING YOU
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> someone has to be the first to test
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> maybe i should do it on a virtual machine though
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that wont work
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont know of any VM that supports vulkan
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maximum as software renderer
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so just do what im trying to do in vm files
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> wait would a virtual machine software do directx
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also try to replace all windows files with wine files xDDDDDDDDDD
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if your windows then still works gg
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i found `directml.dll`
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i guess thats not it
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well you can only replace these
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035675024012628009/unknown.png
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they should be in windows system32
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yep found them
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hope u have a backkend if u actually doing it
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> backup
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> *
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> nah im not gonna try it
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i could do it since i have dual boot
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> if you said that it's safe then i'd do it no joke
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but since you arent sure
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can recover from it:D
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but is it a guarantee that if it works for you that it would work for me
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe i try at some point just for fun^^
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> do tell how it goes =]
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> inb4 it actually makes windows run 50% faster
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paralix> Why i don't see reaz and Knospi skin ( twinbop glow) but i have on skin data
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> What answer do you expect... You didn't send the skins. You didn't share f1 logs. You didn't write the whole data path in which you put them
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 this means only the middle 4 bits of the first byte sent are used for the flags? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667033216.png
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> is that this magic? https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/d6813bf4c9e3da7f155e448c747b87dbb511fe96/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L435-L436
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> ah no thats the chunk header. I keep confusing the packet and the chunk header :( 
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is correct, only those 4 bits are used for flags, ChillerDragon
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> cool thanks i think i slowly understand the protocol which is a bit late considering how much code i have red and written that interacts with the protocol haha
13:53 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow TIL there is a terminal UI for wireshark so gonna ditch the GUI 
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wireshark is one of those programs that I enjoy having a proper gui for
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> yea i understand that but have you tried termshark? Its litteraly the same features but more obvious how to access them and easier/faster to use.
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> i am not talking about tshark termshark is proper wireshark frontend with mouse click and scroll support while also being fully keyboard controllable with intuitive bindings from common curses applications
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I thought you meant tshark
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> yea
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> tshark is more like fancy tcpdump
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> termshark is nuts trust me
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> there is no reason to use wireshark at all anymore
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> i spend 30 minutes yesterday trying to figure out darkmode packet filter coloring and custom columns diving into forums etc. Took me 2min in termshark no web search needed. Also keybindings are guessable if you ever have used another terminal application. Stuff like "?" for help page and ":" for command mode. "G" and "gg" for list navigation. Tabbing for pane switching etc
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> Yo @heinrich5991 is it intentional that the Crc sum is a integer? Instead of hex? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667045850.png
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 20W is like 1/3rd human at rest (sleeping) and 1/5th human sit
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you agree? nice
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no i disagree
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 20W is still a lot of lost power
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> turn off your heater next winter, and see if your body can heat your room
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> spoiler it wont
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> relation?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my claim was that 20W is not lot of energy to actually have an heating impact
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never said smth about if its wasted
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if we want to talk about wasting energy i can give u 2000 trillion other examples
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw now that winter is coming in europe and we talk about private computers its not lost energy anyway
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and in summer you have solar energy
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (ofc considering you are indeed heating your house^^)
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> I let server can client spam keepalive messages and was suprised to see that the packet header differs https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667053867.png
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> why does the client send ``0x04 0x0A 0x00`` and the server ``0x04 0x04 0x00``
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> or did i print it wrong?
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye i guess its the seq number or ack tick or whatever okok im good
16:42 <+ChillerDragon> Okay why does the packet header contain the number of chunks? https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/d6813bf4c9e3da7f155e448c747b87dbb511fe96/src/engine/shared/network.h#L15 seems useless to me
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> seems to be used here hmm https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/d6813bf4c9e3da7f155e448c747b87dbb511fe96/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L53
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i was able to parse all chunks perfectly fine since my udp recv gave me a terminated packet anyways and every chunk header has the size. Or am i missing something?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks the 4090 its so big it dissipates heat insanely good
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fans not even moving
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 47C while playing cyberpunk ultra raytracing
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, i already saw at friends rtx 4090
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Low key good gpu for low fan noise  setups kek
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Where did the stars in ddrace go? I am pretty much done porting the fng to dfng but without stars what kind of fng will it be?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> implement freezebar :greenthing:
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are other fat cards that do this for much cheaper btw
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> It's already with freezebar
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are hit indicators. You can just spawn them as we spawn them for the gun
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 not as fat as this
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> It seems like freezebar has been made default and the options for using stars have been removed
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe not as wide. But I used a 1070TI that was 3 entire slots, thicc heatsink
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U rly gotta hold a 4090
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its an entire league on its own
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes that's what was done. There is an if stmt that keeps stars for old clients there you can take the code from if you want it for fng
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A super expensive brick xd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've held one already. It is massive
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It has an adapter cuz it takes 4 pcie power connectors
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you see the issues with that connector melting?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah gotta be careful so its properly aligned
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The issue is it can be tilted cuz it hits the case
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think they started that with 3090. The new 12V connector. Tho the 3090 only needed 2 iirc
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz the gpu is too big
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I heard it was the internal solder joints of the connector breaking off causing 3 wires to carry all the power instead of the intended 4
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah but the break cuz what i said i guess
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well now i have a 3080 i gotta install
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Byebye amd gpu 6600 xt
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Send me the 6600 I'm poor
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ui nvidia drivers
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> benchmark
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im installing the gpu rn
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Can you tell the package name, i want update my gpu too:troll:
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Can you tell the package name, i want to update my gpu too:troll:

18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> My dirty computer xd
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But now it has 3080
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lazy cable management xddd
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i feel that
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hello from 3080
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on windows
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows decided to remove my weeb desktop images
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good lord
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> let's cancel windows
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now i gotta figure out nvidia drivers in linux
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was always amd so i never had to deal with em
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that didnt age well
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks well im not gonna say no to a free gpu
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even such a good one 😄
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my 2 displays are gsync compatible
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should i enable it only for fullscreen or windowed too
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the question is do u want delay?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sync is sync
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for some movie like games its fine tho
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i guess only windowed
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks where is the benchmark u say?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet, vs ur old fps but on linux 😄
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wish i remember the map i tested
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i usually test on kog maps
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without any pickups
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dota runs at 240 fps
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its the game limit
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gpu temp stays at 66C
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my amd card went easily to 80-89
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is new to me
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok time to try cyberpunk rtyx
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 60-80 fps at rtx ultra and gpu under 70C :o
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> TOMORROW IS CODING DAY!
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> for me
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> :YEP:
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poggies
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you can't really call it coding, it's more learning and shit :kek:
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I was learning c++ by making teeworlds gamemode :justatest:
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> It was hell
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but do you know it now?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Kinda
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Still rookie
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Std is a fucking blackhole
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Infinite possibilities extending with every standart
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> sounds like fun! :YEP:
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> A lot of fun 😭
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should try this cuda stuff
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blender
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://kaegi.github.io/adaptive-sph/
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone made this in rust
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pretty interesting algorithm
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more definition near the surface

23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> What are your guys' opinions on implementing a TClient feature in DDNet? Someone wants a way to have there be a way to replace tee's feet with white feet to see double jumps better.
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Me and someone talked about it, but if this were to have a feet.png that was all white, that replace all feet in client with the white variant
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Me and someone talked about it, but if this were to add it, we could have a feet.png that was all white, that replace all feet in client with the white variant
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You dont need separate file to change feet color
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah but what about tees with darker feet?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1036035748920561805/unknown.png
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i know i wouldnt go through every file and replace all the feet manually
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I mean, just override tee's feet on rendering
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Color
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> *
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You can apply custom colors on feet only, but that would require a bit more code editing
