12:25 < BeaR_> hi \o
12:27 <@EastByte> hoy
13:19 < Learath2> o/
13:26 < BeaR_> nice tutorial @deen (:
13:27 < BeaR_> https://github.com/def-/howistart/blame/nim/nim/1/index.md#L378 this should probably be `discard run()`, shouldn't it?
13:32 <@deen> how did you find that =/
13:33 <@deen> it's not supposed to be public yet
13:33 <@deen> thanks for the bug report though =)
13:34 < BeaR_> you pushed it on github :d
13:34 <@deen> yeah, because the guy wanted a PR so he can review it^^
13:34 <@deen> it should be up on http://howistart.org/ today or tomorrow
13:35 <@deen> i also found a bug with github, they will disallow usernames with a trailing dash now^^
13:35 < BeaR_> nice, interesting project
13:35 < BeaR_> huh
13:35 <@deen> anything else that's unclear or can be improved?
13:36 <@deen> domains like this only work on some OS/browser combinations: http://def-.github.io/nim-brainfuck/brainfuck.html
13:36 <@deen> so i moved it over to http://hookrace.net/nim-brainfuck/brainfuck.html
13:38 < BeaR_> maybe in the metaprogramming section, you could quickly describe what the template is for.
13:40 <@deen> true
13:40 <@deen> i went through that part so quickly because i thought the article is getting too long already
13:46 <@deen> BeaR_: you get a noticifation when I push something to GH?
14:01 <@deen> ddnet people also writes nice guides: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1033&p=9960
14:02 <@EastByte> neat
14:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: the - in the middle is the culprit :)
14:09 <@deen> heinrich5991: i know, and now that i made the github guys aware they will forbid my username^^
14:10 <@heinrich5991> great
14:10 <@heinrich5991> then they'll also forbid my second username :(
14:10 <@EastByte> hm? why?
14:10 <@deen> should i rename "brainfuck" to "brainf" in the article?
14:10 <@deen> someone just complained about it already...
14:13 < Learath2> meh 
14:13 < Learath2> thats the languages name what can you do about it
14:13 <@deen> i wanted to keep it, but if people really are that sensitive
14:17 <@deen> =/
14:17 <@deen> really wanted to choose a non-offensive language, but brainfuck was the best choice!
14:17 <@deen> hi
14:17 < Ama> hi :D
14:20 <@deen> Ama: when I write a serious article, can I use the word "fuck" 100 times?
14:25 <@deen> "Brainfuck is the most famous esoteric programming language, and has inspired the creation of a host of other languages. Due to the fact that the last half of its name is often considered one of the most offensive words in the English language, it is sometimes referred to as brainf***, brainf*ck, brainfsck, b****fuck, brainf**k or BF. This can make it a bit difficult to search for information regarding brainfu
14:25 <@deen> ck on the web, as the proper name might not be used at all in some articles."
14:26 <@deen> i like b****fuck
14:26 < Learath2> Say for the purposes of this article ill refer to it as BF
14:27 <@deen> well, i still have 50 occurences of "brainfuck" then because my package is called brainfuck
14:27 < BeaR_> deen: no don't get notification, just checking the last activities of some people every day ^^
14:27 <@deen> and i don't want to rename it, because how else do you fucking find brainfuck interpreters, if you can't even search for "brainfuck"?
14:29 < Learath2> who could be so butthurt on the internet
14:39 < Muttley> damn i left yesterday and still talking about the bf ;-)
14:39 <@deen> ^^
14:39 <@deen> Muttley: but now i've written the entire article already
14:40 < Muttley> deen, xD
14:40 < BeaR_> deen: is there also a website for the nimble packages? (sth like crates.io) Looking trough the json file in the repository is rather meh /:
14:41 <@deen> BeaR_: http://nim-lang.org/lib.html#official-packages
14:41 <@deen> BeaR_: and someone is working on just what you want
14:42 < BeaR_> ah nice, couldn't find it on the website /:
14:42 <@deen> find out where it should be added so that you would have found it and make a PR
14:44 <@deen> BeaR_: this here is the WIP: https://nim-pkg.svcs.io/#/
14:45 <@deen> but nim needs so many more contributors
14:45 <@EastByte> deen: any idea why this doesn't work in nim? http://pastebin.mozilla.org/8599926
14:45 <@EastByte> the else statement
14:46 <@deen> EastByte: because you assign inbetween, that turns it into a statement instead of an expression
14:46 <@deen> before you had an if-else expression (without the result = false), now it's an if-else statement
14:47 <@EastByte> http://nim-lang.org/manual.html#case-expression
14:47 <@EastByte> there echo is used
14:47 <@EastByte> so that's valid?
14:47 <@deen> interesting, that works
14:48 <@EastByte> also interesting is that it works outside of a function
14:49 <@deen> oh yeah, it's the implicit result variable of the function
14:50 <@deen> looks like a bug, want to report it?
14:50 <@deen> it works with other variables except result
14:50 < Spyker> hello :D
14:50 <@EastByte> not sure whether I know how to describe it correctly
14:50 <@EastByte> also don't know where to report
14:50 <@EastByte> you might do it :D
14:51 < Spyker> guys i opened a tw speedrun channel on youtube
14:51 <@EastByte> cool
14:51 < Spyker> Teeworlds Spyker
14:51 < Spyker> search it if you want :)
14:52 <@deen> next time you do it yourself: https://github.com/Araq/Nim/issues/2084
14:52 < Spyker> i wanted to ask deen if he can put the short speedrun on the website maybe for move views :O
14:52 <@EastByte> deen: okay
14:53 <@deen> I already posted the most bugs ever, not good^^
14:54 < Spyker> deen, did you read my request? :D
14:54 <@deen> Spyker: where's the video?
14:54 <@deen> hi
14:55 < Spyker> deen, hi, on teeworlds spyker (youtube)
14:55 <@deen> link please
14:55 < Spyker> maybe the shorter demo
14:55 < Spyker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK9YRtyRVTQ

14:56 < Spyker> the other is in 1080 but too long i think for ddnet 1st page
14:57 <@deen> you need to have the "bandicam.com" on top?
14:57 <@deen> don't want advertisements on ddnet
14:57 < Spyker> i have to buy license.... i ll do this evening
14:57 <@EastByte> still no video encoder for teeworlds...
14:57 < Spyker> for next videos
14:58 <@deen> there is no free program for video encoding on windows? =/
14:58 < Spyker> but cant remove it from older
14:58 <@EastByte> deen: no acceptable one
14:58 <@deen> ouch
14:58 <@EastByte> shareware everywhere
14:58 < Spyker> yes.... all program make 3 min video in  50 gb or no quality
14:59 < Spyker> this is nice program but need to buy license and since i dont want to buy it only for 7 sub xD
14:59 <@deen> yeah makes sense
14:59 <@deen> video is on ddnet.tw
15:00 < Spyker> thanks man, when i have a bit more subs i ll buy license and remove the shit from up :D
15:00 <@deen> EastByte: oops, turned out not be a bug^^
15:00 < Spyker> bye guys i have to study see ya!
15:00 <@deen> bye Spyker 
15:01 <@EastByte> deen: why not?
15:01 <@deen> you're on #nim, read what araq wrote :P
15:01 <@EastByte> oh
15:02 <@EastByte> ah, didn't fully understand it though
15:03 <@EastByte> I always end up using return...
15:03 <@deen> for example where?
15:04 <@EastByte> well, for example in the paste, I posted here
15:04 <@EastByte> now I'm using an additional var
15:04 <@EastByte> and instead of assigning it to result at the end, return just looks more clear
15:06 <@deen> this is not fine?: https://gist.github.com/def-/07daeda86e9458258020
15:08 <@EastByte> well, let's you have a hundred of cases
15:08 <@EastByte> excluding the num= is looks way better
15:08 <@EastByte> and I havn't used such expressions before so I wanted to test
15:08 <@deen> ok, yeah. in this case can't use resultt hen
15:34 <@EastByte> Warning: 'l' should not be used as an identifier; may look like '1' (one) [SmallLshouldNotBeUsed]
15:34 <@EastByte> neat
15:34 < BeaR_> ^^
15:34 <@deen> haha, yes
15:54 <@heinrich5991> "that is reasonably readable (more so than Rust, C++ and Haskell)"
15:54 <@heinrich5991> more than Haskell? I guess that's debatable :)
15:55 < BeaR_> f = (.).(.).(.) :p
15:57 <@heinrich5991> if you want to obfuscate, you have the chance to do so in many PLs :)
15:58 < BeaR_> sure but often highly depends on what you are used to ^^
15:59 <@deen> heinrich5991: sure, everything i write is debatable. just my opinion after teaching and correcting haskell code for a few years
16:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: if the students had a different PL like java or so, it's not surprising if they find functional PLs unreadable at first
16:00 <@heinrich5991> same goes for the other way around
16:01 <@heinrich5991> depends on whether you're used to think in a mathematical style or procedural style
16:01 <@deen> nono, unreadable for me :P
16:01 <@deen> i mean, it's readable, but even after years of writing more haskell than other languages, it's still harder than nim
16:23 < cris272> yo
16:23 < cris272> fumm is a fucking asshole
16:24 < BeaR_> uhm, what's the matter?
16:26 < cris272> he always block without reason
16:26 < cris272> we was i group of 6-7 player, he played on a other group behind us but faster than us
16:27 < cris272> and when they join us they blocj us
16:27 < cris272> it's not the first time
16:27 <@heinrich5991> :(
16:27 < cris272> i rembember i day he blocket something like 8 tee, and he left
16:31 < cris272> sometimes he is friendly and good, on small group and sometime he is unbearable. well i just wanted to report this guys, i dont know if other player already report him
16:36 <@deen> cris272: i know, he's always like that =/
16:36 <@deen> you can try talking to him, but hasn't worked so far
16:37 < lan> who was it? maple?
16:37 < cris272> :(
16:39 < lan> you cant really do anything about blockers, just remember their name and block them asap
16:39 < lan> when they catch up
16:41 <@EastByte> blocking back actually is a bad idea
16:42 <@EastByte> chain reaction incoming :3
16:53 < lan> not if you go back to block, so that nobody else gets caught in the cossfire.
16:54 <@EastByte> then someone might still notice you blocking
16:54 <@EastByte> and the victim is crying anyways
16:54 <@EastByte> suddenly you are the bad guy :D
16:55 < lan> i dont mind, my conscience is clean :)
16:55 <@EastByte> ^^
16:56 < lan> the teammate might notice. but if your team usually votes no. so its all good
16:57 < lan> gah, that didnt make sense. just woke up. sry
19:36 <@deen> ping to ddnet.tw is a constant 2000 ms for me
19:36 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:37 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 573
19:37 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
20:11 <@deen> meh, have to disable my dyndns, getting too many ddos attacks on my home connection
21:25 <@EastByte> deen: ...
21:59 < o_be_one> hellow
22:00 < o_be_one> im compiling tw client_release in windows but got error : windres command not found
22:00 < o_be_one> maybe you have a hint for me ?
22:02 <@deen> no idea
22:02 < eeeee> o_be_one: you're using cygwin?
22:02 <@deen> never heard of "windres"
22:02 <@deen> o_be_one: are you building vanilla 0.7, vanilla 0.6, ddnet or what?
22:03 < o_be_one> its ok ive removed objs folder and config.lua
22:03 < o_be_one> working now :D
22:03 < o_be_one> thanks a lor ^^
22:03 <@deen> ah, so you had some old config.lua
22:03 < o_be_one> it was TW original
22:03 < o_be_one> yes
22:03 < o_be_one> from a friend running linux
22:03 <@deen> yeah, bam doesn't like that
22:03 < o_be_one> source are from a linux friend :p
22:05 < eeeee> bam should just reconfigure and rebuild everything by default unless told otherwise
22:05 <@deen> eeeee: yes, please make it do that
22:05 < eeeee> would solve a lot of issues for less experienced users
22:09 <@deen> I'm wondering how they keep ddosing my home connection. I'm only on IRC through ddnet.tw and have no dyndns running
22:10 <@deen> the only thing i can think of is scanning my subnet for my mac address. would that work?
22:12 < eeeee> to see your mac address they would have to be on same subnet
22:13 < eeeee> you can also change it
22:13 < eeeee> but yeah it's kind of interesting
22:13 < eeeee> can you share more details?
22:13 < eeeee> like what kind of ddos
22:17 < eeeee> and how are you connected? e.g. if you're using some exotic router it might be easy to identify by nmap-ing the whole subnet
22:17 <@deen> i have the default router everyone gets for free here
22:18 <@deen> i don't know what kind of attack, can't even access the router anymore and have to restart it to get a new ip
22:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you play TW in that time?
22:18 <@deen> nope
22:18 <@deen> and even when I play TW, I only use DDNet tab :P
22:25 < o_be_one> deen, do u have skype ?
22:26 < eeeee> did you also complain to your isp? kinda unlikely but maybe they can do sth
22:26 < o_be_one> maybe they got ip one time and u havent a dyn ip
22:27 <@deen> o_be_one: nope, I'm really only running irc and a web browser all day
22:28 < eeeee> maybe you can try switching the router into bridging mode to get more insight in what's going on
22:45 < o_be_one> curious
