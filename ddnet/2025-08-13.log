00:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat git works surprisingly well if you base follow up PRs on existing unmerged PRs. Just branch of there. They can even be prd at the same time and merged in weird orders and partially replace each other.

06:32 < bridge> <Assa> usually the last grounded not freezed position is saved, but you can be smarter about that and consider time and some hookable positions or save multiple positions and delete the last on rescue

07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> no avx?
07:43 < bridge> <Assa> yes but the base PR would be a bit unstable, since any knew change might force a rebase.
07:44 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^.^
07:59 < bridge> <Assa> this wouldn't save much on setup time, but I don't see much obvious potential in improving quad loading times. I can load billions of quads. It could however slightly improve the performance of rendering itself especially for ogl1

10:47 < bridge> <Assa> no it must be much higher, the mona lisa has more
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> excluding the editor
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> excluding the editor, because it crashes much much earlier than map rendering or the map format

17:06 < bridge> <teero777> can anyone help a bit? im stuck because i want to compile my rust visualizer of a c99 library to wasm, but my libary does use libc and libc isn't in wasm32-unknown-unknown. i can't use emscripten because i get weird internal errors from eframe/egui. have any of you done something like this before?
17:07 < bridge> <teero777> llm says the only option i have is to rewrite the libc functions i use but that would be bloated asf for a small library and would generally be a bad idea because i assume the implementations of cosf, sinf, atan2, powf etc. are not short
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why u get errors from egui?

17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use it to find some info about os dev

17:36 < bridge> <teero777> yea i switch between them often too see which one gives better answers. gpt5 hallucinates a lot after only little conversation
17:37 < bridge> <Assa> you often can ask the ai to give you sources and help you find the insights
17:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
17:37 < bridge> <louis> i thought gpt5 was supposed to be good st not hallucinating lmao
17:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> no, it just hallucinates stuff more professionally now
17:38 < bridge> <Assa> often I use AI just for 1 prompt and don't actually have a conversation

17:39 < bridge> <Assa> maybe it was trained on the fat standard and actually "knows"
17:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ask for a documentary or source of this information, like where it got it from
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405214149918855260/image.png?ex=689e0328&is=689cb1a8&hm=29c5d62e4ea4d8945f409de1f87f6ee5f95abd96fe41c2adb007b1112b4fd309&
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah i just verify it if needed
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> but for things with standards that have lots of pdfs, like the fat32 format
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> its pretty reliable
17:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> true why waste time confirming that the source is real, when you can verify it urself

17:40 < bridge> <Assa> you can actually find it on wikipedia, just not so nice formatted for my taste
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i asked for tables specifically
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz i love tables
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> easy info
17:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Surprisingly AI is very good at procuding the shittiest results in the nicest, most professional way possible
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway i researched a bit up what ppl do with claude, apparently you can have multiple "agents" each defined with a different role and they discusss with each other before giving u an answer, and apparently this results in better results
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if gpt has this
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> just treat ai as a powerful google and its ok

20:04 < bridge> <teero777> 0 man i hate wasm
20:05 < bridge> <teero777> friendship ended with wasm before it started
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> what does it have to do with wasm
20:38 < bridge> <Assa> Thank you Robyt :deen_star:
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Apparently 32 GiB of RAM aren't enough anymore. Firefox takes like 13 GiB idle in the background, then Ubuntu VM takes a few GiB when used and randomly VS Code decides to hang during code completion and takes all remaining memory. This causes the Desktop Window Manager to run out of memory so it keeps crashing as well, because it can't show an error message about memory being low. :pepeW:
21:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> how many tabs do you have open to use 13 gb xd
21:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> running a vm also is expensive
21:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> Idk, 32gb is enough for me
21:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> You can use swap to prevent crashes
21:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> Although i think it's better to just use less ram
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No, we need more RAM.. at least 3 TB
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Per PC
21:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> then all windows ui could be written in react, yey
21:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> Data throughput is still a limited resource even with unlimited RAM
21:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki I'll rewrite an ir for my compiler for the 4th time, surely this time will be the last one :greenthing:
21:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> It seems like CPUs already are like 90% cache lol
21:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> replace all ram with l1 cache
21:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> pure performance
21:56 < bridge> <chairn> you'll need quite a lot of power and of cooling to do that
21:56 < bridge> <chairn> something around like 20kw iirc
21:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> But it would be worth it
21:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> take it to space
21:57 < bridge> <chairn> not really, access time would also increase dramatically
21:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> I think we need 3D CPUs
21:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> A flat surface is quite limiting
21:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> 3D gives you infinitely more possibilities
22:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's an interesting bug
22:07 < bridge> <chairn> 3D chip is also surprisingly hard to make cuz current silicon technology was designed for 2D chip
22:10 < bridge> <teero777> cube cpu
22:10 < bridge> <pilonpl> It would be so cool
22:11 < bridge> <chairn> it would be so hot, it's almost impossible to extract heat out of a cube
22:12 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's why you'd have to have holes for water cooling
22:12 < bridge> <pilonpl> Btw why do CPUs get so hot
22:12 < bridge> <pilonpl> And why do they use so much power
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs transistors
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> their heat output scales by square or smth
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> increase a bit of voltage and you have a lot more heat
22:16 < bridge> <chairn> P_dyn = C\*V\*F^2
22:16 < bridge> <chairn> or CV^2F
22:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> But there are also power efficient CPUs
22:16 < bridge> <chairn> C is capacity of the chip (in Farad), V is power voltage, F is frequency of the chip
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then they slow
22:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> I am sure it makes sense somehow
22:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> But it still feel weird how my PC required fans all the time
22:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> But phones can just work
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It doesn't
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It will just be slow
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Pretty much all modern desktop cpus have rather good overheat protection
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well my ryzen 9950x3d burnt to death
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i'd say it was not my fault üòâ
22:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> So how did it burn
22:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> If there are protections
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it most likely is a bug in the commuication between motherboard and cpu
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can read the asrock subreddit if you want to go that rabbit hole
22:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> Wow that's actually interesting
22:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> I have 0 idea how it works
22:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> CPUs have so many pins
22:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> I wonder how they're used
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean i dunno what you want to know. i also only have a slight overview
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but there are VRMs on the motherboard that need to very quickly change voltage depending on what the CPU needs etc.
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> VRMs are what makes a good motherboard good vs bad
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> VRMs are what makes a motherboard good vs bad
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You might hear of how nice the USB slots are etc. but VRMs are what e.g. overclockers care more about

22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @pilonpl if you have a ryzen 5000+.
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The safest option to overclock is to undervolt.
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It won't go above the spec clock, but it will more easily hold the CPU clock high, bcs less voltage => less heat => easier for the CPUs to not throttle
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Undervolting also doesn't really dmg anything, but can lead to unstable operating
22:28 < bridge> <pilonpl> Or just don't change anything
22:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> And it's probably good enough
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's more effective to buy a modern PC üòÑ
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah, it's also fun to see how much more % you can squeeze out of your hardware
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With undervolting you easily get 5% without much trouble
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> -20mv
22:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> Nowadays i think even cheap CPUs are great?
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CPUs generally are rather good
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But GPUs differ extremly
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The iGPUs from intel just almost all suck
22:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> GPUs are terrible
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah even for CPU depends on task
22:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> Way too expensive
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 16 cores is defs nice compared to 8 for developing
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For gaming it wont matter
22:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok this was wrong, fixed some waker stuff
22:38 < bridge> <chairn> 90% are for dram though or PCIe interface
22:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> takes a lot to reach like 100GB/s bandwidths
22:39 < bridge> <chairn> remaining ones are mostly power pins
22:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah something that big can't get all its power from one pin, having that much power electronics inside the chip would be foolish
22:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah something that big can't get all its power from two pins, having that much power electronics inside the chip would be foolish
22:40 < bridge> <pilonpl> I know nothing about electricity
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I hope we get smth better than transistors soon.
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The performance is already declining per year
22:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't know much about this sort of electronics, but the idea is that it's really hard to keep your voltage stable when your device is switching that quickly
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't want to die before the next big thing üò¨
22:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like, different instructions need different parts of the chip, and the power draw can fluctuate a lot even on like microsecond scale
22:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> Okay i guess
22:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's not obvious what is consuming power in a CPU
22:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> Transistors surely
22:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> But it feels like it should be basically free
22:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think it's mostly just resistance of like *everything*
22:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there are like a bazillion miles of wire inside a CPU
22:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> all of that has resistance
22:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> Well that's unfortunate
22:45 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's why superconductors are awesome
22:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> igpus are great for transcoding video streams.
22:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> people have theorized carbon chips that would have much lower resistance and better heat conductivity
22:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> big problem is nobody has any idea how to make them lol
22:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> silicon isn't exactly the greatest heat conductor
22:48 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is it even possible to make something much better in terms of performance?
22:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> in theory yeah much better
22:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> current CPUs aren't even *that* limited by density, though scaling things smaller still helps
22:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> power density is a really big issue too
22:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you just made a chip as dense as you felt like, it'd heat up so quickly that it'd be impossible to keep cool
22:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> Time complexity is what's annoying. You can have the fast CPU in the world and you could still choke it with a n^2 algorithm
22:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> Why is reality so annoying?
22:51 < bridge> <teero777> @totar im not the only one you see?
22:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and NP is probably not P so rip bozo
22:52 < bridge> <totar> ?
22:52 < bridge> <teero777> i ranted a few days ago in vc didn't i?
22:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> quantum computers can help... if it's even possible to make one that stays coherent
22:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> how does an instruction set for a quantum processor looks like
22:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> is there even one
22:53 < bridge> <louis> yes
22:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> There are quantum gates
22:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> uhhh
22:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a bunch of wacky quantum gates that do like fun complex number operations on your qubits
22:53 < bridge> <louis> watch the 3blue1brown video it was pretty interesting for a noob like me
22:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> basically you replace all your bits with these funny complex number things (is it just a pair of complex numbers or was it more involved than that?)
22:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> And then magically n^2 becomes n
22:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's a really good magic trick ngl
22:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> all your inputs and outputs are still normal classical bits, but the internal state of the computer gets really wacky
22:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> random number generator xd
22:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah, some hardware RNGs (maybe even most?) use quantum mechanical effects to produce randomness
22:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> I think lava lamps are the best way
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> lava lamps are a really fun way
23:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is there some good video about video codecs?
23:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> I've seen some about images
23:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> But video would be interesting
23:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah my Firefox has been sitting at like 12GB lately but I just have a shitload of tabs. ironically since I've had 64GB I've rarely used VMs whatsoever
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how zed compares to vscode when it comes to memory, but it's worth a try
23:07 < bridge> <Ewan> I haven't really missed any extensions so far minus weird specific things like a postgres db viewer
23:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> Zed is meant to be native and fast and responsive so it's probably decent
23:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> zed is nice if you are not on windows
23:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> comparing to vscode it feels extremely fast
23:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> uses ~3 less memory for me
23:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> but it also depends on language servers
23:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust analyzer can just eat 4 gb at least
23:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> zed ran just fine on windows if you self compile
23:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> my friend had lots of issues
23:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> but it was a few months ago
23:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> what kind of issues :o - i've been using zed on and off for a year now on both linux and windows now
23:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> what kind of issues :o - i've been using zed on and off for a year now on both linux and windows
23:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: nice find. Btw I edited your issue to include empty lines around the video links so they get a preview
23:27 < bridge> <Aoe> Didn't know how to do a preview, but now I do. Ty!!
23:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> language server issues
23:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> auto complete is not consistent and does not always show up
23:29 < bridge> <Aoe> Hmm, no I actually don't. How did you make the preview?
23:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: links to images and videos get a preview if there is an empty line before and after the link
23:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> which lang, rust?
23:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> c++ can be annoying if you dont use (c)make to generate the paths for clangd
23:30 < bridge> <Aoe> Gotcha, thanks üôÇ
23:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> i suppose js/ts
23:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont really wanna bother him with these questions rn
23:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> he uses vscode for now but still likes zed
23:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> zed holds a special place in my heart
23:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> first rust project i took a deeper look into
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> i want to learn vim
23:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> `h j k l z y p u b B a w W`
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> especially vim motions
23:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> gz, you learned vim
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
23:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> i hate hjkl movement
23:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> maybe my fingers are short
23:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> but it just does not feel right
23:34 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> xd try emacs!
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> emacs is an operating system
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> change my mind
23:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> a friend of mine writes his emails in emacs
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> but i also looked into helix
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> written in
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> guess what
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmao
23:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> helix is nice, but i'm not a big fan of their standpoint towards a plugin ecosystem
23:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah same
23:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> they want everything vim has without the thing that vim does
23:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> it's.. a horrible discussion
23:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> vim but no customization and no vim motions
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's also nice on windows
23:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it's only officially supported on MSVC, but msys2 packages it, and it's worked perfectly for me so far with the only exception being it can't find git & won't let you set a path to it manually
23:38 < bridge> <Ewan> zed has a whole company behind it as well as lots of incoming OSS contributions, it's moved rapidly in the past months so maybe your friend could consider trying it again
