04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is there an FNG repo that I can clone, that works for DDnet? I found one for teeworlds, but I can't test it with DDnet
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> you can ask the alive clan. I know you can't use noby's version
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I found Juppey's 0.6 FNG build
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> teeworlds-fng2-mod by Jupeyy
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> fng_06 branch
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i know
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Another question: If I were to add a unique particle image into this FNG build, would I put it in the data folder in the build?
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> To client?
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Or what
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I mean, I want the fng edit i'm working on to have a certain particle that's not in the original game.
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh nevermind it's untracked for some reason
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1046652808499310683/image.png
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Add it to the data folder, add path to datasrc.py, set its name and grid args and rebuild project to see new item in pacricles array
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> o-
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> If i understood right what you need to do
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :nouis:
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Add it to the data folder, add path to datasrc.py, set its name and grid args and rebuild project to see new item in particles array
06:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> Intresting that people still do something with fng in terms of modding it
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I think there was a new mod called dfng recently
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> there isnt much to mod really
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> some one made like 4 player fng
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> There were few teams, zooz and smth else, i dont remember
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> ik there is god fng and boom fng
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> but they all suck
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Never saw god fng wtf :monkalaugh:
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> Depends, in the past 13years I mostly played fng and enjoyed new Versions
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> played it like once
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> idk if people are still hosting it
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i havent played in like 4 months
06:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its hosted on rrt servers afaik
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes this mod is still actively developed
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats it going to be üëÄ
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I feel like rrt gonna become next kog eventually üíÄ
06:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or worse .. gores may be unfun but at least they put good effort into protecting the servers from bots and vpn users
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think its easier to just make a quick animated concept rather than coding it
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> one second
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> alr
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im about to sleep tho
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I would use after effects for nay kind of editing:justatest: , coding is just too much
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> speaking of which is there a way for me to host a server on an old pc without putting myself at risk of ddos?
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u have dynamic ip?
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> probably not
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then no not really
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> üò¶
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Sweet dreams üòò
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just get a free trial vps from oracle or smth
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can use free tier for a long time i believe
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Well the whole point was to not have to use some service
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i have the old pc i might as well use it
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought the whole point was to not pay
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I got 1 year of azure for 1$
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yea stuff like that
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my fng small server used to be a google cloud free tiral for the first year
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Dr.Funmanteddy hosting the server uses very little computational resources, theres no reason it cant be on ur actual pc, its just that it puts ur network at risk
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> You can host something more ddos safe, some discord bots for example :monkalaugh:
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> But actually home servers mostly useless
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh, you're sleeping? rip, i'll just post the concept sketch then
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i want to replace the laser numbers with actual numbers
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1046660338357112842/image.png
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> want to try to sleep within the next 10-15 min i have to wake up for work tmrw and i didnt sleep yesterday
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> im not sure it will work out anyway as the hard drive is broken and its from 2004 so no sata port. Turns out ide harddrives are expensive af and are shitty
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does the fng2 mod still have the laser numbers support?
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the one i got? yea
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh.. idk but ur best bet will be a free service like oracle since it wont let ddos affect ur own network and will also give peopel better ping
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ah ok
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Dont you have prerecorded demos on other fng2, or you gonna make fake epic clips:monkalaugh:
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Voxel im wondering if thats something that u should make for the client rather than the server
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> at least in the sense that most of the work would be done on client side
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> an optional setting to render score increases as a numer like that
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well, i want to fully plan out what i want it to look like first, and then learn how to treat particles
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well sounds interesting either way
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just trying to imagine how i might approach the problem
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and doing it on client side would mean that old mods dont need to be updated and that people can choose whether to enable it or not
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> heres what i plan on making the grid
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1046661747962032158/scorenum.png
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this could be used for vanilla and other pvp gametypes as well
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> as an optional setting
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah maybe
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ~~IF HEINRICH ALLOWS IT~~
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ~~just trying to convince u to do it that way so i dont have to update my servers again xd~~
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ~~fair enough~~
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> So you want to add graphics for pvp modes to ddnet, but not planning on making graphics for custom server menus:nouis:
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what is custom server menus
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Transfer menus from call votes to more cool menus
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think Ravie already did something for that
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Call votes are not for menus ‚úã ‚ùå
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like in monster mod and stuff
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Dunno, i only saw custom windowing system in MRPG mod for 0.7
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean weapons arent supposed to be used to render npcs either
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh didnt play that one
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Probably cuz of snap limit
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no theres nothing wrong with it
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just that its repurposing an existing feature to make a mod
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :justatest:
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like votemenu
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I played few mods with just too many npcs and some of them were invisible due to some snap thing
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not sure how it decides which ones to snap, if it goes by closest like it does for tees
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if it does then i wonder which mods youre playing that have 512+ weapons rendered around u lol
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I mean not weapons, characters :monkalaugh:
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats a harder limit
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 64 tees is hard coded in a lot of places
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> That sucks
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and u cant reuse the tee id
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can reuse identities/ids of tees that are out of range like i do with my fake tee system but u cant truly render 64+tees at once with default client afaik
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Teeworlds is so poorly made for expansion, all those hardcoded numbers...
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i agree but i think there was a reason for this
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> something to do with how past this point it makes certain physics calculations more inefficient
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also the part where u can store 64 tees as a bitmask in uint64_t
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for keeping track of state and other thigns like this
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also the part where u can store 64 tees as a bitmask in uint64_t which fits nicely into a single register on most pcs
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> (pinging just in case)
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i imagine something like this idk
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1046669918986326066/FNG_SCORENUM_TEST.mp4
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> made sloppily in adobe animate
07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I imagine this more like server and client side thing, from server you send packet where and what numbers to display and client renders them
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont think ill program it tbh, im already getting side tracked from doing 3 other things
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I dont think that really fits with the aesthetic
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> maybe im too used to the old way
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> people say that with a lot of old ddnet stuff but yet they change anyways
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> it just seems so in your face and distracting
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i would have to play with it tho
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well rn its kinda ugly

12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Does anyone know if CF is allowed in CHN? or is it banned?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Does anyone know if Cloudflare is allowed in CHN? or is it banned?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Narke> https://developers.cloudflare.com/china-network/faq/#:~:text=As%20a%20US%20company%2C%20Cloudflare,provide%20CDN%20services%20in%20China.
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> This only handles onboarding, but I am more interested in "Is content on R2 available in CHN"
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> NVM, its only available for enterprise accounts in CF
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Sad
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Narke> yea entreprise accounts
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Narke> and if you pass directly with the jd cloud website ? not with cloudflare ? idk the price but maybe a solution ? @Avolicious
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Yeah, but maintaining two different sources is always a mess
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Narke> that true XD
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Have to rethink the system for CHN then, thanks anyway
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Narke> yep . good luck !
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh noes
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill get a mac laptop for my new job

19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tokyo.> Can anyone send a private v3 discord?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Is there a website where i can see all servers registered on ddnet master servers
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I know status.tw, but its for tw masters
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I love reading raw json, thanks :feelsbadman:
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gewinum> nice
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gewinum> well you can parse it
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> what did you expect
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon tm
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I expected nice ui, im from mobile and thats why didnt want to look into json
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://status.tw/
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://status.tw/
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> ^
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> oh, did not fully read lol
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it should be map specific
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cuz not every map will fit with standard +10 +5  +3 -5
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @gerdoe lol
