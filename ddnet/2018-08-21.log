08:20 <@deen> Learath2: Plans to also fix fng2, i/gctf+, foot and bomb? Also could you apply your patches to Brazil too? It's back online now
08:23 <+Learath2> deen: couldn't find a source repo for foot, fng2 are we running Jupeyy's?, i/gctf I'll do soon, didn't even know we ran bomb, brazil I'll do now

09:04 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master e2eb4a6 Dennis Felsing: Add Filter for connecting players (fixes #1263)
09:04 <+Learath2> fixed fng2
09:06 <@deen> Great, not sure where to find foot, I think it was tee ball or something
09:08 <+Learath2> deen: well I have other things to do today, might do gctf tonight
09:09 <@deen> I'd like to release new client now
09:09 <@deen> then we have filter on (connecting) players by default
09:09 <@deen> and people should be a bit less annoyed
09:10 <@deen> Ryozuki: hi. wanna write release notes? :D
09:10 <+Ryozuki> ok
09:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fAJy8
09:11 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 63c7105 Dennis Felsing: Version 11.4
09:12 <+Learath2> deen: is a filter for (connecting) a good idea?
09:12 <@deen> yeah
09:12 <@deen> because most servers won't get fixed 
09:12 <+Ryozuki> yes
09:12 <@deen> and no one wants to see 16/64 counts everywhere
09:13 <+Learath2> does it modify the number of players?
09:13 <@deen> of course the proper fix is fixing the server, but we can only do that for our own and publish the patched sources on github.com/ddnet
09:13 <@deen> yes
09:13 <@deen> I have done the same for ddnet.tw/status a few days ago, works fine so far
09:13 <+Learath2> not being able to connect to 0/64 0/16 servers might be weirder, no?
09:14 <@deen> If you filter out full servers they'll be removed anyway
09:14 <@deen> so they're full and empty at the same time
09:14 <+Learath2> I see
09:15 <+Ryozuki> was this spoofing obvious at the time of creating early teeworlds versions?
09:15 <+eeeee> yes
09:15 <+Ryozuki> lol
09:15 <+Learath2> xAngel was the first one to create a tool for all the kids I think
09:16 <+Learath2> he also created a tool to spam with bad packets which dropped everyone authed on rcon
09:16 <+eeeee> let's not acknowledge anyone's credit in creating these tools
09:16 <+Ryozuki> can't heinrich release a new patched vanilla version?
09:16 <@deen> yeah, but heinrich wanted another fix first
09:17 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/500
09:19 <+Ryozuki> how many time it takes for the website to update and show new version?
09:19 <+Learath2> seconds
09:19 <+Learath2> usually
09:19 <@deen> I'm still compiling
09:19 <+Ryozuki> ah
09:19 <@deen> my server is some 5 W machine so give it some time :D
09:19 <+Ryozuki> :D
09:20 <@deen> actually 10 W with 4 cores
09:20 <+Ryozuki> i see heinrich doesnt want credit, Learath2 u want?
09:22 <+Learath2> where?
09:22 <@deen> on /downloads/
09:22 <+Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
09:22 <+Learath2> oh the changelog, no need
09:32 <@deen> Learath2: could you rsync the missing teehistorian files for ger2 to ger.ddnet.tw:teehistorian/data/ger2 ? I didn't notice that it always failed the ssh authentication :D
09:43 <+Ryozuki> done
09:43 <@deen> Thanks!
09:44 <@deen> You should write Changelog [Ryozuki] :D
09:44 <+Ryozuki> haha
09:44 <+Ryozuki> altho some commit messages are confusing, "Forgot to remove ASan"
09:44 <@deen> address sanitizer I assume, so nothing relevant for players
09:44 <+Ryozuki> yeah i didnt add it
09:45 <@deen> except that we might want to provide a version with ASan enabled so that players can try to find memory bugs
09:47 <+Ryozuki> made a little fix
09:47 <+Ryozuki> damn now i see a ; there xD
09:48 <+Ryozuki> ok now
09:48 <+Ryozuki> sry
09:48 <@deen> Is this some elaborate plan to make me give you push permissions to ddnet-web? :D
09:48 <+Ryozuki> no lol xD
09:57 <+Ryozuki> https://hastebin.com/durapiwiwi.apache this guy was clearly not trying to do something malicious
09:59 <@deen> just some automated script to look for vulnerabilities, quite normal
12:25 <+Ryozuki> i think update button doesn't appear
12:26 <+Ryozuki> and i downloaded 11.4 and it says 11.3.1 is out
14:42 <@deen> Ryozuki: we heard that a few times already, then your client somehow can't access https://info.ddnet.tw/info
14:42 <@deen> Some firewall? We never figured out why same guy on discord had the problem
14:43 <+Ryozuki> i can see it on the web browser
14:43 <@deen> But your client can't access it, what does it say on command line?
14:43 <@deen> there should be some debug output about downloading /info
14:45 <+Ryozuki> the only weird thing i see is:
14:45 <+Ryozuki> [2018-08-21 14:44:09][console]: executing 'settings_ddnet.cfg'
14:45 <+Ryozuki> [2018-08-21 14:44:09][console]: No such command: conn_timeout_protection.
14:45 <@deen> on ddnet tab press refresh
14:45 <@deen> what does it show about downloading /info then?
14:45 <+Ryozuki> no output
14:47 <@deen> Even in release build it should show
14:48 <+Learath2> [2018-08-21 15:48:19][http]: http https://info.ddnet.tw/info?name=Learath2
14:48 <+Learath2> looks like that

21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tried to read my /root/spoof.conf
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and it failed
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably permissions thing
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes.
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so its only the user of the tw server
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which isnt the whole filesystem
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it still is a vulnerability. thing should be a whitelist, not a blacklist
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo it would be better to allow it to have bette rcontrol about the exec command
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you considered using symlinks?
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have that control
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk baut symlinks
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, maybe learn about themâ€¦? ^^
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mimimi

21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yay

21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @heinrich5991 do your fix also prevent going through laser door?
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they use the same code
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> then you broke at least a map
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> michler

21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ddmax
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ddmax
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> final part you fall down through laser door
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> apparently not
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> im sure there was a map where oyu had to fall through a door
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and Runaway map has a secret room that you can only access by falling though stoppers

22:14 <@heinrich5991> deen: I don't know how to shut down a ddnet server location, could you do that for FRA?
22:14 <@heinrich5991> (it would be best if you could keep the server online for a little while after all tw servers closed, so that we can still pull the teehistorian files)
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i fucking hate heinrich5991
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @heinrich5991 what about the time on old map with tele skip?
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> now it's not possible anymore
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Chairn which one?
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> cant find it
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Dozens of maps
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> broken
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i know it happend very often on an oldschool one
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i wonder how u can be so ****
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> DDNet is fucked up
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> useless shit
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i hope u all die and especially heinrich this ugly piece of faggot shit dies before he fully destroy DDRace
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I rq
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess that's not a big loss
22:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, he demonstrated just before he leftâ€¦
22:31 <@deen> heinrich5991: ok
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Thats not how it should be expressed but i can understand why he is so angry
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> changing physics of DDRace is a bad thing and i really dont like it
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [he's had problems expressing himself in civil terms before]
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see where you're coming from
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's downsides to changing physics
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> if you would explain the community what are the bugs you are going to fix i guess the majority dont want it fixed
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> such as: maps possibly not working anymore/certain speedruns no longer possible
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> no
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are the downsides you have in mind?
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> its about The changing itself
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm.
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> who are you even that you affect DDRace without asking the community they like it?
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i doubt they would if you explain them what will change
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think a complete aversion to any change helps ddnet
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think a complete aversion to any change doesn't help ddnet
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> using this special physics to make some funny things (yes also little skips are an important part of DDRace) and they are also be in use for special kinds of parts
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Whats the Problem with these physics?
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Xusep> whats the change?
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I dont see any
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you can't fly through stoppers with high speed anymore @Xusep
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Xusep> :feelsbadman:
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> That destroy a lot of maps
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (note that going *into* stoppers is still supported)
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I dont understand how you are unable to understand this
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Xusep> it was nice to get trapped into stoppers for unlimited dj :GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan: :heartw:
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i dont talk about going into stoppers
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Being able to cross doors and stoppers should keep being a part of DDRace
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when I create a map, I don't want to keep all the bugs of ddnet in mind
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I would guess that every special case, every bug, is a hinderance for new players to learn the game
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> For new maps testers have to see the possibility of cheating and on old maps its already used where you cant know of rank1 is still beatable there now
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could get stuck in stoppers in some maps, due to that bug
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it happened to me
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Then you should create a NEW bugfree stopper tile
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> like with ht
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Xusep> are there new players? :GWsetmyxPeepoCry:
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if ddnet fails to attract any new players, it'll certainly die at some point ^^
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Kobra 2 rank1 is unbeatable now
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i think on Kobra 2 solo too
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Xusep> cheating maps is an attraction for me lol its like outsmarting the mapper
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Xusep> but i guess thats not the point of ddr
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think the compromise that Wombat suggested makes sense
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it is a bad idea to do this
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Since we can't know where people flew through stoppers, we should enable the new stopper behaviour for all new maps
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I think its the best idea
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But we did the same thing for all other physics changes
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> See old shotgun, new shotgun
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (not last due to [10:41 PM] heinrich5991: you could get stuck in stoppers in some maps, due to that bug)
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Old hookthrough, new hookthrough
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> you cant now how many maps you just destroyed now
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> old teleport weapons too
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> It's important to help noobs and prevent bugs
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these were hard changes though
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But it's also important to keep it possible to beat old top times
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Is shotgun bug fixed on new maps?
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you might be talking about different shotgun bugs (I dunno)
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> And what about other servers that consume ddnet source code? They might be surprised by this change and forced to maintain a fork
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe I was a bit too quick to merge the change, but I guess it's not running on official servers yet
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> If you doing this compromise i said i would be very glad
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I'm sure they will let us know if that patch prevents anything
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Still tons of affected maps
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i dont like changing this in general
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are different concerns: we want to keep map times beatable etc.
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also have another concern: it should be easy for players, mappers to understand the physics
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Yes but its impossible to find all the maps
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think a stopper you can pass through is counter-intuitive
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Keep it as a feature
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean if we want to try so hard, we could probably do itâ€¦
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> part of why teehistorian exists
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> no
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> teehistorian exists for i dont know 1year?
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> affected maps are 5 years old
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Believe me as a 10 years player
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see, that's the problem, we're all 10 years players here
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hardly any new players coming in
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> You never play :D
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I play from time to time, I have not recently played, that is true
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> And i think its easier to explain new players that there is a bugged version of a tile and a fixed one
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> but try to explain them why some strange thing works on some maps and on some not
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think so. I think it would be easier to have one working version of the tile
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that can be alleviated by giving a hint to the player ingame
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want this
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> thats the reason why you added a new hooktrough tile instead of placing them instead of
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but it didn't make things *easier* for players
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now they have to know the physics of 2 hookthrough tiles
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (one doesn't allow to hook if you're right next to the block)
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> ...
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g.
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> If you want a clean and reasonable version of DDNet for new players then a rewrite sounds like a good approach. I think for DDNet it's more important to keep compatibility and keep the current players
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> You still dont understand that there are so many maps :/
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rewrites never work(tm)
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> At workI'm in a team doing a rewrite of our database execution engine, don't say that ðŸ˜„
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it seems that our goals for the project diverge there :/
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I also dont like that you change such known thing without even tell people about
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> nobody looks in this chat
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/58
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (there is/was a news piece in the making)
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But that's just about unfinishable maps, right?
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> And as i said there are a lot maps using some special physics (ofc often as skip) and people will rq when they fuck up their time because its suddenly broken
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. it describes the change though(?)
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> So if they're still finishable but you take 1 minute longer, then bad luck
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> lmao
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> only a coder think that a player who only wants to play DDNet looks on github what changed
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (note that you should interpret deen's statement with quotation marks)
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Yes deen
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Wombat those changes will be published on ddnet.tw automatically
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and into the client)
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, i do that manually
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh ok
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I have some rank 1 done by this physics
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> thank you for saving my rank for ever :feelsamazingman:
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> At the start of DDNet I did make some breaking physics changes though
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> before the first finishes were done
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Who cares then
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> like fixing doors after team restart
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so if this change came back then it would be 100% ok
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> But now you affect so many maps and ranks :/
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> So please do it as a new tile
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it were a new tile, it would be entirely properly coded and you couldn't go inside of it, I guess
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I guess it's like C++ and Rust. In C++ they also can't change anything that breaks existing code, instead they create new features on top
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> @heinrich5991 thats okay i think. I mean if you want buggy features use a buggy tile :D
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (i.e. that was not the point of the fix. the point of the fix was to fix the stopper tile while retaining reasonable backward compatibility)
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I donate 50â‚¬ to DDNet if this change will be deleted ðŸ™„ ðŸ¤”
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but after hearing the counter arguments from the players we're not keeping 100% compatibility
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. retaining everything except the behavior that was annoying
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's what a physics change is
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now the right question to ask would be how much it breaks/fixes
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bridge is back?
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> irc had such a peace
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we can't do physics changes, except when they allow you to stay at least as fast in every case. for example jetpack was made faster at some point to improve prediction, thus old ranks were easy to beat
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Otherwise when we fix a bug in a map why are we deleting the cheated ranks?
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> If you are about a pool of maps and ranks you can control its okay
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> @deen you do that when you are 100% sure its cheated
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> okay except Konsti rank1 there was no Proof needed
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> XD
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah in c++ u see lot of new functions having _s at end due to thread safety
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Wombat We should make the best decisions for the community independent of bribes ðŸ˜„
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> :feelsbadman:
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> But its the best thing for community
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so. you feel that it's affecting a significant share of the maps and should thus be rolled back?
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Wombat that money can control what decisions are being made? ^^
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Personally I don't know how many maps are affected, I haven't been racing actively since before DDNet was started
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Or do you think players will be happy not being able to beat a rank 1?
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> So I have to trust the judgement of those who race
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> And u cant know if the rank is even cheated
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> @deen a lot of old maps are affected and maps like GetSpeed2 and brainduck are unfinishable
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would add a new tile and tell testers to not accept new maps with old
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so people on other communities can use old tile too
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they want
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Kobra 2 has unbeatable rank1 for example
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people in other communities can also use the mapbug infrastructure if they absolutely want that bug
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or they can talk to us. I don't think that alternative community exists)
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not sure that thing is easily configurable
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but they have to add each map hashsum
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can modify the map as well, as you requested, back when it was added
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> People should be still allowed to use old tile in maps
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Because as heinrich said if new tile he completely fix the new stoppers
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> But the physics of old stoppers are nice for maps
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you evaluate community feedback, @deen? it seems we don't have a useful method for htat
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Talk to people ðŸ˜„
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i wouldnt care about difficulty for new players
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if u do this it will still be a difficult and niche game
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to put effort to enter and like this game
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still remember the emojis debacle, where we both have a majority for and against emojis in the client
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Listen to their arguments, think about them
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Majority isn't that important, arguments are
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I dont see any active player wants stoppers fixed
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> especially old players
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't count as a player I guess, because I play more rarely than others?
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> "Majority" can be easily manipulated in our case, we won't be able to implement fair elections, that's a much harder problem
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> I gave you a lot of good arguments :feelsbadman:
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I understand your desire to make DDNet cleaner and easier for newcomers
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and those are good goals, just not above everything else
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks. that actually helped I think. you're the first one to say that
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I dunno, it shouldn't even help :/
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> what shouldn't help?
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nvm. you're showing that you read what I said, that's a good thing I guess
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u want to make teeworlds easier for newcomers u should continue timakro tutorial implementation
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/612
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's more than one place where making ddnet clearer can be done ^^
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki eh, don't tell people who work on a feature that's important to them that they should work on what's important for you
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still think this is a very niche game and hard even if you tell obvious things
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Whats you are going to do now heinrich
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> -s
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well in my opinion fixing stoppers wont make it "lot" more friendly
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> But break a lot things
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the harder thing for newcomers to understand is that they can hook between corners, which is a bug
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hardest*
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and was fixed in TW ðŸ˜„
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> break a few maps and break a (so far undetermined) amount of speedrunning
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in tw 0.7. not sure if that will ever come out
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Its not about a few maps..
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> physically-wise hammer-flying shouldnt be possible
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my eng sucks
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not? you think there are many maps that need skipping through stoppers, @Wombat ?
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Oh
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i maybe know 3
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> if doors are also "fixed"
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, they are
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Thats bad
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I discovered they use the same physics as stoppers do
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> that break even more speedruns
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in some maps u can skip doors
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> depending on the way they are placed
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> lol thats easy to see that they have same physics
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Stoppers are very hard to skip
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doors are easier
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> doors are very easy to skip
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> doors are as easy to skip like blockers
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and door skip is used
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> the tile which stops in every direction
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they consist of all-way-stoppers
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway, I'm off for bed for tonight. good night
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> speeders are also bugged
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and those bugged speeders are used in lot of maps
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> true
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where u hold d and u go full stop but when u release it u get lot of speed
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Even in new maps
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's actually not speeder's bug, but a speed bug ðŸ˜„
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this trick is used lot more
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can reach the same effect with rockets, and a little bit of patience
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> this speed bug is also doable with a long way with rocket or with shotgunrun
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not sure
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> don't know if u know what im talking about
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did it on race servers long ago
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and good night ðŸ˜„
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a shotgun bug where u shoot another tee and then jump
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Good night, I'm off too
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gn
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Yes this
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i hope heinrich dreams about how evil his fix is and fix The fix tomorrow :GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan:
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> i hope heinrich dreams about how evil his fix is and fix The fix tomorrow :feelsgoodman:
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkobot> @heinrich5991 add a prediction for laser walls, this weird bubbling is not cool
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkobot> ive read some of the messages here and @heinrich5991 im also not a big fan of the new behaivour. Its like you dont like the teleport gun. But this right here breaks maps, as @Wombat told many times.
