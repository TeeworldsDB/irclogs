13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any1 motivated to have a look at my client dummy to 0.7 port? Seems like i messed up some details and it glitches a bit
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> show me
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ZillyWoods/ZillyWoods/pull/19
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ZillyWoods/ZillyWoods/pull/19/files#diff-c54ea30d8c95814c33b60fe2e04a9ef3R552
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no need for loop here, just use m_NetClient[0] in here
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> > Seems like i messed up some details and it glitches a bit
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what exactly?
14:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It seems like somewhere i messed/mixed up dummy and main ids
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so things like reset on switch behaves very odd and fire inputs are swapped and thus cuaisng firing on dumm swithc
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do you know why connecting and disconnecting is so bad?
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it isnt smooth at all
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut maybe related to security tokens or the id problem but idk
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Oh man
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> ChillerDragon
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I talked about that weird delay bug when i move or hook long time ago
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I repaired it
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice!
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Just by copying some lines of text from settings_ddnet file from other player without that bug and copied to my client
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?xd
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I just copied gfx things from someone's settings_ddnet.cfg file to my settings file and delay just disappeared xd
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I just want to say that here for other people that could have this bug
15:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Ofc that person i got the file from agreed to do that***
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> That note xxD
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you know how to get settings of others without their agree, tell me. Interest has totally legit reasons :justatest:
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really should clean up all the gfx options
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo fello bash mains any idea why my regex matches the first url twice but not the second?

16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fellow*
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ok nvm got it. BASH_REMATCH works differently than i expected got it now ðŸ™‚
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Can anyone help me
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> When i hold shift i cant do anything
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> My emote wheel doesnt show up
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I didnt do anything
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> thats due to ddos
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Ofc
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Ddos = shift locking my keyboard
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is possible that it's because of that pull request that I didn't understand but was merged ðŸ˜›
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Umm k
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> If you mean sticky keys or something, i tried disabling/enabling it
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ah, i thought only eye wheel render
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ah, i thought only eye wheel doesnt render
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> It happens only in teeworlds tho
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I tried "unbind lshift" but it did nothing
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Maybe there is a key shortcut that does that
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Idk
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you try binding it to something else
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I juat tried it
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Not working
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You bound +emote right?
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I tried bind lshift +jump
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So your leftshift isnt working for some reason
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> It isn't only in teeworlds
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [6:24 PM] Noe: It happens only in teeworlds tho
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that's confusing ðŸ˜„
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Sec
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Let me edit
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> It isn't working only in teeworlds
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Better
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Two things, What OS are you on? Can you try the previous version?
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Windows 10
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-12.7.2-win64.zip is the last version
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Im downloading 12.6 rn
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Same thing happens
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Left shift locks my keyboard
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Right shift is working tho
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's something about your setup rather then ddnet. I'm not really familiar with windows10
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not really familiar with windows at all
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Okay
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I'll try to search for the fix on google xd
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Ok so
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Shift + ctrl + D/Q/E etc. are working
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> The only thing i found on internet was keyboard ghosting, but i dont think anything could keyboars ghost me randomly when in game
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Also I tried another keyboard and it has same problem
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> i didnt found any fix or even a reason of this problem on internet
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Ffs xd
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> Omg
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> My inp_ignored_modifiers was 1 and it caused that
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I switched it to 0 and it started working
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> What even is that
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I switched it to 0 and my shift started working
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Noe> I dont even know why i had this on 1
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we make kill tiles non skippable?
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how would that work generally? as long as kill tiles will have better hitbox reactions, so should teleports too
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz both arent intented for skipping parts cuz of it
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, maybe we just shouldn't allow skipping any tile
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> making teles hitboxes same as killtiles would kill gameplay
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> To say it here again, changing how killtiles work now would mess with hundrets of ranks
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> To say it here again, changing how killtiles work now would mess with hundrets of ranks. talkin of being skipable
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Brokecdx- what are these cutting edge maps that you are playing that use the fact that kill tiles are slightly fatter then teleports?
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ScReeNy As I said, if I ever make that change it'll come along with a lot of other changes and a clean leaderboard
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> i just can imagine just edge solos by nealson, however i always use edges as to get dj back in a quick fashion, why would you even want to change that ?
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teleport tiles have the same hitbox as freeze tiles
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> which should stay like this
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only ones that are different are kill tiles, what is the purpose?
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I don't really want to change that anyway, what I do want to change however is the fact that at insanely high speeds you can go through kill tiles
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> they are harder to hit, and you get punished if you dont hit, idc about changing to go thorugh kill tiles, i skipped it 1 time in my life
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Only solves the issue that maps are being played fair
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I kept the kill tiles fat in the 0.7 branch aswell, you don't have to worry about that. I just don't know why you were so concerned ðŸ˜„
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> i love to edge and it's really easy for me to hit it on freeze / teles, personal bias
