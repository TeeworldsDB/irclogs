14:59 < shorefir1> Hey deen, did you just release a new update?
15:07 < shorefire> Update seem's to have broken the game for me, all I see is it updating for a split second and then it closes
19:39 <@deen> shorefire: that's weird
19:39 <@deen> shorefire: i did release 3.9, yes
19:40 < shorefire> Had to disable auto updating in the config
19:40 <@deen> ???
19:40 < shorefire> Otherwise I'd just see 'updating' then something about installing new skins
19:40 <@deen> Your updater has no permissions to overwrite files i guess
19:40 < shorefire> then it'd just exit out
19:40 <@deen> Probably same reason as your exit crashes
19:41 < shorefire> I don't get those on Linux
19:41 < shorefire> just the updater crashes it
19:41 < shorefire> Exit crash was on windows 7
19:41 <@deen> ah
19:41 <@deen> why do you always get problems?^^
19:42 <@deen> Oh wait
19:43 <@deen> Works for me on linux
19:43 <@deen> Just tried with 3.8.3 on linux x86_64
19:43 <@deen> updates to 3.9
19:43 < shorefire> strange
19:43 <@deen> I get your problem when the user has no permissions
19:43 <@deen> for the DDNet file
19:43 <@deen> and DDNet-Server
19:44 < shorefire> Hm, I'll change permissions and see if it fix's it soon
