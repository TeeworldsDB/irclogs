01:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> atm Im split between the NZXT H5 Flow and the Corsair 4000D Airflow
01:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> they are pretty much the same but the nzxt one is $20 less
01:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> but I slightly prefer the look of the corsair one
03:05 < bridge_> <billionray> @mpft get a gym membership and leave the video games alone
03:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don’t really play games
03:05 < bridge_> <billionray> Then why do you need this fanct hardware?
03:05 < bridge_> <billionray> Then why do you need this fancy hardware?
03:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> I like computers
03:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> Fast compile times
03:06 < bridge_> <billionray> I agree with you there
03:07 < bridge_> <billionray> What cpu do you have now Ewan?
03:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> i5 9400f
03:12 < bridge_> <billionray> Laptop?
03:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> No
03:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> f means no igpu
03:13 < bridge_> <billionray> Ah
03:13 < bridge_> <billionray> Seems a bit underpowered for a guy that cares about compile times
03:13 < bridge_> <billionray> Not that i have any good hardware
03:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yeah that’s why I am buying new hardware lol
03:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> Ryzen 9 7900X
05:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> dark rock pro 4 or nhd 15... same cooler, both good brands, noctua is $20 more but i hear that if anything goes wrong they just replace the damn thing
05:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> which would be good if i lose hardware again or whatever
05:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> Also wondering why the DeepCool coolers i'm seeing online here are half as much? how tf?
06:23 < bridge_> <murpi> Get the thermalright peerless assassin 120 se, cools better than dark rock pro 4 and nh-d15 at half the price
06:23 < bridge_> <murpi> They ship the from taiwan though, so shipping might take a week or so (10 days in my case)
06:23 < bridge_> <murpi> They ship them from taiwan though, so shipping might take a week or so (10 days in my case)
06:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> ah man that seems like a good option but i want to avoid shipping altogether
06:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> i was gonna pick these up on my way back home
06:34 < bridge_> <remakepower> Did the master have problem?
06:34 < bridge_> <murpi> Crazy how cheap they are here in germany
06:34 < bridge_> <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143765114072354896/image.png
06:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah it's about that much here too
06:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol the website had a listing for it at one point but it's 404 when i click on it
06:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143765243269501008/image.png
06:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> feelsbadman
06:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> wait nvm the website just shat itself
06:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> not in stock anyway tho
06:35 < bridge_> <murpi> sad
06:38 < bridge_> <remakepower> Is there any people know it?
06:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am concerned that the fans it comes with are gonna be louder than the alternatives
06:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> i'm so sick of dealing with shitty fans
06:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> i also wish it came in black and didn't have rgb
07:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i guess i could buy 2 120mm noctua fans alongside it and it would still be cheaper than the nhd 15
11:02 < bridge_> <peace5905> i wanna put this in my private lan server
11:02 < bridge_> <peace5905> https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj_qev4tfKAAxWJfKQEHYecCiYQFnoECCEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDDNetPP%2FDDNetPP&usg=AOvVaw3Lk5yif0Djx--jxbVc_4j9&opi=89978449

11:25 < bridge_> <peace5905> k thanks, when i will double click the exe, what will it do?
11:25 < bridge_> <peace5905> will it add it automatically to the lan server?
11:26 < bridge_> <gyro3630> Launch the server maybe
11:26 < bridge_> <peace5905> ik, already did
11:26 < bridge_> <peace5905> and when it is added to the server, how do i use it?
11:27 < bridge_> <gyro3630> idk explore
11:27 < bridge_> <gyro3630> Try to use sv_gametype
11:28 < bridge_> <peace5905> in the console?
11:28 < bridge_> <gyro3630> No ingame its a cheatcode
11:29 < bridge_> <peace5905> how i use sv gametype then
11:29 < bridge_> <peace5905> in the rcon?
11:31 < bridge_> <gyro3630> Yes
11:35 < bridge_> <peace5905> i doubleclicked on the exe but nothing happened
11:35 < bridge_> <gyro3630> Sad
11:36 < bridge_> <peace5905> help
11:38 < ChillerDragon> Do yp
11:38 < ChillerDragon> you also need a config setting sv_map
11:38 < ChillerDragon> and a maps folder with that map
11:38 < ChillerDragon> I recommend starting it with cmd so you keep the logs
11:39 < ChillerDragon> rightclick the folder select open command line here and then type in ``.\
11:39 < ChillerDragon> `.\windows_DDNetPP.exe`
11:39 < bridge_> <peace5905> i don't understand what do i need to do
11:40 < bridge_> <peace5905> what is yp
11:40 < bridge_> <peace5905> how i have config setting sv_map
11:40 < bridge_> <peace5905> i don't understand this
11:40 < bridge_> <peace5905> same
11:47 < bridge_> <peace5905> help
11:58 < ChillerDragon> did you manage to open a command prompt?
11:58 < ChillerDragon> send some screenshots of what you do
11:58 < ChillerDragon> do you have a maps folder next to the server?
12:01 < bridge_> <peace5905> yes i have, i will use the blmapv3royal map
12:01 < bridge_> <peace5905> and i have opened the cmd
12:08 < ChillerDragon> show some screenshots
12:08 < ChillerDragon> some errors
12:08 < ChillerDragon> of your cmd
12:08 < ChillerDragon> and your folder
12:08 < ChillerDragon> i aint no wizard idk wat u do
12:09 < bridge_> <peace5905> i didn't get any errors
12:10 < bridge_> <peace5905> i just don't know what to do
12:13 < ChillerDragon> type ``.\windows_DDNetPP.exe`` into your cmd
12:14 < ChillerDragon> to run the exe from your command prompt then it should show a log in case it crashes on launch
12:14 < ChillerDragon> what even do you need it for? Running a ddnet++ server on your windows machine is not very interesting
12:15 < bridge_> <peace5905> '.\windows_DDNetPP.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
12:15 < ChillerDragon> okay then show the output of ``dir``
12:15 < ChillerDragon> did you rename the downloaded file?
12:15 < bridge_> <peace5905> nope
12:15 < ChillerDragon> is there no windows_DDNetPP.exe in your current folder?
12:15 < bridge_> <peace5905> the file is on the desktop
12:15 < ChillerDragon> then open cmd on the desktop
12:15 < ChillerDragon> is there also a maps folder on the desktop?
12:16 < bridge_> <peace5905> not on the desktop, but the map folder is opened
12:16 < ChillerDragon> it has to be nice to the server
12:16 < ChillerDragon> next
12:17 < ChillerDragon> the server looks for the maps in either %APPDATA% or in the folder where the server binary is
12:18 < bridge_> <peace5905> what next
12:18 < ChillerDragon> your done
12:18 < ChillerDragon> run the server
12:19 < bridge_> <peace5905> but i actually did nothing, i just put the command in the cmd and got an error
12:19 < bridge_> <peace5905> and my server is already open
12:19 < ChillerDragon> ??
12:19 < ChillerDragon> what error
12:19 < ChillerDragon> ddnet++ is the server
12:20 < bridge_> <peace5905> the error in the cmd
12:20 < bridge_> <peace5905> '.\windows_DDNetPP.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
12:20 < ChillerDragon> send screenshot
12:20 < ChillerDragon> is the cmd open from your desktop??
12:20 < ChillerDragon> or is it in some other folder?
12:20 < bridge_> <peace5905> wdym from my desktop
12:20 < ChillerDragon> rightlclick desktop
12:20 < ChillerDragon> open cmd here
12:21 < bridge_> <peace5905> i just searched cmd in the windows thing
12:21 < ChillerDragon> then it will not open in your desktop but your user folder i guess
12:21 < ChillerDragon> you can also type in ``cd Desktop`` first
12:21 < ChillerDragon> and it should work too
12:21 < bridge_> <peace5905> i did cd desktop
12:21 < ChillerDragon> and did it work then?
12:22 < bridge_> <peace5905> C:\Users\felic\Desktop>
12:22 < bridge_> <peace5905> is that good?
12:22 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:22 < ChillerDragon> then run the server
12:23 < ChillerDragon> you said its on your desktop
12:23 < bridge_> <peace5905> i'm on the server rn
12:23 < ChillerDragon> so now windows_DDNetPP.exe should be found
12:23 < ChillerDragon> ???
12:23 < ChillerDragon> so all worked?
12:25 < bridge_> <peace5905> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143853624410243082/image.png
12:26 < bridge_> <peace5905> i'm in
12:27 < ChillerDragon> thats a ddnet server
12:27 < ChillerDragon> i thought you want a ddnet++ server?
12:27 < ChillerDragon> ddnet++ is not a plugin
12:27 < ChillerDragon> its the server it self
12:27 < ChillerDragon> and you can run it independently
12:27 < ChillerDragon> if you join the ddnet server its a ddnet server
12:28 < ChillerDragon> if you want a ddnet++ server you need to run that by either double clicking it or by running it from cmd to get the logs
12:28 < bridge_> <peace5905> so i need ddnet++ server for ddnetpp
12:28 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:28 < ChillerDragon> the thing you downloaded
12:28 < bridge_> <peace5905> but a ddnet++ server is not lan right?
12:28 < ChillerDragon> just run it already
12:28 < ChillerDragon> its lan
12:28 < ChillerDragon> you can play on it locally
12:28 < bridge_> <teero777> :kek:
12:29 < bridge_> <gyro3630> Good luck
12:29 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon: good luck
12:30 < bridge_> <peace5905> when i open ddnetpp nothing happens
12:30 < bridge_> <peace5905> it opens nothing
12:30 < ChillerDragon> then run it from commandline
12:31 < ChillerDragon> !!!!!!
12:31 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
12:31 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon: haha even the ddnet is trolling u xD
12:31 < ChillerDragon> im losing it
12:32 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon: haha even the ddnet bot is trolling u xD
12:32 < ChillerDragon> what a waste of time its not the ddnet++ server running on some windows pc will be ever used for anything
12:32 < ChillerDragon> like*
12:32 < bridge_> <peace5905> what do i need to write in the command prompt to open ddnetpp
12:32 < ChillerDragon> ?
12:33 < ChillerDragon> windows_DDNetPP.exe
12:33 < ChillerDragon> okay im closing irc now sorry
12:33 < bridge_> <teero777> cd to the directory where the exe is located

13:49 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> :justatest: poor peace
14:28 < ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter its vanilla ddnet behavior. ddnet servers try to load a config based on the map name
14:28 < ChillerDragon> its just a warnig you do not need a map specific config it should work without
14:28 < bridge_> <XWA> where are turkish servers
14:28 < ChillerDragon> in turkey
14:28 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> yeah ok
14:28 < bridge_> <XWA> i cant see in the game
14:28 < bridge_> <XWA> in server list
14:28 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> damn who stopped turkey funding again
14:29 < bridge_> <XWA> are they closed
14:29 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> there is no tooth fairy, there is no easter bunny, and there is no turkish servers
14:29 < ChillerDragon> https://ddnet.org/status/
14:29 < ChillerDragon> i dont see any turkey here
14:29 < bridge_> <XWA> yeah but dont u know that there were many Turkey servers
14:29 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> atleast we got a brazil one
14:30 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1692793805.png
14:30 < ChillerDragon> tur gone
14:30 < bridge_> <XWA> so why
14:30 < ChillerDragon> seems like there were yes
14:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> the hoster stopped hosting
14:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> because of ddoses
14:30 < ChillerDragon> i blame lerato
14:31 < bridge_> <XWA> german servers have ddoses as well
14:31 < bridge_> <XWA> closed them too
14:31 < bridge_> <XWA> close them too
14:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> they wouldnt dare
14:31 < bridge_> <XWA> ahha
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet isnt closing em
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its the hoster
14:31 < bridge_> <XWA> ah
14:31 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> do you know how to read
14:31 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 have you tried disabling ddos for turkey servers?
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hoster says, uh these guys get attacked, its easier to not deal with em and get another client without issues
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> basic capitlism 101
14:32 < bridge_> <XWA> ahahah
14:32 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> chiller cancel your rentenversicherung to pay for turkish server's
14:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> get the panzerwagon out
14:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> panzerkampfwagen
14:32 < bridge_> <XWA> ryozuki are you mod
14:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ryozuki is one of 9 gods you should offer your belongings to
14:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> who r the other 8
14:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> now i dont wanna list em because i get hatemail if i miss someone
14:34 < bridge_> <XWA> watermelon
14:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u made this to urself xd
14:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> XD

14:35 < ChillerDragon> me
14:35 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> one of chiller's toys
14:35 < bridge_> <XWA> is it legal
14:35 < ChillerDragon> i am not a lawyer
14:35 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no its illegal please ban him
14:35 < ChillerDragon> for legal questions please consult my lawyer mr jopsti
14:35 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> kickvote him
14:35 < bridge_> <XWA> the owner of this game should ban chillerdragon for putting a bot on a map
14:35 < ChillerDragon> yikes
14:35 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> we tried, he always comes back 4 some reason
14:35 < ChillerDragon> please do not discuss bots in #developer or you get kicked

14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> owned
14:36 < bridge_> <XWA> arent u a real person
14:36 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> rekt
14:36 < ChillerDragon> i am a hooman
14:37 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> chillerdragay
14:37 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thats what an AI would say
14:37 < bridge_> <XWA> is chillerdragon a chatgpt 4.0
14:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its 5.0
14:37 < ChillerDragon> 0.7
14:37 < bridge_> <XWA> so turkish servers wont be back anymore?
14:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> host em yourself
14:38 < bridge_> <XWA> what would be my profit for hosting
14:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> no profit
14:39 < bridge_> <XWA> is the owner of this game gaining any money
14:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> do you pay for it?
14:39 < bridge_> <XWA> it is free on steam
14:39 < bridge_> <XWA> so
14:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> gz - you answered your own question!
14:39 < ChillerDragon> if you dont pay you are the product
14:39 < bridge_> <XWA> it is not like that in this game
14:40 < bridge_> <XWA> there are not skins to buy or somthing
14:40 < bridge_> <XWA> omg i have an idea for the owner
14:40 < bridge_> <h.kaan> I am trying to translate the game into turkish but i ran into a problem:
14:40 < bridge_> <h.kaan> oops
14:40 < bridge_> <h.kaan> I am trying to translate the game into turkish but i ran into a problem:
14:40 < ChillerDragon> tur servers off no need to translate axaxax
14:41 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> dont recommend getting payed cosmetics into the game
14:41 < bridge_> <XWA> ahaha
14:41 < bridge_> <XWA> make this game pay to win
14:42 < ChillerDragon> smart i will write a letter to the owner and suggest it
14:42 < bridge_> <XWA> buy ddnetpass to have three jumps
14:42 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> $30 to insert a finish in db :santatrollet:
14:42 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> blmapchill:
14:42 < bridge_> <h.kaan> I am trying to translate the game into turkish but i ran into a problem:
14:42 < bridge_> <h.kaan> the string %d of %d servers (example: 17 of 23 servers) translates to "23 sunucunun 17 tanesi" so the numbers have to be swapped and i guess it cant do that
14:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: OMG
14:42 < ChillerDragon> soli
14:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> you fixed that map loading thing
14:42 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> Souly:
14:42 < ChillerDragon> i did?
14:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i just updated my client
14:42 < ChillerDragon> epic
14:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> pog
14:42 < ChillerDragon> pog indeed
14:42 < bridge_> <XWA> buy ddnetpass to have longer hooks
14:42 < ChillerDragon> i have the longest hook
14:43 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no u dont
14:43 < bridge_> <XWA> buy ddnetpass to have more powerful hammers
14:43 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> oh wtf theres a special proof border for making themes now?
14:43 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon: when are you buying portal in your map
14:43 < ChillerDragon> @h.kaan dont think thats possible not sure if that ever has been needed
14:43 < ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter when im rich
14:43 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> haha good one
14:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> %1$d and %0$d
14:44 < ChillerDragon> wait watf
14:44 < ChillerDragon> heinrich is that normal stringformat feature?
14:44 < ChillerDragon> or translation feature
14:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> "normal" string format feature
14:44 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 😮
14:44 < ChillerDragon> woah cool
14:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> %2$d and %1$d
14:44 < ChillerDragon> true hacker
14:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Learn c++, newbie
14:45 < bridge_> <h.kaan> So i have to do "%1$d sunucunun %0$d tanesi"
14:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> apparently 1-indexed, not zero-indexed
14:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, but with 2 and 1
14:45 < bridge_> <h.kaan> "%2$d sunucunun %1$d tanesi"
14:45 < bridge_> <h.kaan> should be okay, thank you
14:46 < bridge_> <h.kaan> the second one will go into the first place
14:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/df62615438d799cc01da94bcfa9dfd0a2da896ef/src/test/str.cpp#L260-L279
14:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
14:46 < bridge_> <XWA> omg what ar e these
14:46 < ChillerDragon> future tech
14:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it means it starts counting from 1
14:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not from 0
14:46 < bridge_> <XWA> i hate these bullshits
14:46 < bridge_> <XWA> programming
14:46 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lmao
14:47 < ChillerDragon> pro gaming
14:47 < bridge_> <XWA> who made this game
14:47 < ChillerDragon> magnus
14:47 < bridge_> <XWA> by himself?
14:47 < ChillerDragon> with chatgpt
14:47 < bridge_> <XWA> ahaha
14:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, alongside many other people
14:48 < bridge_> <XWA> this game was teeworlds as i remember
14:48 < ChillerDragon> teewars
14:48 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> magnus auvi = lead dev of teewars
14:48 < bridge_> <Voxel> if chatgpt makes a ddnet update im gonna be sad
14:48 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> use chatgpt to rewrite game in rust
14:48 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 🙂
14:48 < bridge_> <XWA> i dont update this game
14:48 < bridge_> <XWA> it crashes everytime
14:48 < ChillerDragon> @Voxel if?
14:48 < bridge_> <XWA> i need a chillerdragon client
14:48 < ChillerDragon> @Voxel what makes you think there is not chatgpt code in ddnet already?
14:49 < ChillerDragon> @XWA https://chillerbot.github.io
14:49 < bridge_> <_noby> clicks on #developer and complains about seeing programming related content
14:49 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:49 < ChillerDragon> oi nobi
14:49 < ChillerDragon> is it u?
14:49 < bridge_> <_noby> no u
14:49 < ChillerDragon> or some imposter?
14:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> i want to think people put EFFORT into maintaining this game
14:49 < bridge_> <XWA> ahaha
14:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you have a tool that makes it easier, use it
14:49 < bridge_> <h.kaan> Last one left, what does "Aim bind" option do on the controller settings
14:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no sense in trying to code ddnet in assembly
14:49 < bridge_> <h.kaan> you set a key or some other thing?
14:50 < bridge_> <XWA> and this game should have an android app
14:50 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no u
14:50 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no it shouldnt
14:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> that is bullsh*t
14:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143889992930824262/image.png
14:50 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> drinking game every time someone mentions ddnet on android
14:50 < bridge_> <XWA> i found an app for ddnet
14:50 < bridge_> <XWA> but not playable
14:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Then get pc
14:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wanna block people while away from hokem!!! you dornhnderstand!!!
14:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> call a krankenwagen, voxel has a schlaganfall
14:51 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i wanna use mobile data to bypass bans
14:51 < bridge_> <XWA> dont use mobile discord then
14:51 < bridge_> <XWA> use pc
14:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> *cyberFighter has been banned for life*
14:52 < bridge_> <XWA> does chillerbot client have a virus
14:52 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no its punjabi working 2023 cracked launcher
14:52 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It mines bitcoin
14:53 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i think he removed the keylogger because that interfered with the coinminer
14:53 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon: correct?
14:53 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ^
14:53 < ChillerDragon> correct
14:54 < bridge_> <XWA> so what is the advantage of chillerbot client
14:55 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: now i can change maps in game without crashing lmao
14:55 < ChillerDragon> epic
14:55 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> ez fng hax
14:55 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh no no no
14:55 < bridge_> <XWA> does it have auto aim
14:55 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> nah but i really needed it for that blmapchill edit
14:55 < ChillerDragon> @XWA i will not advertise a 0.6 client. You asked for chillerbot you get chillerbot. I wont sell it to you
14:55 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> okay XWA you're asking questionable stuff
14:55 < ChillerDragon> sus
14:56 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: earlier i had to host the map on local server and then press "load current map" in editor lmao
14:56 < ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxD
14:56 < bridge_> <XWA> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143891427718336542/ScreenHunter_4.jpg
14:56 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and then go back to the server just to test it
14:56 < ChillerDragon> imagine playing fng on onbgy server without chillerbot map loader to fix ugly design
14:57 < bridge_> <_noby> 😮
14:57 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> wtf aint no way ur alive
14:57 < ChillerDragon> ikr
14:57 < ChillerDragon> long time no seen onbgy
14:57 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i thought u overdosed or some shit
14:57 < bridge_> <_noby> not the first time i heard that
14:57 < bridge_> <_noby> hah
14:58 < bridge_> <XWA> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143891920372912269/ScreenHunter_5.jpg
14:58 < bridge_> <XWA> someone offered me this client
14:58 < bridge_> <_noby> just been working and often not home otherwise
14:58 < bridge_> <XWA> should i download
14:58 < bridge_> <_noby> no wtf
14:58 < ChillerDragon> dood
14:58 < ChillerDragon> ban incoming xd
14:58 < bridge_> <XWA> ahaha
14:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> this isnt funny
14:59 < bridge_> <XWA> ok i prefer chillerdragon cleint
14:59 < ChillerDragon> its the we dont say its name client
14:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: what is that playtime thing at the bottom
14:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> in chillerbot tab
14:59 < ChillerDragon> falco requested it
14:59 < ChillerDragon> if you have tracking enabled
14:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> is it total playtime or current playtime
14:59 < ChillerDragon> it sends your online time to my server
14:59 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i dont knwo if XWA is trolling
14:59 < ChillerDragon> its total based on your tracking id 
14:59 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> ah ye i had it enabled earlier
15:00 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and im surprised it shows only 2h
15:00 < bridge_> <Voxel> he is
15:00 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or if he will call himself out using the client in #reports soon
15:00 < bridge_> <Voxel> i can tell
15:00 < bridge_> <XWA> i am learning the game
15:00 < ChillerDragon> you can also do f1 ``playtime``
15:00 < ChillerDragon> @soulyvevo its didnt always track was added in last release and maybe you nuked your settings at some point
15:00 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> ooh i think i know what happened
15:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no advertising bot clients
15:00 < bridge_> <XWA> ah i didnt know that
15:01 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:01 < bridge_> <XWA> is chillerdragon client a bot client as well
15:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> chiller is obviously a ddnet dev
15:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> so its not
15:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> .
15:01 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> when i used normal client it deleted some chillerbot settings cuz i forgot to do save settings 0 before exit
15:01 < bridge_> <peace5905> hey, how can i have the BlmapChill.map.cfg pls
15:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh no peace you're back
15:01 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and maybe chillerbot made a completely new id
15:01 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> or something
15:01 < ChillerDragon> @peace5905 i have none
15:01 < ChillerDragon> you dont need any
15:01 < bridge_> <peace5905> i do
15:01 < bridge_> <peace5905> wait look
15:02 < bridge_> <_noby> peace: gets banned on official serv so tries to host own
15:02 < bridge_> <peace5905> command prompt :
15:02 < bridge_> <peace5905> [23-08-23 13:39:01][console]: failed to open 'maps/BlmapChill.map.cfg'
15:02 < ChillerDragon> @soulyvevo hmm weird thats unlucky wait does launching ddnet once delets all chillerbot specific settings?
15:02 < bridge_> <XWA> is owner of teeworlds and ddnet the same person
15:02 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> ye
15:02 < bridge_> <peace5905> just trying to have fun in a lan server 💀
15:02 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> at least with older versions
15:02 < ChillerDragon> @peace5905 does it start anyways? then ignore it
15:02 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> no - ddnet is a modification for teeworlds - we dont have nuffin to do with teeworlds as is
15:02 < bridge_> <peace5905> how do i know if it starts?
15:02 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i have like ddnet 14 or something
15:03 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and i only really update chillerbot
15:03 < ChillerDragon> @soulyvevo that might also explain my playtime :D maybe i should use a seperate setting file but sounds bloat
15:03 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> lmao
15:03 < ChillerDragon> does the ddnet client delete all entries it doesnt know from the config?
15:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> i use latest ddnet version because it offers more features and better experiences
15:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> hint hint
15:03 < bridge_> <XWA> for exampl
15:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> the updated editor
15:03 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> seems like it cuz i had to turn off the chiller hud each time i launched normal client
15:04 < bridge_> <XWA> i am a player so i dont into it
15:04 < bridge_> <peace5905> how do i know if the server starts chiller
15:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> the sitting animation
15:04 < bridge_> <XWA> i am a player so i am notinto it
15:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> best update
15:04 < bridge_> <XWA> no it looks bad
15:04 < ChillerDragon> @soulyvevo thats annoying but would be worth to add a chillerbot_settings.cfg that seperate? where you need to independently configure all your shit
15:04 < bridge_> <XWA> old one was better
15:04 < bridge_> <XWA> closing eyes is always better ahaha
15:05 < bridge_> <XWA> but now when u press Q it sits and closes eyes
15:05 < ChillerDragon> @peace5905 did it close after you ran? or does it stay open?
15:05 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> nah not sure if i need separate settings file
15:05 < bridge_> <peace5905> nope, nothing
15:05 < bridge_> <peace5905> i think i really need the .cfg
15:05 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> cuz i sometimes switch between clients when trying to test something
15:05 < bridge_> <h.kaan> What does aim bind do in controller menu?
15:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> me when its easy to fake afk by just closing your eyes and now ppl dont know if you're faking or not so they mess with you anyways
15:06 < bridge_> <XWA> yes but sitting animation looks a bit bad
15:06 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no it doesnt
15:06 < bridge_> <XWA> it should be improved
15:06 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i would rather something in base ddnet that would let me detect what client ver im using and then based on it set cl_save_settings to 0
15:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> then you can try to fix it ^^
15:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> it's open source
15:06 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> its fine how it is
15:06 < bridge_> <XWA> chatgpt 5.
15:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> better settings storage seems like it'd fix this problem
15:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> i.e. don't forget options just because the currently-open client doens't know it
15:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> only save options that the user actually changed
15:07 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> ye maybe that would help
15:07 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> but its not really much of an issue
15:07 < bridge_> <XWA> why dont we have stars during freeze anymore
15:07 < bridge_> <peace5905> chiller do u know maybe how can i have the BlmapChill.map.cfg
15:07 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> bro
15:07 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i could just make some autoexec file that would fix everything
15:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i swear to god
15:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues you can search here
15:08 < bridge_> <XWA> cant find in 20 pages
15:09 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @_voxeldoesart btw whats the thing with folder for weapons for i forgot
15:09 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> seeing other people with different weapons?
15:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> mainly not relying on image atlasses anymore meaning its easier to add content
15:10 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea that would be nice
15:10 < bridge_> <Voxel> im splitting each element into its own image

15:11 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> make it yourself with envelopes
15:11 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> but it wont work with entities on
15:11 < ChillerDragon> heinrich can you write a valid tw packet out of your head?

15:13 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:13 < bridge_> <murpi> Vulkan
15:14 < ChillerDragon> try all and the one that runs the best
15:14 < ChillerDragon> vulkan is the new fancy shit
15:14 < bridge_> <Voxel> i dont even know what vulkan does tbh
15:14 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 go i wanna see you write a packet by hand

15:18 < ChillerDragon> no way you came up with a correct one
15:18 < ChillerDragon> not bad
15:18 < bridge_> <XWA> guys what are you trying to do
15:18 < bridge_> <XWA> the game is stable now
15:18 < bridge_> <XWA> u can have a rest
15:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wonder if ddnet will use any bitwise hacking like quake does soon
15:19 < bridge_> <Iza> What’s that?
15:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> fast inverse square root?
15:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root
15:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> that was what i found aswell
15:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck?
15:20 < bridge_> <_noby> !p 10 00 00 01 54 4B 45 4E FF FF FF FF
15:20 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
15:20 < chillerbot4> ```[twnet_parser v0.8.0] udp payload: 10 00 00 01 54 4b 45 4e ff ff ff ff```
15:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> same quake developers... same
15:20 < chillerbot4> ```--- 0.7```
15:21 < ChillerDragon> clearly something is bugged xd
15:22 < ChillerDragon> oh yikes i can reproduce onbgys stuck localy
15:22 < ChillerDragon> it maxes out my cpu xd
15:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> xd
15:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like an endless loop
15:23 < ChillerDragon> sounds like a huffman problem
15:23 < bridge_> <XWA> is ddnet german game
15:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> chiller casually letting us trash his pc yet agai
15:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> n
15:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> first introduced by us german's atleast
15:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> (if we ignore ddmax)
15:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's game from originally swedish authors AFAIK
15:24 < bridge_> <XWA> thats why ger servers have more numbers
15:24 < bridge_> <_noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143898567262613504/Screen_Shot_2023-08-23_at_8.24.21_AM.png
15:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is that in the wiki? @zwelf2
15:25 < ChillerDragon> hi_leute_gll
15:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i got into ddnet because linux game store
15:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> well teeworlds firstly ofc, then city, then block
15:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> then ddnet
15:25 < bridge_> <XWA> in some maps the gun is useless
15:26 < ChillerDragon> yea was huffman as expected
15:26 < ChillerDragon> libtw2 huffman fixed it
15:26 < ChillerDragon> onbgy ur packet was valid
15:26 < bridge_> <_noby> it isnt compressed
15:26 < ChillerDragon> did you come up with it manualy
15:26 < bridge_> <_noby> yes ~~with help of asciitable~~
15:27 < ChillerDragon> cool 
15:30 < ChillerDragon> sos heinrich huffman py on my raspi is not installing
15:30 < ChillerDragon> a wait had no rust installed xd
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I should really build some wheels some day
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so that yo udon't need rust installed
15:36 < ChillerDragon> yo heinrich are you saying your packet is correct any my parser fails at it :c
15:37 < ChillerDragon> what is it?
15:37 < ChillerDragon> ah wait no it works on my machine
15:38 < bridge_> <h.kaan> i think i shouldnt have merged ddnet master to my fix branch
15:38 < bridge_> <h.kaan> 😭
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> vulkan builds upon learnings of old graphics api like opengl and probs some stuff from directx
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it is the most open and gives the most control
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> more fine tuning
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> opengl 1 has the less features and control
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u dont even have shaders
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> opengl 3.3 is somewhat usable
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 4.4 is better
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> vulkan best
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> directx propietary bad
15:41 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> xwayland go brrr
15:41 < bridge_> <teero777> :pepeW:
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wayland has nothing to do with graphics
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> metal, opengl, vulkan, directx
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk about any other
15:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> metal is the apple one right?
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
15:42 < bridge_> <XWA> which is better for fps
15:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I thought wayland stops you from tearing frames
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u know how apple wants to always have their own thing
15:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like it does *something* with graphics
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> vulkan, specially on modern hardware
15:42 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Where is that image from? Do you have more context?
15:42 < bridge_> <XWA> but in vulkan game looks different
15:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> it..does?
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think wayland gives surfaces
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i guess it can control vsync there
15:43 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> wayland looses surface on vulkan, these 2 are not compatible
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ???
15:43 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i had my way with it already, was fun
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what
15:43 < bridge_> <XWA> i will give u 2 photos for seeing difference
15:43 < bridge_> <_noby> https://discord.com/channels/407308363031117832/407308363031117834/705395763298959432
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what do u mean here
15:44 < bridge_> <zwelf2> thanks
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wayland does some rendering, and it has to use a backend, but diferent apps can use diferent backends
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> looks like wayland probs uses opengl or whathever
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but a game under wayland can use vulkan
15:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> vulkan: acquire next image failed -1000000000
15:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>  I vulkan: surface lost
15:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
15:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thats what happens trying to run ddnet on wayland
15:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 😄
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also there is a experiment for wayland to use vulkan to render the things https://github.com/st3r4g/swvkc
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u need to make a surface with this maybe
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_wayland_surface.html
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> The VK_KHR_wayland_surface extension is an instance extension. It provides a mechanism to create a VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by the VK_KHR_surface extension) that refers to a Wayland wl_surface, as well as a query to determine support for rendering to a Wayland compositor.
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceWaylandPresentationSupportKHR.html
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess it needs a bit more support
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on ddnet part
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u know others who run on wayland?
15:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Run what? Ddnet?
15:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet with vulkan
15:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on wayland
15:48 < bridge_> <XWA> vulkan feels different
15:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nori and me sometimes
15:48 < bridge_> <XWA> rather than opengl
15:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> melon claims it doesnt work
15:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> How exactly
15:48 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> you got ddnet running on wayland with vulkan? i never got it to work
15:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> melon why u use a weird name
15:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant ping u
15:49 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> for exactly that reason
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U have to use the sdl Wayland backend
15:49 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> namechange comes with 3K points XD
15:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @223825194622517249 test
15:49 < bridge_> <XWA> mouse control is better in opengl
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But i also often had and even still have problems with Wayland sadly
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No
15:49 < bridge_> <XWA> but fps is more in vulkan
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Mouse is not related to vulkan
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then it's either a graphics driver setting. Or your brain
15:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @blaiszephyr works fine for me
15:51 < bridge_> <XWA> no it is like more sensivity in vulkan
15:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> was a long time ago, but swapping between opengl and vulkan forced my res to 60hz, had to manually swap it back
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then you generally have few fps maybe
15:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki if they talked recently, you can select from the recent chat participants after entering `@`
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Which increases the input lag
15:51 < bridge_> <XWA> NO fps is like 2300
15:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> maybe i'll take a look at it again sometimes
15:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> hz in resolution?
15:51 < bridge_> <XWA> 144 hz
15:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @blaiszephyr I meant pinging you works fine 😄
15:52 < bridge_> <XWA> res is 1366 768
15:52 < bridge_> <XWA> but pc is 1080p
15:52 < bridge_> <Voxel> @/blaiszephyr
15:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> XD
15:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 1366x768 - what toaster model you got?
15:52 < bridge_> <XWA> i have 1920 1080 but i dont use it
15:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> why
15:53 < bridge_> <XWA> old habits
15:53 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> fng player downscaling their game for more zoom - humm humm
15:53 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh 😄
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway. Above like 1000fps vk and ogl should not make any difference..
15:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> keep in mind vulkan has these options
15:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143906136618176562/image.png
15:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> when you're used to 144hz, game looks like its lagging going lower
15:55 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> so maybe it scaled down when you switched
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> All backends should have them
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Available resolutions are not part of vk api
15:55 < bridge_> <XWA> no i have the same res settings in vulkan and opengl
15:55 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh yeah mb, didnt mean to say vulkan but ddnet
15:55 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ._.
15:56 < bridge_> <XWA> mouse is faster in vulkan
15:56 < bridge_> <XWA> i tested again
15:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway. Maybe your ogl driver isn't consistent, or you have a 8000 Hertz mouse or smth
15:56 < bridge_> <XWA> same res
15:56 < bridge_> <XWA> i have wireless mouse
15:56 < bridge_> <XWA> ahaha
15:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well that's not really an issue
15:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you have good adapters
15:57 < bridge_> <XWA> no adapters
15:57 < bridge_> <XWA> it works with a battery
15:57 < bridge_> <XWA> AAA
15:57 < ChillerDragon> tripple a
15:58 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> why not 2 AA
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In theory electro magnetic waves are but faster than electrons in copper xd
15:58 < bridge_> <XWA> whats the difference
15:58 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> .
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But the adapter speed is probably slower
15:59 < bridge_> <XWA> 1000dpi
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In theory electro magnetic waves are bit faster than electrons in copper xd
15:59 < bridge_> <XWA> i cant change my mouse
15:59 < bridge_> <XWA> i get used to it
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway. Use the backend with lowest input delay and be happy
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If vk feels faster. Use that, you will get used to it fast
16:00 < bridge_> <XWA> no just fps is better in vulkan
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Thought mouse feels different
16:00 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm... i had weird issues with fps lately. i know a few months ago i had ~3000fps but now im only getting about 500-1000fps for some reason. didnt really change anything and my cpu usage looks like this:
16:00 < bridge_> <teero777> so i dont think its my cpu. is my gpu degrading? xDD
16:00 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143907735440720014/image.png
16:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Hardware doesn't degrade so hard
16:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> did you install chillerbot? he installed a new coinminer
16:01 < bridge_> <XWA> omg what is this graph i dont understand anything
16:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Must be software or cooler
16:02 < bridge_> <XWA> download windows xp
16:02 < bridge_> <teero777> ...
16:02 < bridge_> <teero777> actually i would prefer xp over 10 when it comes to windows
16:03 < bridge_> <XWA> should i play 144 fps stricted because i have 144 hz
16:03 < bridge_> <teero777> but many things are not made for xp
16:03 < bridge_> <teero777> does ddnet work on xp?
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No
16:04 < bridge_> <teero777> ;(
16:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> old versions, probably. but you probably shouldn't run winxp
16:06 < bridge_> <teero777> now im forced to try
16:06 < bridge_> <teero777> ill be back in a few hours
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I mean u could probably get it to work. Disable the debug stuff and discord api. That is probably the biggest problem
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But please don't ask me for help xd
16:19 < bridge_> <XWA> what is github? is it a place for hackers
16:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Definitely
16:20 < bridge_> <h.kaan> k i did it
16:21 < bridge_> <h.kaan> closed the previous pr because i accidentally ran some wrong commands
16:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> yes
16:23 < bridge_> <han_4975> nasıl kuruluyor
16:32 < bridge_> <teero777> the question is will it run better than on my current arch install

16:48 < ChillerDragon> well the giga live thing was german wasnt it?
16:48 < ChillerDragon> the major source for tw players
16:48 < ChillerDragon> also the majority of ddnet devs and admins is german

16:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> based
17:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> No, we use Windows API that requires at least Windows Vista. But it's only for accessing the registry to register the file extension and protocol handlers, so you could probably patch that out if you really wanted to.
17:07 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Threads?
17:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> Not sure, I added the only `#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0600` in `system.cpp` and commented what it's needed for
17:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds weird, why's there a new API for accessing the registry in windows vista?
17:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's only some new functions which are more convenient than the old ones I think
17:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> For example `RegDeleteTreeW` allows deleting an entire tree. Otherwise I'd have to delete each folder individually in the correct order.
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I see
17:17 < ChillerDragon> why does ddnet do reg edits?
17:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Stealing your mothers maiden name
17:18 < ChillerDragon> thats what i figured
17:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> Register the `.demo` and `.map` file extensions and the `ddnet:` protocol scheme to be opened with DDNet
17:19 < ChillerDragon> i see
17:20 < bridge_> <robyt3> Still remains unsolved for Linux because there is no API for it AFAIK
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it's simply placing some files
17:20 < ChillerDragon> the ddnet protocol works
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no need for an API
17:21 < ChillerDragon> ddnet://zillyhuhn.com
17:21 < ChillerDragon> ddnet:149.202.127.134
17:21 < ChillerDragon> a dis
17:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> There is a `.desktop` file for the protocol, but you need to manually install it in some way
17:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think you also need to install MIME types for the file extensions separately from the `.desktop` file
17:25 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 i would like to move some server bridge code in a file thats shared between client and server like this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/df62615438d799cc01da94bcfa9dfd0a2da896ef/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1235-L1245
17:26 < ChillerDragon> how should that file be called? engine/shared/protocolglue.h ? or should it be generated in datasrc/ py scripts?
17:29 < bridge_> <robyt3> These `failed to query replaced source registry crates-io` failures in the CI are getting really frequent
17:29 < ChillerDragon> yes!
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I should look into caching
17:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> That would be very cool
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc arch linux ddnet installs the desktop with that
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think i need to add that to gentoo
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok it doesnt yet
17:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> What if you download the zip though? I couldn't find a way for the application to register the `.desktop` on its own
17:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 use this https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache
17:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7061
17:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you also add #7049 to the queue again?

17:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well ye
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> # selecting a toolchain either by action or manual `rustup` calls should happen
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> # before the plugin, as the cache uses the current rustc version as its cache key
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lol
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt mean to do that
17:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> shouting today, eh? :p
17:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> Anyone got other opinions on #7054 and #2412? Looks like too much effort and could lead to confusion due to different terms being used.
17:43 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7054

17:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> could load translations from internet and not make it part of the other translations
17:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's more than 150 new strings just from the tile explanations. All tooltips would probably be another 100-150 I guess.
17:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think it's easier if the Wiki explains the editor in other languages
17:49 < bridge_> <h.kaan> i just noticed the ddnet translation status page is not updated
17:49 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, it's only updated manually
17:50 < bridge_> <h.kaan> i updated the page
17:50 < bridge_> <h.kaan> should i pull request it?
17:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> You used the script or how did you do that?
17:50 < bridge_> <h.kaan> wrote it down like this in the pull request:
17:50 < bridge_> <h.kaan> First i used the `analyze.py` script to get info about translation then pasted the results into a text file. Finally, used another python script to generate the translation status data.
17:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ah, interesting. There is actually a `readme.txt` in the `scripts/languages` folder
17:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> According to that you can use `$ for i in data/languages/*.txt; do COVERED=$(cat $i|grep "^== "|grep -v "^== $"|wc -l); TOTAL=$(cat $i|grep "^== "|wc -l); [ "${i:t}" != "license.txt" ] && [ "${i:t}" != "index.txt" ] && echo "$(($COVERED*100/$TOTAL))% ${i:r:t}"; done | sort -n -r` to get the statistics
17:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can make a PR though if you want, otherwise deen will update the stats at some point
17:53 < bridge_> <h.kaan> didnt see it
17:53 < bridge_> <h.kaan> will create pr then
17:53 < bridge_> <h.kaan> thank you
18:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> looks much better

18:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what exactly do you want to achieve there? 🙂
18:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> my code seems to do the same thing in less lines of code
18:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> absolutely nothing 😄
18:43 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> mine is just complicating it using ptr::copy
18:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Unsafe for unsafes sake

18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ´´´
18:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why did u delete it
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i tried changing it
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> and it deleted
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ._.
18:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i found another way to overcomplicate it!
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ```
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> use core::ptr::{write_volatile};
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> fn main() {
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     let mut string1 = ['t' as u8, 'e' as u8, 's' as u8, 't' as u8, '\0' as u8];
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     let ptr = string1.as_mut_ptr();
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     for i in 0..4 {
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>         unsafe { write_volatile((ptr as *mut u8).add(i), *ptr.add(i)); }
18:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     }
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     unsafe { write_volatile((ptr as *mut u8).add(4), *(&b'\0' as *const u8)); }
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     let string2 = core::str::from_utf8(&string1).unwrap();
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     print!("{}", string2);
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> }
18:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ```
18:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its funny cuz
18:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u use unsafe yet u use the safe  from_utf8 str method
18:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i dont wanna hurt my compiler's feelings if it doesnt work
18:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
18:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> "test".as_bytes() works btw
18:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or smth like that
18:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also u dont need \0 in rust
18:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> rust hard
18:56 < bridge_> <patiga> `b"test\0"` would also improve readability, although I'm not sure if you are going for that 😉
18:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/fn.copy_nonoverlapping.html
18:56 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i really am just trolling around in rust right now 😄
18:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> doing low level stuff in rust is fun
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ```
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> fn main() {
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     let string1 = [b't', b'e', b's', b't'];
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     let mut string2 = [0u8; 4];
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     for i in 0..4 {
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>         string2[i] = string1[i];
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     }
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     let string3 = core::str::from_utf8(&string2).unwrap();
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr>     print!("{}", string3);
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> }
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ```
18:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> so many ways
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do ur own vec
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> altho its advanced rust
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u know
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well nothing
18:58 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> true
19:05 < bridge_> <XWA> so when is ddnet2
19:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as soon as it's finished
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so better get started already
19:06 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> pull out pycharm and letsgo
19:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> give ideas for ddnet 2.0
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> new logo
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
19:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> i just finished 2 logos yesterday
19:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> for maps
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> when ddnet logo
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😇
19:23 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Accounts :santatrollet:
19:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh no no no
19:53 < bridge_> <nouaa> :justatest:
19:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh HEY NOUAA ehmm... ehm...
19:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> hi!
19:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ehm nothing to see here!
19:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> pycharm wont handle it?
20:06 < bridge_> <XWA> it should be designed with source 2 engine
20:21 < bridge_> <teero777> ey btw the stop server button isnt working for me for the last few updates btw. i mean the server stops but the icon doesnt change and i cant restart the server again
20:21 < bridge_> <teero777> in client
20:24 < bridge_> <teero777> on arch on 17.2.1
20:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> He uses arch BTW
20:27 < bridge_> <teero777> BTW
20:28 < bridge_> <teero777> had 15.7 lying around and it works there
20:28 < bridge_> <teero777> gonna try diffrent versions
20:32 < bridge_> <teero777> works on 16.5
20:33 < bridge_> <teero777> doesnt work on 17.0.3
20:34 < bridge_> <teero777> doesnt work on 16.9
20:34 < bridge_> <teero777> works on 16.7.2
20:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Very likely caused by https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6409/commits/128d3e4758ea11164e11f77aba8d74c530f34928, so 16.9 should be the first version were it doesn't work
20:35 < bridge_> <teero777> yep
20:36 < bridge_> <teero777> 16.8 works
20:36 < bridge_> <teero777> the killing works but the state is not changed
20:37 < bridge_> <teero777> ill try toi just check if i can just fix it real qucik
20:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, this commit added error handling, but function didn't return the correct value on Linux to begin with
20:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> You need to correctly handle the `waitpid` return value in `kill_process`
20:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> `kill_process` should return `true` on success
20:40 < bridge_> <teero777> yea waitpid returns the pid
20:40 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143977983531569303/image.png
20:41 < bridge_> <teero777> fix is return `waitpid(process, &status, 0) != -1;`
20:41 < bridge_> <teero777> im lazy
20:41 < bridge_> <teero777> u do it
20:42 < bridge_> <teero777> fix is `return waitpid(process, &status, 0) != -1;`

20:44 < bridge_> <teero777> ahha
20:46 < bridge_> <teero777> @robyt3 btw how do you quickly edit things like this 1 line. a pr would be overkill so how?
20:46 < bridge_> <teero777> @robyt3 btw how do you quickly edit things like this 1 line. a pr would be overkill.
20:46 < bridge_> <teero777> @robyt3 btw how do you quickly edit things like this 1 line? a pr would be overkill.
20:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Why would a PR be overkill? If you only need one line then you make a PR with one line diff
20:47 < bridge_> <teero777> really? xd
20:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Unless you are working alone and just pushing stuff to master
20:48 < bridge_> <teero777> yea. so i have to fork the repo to make a 1 line change and then request a pr? xd
20:48 < bridge_> <robyt3> Well, yeah, if you've never made a PR then it's a bit more work to get started
20:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but it's a good exercise
20:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you haven't done it yet
20:49 < bridge_> <robyt3> 👍
20:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then you'll have more setup if you need to do it again
20:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (don't delete the fork/repo after you're done)
21:00 < bridge_> <teero777> why not?
21:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why would u want to delete it?
21:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do you hate to have ddnet on your github profile so much? 😂
21:01 < bridge_> <teero777> just a useless lying around repo then right=
21:01 < bridge_> <teero777> xDD
21:01 < bridge_> <teero777> yes
21:01 < bridge_> <teero777> very embarrasing
21:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so that the next PR will be faster
22:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyone recommend a good movie
22:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont like super heroes
22:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> LOTR
22:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> at cccamp they showed hackers and war games
22:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> with company they were fun to watch
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://m.imdb.com/chart/top/
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> most movies with 8.0+ are watchable
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there are few exceptions tho
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd generally say IMDB ratings fit my taste pretty well xd
22:09 < bridge_> <learath2> Trainspotting go
22:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im trying rotten tomaties
22:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tomatoes
22:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think imdb is not good i heard
22:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yesterday i saw Sisu
22:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i find lot of rotten tomatos overrated
22:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> was not bad
22:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont watch movies < 7.0 xd
22:10 < bridge_> <Voxel> rust the movie
22:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> waste of time xD
22:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe i saw that already
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/source_code
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lmao
22:11 < bridge_> <teero777> watch it while you play the 1400x1400 extreme 5* gores map lotr
22:11 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1144000943197786174/image.png
22:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> wdym dude movies < 7.0 are really funny and have a great personality
22:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:11 < bridge_> <teero777> Wanted 2007
22:12 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki watch Pixels. A solid 5.6/10
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 2008
22:12 < bridge_> <teero777> ah sry
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is it animated
22:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Gamer movie
22:12 < bridge_> <learath2> It's garbage
22:12 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Fall is an interesting movie
22:12 < bridge_> <teero777> Wanted ~~2007~~ 2008
22:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> so #retro
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh ity has morgan freeman there
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> atleast i know it has a god tier actor
22:12 < bridge_> <teero777> main char is also super nice
22:13 < bridge_> <teero777> they even show bathing in litteral molten wax xd
22:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i prefer more sci-fi oriented maybe
22:13 < bridge_> <teero777> but idonwanna spoiler
22:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
22:13 < bridge_> <teero777> is pretty scifi
22:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill consider if idont find anything else
22:13 < bridge_> <teero777> but not really
22:13 < bridge_> <teero777> about a cult that reads the future
22:14 < bridge_> <teero777> idk if you could call it scifi
22:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just wanna remind that p2p protocols are the best invention
22:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :troll:
22:14 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Obviously
22:15 < bridge_> <teero777> yea true true
22:15 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Bitsearch.to is pretty good
22:15 < bridge_> <teero777> i have a movie in mind but i forgor the name 💀
