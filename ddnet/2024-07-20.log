00:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> After Vanguard, it's a matter of question of "whether one fuck up so bad, that they leak everything themselves" than "whether hackers leak from them"
00:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> My conspirecy theory is that hackers wanted companies to get to the most dangerious parts of our computers, so making one oopsie will just brick all computers that use it, so hackers can say that the company did their jobs
00:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
00:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's a lot

01:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Did people actually stop making shotgunfly maps because of this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5768
03:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
03:26 < bridge> <gumbatw> Don't think so. Its just not a versatile mechanic, when u got the right angle there is no big skill expression left (imo)
03:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: so the run guy video is a hand crafted demo? Not an actual run?

06:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have been talking into the void again it seems xd
06:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Epic port @headshotnoby
06:17 < bridge> <headshotnoby> thx but there's still work to do, it's very laggy
06:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nobody will know
06:17 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
06:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That sounded a bit rude. I mean itâ€™s really cool project. I just think there isnâ€™t that many people who actually try it out
06:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Most people probably get excited and celebrate the image in the readme and then move on xd
06:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t own a ps2 but once you publish your port to Nintendo DS I will find mine and try it out hehe
06:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok tbh idk if I still have my DS
06:20 < bridge> <headshotnoby> it won't work on a DS, only on DSi
06:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t have such fancy hardware
06:20 < bridge> <headshotnoby> rip
06:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I just got a github follow from this guy https://github.com/vintagewang he gives me major Jian Tan vibes. Or maybe more linked in bro vibes.
06:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He follows 7k ppl and this way he farmed some follow4follow followers xd. He forked 77 repos. And managed to get one readme change merged into AutoMQ. And now his profile looks like he is full on githubber xxxD
06:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don't get it. What is this for? Do headhunters fall for this?
06:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can someone gitroll that guy? xd

06:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991:  i got a bunch of git conflicts in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949 again when did you say will you have a look? Or are you not planning to merge it anymore and just roll your own translation layer? If so I would like to be informed.
06:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate xwayland
06:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet from steam seems to use it by default
06:55 < bridge> <Souly> chillerdragon: any way to also merge this into that pr? https://github.com/TsFreddie/teeworlds/tree/0.7-adaptable-marking

07:01 < bridge> <Souly> it basically allows markings to fit any body type
08:21 < bridge> <egyt> Translation?
08:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> norming
08:23 < bridge> <egyt> DDNet from tarball seems like it uses xwayland too
08:24 < bridge> <egyt> When I compiled it from source, though, it showed X11 icon in the taskbar insteaf of Wayland one, and I was able to play in FullHD
09:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> protocol translation not human language translation
09:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah nice idea. Yea that sounds good.
09:41 < bridge> <soulyvevo> btw @tsfreddie thank you so much for making this

10:29 < bridge> <robyt3> You'd have to implement the Vulkan backend implementation of this yourself since upstream only has OpenGL. I'd prefer not adding more features to this already huge PR, also because it currently doesn't need to touch the engine graphics.
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 is there a non upstream patch to allow 
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```json
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ["tw-0.6+udp://5.57.32.190:8300","tw-0.7+udp://5.57.32.190:8300","ddper-17+udp://5.57.32.190:8300"]
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddper-17+udp?
10:55 < bridge> <DDNet> 5.57.32.190:8300 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
11:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes: https://github.com/heinrich5991/ddnet/tree/mastersrv_ddper / https://github.com/heinrich5991/ddnet/commit/80246d0f9f2542b86710768600a82719a99e88aa?w=1
11:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's a test run to ultimately hide ddper servers from the ddnet client
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sounds good
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wonder if it makes sense to add a Err variant to Protocol tho, so it can implement default
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i currently use the master server data types for client too
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well for now i put it into option i guess
11:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I was wondering how you noticed ðŸ˜„
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but yea, the expectation is that new protocols can appear at any time. I guess it'd be best to discard unknown protocols at parse time
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wrappers magic
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```rust
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> #[serde_as]
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> pub struct Addresses(#[serde_as(as = "serde_with::VecSkipError<_>")] pub Vec<Addr>);
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> impl Deref for Addresses {
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     type Target = Vec<Addr>;
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>         &self.0
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     }
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> }
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> impl DerefMut for Addresses {
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     fn deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Self::Target {
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>         &mut self.0
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     }
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> }
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
11:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> beautiful
11:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could potentially even inline this in the surrounding struct
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sadly i use it as generic parameter currently bcs the master server uses 'a [Addr] somewhere to serialize servers
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wanted to reuse as much code as possible
11:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
12:21 < bridge> <learath2> A friend of mine was dating a guy who has a github that is full of almost empty repos with generated boilerplate with cool buzzwords in the name/description. I'm guessing someone out there is giving this advice ðŸ˜„
12:21 < bridge> <learath2> had*
13:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah yea you have a point here. Yea im not touching vulkan. Sori Souly too complex for now. Maybe once its merged.
13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea there is this idea floating around that if you do contribute to open source you will get a job
13:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And its true to some degree. I always flex my github in interviews and it worked pretty well so far. But i bamboozeld by how far ppl go to bend the reality. Claiming to be CEO of apache while having basically an empty account is quite intense.
13:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Its not that im innocent my self. My github is also artifically boosted xd but some people are next level.

13:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have all these orgs on my profile which looks like im big on collaborating with a bunch of teams xd. But in reality its just me, myself and I. But there are real projects behind it (mostly xd).
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Its just these really empty repos with full on lies and bunch of empty forks don't make any sense to me. Whoever these people try to impress they must be able to instantly see that it is all fake.

14:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Why?
15:00 < bridge> <zhn> wow what happened to opacity
15:02 < bridge> <zhn> whats ddper protocol lmao
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddper servers only work with ddper client
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that always was stupid
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i assume heinrich convices them to vanish from the list ðŸ˜¬
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> at least for normal ddnet
15:03 < bridge> <zhn> ye every time i want to check some of yoyr projects i just see this and drop it immediately xd
15:04 < bridge> <zhn> i wouldn't though as its good precedent for another mods having extended protocols
15:04 < bridge> <zhn> like imagine nodes in ddnet server list :justatest:
