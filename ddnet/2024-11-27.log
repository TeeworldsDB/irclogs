01:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The connection requires multiple packets to be exchanged. How do you send packets from rcon? What are you planning to do?
02:42 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
02:43 < bridge> <woidless> What should I do?
03:04 < bridge> <kebscs> i wish i had chillerdragon's patience :kek:
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> same
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller for village elder
03:23 < bridge> <louis> anyone have experience with syncing entire folders/files between linux systems? looking at stuff like syncthing
03:23 < bridge> <louis> anyone have experience with syncing entire folders/files between laptop/pc? looking at stuff like syncthing
03:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think admins might have
03:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> thought they used rsync extensively
03:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless download this exe and run it https://github.com/k-i-o/CChat.TW/releases/download/v0.1.6/cchat-setup-0.1.6.exe
03:37 < bridge> <totar> 🤨
04:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s literally the repo posted above
04:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a chat client
05:02 < bridge> <woidless> But I wanted my own program
05:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why?
05:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what makes it your own?
05:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you want someone else rewrite exisiting solution from scratch just so you can call it your own? Do i understand that correctly?
05:09 < bridge> <woidless> Well , in fact yours , but not Kisao 's solution
05:09 < bridge> <woidless> For your own use, uh
05:53 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
05:53 < bridge> <Ewan> if you want it to be yours then write it yourself
05:54 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller has essentially done all the work for you up to this point, unless I’m misunderstanding
06:43 < bridge> <louis> you can use that exe for your own use ?.
06:43 < bridge> <louis> it looks like its open source so just edit it how u need it
06:45 < bridge> <woidless> Ye
06:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @woidless: just use the one I sent you for your own use?
06:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So all good now right?
07:02 < bridge> <woidless> But you can't make a bot jump there, for example
07:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can also not make the bot jump here
07:49 < bridge> <woidless> forgot
10:48 < bridge> <patiga> I use syncthing extensively, it works very nice :)
10:53 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> I use git extensively, it works very nice
11:09 < bridge> <isowner> about rcon - I mean that I wrote a command that sends a packet with int value to all clients (all clients with a special client), but this command send only for those, who on server, therefore, new joining clients not have this value
11:12 < bridge> <isowner> about rcon - i mean that I wrote a command that sends a packet with int value to all clients (all clients with a special client), but this command send only for those, who on server, therefore, new joining clients not have this value
11:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And you want to send it to all players when they join?
11:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would put that code into the OnPlayerConnect method
11:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I am lacking context for a more detailed answer
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> I used unison for a while. It was pretty nice
11:51 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
11:51 < bridge> <woidless> Maybe we just configure the Kisao application so that I can perform any actions for the connected bot, and also I connected to the servers of the ip:port?
11:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://tenor.com/view/what-is-this-we-breaking-bad-meme-we-gif-25916954
11:59 < bridge> <Solly> expect when it doesnt @chillerdragon
12:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> I use unison, works fine on Linux+macOS
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/27/Rust-2024-public-testing.html
13:02 < bridge> <3x1st_> where located enums like PLAYERFLAG_PLAYING?
13:13 < bridge> <Solly> grep "PLAYERFLAG_PLAYING" -r src
13:13 < bridge> <Solly> `grep "PLAYERFLAG_PLAYING" -r src`
13:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like guys, really, learn to use a computer
13:14 < bridge> <Solly> i didnt know you could just search files like that for a long time x-x
13:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Then again, I don't know what to expect of a Visual Studio user...
13:14 < bridge> <Solly> (and i also couldnt setup intelisence it just broke and i couldnt fix it)
13:14 < bridge> <Solly> vsc is great :D
13:14 < bridge> <Solly> vs not so much
13:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Electron 🤢
13:15 < bridge> <Solly> except there are some tools which i would really... like
13:15 < bridge> <Solly> yeah and i cant find a text editor which doesnt force modes, lisp or other weird paradims into my brain
13:15 < bridge> <Solly> with support for all the things i would want to do in a text editor
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend ripgrep
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> rg
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> grep works... /:
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> luckily my requirements are very simple
13:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I want my text editor to:
13:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> - edit text
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> rg works better
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> * highlight
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> * have sane keybinds to move text around
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> * (ai) completion
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> * intelisense
13:16 < bridge> <Solly> * tabs / splitting
13:17 < bridge> <Solly> emacs and vim can do everything... but i dont want to learn a new set of keybinds i will only be able to use in them
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> most editors have vim mode
13:17 < bridge> <Solly> and i dont wana be forced to set that up
13:17 < bridge> <Solly> vscode has sane defaults
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> vscode vim mode is a simple plugin
13:17 < bridge> <Solly> not to my liking, but i can use it for 90% of the thing
13:17 < bridge> <Solly> not to my liking, but i can use it for 90% of everything
13:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> completion is a crutch
13:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> intellisense is a bigger crutch
13:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't need tabs, I have my window manager/tmux
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> highlighting is bad
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> completion bad
13:18 < bridge> <Solly> and most other text editors also have similar keybinds
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> white text is enough
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> poggers
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> why have a window manager at all
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> just use the login shell
13:18 < bridge> <Solly> for completing 30 character long symbols??? when you dont know the symbol name???
13:18 < bridge> <Solly> oh where is this defined, or implemented or referenced, or you want to rename something without just find and replace
13:19 < bridge> <Solly> yeah if you are using a tui
13:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, a window manager might be bloat, but a graphical environment has significantly better font rendering so that's nice
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> what wm u use
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i3 ftw
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> when wayland is usable ill switch
13:19 < bridge> <Solly> dwm go brr
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> but not today
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> to sway
13:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok I'll accept that Awesome is a bit excessive
13:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but it's nice that I don't need to recompile my wm
13:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> i3 works
13:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I honestly don't really care
13:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> as long as I can open and close windows and the wm splits my screen down the middle when I open two of them
13:22 < bridge> <Solly> i have alot more requirements for my wm
13:22 < bridge> <Solly> more than most de's give x-x

13:22 < bridge> <Solly> pretty
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> the bars are the cpu cores
13:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the first thing I did when I installed awesome was disable most of the features in the default config
13:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the second thing I did was never touch it again
13:23 < bridge> <teero777> nvim is better :troll:
13:24 < bridge> <Solly> read the rest of conversation as to learn why i dont like vim
13:24 < bridge> <teero777> nah

13:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1. if you don't know the symbol name you're not familiar enough with the codebase :troll: 
13:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 2. if your symbol names are 30 characters your codebase is too modern
13:27 < bridge> <Solly> 1. how do you expect to learn it then
13:27 < bridge> <Solly> 2. i cant control that
13:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1. :troll: 
13:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 2. :troll:
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> You don't use any completion?
13:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> hello
13:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no I'm just mad right now and trolling my favourite channel to vent
13:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but a lot of the time yeah no completion
13:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> too lazy to set it up
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> Wow, I thought I was backwards with not using ai copilot magic and intellisense
13:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I spend a lot more time reading code than I do writing code
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> I only really use autocomplete for symbols (contextful if available) and go to definition
13:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> same
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> Then you must appreciate teeworlds'
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> Then you must appreciate teeworlds' naming convention
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> Our modified hungarian notation makes reading code a breeze without magic IDE crutches
13:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> modified hungarian notation?
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> The prefixes we add to our variable names, e.g. `m_` or `pfn`
13:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I actually haven't written anything for Teeworlds, I've just read the code (it's the best documentation!)
13:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> part of the reason why I can't stand closed source software
13:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> actually unusable as the majority of the documentation just isn't available
13:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm not quite at the point of reading the binary for documentation
13:41 < bridge> <learath2> I have only had to reverse engineer a binary once to figure out something. It was actually for ddnet/sdl 😄
13:41 < bridge> <learath2> AppKit on macOS
13:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> sounds fun
13:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I should learn; maybe I'll finally be able to tolerate Windows
13:45 < bridge> <learath2> It is quite fun to reverse engineer stuff, it's a decent hobby
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust

13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>

13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43122
14:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> am i crazy or m_HasExtendedData never resets
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> you should try to mod dota2
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
14:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> make dota2 tetris please
14:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it was zeroed along with m_Snap so i'm indeed crazy
14:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait is this valid rust??
14:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg
15:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They origin from network.py and are generated code
15:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea it’s using swarfeys lib under the hood it is capable of jumping
15:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I dont like that ripgrep decides which files and folders are not interesting for me. If I don’t get a hit with rg I usually end up grepping just to be sure. Which usually is so annoying that I straight up grep.
15:08 < bridge> <woidless> Can you help me do it?
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> rg -uuu
15:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait, are player input not 50tps
15:29 < bridge> <Solly> non
15:30 < bridge> <Solly> 25
15:30 < bridge> <Solly> :ghasp:
15:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> more like 20
15:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311338326875176971/image.png?ex=67487e7c&is=67472cfc&hm=44985d36b8b1e48295772a689cae7f81a13452e1684bdeb8cd1a1336c2a6ef42&
15:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or 17
15:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ohno
15:31 < bridge> <Solly> also inputs only get sent if there are changes
15:32 < bridge> <Solly> idk if it affetcs ur test
15:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> this is every tick
15:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i'm 100% sure the cursor is moving the entire time
15:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> way too many 3s and no 1s
15:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm tracking `m_Core.m_Input`  btw
15:35 < bridge> <Solly> have a look in CControls::SnapInput
15:35 < bridge> <Solly> which should be called 25/s
15:37 < bridge> <zhn> based on sv_high_bandwidth afair
15:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye but less than 25?
15:37 < bridge> <zhn> shouldn't
15:37 < bridge> <zhn> lemme test
15:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> dbg_stress test seems to send 50tps hmm
15:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> regardless sv_high_bandwidth
15:40 < bridge> <zhn> :tee_thinking:
15:41 < bridge> <zhn> i broke my test suit oh no :justatest:
15:42 < bridge> <zhn> i swear it sent input like every tick, at least i could see it in snap processing
15:42 < bridge> <zhn> just vrooooooom
15:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW: maybe just human input jitter? dbg_stress dosen't seem to send input via a different routine. it just update the input data during normal `SendInput`
15:43 < bridge> <zhn> shouldn't affect tho
15:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i tried to record a lot of demo, none of them have consective inputs
15:43 < bridge> <zhn> if no input changes were made though
15:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but if i turn on dbg_stress then the demo cursor is like ultra smooth
15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> dbg_stress
15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311343552994742413/2024-11-27_22-50-05.mp4?ex=6748835a&is=674731da&hm=b7fb988c6b2bd2e89c8843792452598cdc3076a9b18aed5ba67f8023abcb5e7a&

15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> both `sv_high_bandwidth 0`
15:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh i get it now
15:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it really only send at 10hz if there is no hooking and moving. bummer.
15:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i guess that make sense
15:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> TIL
15:58 < bridge> <.puch> @chillerdragon is there anyway to force 0.7 client to be loaded on ddnet with 0.6/0.7 bridge server?
15:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> connect via 0.7 protocol address
15:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tw-0.7+udp://ip:port
16:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> one char commit let's gooo
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> o i thought this was about configs
16:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> one char pr\ let's gooo
16:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> one char pr let's gooo
16:19 < bridge> <Solly> when float configs i cry
16:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh, is there a downside for float config?
16:20 < bridge> <Solly> (fyi your pr isnt about float configs)
16:20 < bridge> <Solly> older clients will destroy float values
16:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i didn't change the command at all
16:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it was already reading float
16:20 < bridge> <Solly> demospeed isnt a config is it?
16:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk
16:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh it isn't
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> configs are the ones saved to ddnet_settings
16:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's a commnd
16:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> wait zoom isnt a config either
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> xd i thought we had to some shenangns to get floating zooms
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> just make it a float
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> lmao
16:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis: the only other float command i found is tune
16:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so i was wondering why it was not used at all
16:21 < bridge> <Solly> old codebase
16:22 < bridge> <Solly> made by an even older person
16:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> about importing old config or downporting new config?
16:22 < bridge> <Solly> the usage of ints where floats work perfectly well or even better is a premature optimization which has stuck
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> which is why alot of settings are ints which in every place they are used are turned to floats and divided by some cosntant
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> which i think rather sucks
16:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> is there a downside for that pr tho?
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> for your pr theres no downside
16:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cool
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> nor for the one which would allow float zooms
16:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz you can't really get a 0.1 value which is doable via UI but not via command
16:23 < bridge> <Solly> just would have to add a param to +zoom and -zoom
16:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is kinda odd
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> just would have to add a (float ghasp!) param to +zoom and -zoom
16:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i needed 0.001 speed to check my interpolation things, so i just figure i pr it
16:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> void Update(CNamePlates &pThis, int Id, char* aName, bool FriendMark, float FontSize)
16:24 < bridge> <Solly>     {
16:24 < bridge> <Solly>         ...
16:24 < bridge> <Solly>         pThis.TextRender()->SetCursor(&Cursor, 0.0f, 0.0f, FontSize, TEXTFLAG_RENDER);
16:24 < bridge> <Solly>                 ...
16:24 < bridge> <Solly>     }
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> i need textrender but its inaccesable here, do i just make it... public
16:24 < bridge> <Solly> oh no im an idiot make it a friend!
16:25 < bridge> <Solly> thats a thing in cpp
16:25 < bridge> <Solly> im moving up in the world hey
16:25 < bridge> <Solly> *proceeds to ask chatpgt how to do that*
16:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> i think you have other ways to get a TextRender()
16:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe not via CNamePlates
16:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there are TextRender everywhere i think
16:25 < bridge> <Solly> this is in a struct in CNamePLates.h
16:26 < bridge> <Solly> used by name plates only
16:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> are you sure
16:26 < bridge> <Solly> yes im the one who made the struct
16:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is this even ddnet
16:27 < bridge> <Solly> yes
16:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
16:27 < bridge> <Solly> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9284
16:27 < bridge> <Solly> for this
16:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> then just public it i guess
16:27 < bridge> <Solly> non i make it a friend
16:27 < bridge> <Solly> because those interfaces arent public anywhere else so that would be weird
16:27 < bridge> <Solly> (although thats whaqt i would do if i wasnt bound by law)
16:28 < bridge> <Solly> (well i would get rid of the whole interface systsem)
16:28 < bridge> <Solly> (i dislike it)
16:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> can i take a look cuz i don't understand how you can't find a textrender else where.
16:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did you make another textrender instance?
16:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> the law is: make stuff public that needs to be public or use a getter function
16:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> i remember asking the same thing like a year ago xD
16:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or did you make two structs/classes that only references only to each other but not pClient
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> other places use friend when needing to use private things inside structs inside the class itself
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> tahts why i remembered friend existed
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> why is myr so against it
16:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> Direction arrows D:
16:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311353230416154715/390081592-50e3c00f-7c17-4f26-87b3-eb831e9d06d2.png?ex=67488c5d&is=67473add&hm=308540525dfb4f1a38fc5ae9e3a009add6176b29e585786246ad7b091dd11031&
16:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no one really uses friend i think
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> just skip the commit x-x
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> ive seen it for the reason im about to use
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> this has always been a thing
16:29 < bridge> <Solly> u been living under a rock?
16:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but again, i still have no idea why you can't get a textrender reference <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> friends need to declare protected/private members explicitly right? or do they just expose the entire class
16:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'am about new design of this
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> i never really used friends :kekw:
16:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did you factor the thing so much it doesn't have anything to do with `CGameClient` anymore
16:31 < bridge> <Solly> i have never used friends (resident cpp novice) but i think yeah just lets u access things. it isnt like illegal to do this since the struct is inside the class it wasnt to access stuff rom anyway
16:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you are a good person then
16:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> make friends, don't use them
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you explicitly expose it, good
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you just fully expose it, bad
16:31 < bridge> <Solly> ` it isnt like illegal to do this since the struct is inside the class it wasnt to access stuff from `
16:31 < bridge> <Solly> its just inside a class in a class for seperation of concerns
16:31 < bridge> <Solly> otherwise it would be so messy
16:32 < bridge> <Solly> (even more than it already is)
16:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I'm about to make a lagrange interpolation maneuver. wish me luck
16:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it's 11pm tho
16:32 < bridge> <Solly> larange?
16:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i should probably slepp
16:32 < bridge> <Solly> or lag range
16:32 < bridge> <Solly> oh no it is spelt lagrange
16:32 < bridge> <Solly> that is poor spelling
16:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably french or something
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> i thought they had good spelling
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> (bad but consistent)
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> i knew larange is french
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> but as you just saw lagrange doesnt feel right to me
16:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok do i sleep or do i make this tomorrow night
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> uhh
16:33 < bridge> <Solly> both
16:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok i'll washup and go to bed
16:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gn
16:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> gn hairless man!
16:34 < bridge> <louis> do it rn
16:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i might have more head hair than you
16:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you never know
16:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tempted to grab my laptop into my bedroom
16:50 < bridge> <barlars> how many servers i can create before i get banned from masterserver
16:50 < bridge> <isowner> is it possible to send and receive float?
16:51 < bridge> <Solly> dont be an idiot ™️
16:51 < bridge> <Solly> otherwise there isnt any
16:51 < bridge> <barlars> so
16:51 < bridge> <barlars> 32 ?
16:52 < bridge> <Solly> that doesnt sound like alot
16:52 < bridge> <Solly> you also have to not.. fake players
16:52 < bridge> <Solly> there was some adhoc rules for the master server but i dont know where they are
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> we let common sense rule
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> if the servers solely exist for things like advertisement or faking numbers (e.g filling them with bots)
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> will most likely lead to your servers going into the shadow realms
16:54 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:54 < bridge> <Solly> pThis.TextRender()->TextColor(ColorRGBA(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, Alpha));
16:54 < bridge> <Solly>         pThis.TextRender()->CreateOrAppendTextContainer(m_TextContainerIndex, &Cursor, m_aName);
16:54 < bridge> <Solly> ```
16:54 < bridge> <Solly> how does textcolor with appending to text container work if you set it before rendering?
16:55 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311359877418844182/image.png?ex=6748928e&is=6747410e&hm=e3a3f0603300a6e2f7db9dc276778c9f1b4da6dfd1bb2b0a8288c2ad80a2d5e0&
16:56 < bridge> <Solly> ungodly indentation
16:58 < bridge> <Solly> TextColor multiplies
16:58 < bridge> <Solly> thats unfortunate
16:58 < bridge> <Solly> i mean ill guess ill try and see if it works
16:58 < bridge> <Solly> might look weird
17:00 < bridge> <barlars> hey @sollybunny are you pro at programming
17:00 < bridge> <Solly> not particularly
17:00 < bridge> <barlars> yes you are
17:00 < bridge> <barlars> now u should help me
17:00 < bridge> <Solly> x-x
17:00 < bridge> <barlars> i need to easylyly manage my fng servers but idk how and tmux sucks like its name
17:01 < bridge> <Solly> manage how
17:01 < bridge> <barlars> yes
17:01 < bridge> <barlars> thats what i asked
17:01 < bridge> <Solly> manage how[?]
17:01 < bridge> <barlars> fancy ?
17:01 < bridge> <Solly> manage how == how do you mean "manage"
17:01 < bridge> <barlars> oh
17:02 < bridge> <barlars> i need to monitor their console ram,cpu usage and run some console commands
17:02 < bridge> <barlars> and lastly start stop or restart them
17:02 < bridge> <Solly> im not very sure how to track ram/cpu usage of DDNet-Server
17:03 < bridge> <Solly> also the only way i know how to interact with applications like that is with some screen shenangans (see my minecraft discord bot)
17:03 < bridge> <Solly> i guess it would be fun to make, but idk how useful it will be to you
17:04 < bridge> <barlars> hehe
17:04 < bridge> <Solly> im kinda doing stuff rn
17:04 < bridge> <Solly> dm at the weekend
17:04 < bridge> <Solly> dm me at the weekend
17:04 < bridge> <barlars> sure
17:04 < bridge> <Solly> if im still alive by then
17:04 < bridge> <barlars> professor solly bunny
17:04 < bridge> <barlars> thank u
17:05 < bridge> <louis> ask chatgpt bruh
17:05 < bridge> <louis> itll know how
17:05 < bridge> <barlars> i hate it
17:05 < bridge> <Solly> its a bit complicated for that
17:05 < bridge> <louis> use some top command
17:06 < bridge> <Solly> top cant distinguish processes from eachother
17:06 < bridge> <Solly> top cant distinguish ddnet server instances from eachother
17:06 < bridge> <Solly> htop can, but interfacing with that is wakc
17:06 < bridge> <louis> you can use chatgpt to tell u how to use tmux (which is a good program btw) and monitor cpu usage
17:06 < bridge> <louis> for sending commands from a terminal you'll need to set up fifo
17:06 < bridge> <dizyyy123> is there any way to copy envelopes from the map
17:07 < bridge> <Solly> (might be a #mapping question?)
17:07 < bridge> <louis> file -> append another map
17:07 < bridge> <louis> if you just want envelopes, i'm not sure sry
17:07 < bridge> <Solly> that only lets you write, what abt reading
17:07 < bridge> <louis> he said run some console commands?
17:07 < bridge> <Solly> o i guess u can just go > file 2&>
17:07 < bridge> <barlars> what now mr brainpants
17:07 < bridge> <Solly> o i guess u can just go > file 2&>1
17:08 < bridge> <Solly> o i guess u can just go > file 2&>1 (except that logging is a bit fragile)
17:08 < bridge> <barlars> what is file 2&
17:08 < bridge> <Solly> ddnet server > logfile 2&>1
17:08 < bridge> <Solly> `./DDNet-Server > logfile 2&>1`
17:08 < bridge> <barlars> its fng server
17:08 < bridge> <Solly> `./FNG-Server > logfile 2&>1` (the `2&>1` redirects stdout to stderr)
17:08 < bridge> <louis> what do you specifically want to do @barlars
17:08 < bridge> <Solly> `./FNG-Server > logfile 2&>1` (the `2&>1` redirects stderr to stdout)
17:08 < bridge> <barlars> i need to monitor their console ram,cpu usage and run some console commands
17:08 < bridge> <barlars> and lastly start stop or restart them
17:09 < bridge> <barlars> i need to monitor fng server console . ram,cpu usage and run some console commands
17:09 < bridge> <barlars> and lastly start stop or restart them
17:09 < bridge> <barlars> and its need to be easy to use
17:09 < bridge> <barlars> is there some app liek that
17:10 < bridge> <barlars> maybe a web gui
17:10 < bridge> <Solly> not yet :P
17:10 < bridge> <barlars> like most minecraft servers
17:10 < bridge> <louis> no unfortunately
17:10 < bridge> <Solly> o thats a shout just a multiple process manager where u can pipe stuff into stdin and read from stdout
17:10 < bridge> <Solly> and restart it
17:10 < bridge> <Solly> and stop and start
17:10 < bridge> <Solly> etc etc
17:10 < bridge> <woidless> Do you speak Russian?
17:11 < bridge> <barlars> cyka blyat
17:11 < bridge> <Solly> x-x
17:11 < bridge> <barlars> thats only word i know
17:11 < bridge> <louis> theres no webgui like that, so you'll have to know how to use a terminal
17:11 < bridge> <barlars> i do
17:11 < bridge> <louis> are you hosting your servers on a  vps?
17:11 < bridge> <barlars> vds
17:13 < bridge> <Solly> i was just thinking of making some api to control multiple processes then sticking an ncurses or ui on it
17:14 < bridge> <Solly> then since its an api it can be turned into a web gui if you wanted
17:14 < bridge> <barlars> is it better than manually starting with tmux
17:16 < bridge> <Solly> well if i were to implement it i woudl do it with screens
17:16 < bridge> <Solly> and probably in js (since 1. its easy 2. runs everywhere 3. makes it easy to api it 4. easy access to libraries for screen and tui)
17:16 < bridge> <Solly> no point in making it blazingly fast since it would be doing so little
17:17 < bridge> <barlars> i dont understand it but support u whatever u doin
17:17 < bridge> <Solly> `GNU screen`  (screens) are terminal sessions which can be attatched and detached
17:17 < bridge> <Solly> its probbaly similar to what you are doing with tmux
17:17 < bridge> <barlars> yez

18:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> same clip normal speed

19:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i have no idea why the cursor is flashing tho
19:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> how dare you
19:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What sort of interpolation is this? The artifacting isn't obvious enough for me to tell so I guess that's a good sign
19:37 < bridge> <ar1gin> I see no problem :gigachad:
19:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lagrange
19:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it guarantees to pass each sample point and the path looks like bezier but there is not control points
19:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> however. why is everyone in chn using dyncam, i can't find one that have the cursor on my screen at all time :justatest:
19:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i might need to add dyncam to spectator view
19:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311402318918455407/2024-11-28_02-43-34.mp4?ex=6748ba15&is=67476895&hm=0e1aaf60805f23dc0613b9a4f084c473c342e29ce99fa67b1f94f6feabed8c1a&
19:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> here's the spectator cursor in action
19:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait, wouldn't that imply that you're fitting a polynomial to the entire sequence of inputs?
19:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just 4 around the target time
19:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> using the entire sequence actually explodes the result
19:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i tried
19:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so that'd be some sort of spline that I can't name off the top of my head right now
19:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not computational explode, the result just flies too far
19:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I understand
19:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> anyway, although the position is mostly fake, but i think this looks pretty good to not be jarring and give you a pretty good idea where they are aiming i think
19:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait yeah, with 4 points you'd be drawing cubic splines between them
19:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
19:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's just that
19:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i called it lagrange because i did tried to use all 32 sample points that i've collected
19:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
19:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
19:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im assuming the Catmull-Rom spline equation
19:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> (my favorite polynomial equation)
19:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let's just say, i have no idea
19:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i googled lagrange interpolation and copied some code
19:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
19:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh rip LOL
19:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> idk if catmull rom will look any good tho
19:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> it tends to look extremely floaty
19:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but i think its very fun
19:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline
19:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> doesn't look that similar but maybe it is identical when unrolled
19:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't really want to solve the equation to be sure tho
19:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> fair
19:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like 80% of the chn player are using dyncam
19:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311406077828403293/image.png?ex=6748bd95&is=67476c15&hm=94ba1e6b04e4622e132970a2947545dd13c900348951d7140389e578949d2b85&
19:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not sure what to do for spectator :justatest:
20:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do i just enable smooth dyncam for spectator by default?
20:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'll try it tomorrow i guess
20:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's 3am
20:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Crazy people
20:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311407221275623506/2024-11-28_03-02-43.mp4?ex=6748bea6&is=67476d26&hm=a1b832fe71d4aa0f2efa4ebde9c7732d79001a19882101ced123b3375ede799e&
20:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's all the demo i currently have. let me know if that looks ok **10 hours later**
20:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gn
20:10 < bridge> <zhn> whats that
20:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> spectator cursor
20:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> interpolated from the 10tps data we just found out
20:11 < bridge> <zhn> client receives 10tps character changes?
20:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> funny wobbles
20:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cursor only sends 10tps if the character is doing nothing
20:12 < bridge> <zhn> client -> server or vice versa?
20:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cursor only sends 10tps if the character is doing nothing other than moving the mouse
20:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> client to server
20:12 < bridge> <zhn> huh
20:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311409520567910510/image.png?ex=6748c0ca&is=67476f4a&hm=8d44df4f96ba96507e1e2fbccbb3ecbe70c132f8ef5de930f07ce57be99291ec&
20:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the send flag does not check whether TargetX and TargetY changes
20:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so if no other input has changed, the cursor will only send at 10hz says the comment
20:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it kinda make sense that it doesn't send useless info. once you fire and hook the cursor sends along with those immediately which is the only cursor position that matters i guess
20:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i want to detect the max range from the latest 32 samples to guess a mouse distance max and clamp it. not sure if it is really nessesarry but i think it'll looks more like teeworlds input
20:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> and ye, smaller movement does wobble
20:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> inevitable i guess?
20:18 < bridge> <zhn> if not accurate then its useless imo
20:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the interpolation or the clamping
20:19 < bridge> <zhn> both
20:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's true
20:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and you can just turn off interp i guess
20:19 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not 10 Hz though? `time_freq()` is 1 second and 1s/25 is Hz or 40 ms. Looks like it was changed to 25 Hz in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/24899a13e8863e59027e993a61e9b2ef6787b74b but the comment was not adjusted
20:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'd try using something other than the obvious cubic polynomial, maybe even a curve that changes with input if I felt like an artist
20:20 < bridge> <syrinok> noby has a moderator command on his server to show the player's cursor :greenthing:
20:20 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not 10 Hz though? `time_freq()` is 1 second and 1s/25 is 25 Hz or 40 ms. Looks like it was changed to 25 Hz in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/24899a13e8863e59027e993a61e9b2ef6787b74b but the comment was not adjusted
20:20 < bridge> <zhn> u basically can add another ex packet too btw
20:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah, but still, it kinda sends less than 25tps from what i can tell from the server side
20:20 < bridge> <zhn> maybe it would be more sane and will not distract newbies
20:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like, for smaller velocities make it more linear to avoid overshoot
20:21 < bridge> <zhn> like imagibe some weird config that gets clamped and interpolated
20:21 < bridge> <zhn> and its someone like jukki
20:21 < bridge> <zhn> they will try to copy it and play with wrong one xdd
20:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not sure i want to add ex packet client to server tbh
20:22 < bridge> <zhn> you check onmessage or?
20:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> onpretick
20:22 < bridge> <zhn> 💀
20:23 < bridge> <zhn> so you actually analyze processed input rather then incoming
20:23 < bridge> <zhn> than*
20:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes, but still, that's where charactercore is getting it's info
20:23 < bridge> <zhn> why client to server tho
20:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz client doesn't send enough to server
20:24 < bridge> <zhn> it sends exactly 25tps as we can see
20:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think it can miss the window time to time
20:25 < bridge> <zhn> is it a problem even
20:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it looks too jarring without interpolation for spec cursor
20:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i thought that's the reason we haven't done it yet?
20:25 < bridge> <zhn> idk, but server side cursors worked fine(?)
20:26 < bridge> <zhn> at least ones i saw
20:26 < bridge> <zhn> why it shouldn't work as good on client side
20:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz screen refreshes at 60hz and more?
20:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it just doesn't look like the local cursor does
20:27 < bridge> <zhn> but you should see same ingame huh
20:27 < bridge> <zhn> interpolating is fine ig :justatest:
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean tee and gun angles are interpolated as well <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's definitely for regular players
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not us
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but if we can bump the cursor send rate to 50
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'd be happy too
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also probably make modding a bit easier too
20:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also probably make moderating a bit easier too
20:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but the CHN me is telling me that we shouldn't really do that cuz CHN server bandwidth.
20:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
20:30 < bridge> <zhn> yeah was about to say same
20:30 < bridge> <zhn> i wonder ehat would be a bottleneck tho
20:30 < bridge> <zhn> bandwidth itself or packet processing stuff
20:36 < bridge> <syrinok> More than a bit, it's a great tool
20:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311415622642438285/2024-11-28_03-36-36.mp4?ex=6748c679&is=674774f9&hm=37d5970e984d53ec6ba2543942de172777df1ea86f23f44c46649dd7d765386e&
20:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> interp comparison btw
20:38 < bridge> <zhn> first is accurate second is smooth
20:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and there is a toggle
20:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
20:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> choose your flavor
20:39 < bridge> <zhn> toggle is no no
20:39 < bridge> <zhn> remember what messiah heinrich told us
20:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's not like there is a gameplay difference tho
20:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do want to turn interp off when modding i think...
20:41 < bridge> <zhn> use server side cursor :P
20:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> modding = moderating
20:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or do we have server side cursor on ddnet servers already?
20:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm obviously lagging behind on ddnet features
20:42 < bridge> <oxyzo.> add free rcon for everyone:hey:
20:42 < bridge> <zhn> nop
20:42 < bridge> <oxyzo.> on every server
20:42 < bridge> <zhn> no
20:42 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :tear:
20:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ask jiatan
20:42 < bridge> <zhn> ah
20:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not some kid that just add modding features to upstream just because i want it
20:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
20:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not some kid that just add server-modding features to upstream just because i want it

20:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i really should go to sleep i think
20:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How does it look if you compensate for the delay?
20:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok yeah maybe I shouldn't be asking questions at this time :)
20:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'll do that tomorrow
20:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
20:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tbh i don't really care
20:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's interpolated, all it has to do is looks fine
20:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Just train a small neural network by uhhh crowdsourcing training data and use that for your cursor estimation :) :) :)
20:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Telemetry is good, right? Not problematic at all?
21:01 < bridge> <kebscs> any updates on #9092
21:01 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9092
21:01 < bridge> <kebscs> any updates on #9092?
21:01 < bridge> <kebscs> pr ready and approved
21:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg this is a game changer
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Could we somehow add test cases for this function including the argument handling and escaping? Looks like we don't escape backslashes yet. Is that not necessary?
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it possible to connect to the existing ddnet servers with websockets?
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> i know it's a feature, but it can be disabled too
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAIK websocket support is broken (#5625, #2853)
22:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5625
22:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2853
22:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> We disabled it on official servers because it doubles the impact DoS attacks have
22:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> it being broken in client and lan tab doesn't help either 😄
22:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> we only had it enabled so you could join from http://teewebs.net/
22:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> client never shipped with websockets I think
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> i can add test cases, but would rather leave backslash escaping to someone that uses this in future, it doesnt need to be foolproof
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> this pr doesnt do anything related to backslashes
22:44 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont like how it does quote escaping even, it should be up to developers how they want to do that imo
22:45 < bridge> <robyt3> How would that work? Then it's just broken for everyone if they don't follow the standards
22:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Then `shell_execute` need a warning remark about what it can and cannot do correctly safely without causing arbitrary code execution for the user
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> quotes for every arg yes, but helping them add a backslash, idk about that
22:55 < bridge> <Solly> @robyt3 you alive rn?
22:57 < bridge> <Solly> darn
23:00 < bridge> <robyt3> What's the question? I'm working on my factory :owo:
23:01 < bridge> <Solly> what kinda factory
23:01 < bridge> <Solly> it was about the ` Introduce Parameter Object`
23:02 < bridge> <Solly> i dont really know how to group the items
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Factorio Space Age
23:02 < bridge> <Solly> i could have a rendernameplatenameparam struct (which is part of rendernameplatename aswell)
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd probably put them all in one object
23:02 < bridge> <Solly> but that only ads to the ocmplexity?
23:03 < bridge> <Solly> is that just to make each argument clear where it is
23:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, otherwise the function call is pretty unreadable
23:03 < bridge> <Solly> it kinda feels like stretching for kwargs
23:03 < bridge> <Solly> but yeah it would be more readable
23:03 < bridge> <robyt3> And it's very easy to add bugs if you have 5 int arguments and you accidentally swap one
23:03 < bridge> <Solly> :D
23:04 < bridge> <Solly> i need to do atleast a single factorio
23:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> this is the first time ive seen robyt3 use an emoji like that
23:05 < bridge> <Solly> just lil guy playing a big game
23:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> factorio is so fun, i need to get back into it
23:05 < bridge> <Solly> nu'in wrong with dat
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
23:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> I saw a few :justatest:'s from roby :kek:
23:49 < bridge> <Solly> does "p" prefix go on references?
