23:43 <@deen> A very large DDoS attack against your IP address 95.172.92.151 overloaded our connection speed and/or our router's filtering capacity at your location a short while ago and caused location-wide problems. We were forced to null-route the IP address as an emergency response measure. This null-route will need to remain in place for at least 4 hours.
23:45 <@deen> That's GER, now GER2 being attacked
