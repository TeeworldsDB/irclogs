09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> great
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And you really don't understand these lines of code ?
09:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Some of them but not all
09:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well that sucks xd
09:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Can u write all setup code urself?
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say i could write it with the docs nowadays
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Without a tutorial
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://gpuopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Vulkan-Diagram.png
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This is all you need to understand
09:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ive seen those words :poggers2:
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I assume the hardest for beginners is descriptors and Render passes
09:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot did you write
09:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/dance-jul%C4%B1an-dance-gif-1139695495022300889
09:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> still drunk fokko? :D
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Always been
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He posted some image but it doesn't load anymore
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Where was that discord backup again
10:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I wasn't even drunk, I just found it funny because heinrich's role is literally "hcirnieh"...
10:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But u can't see it over there
10:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
10:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> zilly dreck huhn u dont use discord cuz of Tencent or what exactly made u rq?
10:36 < bridge> <kekomonter> Vulkan or OpenGL?
10:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> vulkan
10:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nice
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Legendary
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Now that u pro, what is your next project
10:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> make fancy ass webgl renderer for demos
10:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> make fancy ass webgl2 renderer for demos
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So you already abounded vulkan again? Xd
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Renderer = to video converter?
10:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Nono
11:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Eeeeh, id like it to play demo
11:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> On website
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah, i hope i don't destroy your goal if i tell you that is already possible
11:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yes?
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, but my Apache Server is not running rn. I can later show it.. u can simply compile ddnet to a web version
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So it's basically the real client playing it
11:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Cool, i ain't doing that project anyone then
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XD
11:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Cool, i ain't doing that project anymore then
11:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Time to come back in web development :pepeW:
11:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ive got 5 stars on GitHub repo, it is so popular :poggers:
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Time to learn webgpu
11:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I was interested in graphics only because of demo rendering
11:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Go + htmx time
11:21 < ChillerDragon> I added some macro magic that updates checkboxes in front of the votes if the underlying config option change is already applied
11:21 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700043626.png
11:21 < ChillerDragon> would this be interesting for ddnet?
11:22 < ChillerDragon> official ddnet uses other hacks already for the map types but maybe some community servers would like toggeling options such as /me on or off
11:23 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut ye tencent bad
11:23 < ChillerDragon> also closed src software is cring
11:24 < ChillerDragon> oh and they random ban ppl
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wat. Rust+ Vulkan time
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan doesn't work on Web answers
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan doesn't work on Web
11:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I had different goal with vulkan
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Continue that goal
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Distractions with side projects are not helpful
11:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But it was related to web demo renderer
11:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sooo
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U wanted to Render it Server side?
11:45 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i think i had a dream where i played ctf
12:01 < bridge> <Dreamless> u're the dream destroyer here..
12:01 < bridge> <Dreamless> If only you hadn't said what u said.. he would be on a journey rn xD
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe you as a dreamless person can give him some tips and tricks
12:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's pointless, why making own goofy ahh version when u can compile ddnet to a web version
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is the point existence anyway
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You will def learn smth new
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe your answer to the same question is better
12:11 < bridge> <Dreamless> idk? wasn't ur goal to learn vulkan?
12:11 < bridge> <Dreamless> it's done by others but if u wanna learn something u gotta do it urself..? Or at least study from what others has done.
12:11 < bridge> <Dreamless> but, if you don't have the will to do it because it has already been done..well..what should I say xd
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @milkeeycat you learned Vulkan Bro. That's one of the hardest to use libraries I've used so far, even tho one of the best documented ones, you can find. Isn't that fact already impressive
12:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> "learned" :clueless:
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Now u have to do it again and again. After few times, you'll understand everything^^
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks its decided
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use nasm for aoc
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hope i find time to make my nasm library
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> e.g to have my own nasm hashmap, list, etc
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Great
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks does the linux kernel provide a syscall to hash?
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> what hash algo could i use for the hash table
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> in such low level
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> modulo ^^
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> well a hash table already uses module size of the current capacity
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> modulo*
15:26 < bridge> <patiga> as a hash function it might actually work out at first
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but sometimes aoc problems have big inputs
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess it needs to work well for 1000 or so
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i make it fixed size and not handle reallocations it can be easier
15:27 < bridge> <patiga> as long as the input isn't a lot of power of 2, it might still work fine xd
15:27 < bridge> <patiga> but yea, you'll hit a problem eventually
15:28 < bridge> <patiga> but then bandage it with fixed-size buckets 🫠
15:29 < bridge> <patiga> but knowing what your rust aoc solution looked like, I suppose you want to do it 'properly'? :happy:
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if with nasm i want to do it properly
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> its way more work
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> but maybe yes
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> - io library
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> - collections
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> - simple algorithms?
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need this
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill probs first solve it in rust and then try nasm
15:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog nasm already looking forward to your repo ryo
15:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao the hammer gif you sent today at Today at 23:24 is amazing @fokkonaut where is that coming from? o.O
15:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Dear time traveller, today at 23:24 I will post it to tell you,

15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe even have a short call because ping poning emails is not getting anywhere
15:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Even I can smell your nervousness from reading 3 messages by u (yesterday and today)
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I was/am furious lmao
15:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> <a:banouis:1063776702544744498>
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxD
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it renders so poggies in the webchat
15:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Idk where it's from tbh, I have a free 2 week Nitro trial (even though I had Nitro already in the past) and it came up when I searched some nouis emojis
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that a ddnet emote?
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah nitro?
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so from some random ddnet/tw discord?
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No, it just says "This Emoji is from a server you are in" without telling me which.
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> In the past it did...
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trols
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its well made
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanna compliment the artist
15:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @_voxeldoesart you are a artist? you must know who made it
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> <a:cagentpatpat:785420444924248085>
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He's not a artist.

15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was in nouis dc
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think i got kicked or i left
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have the emotes
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki what if the aoc Server runs on arm?
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then u doomed
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats not how it works
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> the aoc problems only require an answer
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> u calculate the answer with ur program locally
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Watafak
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like that famous problem site
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it all about who is there fastest?
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> well if u care about being fast sure
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the problems itself get more challenging
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> each day
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> the fun is at sharing here and discussing
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure u were here when we did it last time
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just dont remember
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> we do this every year
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i remember deen posted some bash
15:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> No idea
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> deen made it with a diff language each day
15:50 < bridge> <patiga> to get global points, you need to be among the top 100 fastest coders on that day
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> till day 14 iirc
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but I didn't think that it's about only posting the answer
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> he even made it with sql
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> obviously its a answer u need a program to know
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the site specifically says no AI
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the internet is evil
15:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> now he should make it in acratch
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I thought they also measure which program runs the fastest. Like every sane person would do that is called jupstar
15:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> now he should make it in scratch
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> Also, starting this December, please don't use AI to get on the global leaderboard.
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://adventofcode.com/about#ai_leaderboard
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Can I use AI to get on the global leaderboard? Please don't use AI / LLMs (like GPT) to automatically solve a day's puzzles until that day's global leaderboards are full. By "automatically", I mean using AI to do most or all of the puzzle solving, like handing the puzzle text directly to an LLM. The leaderboards are for human competitors; if you want to compare the speed of your AI solver with others, please do so elsewhere. (If you want to use A
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Will totally be ignored
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> we can do that ourselves
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can grab a cheap vps with nothing and run the programs
15:52 < bridge> <patiga> the input is a bit randomized, they are sometimes values or text files with data. on some days though we realized that there are maybe only like 3-5 different inputs iirc
15:52 < bridge> <cyberfighter> why does saving keep doing this
15:52 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1174361260029132800/image.png?ex=65675026&is=6554db26&hm=5272aca5c488618233af85a57ba18797348e06e7abd9f568fa2877b1b81b518c&
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> or well maybe use my server if it doesnt have noise
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That would actually be funny imo
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually my home server doesnt have noise
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz i have nothing there yet
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but we can bench with the same input
15:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont like how yesterday i had to use bingai to help me write down a command
15:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> gpt and bard failed me but i didnt want to manually create 20 folders
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to use unholy unsafe rust to get the max speed
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> and also intrinsics and simd
15:53 < bridge> <patiga> lets only count cpu cycles to favor gpu work :troll:
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> counting cpu cycles is ez with c++ or rust
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk if with python i can

16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> im also at work
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Exactly.. if u ignore voxel for another 2 months u get robyte and i take voxel
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> a game like ddnet is a ton of work
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not realistic
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> we need 5 jupstars
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> (to make it in rust i mean ofc we are not gonna code in c++ ew)
16:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why not all us team up

16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I've seen that before
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it final now m
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> sailboat hardcore simulator
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> Elongated Muskrat says 100 mile x 100 mile array of solar panels and a couple gigawatts of battery storage can power the US np
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean that's insanely huge space we talking about
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> factorio vibes
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's like half of Germanys width xd
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki you have ddnet2 plans too?
17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> not rly xd
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> im already like a retired dev
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just talk a lot

17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> when tees with fur?
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "nasm" libraries are just libraries, you can any library from assembly ^^
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. libc
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know i know
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean making it all
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
17:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @chillerdragon im probably the only one with ddnet2 ideas LOL
17:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like he'd do anything good for us LOL
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > <ChillerDragon> jopstis ddnet2 sounds promising!
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> has ryo leaked smth, or what did i miss?
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have no ddnet2
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:47 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i have a feeling this is all a bit and none of you care about remaking ddnet
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i remake vanilla
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not ddnet
18:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why call it ddnet2 then
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not about caring or not
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> its lot of work and one got limited time
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> personally i dont have time
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> we need new 16y old devs
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
18:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
18:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd say it's about caring
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always stated my will to break all compat and become teeworlds independent
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I prioritize other things over ddnet whcih leads me to have less time for ddnet
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh well if u put it like that
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i still care about ddnet and its future, but i dont have time to change it, maybe its true if i cared more i would find that time
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well maybe if we had a set of plans nicely laid out and separated, where one could pick a issue and do it it may be different
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> buts its hard to organize
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem is more probably on organizing the work than doing it xd
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> and knowing what to do even
18:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz we got the skills
18:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/pepe-wink-pepe-wink-gif-18805786
18:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> plus i have too many ideas that bog down the whole engine LOL
18:58 < ChillerDragon> any tui email client recommendations?
19:23 < bridge> <axel_vestin> mutt
19:28 < ChillerDragon> yea indeed it is very smooth
19:28 < ChillerDragon> last time i tried it it was a bit messy. Not sure what i did back then but i just reinstalled it and it seems to be exactly what i wanted :)
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @avolicious i think lasers are broken on kog

20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what port does legacy master server use?
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> static const int MASTERSERVER_PORT = 8300;
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> found
20:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/93f5bf632a3859e97d527fc93a26b6dced767fbc/src/mastersrv/mastersrv.h#L5
20:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you were faster
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i assume the https master servers the normal ssl port?
20:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 0.7: 8283
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do they have a specific port to send the UDP request?
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the token
20:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, 443
20:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, port and IP address are pretty much random
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's probably a problem for the stuff we talked in PM
20:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we're currently using mullvad
20:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we're currently using mullvad VPN
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well works for now xd
20:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you know what would be fun af? logic in ddnet maps.
20:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and/not/or gates, variables, if blocks, basic math
20:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> computer inside ddnet :poggers2:
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> redstone
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah would be funny
20:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> would make for some fun maps too
20:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> race track map where u have to go around 3 times in order to win
20:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and maybe the map changes ever so slightly each run
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thanks almost forgot that i also host 0.7 servers xddd
20:45 < ChillerDragon> 0.7

21:27 < bridge> <cyberfighter> society if envelopes could get activated by switches ors mth idk lol
21:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://tenor.com/view/future-ram-ranch-gif-18120355
21:48 < bridge> <avolicious> Might be, havent tested. Is there any change to lasers in the past ddnet upstream updates?
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i've no overview about that, dunno which commit kog even based on rn xd
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the map works on ddnet servers
21:59 < bridge> <avolicious> I havent changed any physics nor laser logic
21:59 < bridge> <avolicious> we havent pushed an update for a while
22:00 < bridge> <avolicious> so might be a fix inbetween
22:00 < bridge> <avolicious> Gonna prepare an update, maybe its fixed then
22:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/3216#issuecomment-1813268889
22:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you think it's a good idea to tell people to work on teeworlds?
22:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in teeworlds' current state, I'd expect the pull request to never be reviewed
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let me rephrase. I do not think it's a good idea to tell people to work on teeworlds
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you think?
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^ @jtbx.
23:04 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 its ironic that you says i shouldnt review a pr because it never gets review :D
23:04 < ChillerDragon> but year i get your point. My feedback was before this gets merged more stuff has to be done. Exactly those kind of reviews that i hate :D
23:04 < ChillerDragon> I would argue that everyone can see the current state of the repo and knows what they are getting into
23:05 < ChillerDragon> I am also waiting for dune to contact oy so we can talk about merges
23:06 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 also if nobody opens prs Oy brings the "if there were prs i would merge" argument
23:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7464#issuecomment-1813341932
23:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Saw
23:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I’m going to bed now. It’s going to be weeks until the controller -.-
23:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why weeks?
23:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> good night 🙂
