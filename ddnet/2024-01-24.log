05:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo btw heinrich ill stop sending you matrix bug reports but i got another 2 bugs right now in the 10 seconds i used matrix to send a code snippet xxxxxD
08:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how to community
08:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> would be cool if you would explain instead of ignoring
08:38 < bridge> <matodor> you want community logo for 1 blmapchill server xD ?
08:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> of course
08:38 < bridge> <matodor> https://tenor.com/view/no-nooo-nope-eat-fingerwag-gif-6587305437700023105
08:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's a community, which needs to be verified :)
08:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Step one. Go open source
08:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Not required currently.
08:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Currently there is no community accepted that wasn't previously too
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That's news to me, Avo told me to apply for community so that my server can get out of KoG tab and that currently there is no open source enforcement.
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I hope it's not double standards again
08:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Currently it's just as it was before the update. Nothing else
08:43 < bridge> <zhn> again?
08:43 < bridge> <zhn> heinrich started discussion about communities on gh
08:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also why should ddnet suddenly start advertising ur closed source mod on a clean config
08:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are exactly 0 double standards
08:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Kog will need to go open source too
08:45 < bridge> <matodor> big mistake, example - I developed a big interesting mod, with its own rules, for example, no swearing and insults, online on the server is small, you force the mod to be open source - some schoolboy starts a server, allows you to insult each other there (like on block servers), adds other garbage because of which the online on his server flies into the skies, and the original mod dies
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good but it's not ddnets task to advertise your awesome mod
08:46 < bridge> <zhn> original xpanic didnt go open-source - only kurosios copy is alive
08:46 < bridge> <zhn> alive in terms we have the code of his code only
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also if the mod is closed source and the maintainers are as holes it's nothing better. So your argument is a double sided sword
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If your mod is as good as you think, then the advertisement you get will probably overweight the fact that others can copy it in future
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> good norming
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you think a second gores mod would instantly be a hit?
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> why did ddnet not do gores
08:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno xd
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it's stupid kog shouldn't really exist
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just ddnet
08:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's about protecting players and letting them know which server is real. That's the entire reason why KoG added bw and my server to their list, because we had to fight against fake servers.
08:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If it was not possible for us to join communities, then it would not have to be done in the first place.
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can join communities
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki do you manually remove files from /boot after installing a new version of kernel? :owo:
08:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> BW aswell as I will probably not go open source just for that
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do you fear so much that your server will be replaced?
08:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Why do you project so much?
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You are visible on first install
08:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Or interpret
08:51 < bridge> <matodor> @fokkonaut just run 10x ddnet servers, get a community logo and after some weeks run blmap chilll server, profit 😄
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You probably get most new payers bcs u have 128p support
08:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You don't seem to get it. By fake servers I mean proxy servers who tried to collect IPs of our players, in order to use them for attacks against us
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But of you are in communities ur server will have a logo
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So better now then never
08:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> How does that work can someone just copy (wrong term but I think you get it) and paste IPs?
08:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Please stop trying to make me publish my mod, ty
08:52 < bridge> <matodor> and where are the requirements for communities?
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then stop converting ddnet to advertise your mod
08:53 < bridge> <matodor> for example, how many servers should be the minimum, etc.
08:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Do you have some kind of bad mood today? Maybe take a rest for now
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are ofc open questions. But to rephrase it.
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The communities that will be active on first install, will probably need to be oss.
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We can still think about communities that are not pre selected
08:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But they will be less visible
08:54 < bridge> <matodor> what is `oss`?
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Open source
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (Software)
08:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> He's filling for Ryozuki since he's on vacation
08:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That doesn't make any sense, as then it's better to not have any community at all, cuz then the server is visible at leats. Lol.
08:55 < bridge> <matodor> i have one open source server online, have discord server, can i get community tab now? :brownbear:
08:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Haha ^^
08:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Exactly my humor
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That your server got this attention at all was a mistake, that's right
08:56 < bridge> <matodor> I'm not kidding :justatest:
08:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think though Jupstar's point is that real != safe.
08:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @jupeyy_keks envious?
08:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Btw, following your points we have to remove mods as blockZ from DDNet now (closed src)
08:57 < bridge> <matodor> Another question, if the author of the mod (source code) has not created his own community, then by forking the mod I create my own, what happens in this case?
08:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Accept that this game is advertised on steam as oss. And that the game only lives thanks to many contributors that voluntarily help it. 
08:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why should it now make a turn around just because of you being mad af
08:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol. It's funny how much you interpret xD
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't understand this
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The author of the source code did is not the author of the mod idea?
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This already happened for e.g
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>  Fng
08:59 < bridge> <matodor> and how will it be, one FNG community?
09:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You're totally going nuts @jupeyy_keks
09:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It isn't right now. But most players will probably play noby fng
09:01 < bridge> <matodor> for example, imagine ddnet community not created, i fork ddnet mod, run servers and want get a community tab
09:02 < bridge> <matodor> you didn't answer, it will be one community or NOBY FNG Communuty, Alive FNG Community and more...
09:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well that's an open question. I guess at first step we can make existing communities get a higher priority to join
09:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> He's not in the mood to answer correctly today
09:04 < bridge> <matodor> What is generally meant by community, a game mode or a community of players united, for example, by a discord server?
09:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> "correctly"? If we knew what was correct we wouldn't be having this conversation tbh
09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It doesn't help that you try to trashtalk me. It's obvious from the start that you are the mad one
09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We have an open issue where we discuss the requirements
09:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Projection big time.
09:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Have a good day my dear
09:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks you too bae
09:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> <3
09:08 < bridge> <matodor> 🥺
09:08 < bridge> <zhn> btw did you see any copy of mrpg/mmotee/infclass with schoolboy as host/developer
09:08 < bridge> <zhn> have you seen*
09:09 < bridge> <matodor> I have already met with someone who stole my ideas and implemented them on the block server)
09:09 < bridge> <zhn> who is it lol
09:09 < bridge> <matodor> but yes, this is different, these are not running sources
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Jupstar projecting his madness onto others today:
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> > - maintainers are as holes
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> > - stop converting ddnet to advertise your mod
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> > - That your server got this attention at all was a mistake, that's right
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> > - just because of you being mad af
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> > - It doesn't help that you try to trashtalk me. It's obvious from the start that you are the mad one
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can you please stop to quote out of context
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This is pure evil
09:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just showing that you're the one trashtalking xD Anyways, keep projecting.
09:12 < bridge> <matodor> https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kBxlKhJ397o
09:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's simply that this is a lie
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Also **if** the mod is closed source and the maintainers are as holes it's nothing better. So your argument is a double sided sword"
09:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Get better arguments than "This is pure evil" or "It's simply that this is a lie" xD
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dude can you read
09:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> We can discuss this properly, if you want
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you completely quoted out of context
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just accept that you are 100% evil in this case
09:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ok, I think you're not able to dicuss properly currently. Tell me when you're in a better state of mind, I'm here
09:17 < bridge> <matodor> if there are still so many questions about communities, then why are they already in production?)
09:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that wasn't my decision
09:18 < bridge> <matodor> advertisement of ddnet and kog :poggers2::poggers2:
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #7699
09:19 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7699
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it makes you happy, i personally would accept communities that are closed source, **BUT** not allow them to be filtered on clean config by default
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> filtered in*
09:23 < bridge> <matodor> I think a checkbox for verified servers would be enough with the application form
09:23 < bridge> <matodor> plus an API for the master server, so that verified servers can specify links that would be displayed somewhere in the client
09:24 < bridge> <matodor> communities are still filtered by name, everyone adds their prefix to the server name
09:25 < bridge> <matodor> today communities filtered by name, everyone adds their prefix to the server name
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> aaaeee
10:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I Love that jupi and foko are beeing a little :AFmerumad:  at each other and U have matodor basically chatting with himself :gigachad:
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> ☹️
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 🫂
10:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @blaiszephyr lmao true
10:54 < bridge> <zhn> city mod has casino too, hasnt it?
10:56 < bridge> <matodor> yes, I showed it to some people, but they didn’t just take the idea, they even took the 1 in 1 map
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye mats C# mod is really cool! <:owo:1154794204871008397>
11:04 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I seen a few infclass servers, pretending to be better because they have ~~ruined balancing ~~ increased damage and limits. Stronger = better, you know. Add a huge gun and you're a 'next generation'. Have the server located in a different country and you'll get players "by default" because the smaller ping is attractive, especially for newcomers.
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it sucks that you can not use rude words and its closed source
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would fork and make it a toxic server axaxax @matodor 
11:06 < bridge> <matodor> 😄
11:08 < bridge> <cyberfighter> who even is schoolboy
11:09 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It seems to be DDNet (client) responsibility to give equal (at least comparable) discoverability and convenient access for all servers.
11:09 < bridge> <nouaa> I'm going to quote a big guy:
11:09 < bridge> <nouaa> 
11:09 < bridge> <nouaa> > Give even more power to people who DDoS servers and steal mods/players
11:09 < bridge> <nouaa> > Make putting in the work to create and maintain a good mod even less rewarding
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who u quote?
11:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> :justatest:
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> no closed source only gpl, make ddnet gpl
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gpl vs MIT is the new tabs vs spaces or what
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> good morning its 7:11
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki make ur github status "I use gpl BTW"
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do i wake up so early
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good evening its 18:12
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> asian chiller
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> why chiller relocate?
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> aksually its 12:12
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> better ping on singapore servers
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for ddnet gaming
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No. Ddnet has an interest to make ddnet servers be the most visible. Communities is already a way to make other mods more equal. In this step it additionally makes sure these communities have similar values.
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> From ui perspective I've nothing against making mods generally more visible. But it should be clear that these mods are not part of ddnets ecosystem
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so to add that: it's not unlikely that ddnet will even enforce certain rules (e.g. "be nice") for these servers
11:21 < bridge> <dogy777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/750301928499707935/1198647918803026060/image.png?ex=65bfaadd&is=65ad35dd&hm=e23f3789705067d4143a756e80d2a37415ed3c8179a8a41e7d6f64b43eec758e& how to fix?
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't use beta for now
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 any plans to fix above error? been broken for quite some time now
11:22 < bridge> <en1gma_ddr> which beta? its steam client, default
11:23 < bridge> <en1gma_ddr> im about Тимофей
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how did you get that skin then?
11:23 < bridge> <en1gma_ddr> Oop
11:23 < bridge> <en1gma_ddr> sorrey)
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller that can’t really be why you moved
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> np
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan no singapore servers are boring af and my internet here is ass anyways xd
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> so why you move
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only place i would move to for ping is russia so i can play Copy Love Box
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan secret
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @kaffeine0 i can understand that you want your player base being kept together. But I want to make very clear that my point is really about what the player sees first, when starting the ddnet client.
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If there are only servers that are closed source, and in worst case the player base is very toxic.
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then:
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. ddnet will get the bad review
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. ddnet, advertised as OSS, seems the opposite
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3. ddnet can almost not control that anymore, because the player base will be mad
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at this point maybe a new game is better that is not called ddnet
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller is wanted by the government
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
11:26 < bridge> <matodor> 0.7 propaganda?
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye i spread the word of 0.7 in local asian communities
11:28 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > Communities is already a way to make other mods more equal.
11:28 < bridge> <kaffeine0> As I see, the communities idea (the new servers browser) in its current state only hurts the UX and reduces "other mods" discoverability.
11:28 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 
11:28 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > In this step it additionally makes sure these communities have similar values.
11:28 < bridge> <kaffeine0> There are many servers which do not care. On the first step you reduce the visibility for everyone except DDNet, on the second step you add requirements to get an half of that visibility back, pretending that you're improving something.
11:28 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Decide what you want: if you want better UX for the players then try asking players. If you want more contributions to DDNet then ask for that.
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah replies in irc
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can see replies!
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the UX is not even part of this discussion in my opinion.
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i never said i like the UI at all
11:29 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I see your point. You care about DDNet reputation. How the request to be "open source" matches that idea?
11:31 < bridge> <kaffeine0> For me UI is just destroying and making a nonsense all this approach of "hey everyone! do you wanna be one of our communities? then publish your code and we'll give you an half of what you have a few months ago".
11:31 < bridge> <kaffeine0> For me UI is just destroying and making a nonsense all this approach of "hey everyone! do you wanna be one of our communities? then publish your code and we'll give you an half of what you had a few months ago".
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't understand how it does not match?
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is how ddnet was build.
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can also rephrase it:
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet's values rn are, being transparent (donations), being open source, being "nice" <- not being too toxic.. ofc this is a hard to moderate topic
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the player that starts ddnet, should see these values reflected
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> The one introduced by curl was fixed by Robyt before I ever got home
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok, sry then
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well if you ask me, i'd also be ok if communities would be completely moved to a new tab and internet will be as before.
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> again, for me this is not a about UI design
11:33 < bridge> <kaffeine0> You want to have a non-toxic servers visible by default. Yet you say you don't see a sense in applying the "be nice" policy to those servers; you want to have them open sourcing the code instead.
11:33 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Does it make any sense?
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just want to make clear, that if comminities will, however it will look like, be shown as the first, default look into the client.
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then these communities should share ddnet's value up to a certain amount
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as said, i can imagine that the "be nice" rules will apply too additionally
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> banning toxic servers is fucked
11:34 < bridge> <learath2> The day that first issue was made I knew there was no way we could make anyone happy with that
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> right now we dont even have guidelines, so i cannot foresee how it will look like
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not at all about banning
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is already completely wrong.
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i give a shit about if u go closed source, or take 10000000 euros to play your game
11:35 < bridge> <avolicious> Open source and players being toxic are two different things. Open source wont solve this problem
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> agreed
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also being toxic is not a problem
11:36 < bridge> <avolicious> Toxic is a problem
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see ddnet rules more as a problem
11:36 < bridge> <avolicious> There are kids playing this game
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how does that argument help. i said that I, personally, see both as a requirement sooner or later
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if their parents dont want kids in the toxic internet they should install OpenGFW on their router
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs there 100% will be bad servers, and this will influence ddnet's decision making
11:36 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller is a freespeech absolutist. Best ignore his opinions on that specific matter
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :c
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :c 
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> The right to say racist slurs and cyber bully kids shall not be breached by the ddtyrants
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> +1 
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i like using "kys" as smalltalk o.O
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> See, delulu, best not pay too much attention 🙃
11:38 < bridge> <avolicious> I doubt that closed source servers will influence ddnets decision
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats delulu xd
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > Delulu is an internet slang used to describe the belief that one can influence one's own destiny through sheer willpower. Derived from the English language word "delusional", the term has its origins in K-pop communities where the term delulu is used to refer to individuals who were in a parasocial relationship with celebrities and had hopes of meeting them someday. The term has subsequently been adopted by Generation Z and
11:39 < ws-client> Generation Alpha, popularized by viral Tiktok trends such as the catchphrase, "delulu is the solulu", which implies that self-confidence is the solution. Wikipedia
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but as said. it's about making 100% clear that these servers are not part of ddnet's ecosystem
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato flexing english agaun
11:39 < bridge> <avolicious> Which is in the new UI visible
11:39 < bridge> <avolicious> You can see DDNets logo infront of the server
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i love how "tiktok" is mentioned on wikipedia pages explaining words xd
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u install a minecraft mod and join a custom minecraft server, and ppl there are mad and the mod sucks
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then it's unlikely u blame mojang for it
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no we blame microsoft for that
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only as long as ddnet servers are the top ones
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wrote magnus an email when my kog account didnt work
11:40 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont get why people shouldnt enjoy other gamemodes aswell, this will kill the entire ecosystem
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you didnt?
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok sorri i close irc now enuff trolling
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is just so wrong, where did i ever say that?
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are 100% ignoring my arguments
11:41 < bridge> <avolicious> It implies it. Its in peoples nature to join full servers and I do have proof for this thesis
11:42 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw, I did want to keep the ddnet tab just to make it obvious which servers we provide support for
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't deny that, and if we add a tab "toxic servers not related to ddnet, be careful" then idc if we list all toxic servers there.
11:43 < bridge> <avolicious> Wow... so you are telling us that we dont care about our servers? and we are toxic?
11:43 < bridge> <avolicious> ggs
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can only repeat myself. MY point, which might be different to other ddnet maintainer's point, is really about the first experience in the game
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kog is not toxic
11:44 < bridge> <avolicious> But we do care about the experience too
11:44 < bridge> <avolicious> So do block servers
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you try to make me say smth i NEVER said
11:44 < bridge> <avolicious> and other communities
11:44 < bridge> <kaffeine0> @jupeyy_keks I don't care about communities or advertises. I see DDNet as the main client for Teeworlds, and thus I want it to have a reasonable UI, allowing it to be the universal client.
11:44 < bridge> <kaffeine0> You want DDNet servers be separated from the "unofficial" servers, and you want only "nice" servers be visible by default. That's fine, let's add a "18+" checkbox, and make all servers exposing their "be nice" status to the master server.
11:44 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It would be a practical solution for the actual problem of "players randomly joining toxic servers".
11:44 < bridge> <avolicious> >  and if we add a tab "toxic servers not related to ddnet, be careful" then idc if we list all toxic servers there.
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but apparently not about being an OPEN, TRANSPARENT community
11:44 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing "might be toxic" is the issue there
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's so hard to understand about this?
11:44 < bridge> <avolicious> we are open and transparent, even about the funding
11:44 < bridge> <avolicious> lol
11:45 < bridge> <avolicious> we are just not OPEN SOURCE
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good then you agree with my argument
11:45 < bridge> <avolicious> please different between how we handle communities and how we handle source code
11:45 < bridge> <avolicious> this are two different things
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's your opinion
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> It's kinda fact though. What does the visibility of the source code have to do with community management?
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am also part of the community.. the developer part..
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How is your kog community open about that?
11:46 < bridge> <avolicious> Depends on what you wanna do, we are searching for devs 🙂
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think you downplay the word community at this point
11:47 < bridge> <avolicious> We posted some news about that
11:47 < bridge> <learath2> There is no developer community for kog though. They just indirectly leech off of ours 😄
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kog sucks at open communication too btw. Its only discord -.-
11:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, this is your fault xD You wanted us to streamline it for the features 😄
11:48 < bridge> <learath2> I mean it's completely fine under the current license. So I don't really have an issue with it anyway
11:49 < bridge> <learath2> I would like to see everyone open source their mods, but I also know humans are not built like that.
11:49 < bridge> <cyberfighter> f3
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at this point i'm rather for reverting communities than keeping them.
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Apparently that was less of a problem
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> KoG tab can be renamed to Community and all problems solved
11:50 < bridge> <cyberfighter> should servers with toxic shit in them even be in community tab
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we try to make universal rules for community guide lines so mods that weren't in KoG tab have a chance, but instead even those are argumentining against it
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i defenitely don't want new players to not see ddnet servers as official
11:51 < bridge> <cyberfighter> (looking at fokkonaut with all the slurs)
11:52 < bridge> <avolicious> But you see DDNets logo next to the server? Whats the problem about it?
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i gave you the arguments, you don't want to hear them. whats the point?
11:52 < bridge> <avolicious> You want a generic client & support even backwards comp.
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> Doesn't stand out that much anymore now that everyone has a logo
11:52 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I would like to see everyone working on ddnet base game and making their mod as plugins for that.
11:52 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I also 'd love to see the idea of DDoS attacks forgotten, and all servers be nice. But you're absolutely right, "humans are not built like that."
11:53 < bridge> <learath2> Well not everyone but you get the gist of it.
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am 100% for permissive licenses or no licenses
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>  i give a shit about how ppl want to design their community, fundings etc.
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am 100% for more discoverbility, even to a extend where we have KoG tab back
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am 100% against destroying ddnet's values for new players already
11:57 < bridge> <avolicious> The discoverbility could be solved if we group server. DDNet is hosting 664/1044 servers. KoG 91
11:57 < bridge> <avolicious> The discoverbility could be solved if we group servers. DDNet is hosting 664/1044 servers. KoG 91
11:57 < bridge> <avolicious> So if we add proper grouping, you would have more discoverbility, because the server list doesnt gets flooded as of now
11:58 < bridge> <learath2> Grouping is what I wanted from communities, this current UX is far from optimal
11:59 < bridge> <kaffeine0> (kaffeine is hosting 1 server with 8-16 players daily, yet complaining so loudly, like if the infclass community has 816 players instead)
12:00 < bridge> <kaffeine0> (kaffeine is hosting 1 server with 8-16 players daily, yet complaining so loudly, like if the infclass community had 816 players instead)
12:00 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok but when buff medic
12:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Everybody is against you today!!1!1!
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Without teeworlds being open source you couldn't even be against me today
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So maybe value it a bit
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And the work ppl put into the client ppl use to join your server
12:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I do not support slurs and actively ban people for that when it goes too far. I also ban people for doxxing, threatening, and so on. A little bit of toxicity is amongst every teeworlds server, even DDNet.
12:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But when things go too far, I definitely do something about it specifically for younger players.
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> idc about toxic or not here
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> being open source should be a requirement to be listed as a community
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> simply because it should be open source
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is no need for any other reason
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i dislike open source word, i prefer free software
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol, you're so damn weird today xD
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Really, get some rest bro
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't sell ddnet under value just to justify your needs
12:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's funny, you tell @avolicious to not put things in your mouth, yet you do the same
12:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Keep projecting, mr. delusional, wont argue with you anymore
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> a good quote
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Proprietary software development does not contribute to our community, but its developers often want handouts from us. Free software users can offer free software developers strokes for the ego—recognition and gratitude—but it can be very tempting when a business tells you, “Just let us put your package in our proprietary program, and your program will be used by many thousands of people!” The temptation can be powerful, but in the long r
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But in programmatic enough to try to value your work as good as possible without that
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I'm programmatic enough to try to value your work as good as possible without that
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean pragmatic?
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I'm pragmatic enough to try to value your work as good as possible without that
12:19 < bridge> <kaffeine0> My point (besides to my opinion that the UI decision is frustrating) is that there should be a pragmatical, real reason for any requirement.
12:19 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > open source should be a requirement to be listed as a community
12:19 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Do you care about the players or about the devs or about DDNet contribution? What is the goal?
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a ideological requirement
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> free software gives end users the most rights
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should strive for that
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is open source, mods features should be open source
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is open source, mods featured should be open source
12:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Imagine every Minecraft server needs to be open source in order to be allowed to show their icon using the official protocol next to their server in the list
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ideological, i believe all users should fully own the software they use and be able to fullfil their 4 rights
12:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (ik, Minecraft doesnt "advertise" open source)
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions.
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its a weird take since minecraft is closed source itself
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i wouldnt be against that if miencraft was open source and required that
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> in fact i would be extremely happy
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If I am not mistaken, the initial idea was that when the creator of a mod leaves and closes servers, the mod should still remain and can be hosted by others if wanted.
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Where did this approach go? Why can't we allow DDNet to be a contributor in a private repository, or hand the code to the community after we "leave"?
12:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I see, I wanted to assume it. Then I'd repeat my comment:
12:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > In case of teeworlds, permissive license attracts more developers, which is beneficial for the players.
12:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 
12:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> This ideological requirement can hurt mods and thus hurt the game and DDNet. That's how I see it, and as I see, many mod devs agree.
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> that idea is a result of having some of the 4 rights
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> free software gives u
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> > permissive license attracts more developers,
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i dont care about that
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> better idea than forcing people to go open source for a logo which basically only protects a server from being faked and makes it distinguishable
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  The GNU GPL is not Mr. Nice Guy. It says no to some of the things that people sometimes want to do. There are users who say that this is a bad thing—that the GPL “excludes” some proprietary software developers who “need to be brought into the free software community.”
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> > But we are not excluding them from our community; they are choosing not to enter. Their decision to make software proprietary is a decision to stay out of our community. Being in our community means joining in cooperation with us; we cannot “bring them into our community” if they don't want to join.
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> another quote :)
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's kinda far fetched to compare all of that to a game like teeworlds, imo
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But I understand your point
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> forcing ppl to go open source sounds like a epic idea to me
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yeah, ideas and beliefs are different
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?? game is software xD
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> as i said
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is ideological for me
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ok for u to not agree
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its my reason for this
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I know, lol :)
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> (and kaffeine asked my reason)
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No worries!
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ultimately if a dev didnt want to join in cooperation with us by being open source, then its ok, but he wont be featured
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> why give handouts? xD its fine to not be ok with everyone
12:26 < bridge> <kaffeine0> You don't care about mods => you don't care about the players, I see. (sorry for the exaggeration)
12:26 < bridge> <kaffeine0> The number of players who care about the freedom is negligible. @jupeyy_keks had a good point about Steam and players impression. I have to say that the most of the games are not open source and the players do not need it.
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i care the most about players xD which is why i think GPL is the best
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> gpl removes devs some rights and gives them to users
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is why some dislike it
12:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Realistically, most players dont care about open sourceness, that's something from within our nerd/dev bubble right here
12:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Keep that in mind
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think they would care
12:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If they'd investigate, maybe, but as I said... Realistically...
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> We use Discord, lots of people play LoL...
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What does Tencent do with our data? Nobody "cares"
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But permissive license doesn't mean that the developer of that software should advertise closed source software that was built on that
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i talked with my father about this, e.g he sometimes find stuff he cant do in software or things that arebroken, i told him in a world of free software i could fix it for him :)
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> so they dont directly know
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they benefit the most
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> good point
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Dont get me wrong, I'm on your side generally when it comes to Open sourceness
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know its utopical anyway but i like it xd
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> open source is a bad term
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> free software*
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
12:29 < bridge> <diariesvexar> Why players should have source of mods that they want to play !?
12:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> With free software comes great responsibility.
12:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And a lot of people don't care about that.
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In fact no
12:31 < bridge> <kaffeine0> "Free" is often read "free as in beer", so it is not much better 🙂 "Libre" is an unambiguous term here but sometimes it sounds weird.
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They always say. Use on own risk
12:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You misunderstood my point, but thanks for your contribution
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Open source also doesn't mean open contribution
12:32 < bridge> <kaffeine0> You don't care about mods => you don't care about the players, I see. (sorry for the exaggeration)
12:32 < bridge> <kaffeine0> The number of players who care about the freedom is negligible. @jupeyy_keks has a good point about Steam and players impression. I have to say that the most of the games are not open source and the players do not need it.
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but im not refering to that anyway xD
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > A pure open source enthusiast, one that is not at all influenced by the ideals of free software, will say, “I am surprised you were able to make the program work so well without using our development model, but you did. How can I get a copy?” This attitude will reward schemes that take away our freedom, leading to its loss.
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The free software activist will say, “Your program is very attractive, but I value my freedom more. So I reject your program. I will get my work done some other way, and support a project to develop a free replacement.” If we value our freedom, we can act to maintain and defend it.
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl seem to not understand this either
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can give free software and not accept any pr or request or support
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> and go silent
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> they still have their right to redistribute and modify under same terms
12:35 < bridge> <avolicious> but this will add bad reputation to the repository
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xDD
12:35 < bridge> <avolicious> look teeworlds, how many people do blame the devs about not accepting anything
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> no it wont
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u make it clear ur not accepting prs and telling ppl to fork its fine
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> well teeworlds is dead, we have ddnet now
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tw started as very open. I guess that's the main reason
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem is teeworlds they dont mention anywhere they dont accept prs anymore so its a bit meh
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sqlite is also not really open contribution. Still it's considered good software
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> they should archive the repo
12:37 < bridge> <avolicious> Why is it meh? Its open source, fork it and go
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @avolicious yeah i have it forked dont worry, i dont need to go because i dont wanna do anything in teeworlds?
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur point is not there at all xD
12:37 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I gave up on teeworlds when they declined my contribution in 2013. I'd never thought that the game with such devs will last that long 😄
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it lasted and will last a lot, and maybe even resurge, in the repo or in a fork
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> good thing about open source
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> also its what allowed ddnet to exist
12:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://notbyai.fyi/
12:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
12:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> add to ddnet kek
12:45 < bridge> <learath2> Let's be real here. I align with you ideologically but the averafe user of any software couldn't give two shits about open source
12:51 < bridge> <learath2> average*
12:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think it even confuses ppl who don't really use computers.
12:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> "Yeah we're open-source we use ppl (volunteers) to get our products get better without paying them!".
12:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> That's what they see
12:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> And they go like "Open-source doesn't have funding since they don't pay programmers -> it must suck compared to the "company" equivelant"
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tbf that's also not their task, because they don't understand.
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you hire a teacher about nuclear energy and he simply lies to his students you also don't care, but only because you trusted that teacher to do it right, not because u don't want the best teacher
12:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> But more advanced user do know that open-source is better since it provides more transparency.
12:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Also they know that big open-source projects often get funding (eg Ubuntu)
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> I agree with the first sentence, but it seemed to me that Ryozuki did think that it was their task. (Which in an ideal world might be good)
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> 
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> The example you gave I couldn't quite connect back
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you ask most ppl. They probably want privacy even to they don't understand what that would mean
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> They want privacy but it's not a priority for most. They'll gladly give it up to use discord with it's cool features
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> Some will go so far as to give up kernel level access to their computer to play a game cheater free
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But discord also doesn't day. Hello guys, using this you'll loose all ur data
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your personal chat will be stolen
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Say*
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> On that note, let's add a ring0 anticheat to ddnet
12:59 < bridge> <learath2> Sure they don't say it. But have you tried pointing the fact that they do out to any friend of yours that is not a poweruser?
13:00 < bridge> <learath2> 100% of the friends I talked to were completely okay with Xi personally looking at their chatlogs as long as they get to send nice animated gifs and emojis and files
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's probably only as long as we have good laws and xi isn't the president of the world and we normal ppl are insignificant enough
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Too a very very extreme, we already had a Holocaust in this world
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And personal chat would make it easy to identify ppl
13:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Imho I wouldn't mind a random reading my chats either as long as he didn't abuse them aka doxxing and doing that didn't intend stuff without my persmision from the knowledge earned. The problem arises with selling data to componies to track and create profiles for ppl.
13:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Imho I wouldn't mind a random reading my chats either as long as they didn't abuse them aka doxxing and doing that didn't intend stuff without my persmision from the knowledge earned. The problem arises with selling data to componies to track and create profiles for ppl.
13:06 < bridge> <devinci24> That's the same issue. If you have a random reading your chats you can't know what he will do with it.
13:07 < bridge> <devinci24> I agree with what jupstar said, but going back to the client conversation I believe it would be normal for the DDnet client to advertise his servers first, and then other trusted mods. Ofc the mod being open source would greatly help in that "trust" factor.
13:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Oh right that's from where it started.
13:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I would say that the community servers need to be split into 2 categories.
13:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> - `Real` servers and
13:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> - `Trusted` servers
13:11 < bridge> <devinci24> That would be fair. But then again, what is a trusted server? How would you define them? open source code? Known community members?
13:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 lets add a EULA too
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> 😂
13:12 < bridge> <matodor> imagine ddnet evolves into twnet and all these disputes will stop
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> https://tenor.com/view/eula-genshin-eula-genshin-eula-beloved-beloved-gif-20770239
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> ?
13:12 < bridge> <devinci24> Eula Lawrence is a playable Cryo character in Genshin Impact who severed her ties with the Lawrence Clan and became the captain of the Reconnaissance Company with the Knights of Favonius.
13:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I would say the mod itself should be trustworthy (aka open-source or atleast checked by the admins or a some kind of team) and the server should be trustworhy (aka chat shouldn't be toxic and stuff and the ppl moderating wouldn't abuse their power)
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn weebs
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Do we have to have rigid rules for this? Can't we just take a vibes based approach?
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u ask me, only free software, but i doubt u want to ask me kek
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Avo gives off good vibes so kog can be a community
13:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think a guideline would provide the most flexibility. I would be personally against a hard/rigid rule
13:15 < bridge> <devinci24> that would disqualify any ddnet server with multyez map on it 😄
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> Multeasy is a toxic cesspool indeed
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 ok time to social engineer ddnet
13:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ryozuki has 1337 Unique friends. He lives on the top of A-GPL with MIT and other such licenses targets for his arrows
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> here are the social engineer ticks for ddnet:
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - code
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - mention how rust is good
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - some pr in ddnet
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - be somewhat regular
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont use mit for any new software i write
13:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nvm I miss-remembered what social engineering ment
13:17 < bridge> <learath2> If you praise C99 you can have a community
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 at the office someone mentioned "C23 adds the things C has missing" xd
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a meme
13:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ik that's why you've sticked such Licences to this

13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> mainly because c23 adds
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> Keywords
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> Add true and false keywords.

13:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :(
13:59 < bridge> <murpi> Ah yes, the success story of Valorant and its root-level anti-cheat. *cough* DMA cheats *cough*
14:02 < bridge> <murpi> Sweet! thanks alot :)
14:03 < bridge> <lixinveritas> bind
14:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> you need to boot windows with secure boot to play valorant - a friend told me, i couldnt stop laughing
14:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nah that's not true
14:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> something similar ig
14:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> TPM setting on bios is neccessary though
14:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> their anti cheat requires secure boot
14:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199701271163195432/Bildschirmfoto_vom_2024-01-24_14-04-15.png?ex=65c37fe0&is=65b10ae0&hm=0ad9f9efbc4560f9403e6968b0aaaae3915e78b13edf4fb0134eac014bd3a1bb&
14:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I've been playing without secure boot. Maybe that's an old message idk
14:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> hmm idk, i dont like to oversalt my daily life so i dont play these games
14:05 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw I don't have tpm 2.0 nor do I have secure boot enabled
14:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I didn't need to enabled it (TPM 2.0) either but then I changed something and it was required
14:06 < bridge> <learath2> Ah apparently it's for the windows 11 version of vanguard
14:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I didn't need to enabled it (TPM 2.0) either but then I changed something and it was required
14:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> edit: I enabled virtualization and maybe TPM 2.0 was required after that
14:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O good thing I don't have win11
14:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> ~~i use arch btw~~
14:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> ok i stop, dont wanna loose more people like Voxel °_°
14:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ~~I use antiX btw~~
14:07 < bridge> <learath2> Antix?
14:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> just googled it "proudly anti-fascist antiX magic in a distribution"
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> I highly doubt we'll see another voxel incident in our lifetime
14:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> debian without systemD
14:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> didntk now this exist
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> Bro left because Ryozuki likes Rust too mucg
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> Much*
14:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> he quit after me and ryo went on a "we use arch and rust" spree :D
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> What happened to devuan? No longer a thing?
14:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> was funny
14:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> Proudly anti-fascist "antiX Magic" in an environment suitable for old and new computers.
14:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Devuan are still a thing I don't remember why I picked antiX at the end though. But I like them so far (compared to artix (arch without systemd))
14:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Because arch was constanlty having new updates about everything
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> My goto is gentoo on machines strong enough to compile stuff and artix on machines that are too weak
14:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> and I remembered Jupstar saying smt about debian so I figured I'd try something like that
14:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> the most fun with any distribution i ever had was NixOS
14:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I remember having 20-30 total package updates per day
14:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> thanks to @scrumplex for the recommendation on that
14:11 < bridge> <learath2> I was away for a month and had to update 220 packages on my gentoo box yesterday 😄
14:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Sounds like not a lot compared to artix xD (maybe I just had too many packages)
14:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> NixOS or Gentoo it is. Source based distros are just too OP
14:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> NixOS or Gentoo it is. Source-based distros are just too OP
14:37 < bridge> <murpi> @blaiszephyr `cl_replays`?
14:37 < bridge> <murpi> `cl_replay_length` to set the length
14:37 < bridge> <murpi> `save_replay` to save the replay

15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @louis.place just a reminder to reduce the view distance. forgot what commands exactly, but just to make sure the on screen tees are under 64
15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> less of a problem during the event but would be nice to not lose anyone in server. have to be really small to not miss anyone in the final screenshot too
15:58 < bridge> <louis> ill check to make sure
15:58 < bridge> <louis> i used the original autoexev with some modifications
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, iirc the original autoexec was not ideal
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> aka last year wasn't ideal
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw I remember the server actually support 512 players
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> might be useful...
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually let me double check the code
16:00 < bridge> <louis> ah
16:00 < bridge> <louis> i cloned teeworldscn momentcap from github
16:00 < bridge> <louis> not sure if thats outdated or not haha
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not
16:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm pretty sure momentcap was developed like twice and that's it
16:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yep

16:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not field tested but i remember it working to a degree
16:04 < bridge> <murpi> @louis.place Do you use a dns blacklist btw? Else you'll have people spamming tees everywhere
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @murpi help him please
16:05 < bridge> <murpi> 😬 IDK how
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
16:05 < bridge> <murpi> It might have been more preferable to host the photoshoot on a ddnet server
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> did louis not giving you guys a heads up
16:06 < bridge> <murpi> since we have the dnsbl already set up on all servers
16:06 < bridge> <murpi> He did 😄
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
16:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just that i didn't upload the 2022 autoexec, since it was tuned in server on the fly

16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice closer to faith
16:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> something about options and result
16:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it autoplayed while i was sleeping

17:00 < bridge> <louis> i can probably set it up
17:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> try sv_max_clients 512 next time you set it up as well
17:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it crashes randomly at sometime then revert back to 64. if it doesn't, then great

18:06 < bridge> <teero777> return nullptr;

18:07 < bridge> <teero777> if someone wants to include that into their next pr pls
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> How does one even get their first job when almost every position seems to ask for "3+ years of professional software engineering experience"?
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how does one even get a job if i don't even pass they stupid filters
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear 90% u just ignored xd
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> I'd have to do 10 unpaid internships to get the 3+ years needed of professional experience 😄
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> do 1 and they see u pro with C and hire u
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> or pro in programming
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what happened to me
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> they saw i was rly good
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> hired me
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> made an entire app
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> then went to another
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> they see I'm pro with C and tell me 1999 called they want their language back
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah ur valuable
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> just say u know c and c++ and python
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 in 20 years you are very valuable
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur c++ knowledge is higher than most too
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then most boomers are gone, but c code will still exist
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet you get an overpaid job easily then
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> True, I wonder if in 20 years I'll be one of the people that use COBOL now
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually u just need to know programming and u can learn the tools easily if u know how to be self thaught
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> find a job in embedde
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> embedded
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> embedded c is legit
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> it's legit underpaid from what I've heard, but yeah that's like my only option with C anyway
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://traxys.me/riscv_os_setup.html
18:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> just get into IoT.. where i live more and more people want home automation and stuff. most of it is C/C++ afair
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> im saddened most ppl dont wanna enforce a free software community in ddnet
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its probs mostly ignorance and wishful dreams of having something they will unlikely have, its like the american "not yet millionare" thing

18:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> seems like most people are just scared they'll loose their """"uniqueness"""", and i've heard about safety concerns considering blockworlds anticheat etc
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> the truth is if ur mod being open source makes u lose ur "unique" or "creator flair" it wasnt that good to begin with and free software made it better
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is why gpl is a real win here
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> because the competition would have to use gpl
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u can get back the pros
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> It's a people scared of losing their communities. Which is fair, humans love power
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> another truth is that a dev who made a mod will often have advantage over forks if they know what they doing
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> It's people scared of losing their communities. Which is fair, humans love power
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> knowing a codebase takes time and effort
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah power they never had
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> the truth is i can come and make a shitty block server
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> they never had the power
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> they would ddos me tho :)
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz thats the only thing they have
18:58 < bridge> <learath2> You need all the cool features they have if you want to take their community
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah not hard probs
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> just takes time
18:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> scared of losing their communities... just give every creator its own community tag, whoever leaves to go onto another server, just sounds like a skill issue to keep a community. this is just how it is :D
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the truth is
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> Definitely not hard. Just 2 developers can probably dish out any tw mod in a week at most
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> we shouldnt care of ppl who think like that
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> we simply should enforce free software
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> because it is how it should be
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> if they dont wanna join us they are deciding to be out

19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the only problem is that nobody here argues with counter arguments. they just mad and insult
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and its simply isnt bad to think about a ideology u have and enforce it
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> like free software
19:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> i find this topic weird anyway, they take a fully open source game, modify it, make it private, and they seem almost threatened when the biggest teeworlds modification that has its own client and a huge playerbase denies them increased visiblity support when they wont continue the open source philosophy
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> they selfish but its ok
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl are selfish
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is why pragmtism is key
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> GPL works nicely against that
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also want vanilla teeworlds repo, and then strike back

19:03 < bridge> <learath2> Ur like a preacher 😄
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Proprietary software development does not contribute to our community, but its developers often want handouts from us. Free software users can offer free software developers strokes for the ego—recognition and gratitude—but it can be very tempting when a business tells you, “Just let us put your package in our proprietary program, and your program will be used by many thousands of people!” The temptation can be powerful, but in the long r
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i am
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> im gpl and rust preacher
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 btw ur friend from irc called me crazy when i mentioned i use gpl
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> and that i was a retard
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> how was he called
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was the game dev one
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> HAHAHA siO?
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but this quote is nice
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  And if cynics ridicule freedom, ridicule community…if “hard-nosed realists” say that profit is the only ideal…just ignore them, and use copyleft all the same.
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> He is a BSD enjoyer
19:04 < bridge> <reitw> damn why ddnet was late with photoshoot
19:04 < bridge> <reitw> we thought we'd never see it
19:04 < bridge> <cyberfighter> it got delayed by accounts
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> I thought we weren't even going to do one this year
19:04 < bridge> <reitw> same lmao
19:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> when ddnet riscv
19:05 < bridge> <reitw> btw bsd is damn amzing, I love ports
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> I meant as in the BSD license, but yeah BSDs are also enjoyable
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> ports are what inspired gentoos portage
19:05 < bridge> <reitw> go in the app u want to install, u do make & make install, as easy
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 he probs thinks someday a company wilñ use his software and become famous
19:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> unlikely, he suffers from the same condition as you, idealism
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> just different ideals
19:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> my python script from 2014 is just WAITING for a big company!
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> what ideals??? xd
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> MIT enforces nothing
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> u give handouts to companies, which will restrict user rights on the software
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw did u know X11 at some point nearly became nonfree?
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> MIT/BSD/CC0/Unlicense creates code that is free in another sense
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  The temptation and pressure are harder to recognize when they come indirectly, through free software organizations that have adopted a policy of catering to proprietary software. The X Consortium (and its successor, the Open Group) offers an example: funded by companies that made proprietary software, they strived for a decade to persuade programmers not to use copyleft. When the Open Group tried to make X11R6.4 nonfree software, those of us who
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In September 1998, several months after X11R6.4 was released with nonfree distribution terms, the Open Group reversed its decision and rereleased it under the same noncopyleft free software license that was used for X11R6.3. Thank you, Open Group—but this subsequent reversal does not invalidate the conclusions we draw from the fact that adding the restrictions was possible.
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Pragmatically speaking, thinking about greater long-term goals will strengthen your will to resist this pressure. If you focus your mind on the freedom and community that you can build by staying firm, you will find the strength to do it. “Stand for something, or you will fall for anything.”
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> Code that truly does not care about it's use
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah its not code that cares about user freedom
19:09 < bridge> <learath2> Well I'm not going to debate that with you right now
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean its indiferent to that
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> since if u dont protect against smth, it will eventually happen
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it did
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example llvm is mit
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvvm was made out of it
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> aand its private
19:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a reason companies love open source but not free software
19:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill dominate the world with edlang
19:21 < bridge> <reitw> ah so another example of that is BSD
19:21 < bridge> <reitw> like, BSD allows u to sell it, like any products based on it
19:22 < bridge> <learath2> Make the stdlib GPL so it can't be used for closed source code at all :BigBrain:
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats a nice idea
19:27 < bridge> <scrumplex> based GPL user 🤝
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> hey everybody
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> @ryozuki how's it going down there
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> good
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> cheap food
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i have never been to argentina
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> is it awesome
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> the food is awesome
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> the city looks like 3rd world
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe im too used to barcelona
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> barcelona is epic
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
19:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> glad you're enjoying your stay Ryo
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> most of south america is like that afaik
19:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> dont drink to much coffee tho
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> like in barcelona streets are nicely paved u know
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> here its irregular
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> low buildings everywhere
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm idk its a vibe
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> south america is probably one of the least developed continents
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure its more developed than africa
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur prejudiced a bit too maybe xD
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example idk if its common in barcelona but my airbnb has a touchpad code to enter
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> never seen that xd
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> did u usually just walk in or what
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> what else
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> a physical key?
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> u use a key
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> cavemen
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just not common in barcelona i guess
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i assure u barcelona looks way way way more modern
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> than buenos aires
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> also idk why they dont have automatic sliding doors
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have to open and close it
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but good food
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and wine
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and like weather
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl seem rly nice too
19:48 < bridge> <kaffeine0> You're familiar with infclass, right? I bet two devs won't repeat it in a month, because the *gameplay* codebase is huge. I didn't invent the mod but I made 2000 commits ontop of already implemented stuff.
19:48 < bridge> <kaffeine0> // Note: Infclass is open source but I keep a few small features (PvE rounds and winter animation) closed.
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and talky
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and not fat
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its only a na problem
19:49 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i am familiar with infclass
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you want to say antarctica looks more beautiful? 😬
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> well yea
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> do u know what one of means
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> my internet
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to make a bad joke but hein would ban me maybe
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> the joke: || im familiar with ur mom || haha funny
19:51 < bridge> <Ewan> he would nver
19:51 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as u don't talk about fussel's mom
19:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:

19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft leak top 7
19:53 < bridge> <Ewan> can't

19:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> how did upload just increase by 20 mbits :D
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> bad infrastructure
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's still almost as high as my download
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i heard that in june i can ask to get fiber to the home
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic germany moment
19:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> :o
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> when ISPs had to increase their capability during covid they only focused on download bcs for zoom calls you only upload 1 video stream but download as many streams as there are ppl in the call
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> do u just ask them nicely and they  come install a thing in ur backyard lol
20:00 < bridge> <louis> free software fans declining a 5* restaurant date (the entree recipes are  closed source)
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> context tho
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's like a registration list to see where the interest is highest
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as far as i know
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i already have fiber to cluster, so they just open the streets yet again
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> german logic
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> open the streets 200 times
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 10 years everyone wants 10 GBit/s and we open them again
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> should just route internet thru sewers tbh
20:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> my mayor was like "fuck you guys everyone gets it"
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes that's what many clever countries do
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not germany
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> TIL
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also every compition has to open the street again
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> compition ?
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> competitors
20:04 < bridge> <rafael8192> how can i get a duration of hook from server side?
20:04 < bridge> <rafael8192> like
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> @rafael8192 get back to work
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> my client is not gonna compile itself

20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> he is my 7900X
20:05 < bridge> <rafael8192> iam mine 💀
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the max hook duration?
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or the current?
20:05 < bridge> <rafael8192> no
20:05 < bridge> <rafael8192> like
20:06 < bridge> <rafael8192> not a duration
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> wat u want then
20:06 < bridge> <rafael8192> the distance the hook extended
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> length?
20:06 < bridge> <rafael8192> is it possible?
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> prob ez
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is m_HookPos
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can compare it against the players m_Pos
20:06 < bridge> <rafael8192> where i can find its
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u have the length
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
20:07 < bridge> <rafael8192> compare?
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> look in gamecore.cpp
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> pythagorean theorem 🙏
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's probably done there a few times
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i mean take the distance
20:07 < bridge> <rafael8192> m_Pos / 32 - m_HookPos / 32 ?
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
20:08 < bridge> <rafael8192> bruh
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> do u not know how
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> distance(m_Pos, m_HookPos)
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> where u get distance fn
20:08 < bridge> <rafael8192> sry
20:08 < bridge> <rafael8192> iam sent really stupid code
20:08 < bridge> <rafael8192> i sent really stupid code
20:09 < bridge> <rafael8192> i will try
20:09 < bridge> <rafael8192> thx
20:10 < bridge> <rafael8192> the max disctance of hook is 1.5 yes?
20:10 < bridge> <rafael8192> in code
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that sounds more like the duration
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> of a hooked player
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> m_Tuning.m_HookLength is max distance
20:11 < bridge> <rafael8192> thx again
20:25 < bridge> <rafael8192> why its call every time when player hook?
