00:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ryu limine can't find the config file, it's hella annoying having to get back into livecd to mount and try fixing it again constantly, I go sleep - ping me anytime if you're available please. Rest is done :justatest:
00:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ok @teero777, for that reaction I'm making myself a coffee, I'll fix this rn
00:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Okay nevermind. It now finds the config but tells me I made an oopsie in it, cba rn xd
00:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Good night
00:52 < bridge> <learath2> Should have used refind, no config needed gang
01:59 < bridge> <Ewan> should i try gentoo again now that they have that package cache? the idea it would save me a lot of compiling while still tuning for zen 4 and everything
01:59 < bridge> <Ewan> should i try gentoo again now that they have that package cache? the idea is it would save me a lot of compiling while still tuning for zen 4 and everything
02:00 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how to use it. most of the gentoo knowledge fell out of my head after that few months i used it
02:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I feel like the only way we could get bad apple in Teeworlds on 60 FPS, if we convert the video into optimized meshes, which will be animated.
02:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Now this could be done with programming.... or you could just suffer for months animating. xd
02:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Is this enough swap memory to run UE5 games? :troll:

08:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> could I talk with that person? I assume it's either Heinrich, Deen or Learath
08:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @remakepower yup
08:39 < bridge> <remakepower> Wow
08:39 < bridge> <remakepower> Quite amazing

08:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was thinking of doing the same but i probably wont have time for it in the near future
08:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Xd
08:52 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> it's just the wiki's example with the path changed
08:52 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Yea I installedy kernel using installkermel
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u use initramfs
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i found it makes live easier
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use dracut
08:57 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ye,
08:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I'll see my setup now, It should be tbe same as this tbh
08:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Coffee first
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr did u run
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```

09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> where --disk is the entire disk
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> and --part is the partition number, starting from 1 (see fdisk -l)

09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :justatest:  I don't think I did
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Coffee done soon
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i passed 1 for p1 efi system
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405811540678017156/image.png?ex=68a02f86&is=689ede06&hm=d6bbb1ae806819d742a01815fa05d02770ebef2c9a1a6a94bfb0403429b98f43&
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> But limine boots up
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> emerge --ask --verbose sys-boot/efibootmgr
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> It just tells me the config is invalid
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah then maybe u dont need it
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i would do it cuz its more specific
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> show ur config
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> soon
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u cp -v /usr/share/limine/BOOTX64.EFI /boot/EFI/BOOT/
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i go to the gym
09:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ok thanks I'll check everything again xd
09:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 we need someone to decide on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9028 yay or nay. How do we do that?
09:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 1. lerato decides 2. deen decides 3. rossbit decides 4. heino decides
09:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !roll 1 4
09:31 < chillerbot12> 1
09:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its you call @learath2 you have 24h to make a decision
09:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 1. yay
09:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 2. nay
09:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> !roll 1 2
09:32 < chillerbot12> 2
09:32 < bridge> <learath2> I like R/T more, but wtf do I know, we should ask people in #mapping
09:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok go ask in #mapping irc is not bridged there
09:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also arent ppl on discord always afk? it will be seen by 1 random gooflord
09:36 < bridge> <learath2> Is shift + r a common bind in other tools?
09:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** shift+ anything is common in entire computing to revert
09:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or you mean the +r specifically cuz reload and shit?
09:40 < bridge> <learath2> I meant the entire r, shift+r combo for rotations. Is that a common thing?
09:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i mean there is also the r rotation mode and then spin with mouse thingy
09:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not sure how common it is to rotate in some degree step on keybind
09:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** inkscape be like
09:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.21093d00-4882-45d6-b6a4-f97e3ae86816.png
09:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but they already have "r" for rectangle mode
09:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I'm used to shift+t r for transform rotation
09:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Or shift+t s for scaling, etc
09:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Idk from which software initially xd
09:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Aoe 
09:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did the ping work?
09:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would look at blender
09:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** blender is nice ye but its a bit different
09:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i assume its like r to enter rotate mode and then x/y/z to lock the axis
09:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** probably also just typing numbers to set a degree and so on
09:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** entirely different flow
09:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Aoe nice i see you store your demos on github :D 
09:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** btw lemme give you epic tutorial
09:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** see this pr you can test and like share subscribe on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10128
09:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then you can scroll to find the latest commit and on the right side there is a green tiny checkmark

09:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then on details
09:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** top left on summary

09:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then scroll down and download windows
09:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then you can run the client and test if the live demo feature causes your pc to explode
09:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then report back your expirience in a comment :)

10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> or whatever anime girl is currently trending
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> realistically by the same logic you should call it BocchiOs, since you're working alone on it :owo:

10:45 < bridge> <Assa> 19.4 will be a banger client
10:51 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon the community vote also prefers resetting animations instead of stopping them
10:52 < bridge> <Assa> that would "fix" look at me, but break maps like the pitch black one (which was fixed by fixing the map)

11:06 < bridge> <Assa> which server is that? Its not a ddnet map
11:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa ye ik the check is too strong and encourages and thus normalizes bypassing it. 
11:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Lmao ryo, Im now a Gentoo user
11:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
11:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> (Even tho I god knows why disabled root without adding my user to wheel)
11:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa KoG
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hard server
11:08 < bridge> <Assa> ye now not gonna login xD
11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa I mean when I merge there is no need to approve. But when I am too scared to merge i might approve already. Could also come back with more confidence and merge xd
11:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa good that i sent the map file
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice, now install maim to take proper pics
11:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ye let me quickly setup i3 and Services and whatnot
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use i3blocks-rs
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth like that
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> its dope
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/i3status-rs/latest/i3status_rs/blocks/index.html

11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr btw i unmask kernel ~amd64
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> to get latest kernel
11:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Sounds scary
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> Linux gentoo 6.16.0-gentoo #5 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Aug 14 09:57:17 CEST 2025 x86_64 AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D 12-Core Processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> its pog
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> latest kernel has new stuff
11:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> we can use quads and envelopes to painfully animate and re-use quads, since it's only black and white
11:13 < bridge> <Assa> well yes but then fps is in the mud
11:13 < bridge> <Assa> you can benefit from `grouped` quads and the gpu goes brr
11:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> FPS dimmers on textureless quads when it reaches above 500 or so, animation don't impact performance if it's constantly updating
11:14 < bridge> <Assa> but for grouped quads all the quads need to have the same env and same offsets
11:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> idk
11:14 < bridge> <Assa> but I do, I implemented it xD
11:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> What I experienced with quads is, the only reason one specific dummy map lags, is because of the texture applied to it
11:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> without the texture, it runs perfect since you don't just abuse the GPU, while the GPU can concentrate on other things
11:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And since you can just color the quads which is all CPU, it's a lot easier to animate them this way
11:16 < bridge> <Assa> 19.4 might improve maps like this tremendously, it also added automatic quad clip regions
11:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> idk how grouping (I assume multi meshing) would benefit from it, but if it limits the use of envelopes, then it kinda sucks xd
11:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ooh, actually based
11:17 < bridge> <Assa> it _might_, disclaimer it doesn't split up a quad group, but optimizes localized groups out
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> it _might_, disclaimer it doesn't split up a quad layer, but optimizes localized layer out
11:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> at the expense of separate properties, since all of them use one?
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> like if you have a huge animation at the end of the map, it doesn't render if you're at the start
11:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I sure fucking hope so xd
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki i promised to maintain the 0.7 stuff which is a good thing -.- Now I just also have the power to merge a 0.7 polish after testing and reviewing it. Rude comment!
11:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the biggest abuse i did was my first merged pr was instantly a #7777 violation xd
11:19 < chillerbot12> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> it's part of the grouped quads, there is an issue about it if you want to improve this. It's an expert issue and requires a skilled person to do it 😄
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> One day I'll implement the greedy approach myself for this
11:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, getting the hierarchy organized with each property change.... no thx
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> hierachy? It's not a quad tree or anything
11:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> is it not?
11:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> hmmm
11:21 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Eh, brain hurty now
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> here read into it: #10580
11:21 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10580
11:22 < bridge> <Assa> i am pretty sure this is an NP problem, just ignore quad sorting, that's yet another level
11:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I love emerge already
11:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
11:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> It's so fast :coupysparkle:
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> rly
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> feels slow to me
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> always wanted to rewrite it in rust
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :justatest: :kek:
11:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> that emoji is why there is potato in my username
12:08 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean the original only has 30 FPS? AFAICT the original animation has 6563 frames whereas the extended version is lost media
12:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Doesn’t emerge build everything from source? How can it be fast?
12:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller can u pls send a file with all the default ddnet binds
12:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> i accidentally deleted all of them
12:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> or is there a way to get them all back within the client
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> the version I used is from the internet archive, it has 30 fps. Can't tell about anything else
12:33 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> not just emerge, the entire ecosystem, use flags are op
12:33 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> only thing that seems annoying is llvm, but thats just llvm
12:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> you were trolled weren't you
12:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> no it was c++ fault
12:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> you could rename your folder under %appdata% from ddnet to ddnet.bak
12:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ddnet then generates a new one, grab the binds from settings_ddnet.cfg
12:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> i was trying to fix an issue that was on github
12:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> there are much easier ways for sure but i cant check
12:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok gonna try but im on linux (btw)
12:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> mv .local/share/ddnet .local/share/ddnet.bak
12:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> how are u so fast xd
12:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i had to type out 9 partuuid's without copying them multiple times
12:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> at some point your fingers rest on /  | " ' : _ - by default ...
12:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet decided to create a new config in ~/.teeworlds directory
12:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> i thought it was deprecated
12:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> $configdir
12:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> weird
12:42 < bridge> <remakepower> That's because
12:44 < bridge> <remakepower> DDNet will create config in the ~/.teeworlds when the ~/.local/share/ddnet doesn't exist but ~/.teeworlds exists.
12:45 < bridge> <remakepower> But it's still annoying
12:45 < bridge> <remakepower> DDNet wouldn't create config in ~/.local/share/teeworlds
12:45 < bridge> <remakepower> (which is used by 0.7 teeworlds)
12:46 < bridge> <remakepower> I have to create a symbolic link for it.
13:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato delete your settings and you get defaults xd
13:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** *insert unbind all meme*
13:33 < bridge> <Assa> currently fixing envelope animations and I believe I solved time itself now
13:33 < bridge> <Assa> like to fully stop animations from moving, you also need to remove their quantum effects (sub tick)

15:12 < bridge> <teero777> who is raphael????
15:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Fren
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> and you integrated him???? how unethical
15:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Fren no leave
15:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Fren stay
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> okay
15:14 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Are you fren
15:14 < bridge> <teero777> it really does sound like the people from amd just took a coworkers brain, uploaded him on their cpu, let him do the graphics stuff and ship him out
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will be complete when u compile ur kernel, ur close
15:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> what's the benefit tho
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> enable only what u want, configure the scheduler u want, optimize for ur cpu
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a zen4 option
15:39 < bridge> <manikoo> how do you still use 60hz:poggers2:
15:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Simple, didn't setup xrandr yet xd
15:40 < bridge> <manikoo> :kek:
16:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> how can i tell gentoo to stop bullying me with masked packages and use flags constantly
16:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> or is that the fun of gentoo
16:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> struggling to compile the simplest packages
16:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> even when fully following the wiki
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> autounmask
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> search ir
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> it
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> dispartch conf
16:57 < bridge> <Aoe> Does every server in TW / DDnet run on 50 tick rate, or would everything break if we had 128 hz like in CS?
16:59 < bridge> <Aoe> If it even is possible, I assume that we would be able to do even better movement, but the servers will most likely be more expensive
17:00 < bridge> <louis> some of the physics breaks
17:01 < bridge> <louis> i think jupstar knows more but id imagine bumping and such gets messed up
17:01 < bridge> <Aoe> Yeah, I figured…
17:31 < bridge> <Assa> short answer yes. long answer, client and servers wouldn't be able to community properly, physics breaks, other stuff breaks, somewhere a 50 is hardcoded, it breaks left right center and middle, but not bottom
17:31 < bridge> <Assa> short answer yes. long answer, client and servers wouldn't be able to communicate properly, physics breaks, other stuff breaks, somewhere a 50 is hardcoded, it breaks left right center and middle, but not bottom
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> about physics: the server interpolates movement in a straight line between ticks and then applies gravity in a tick, so imagine doubeling this ...
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> about physics: the server interpolates movement in a straight line between ticks [1] and then applies gravity in a tick, so imagine doubeling this ...
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> 
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> [1] except when it doesn't except when it should
17:34 < bridge> <Aoe> I see… The least amount of possible movement you can do will last for a full tick? Like, if I press D and immediately release it, will the server recognize it as me holding down D for 2 ms?
17:35 < bridge> <Assa> maybe, if you ignore something like ping in netmessages and client prediction ...
17:35 < bridge> <Assa> like imagine you press d , then you have a lag, even if you release after 2 ms you may get offset
17:36 < bridge> <Aoe> Yeah… I’ve been trying a bunch of different switches to find one that works really well for TW, but after learning how ticks work, it seems like it won’t really impact it too much anyway?
17:37 < bridge> <Assa> yes
17:37 < bridge> <Assa> it might help tbh
17:39 < bridge> <Aoe> Ye, I think it helps a little bit. Some keyboards might not be able to have the key activated for less than 2 ms at a time.
17:41 < bridge> <Assa> teeworlds/ddnet feels the smoothest with low network latency, no matter how good the antiping is. So a good internet will help you way more
17:41 < bridge> <Assa> unfortunately I live in germany, and here the Internet is Neuland
17:43 < bridge> <Aoe> Interesting. Does having a high ping matter, or is it all about having stable internet?
17:44 < bridge> <Aoe> Like, let’s say I join a CHN server and my ping is 240. Will I be able to play solo maps just as if it were a 5 ms ping?
17:45 < bridge> <Aoe> Or does it take more than 1 tick for the server to process my inputs and such?
17:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 125Hz is a super common keyboard polling rate, so that would limit you to 8ms keypresses
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say its not that it takes more than 1 tick, its that the time ur input takes to reach server is over 200ms
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> and prediction can only do so much, predicitng other players is not possible cuz they move randomly
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats why prediction works so well when the other tee is frozen
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> easy to predict
17:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Certain things might still lack prediction but generally when playing solo ping doesn't matter
17:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> important is just that your ping stays consistent and there's zero packet loss
17:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> sadly zero packet loss is basically impossible in some parts of the world
17:48 < bridge> <Aoe> I see, thanks for explaining!
17:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> minor nitpick: ping is the round-trip time, so both directions are added up, and it's not necessarily symmetric either
17:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if your ping is on the order of 400ms you're probably in trouble...
18:13 < bridge> <liber_0> maybe someone can help me find this json with all maps?

18:16 < bridge> <liber_0> thx
18:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: seen you nitpick commit messages quite often. Do you think your current opinion is reflected well enough in contributing.md? Or does it need more emphasis?
18:19 < bridge> <liber_0> i try link "ddnet.org/releases/releases.json"
18:19 < bridge> <liber_0> But i miss
18:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: one day we feed contributing.md into a llm so we can all retire
18:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or at least speed up pr reviews 10x with nitpick bot
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Could maybe be a bit more detailed. Wasn't really clear in that PR what bug it fixes to me.
18:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think the Tee's movement is based on tick speed, this is why that movement is not predicable.
18:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In a way, the physics ARE deterministic, but the movement based on your input will not be. Since servers control how much you move, the servers also control how many ticks has been passed for that movement input...
18:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And considering sometimes the servers use more inputs than necessary, aka when you (the client) didn't send the info to the server that you released the key, then it takes more time for your Tee physically to stop.
18:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 
18:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> A whole lot of yapping by me and the conclusion is, that it's server dependant sadly.

20:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> hm ye the PR is 11 months old
20:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> maybe ask dobry to forcepush for CI to rerun xd
20:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if you want to dig deeper into testing these features you could follow the readme on github on how to compile using msvc if artifcats arent availble xd
20:07 < bridge> <Aoe> It never popped up for me, maybe because I pressed the link in the email?
20:08 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> could be, i get my notifications through that
20:08 < bridge> <Aoe> I also don't see it here
20:08 < bridge> <Aoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405976430516633742/image.png?ex=68a0c916&is=689f7796&hm=650c6d930d7e4b0a66f94fa6b2829c3a6aa81d40599d903522544d69119bb7f4&
20:08 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oh?
20:08 < bridge> <Aoe> Maybe it would have worked, if I just went on Github normally
20:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> weird
20:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405976605121056932/image.png?ex=68a0c940&is=689f77c0&hm=0e52314d329948e55a064437ad68096eadd9942c4f95d4cbf30fcfd79b74ff19&
20:09 < bridge> <Aoe> Can you mention me somewhere to test it?
20:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> xd sure
20:09 < bridge> <Aoe> xD Ty
20:11 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> did, refresh the page
20:12 < bridge> <Aoe> Nope, didn't work
20:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: you can also turn on email notifications
20:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah you have it already
20:12 < bridge> <Aoe> I did receive an email though
20:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://github.com/settings/notifications
20:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> maybe check your notification settings? idk
20:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bru just check your mails eventually. Nobody expects you to react within minutes
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It worries me a bit that chillerbot number grew so high. I wonder if my poor raspi runs 100+ instances because of some js bug
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> !ping
20:15 < chillerbot123> pong
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 123????
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> !remindme 16h fix gentoo use flags for steam
20:17 < chillerbot123> Helo blaiszephyr I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.
20:18 < bridge> <bomab> gambling time ☝️
20:18 < bridge> <bomab> !roll 111 999
20:18 < chillerbot123> 272
20:18 < bridge> <bomab> aww man
20:18 < bridge> <bomab> i lost all my savings
20:21 < bridge> <Aoe> Ye ty!
20:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: oh yes you did it correctly! But yes as melon said GitHub sadly does not keep it for ever for free. Usually devs build it locally but that is drastically more effort. I think for now just stick to prs that are new or have been touched recently so this flow works. You can also poke me to send you a binary.
20:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> chiller cross-compiling to windows for free
20:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Eventually you can try building it your self but I would not start with that because it is so much work. If you manage to do that you can basically call your self a developer already
20:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mean poking gh in a fork and burning Amazonas with CI
20:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I suppose aoe could do a similar stunt fully in the GitHub UI xd
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i could setup a powershell script that:
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> sets up msys2 with mingw
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> installs rust, python and git and adds it to path
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> clone ddnet's repo
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> compile
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> and play a cute soundtrack while it does all that
20:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :Pepega:
20:24 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> just gimme 15€ (for GPTee 5)
20:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> yes would be cool. @blaiszephyr
20:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I once spent an entire day booting into windows to do the ultimate DDNet compile setup speedrun tutorial. Documented the entire process in this channel and rage quitted eventually. I will probably not give this a go any time soon. Windows is such a broken environment
20:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> All these half ass package managers like chocolatey, scoop and so on. The amount of C++ compilers that all bring their own unique compilation errors. Horrible.
20:29 < bridge> <kebscs> Msvc+vcpkg 0 problems most of the time
20:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Send tutorial then
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> for linux people its always recommended to use msys2
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> in fact, i'd recommend msys2 over msvc anytime
20:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> for linux people its pretty much always recommended to use msys2
20:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> the only advantage of msvc is visual studio with its amazing debugging capability
20:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> in fact, i'd recommend msys2 over msvc anytime
21:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am not interested for a setup for Linux users. But one for windows users that do not know how to do anything programming related and just want to start cracking on ddnet with TikTok attention span
21:15 < bridge> <zaer1n> pls `nix develop` in ddnet
21:17 < bridge> <zaer1n> why not
21:17 < bridge> <zaer1n> 🙏
21:28 < bridge> <kebscs> so just setup from ddnet readme
21:28 < bridge> <kebscs> 1 command to clone with libs and open in vs 2022
21:36 < bridge> <Obliterator²> i take that as a compliment since i refreshed that readme
21:37 < bridge> <Obliterator²> i take that as a compliment since i refreshed that part of the readme
21:49 < bridge> <kebscs> very nice
21:50 < bridge> <kebscs> having 6 different commands for cloning might be confusing though
21:51 < bridge> <kebscs> most beginner devs probably dont care, just shallow clone with libs
22:37 < chillerbot123> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: watch rec video dc
22:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog
22:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1406015872820052028/image.png?ex=68a0edd2&is=689f9c52&hm=42b1134ae6a4636054eb8225b8afd4c6bb6ea0efbce7893960d6f75f75b8c1c9&
22:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> fat32 file names are max 10 length lol
22:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> but there is a extension for longer names
22:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: but how to download git? And how to download vs?
22:58 < bridge> <Obliterator²> 💀
22:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Especially vs is too fat for a quick start and too complicated of an interactive installer
23:01 < bridge> <Obliterator²> i agree, you have someone asking why vscode is frickin 30gb
23:01 < bridge> <Obliterator²> (they checked every option there is)
23:01 < bridge> <Obliterator²> i agree, you have someone asking why VSis frickin 30gb
23:01 < bridge> <Obliterator²> i agree, you have someone asking why VS is frickin 30gb
