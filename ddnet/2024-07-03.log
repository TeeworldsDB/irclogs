17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fixed
17:54 < ChillerDragon> pog
17:54 < ChillerDragon> can i get ws-client and bridge too
17:54 < ChillerDragon> ah wait
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> some spammer abused IRC so I set +m
17:54 < ChillerDragon> you set the mode not me
17:54 < ChillerDragon> globally
17:54 < ChillerDragon> sure that also works
17:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ping
17:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pong
17:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we so back!
17:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> finally
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like some error handling would be good for your clients
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if they didn't tell you that +m was the problem
17:55 < ChillerDragon> err_cannotsendtochan
17:55 < ChillerDragon> 404
17:55 < ChillerDragon> from my js lib
17:55 < ChillerDragon> `#ddnet: Cannot send to channel      ` from weechat
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it wasn't shown to the user?
17:56 < ChillerDragon> oh no took me 1 day talking to the void to figurure out nobody sees my messages xd
17:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oof. error handling!
17:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then when i looked in the logs i did not know what was causing err_cannotsendtochan
17:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i am always a bit hesitant to just pipe any kind of error which i dont really know its format of to the users
17:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might leak some infromation i dont want to leak
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did you at least send *any* error to the user?
17:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no xd
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then send a redacted error
18:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds good
18:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not sure if in general my fear is even justified
18:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but a error means i messed something up and something unexpected happend and my users now know exactly what. That should make it easier to further exploit.
18:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or the backtrace might straight up contain `/home/moms_maiden_name/code/proj/lib.js:8 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'`
18:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> will you use the hardware for ddnet?
18:03 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Yes
18:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then its perfectly on topic
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> we talk about general hardware all the time, ask away!
18:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I'd give the most detailed error message to the user
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea thats nice
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but isnt it also scary?
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. I do that in the https masterserver for ddnet
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `curl -i https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/register`
18:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Did you write the string `HTTP method not allowed` ?
18:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> isnt that just the regular 405 response?
18:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> passing on errors from an unknown source to the user might contain any information
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did not write that message, ChillerDragon
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (you can see the mastersrv code, it's just three files or so)
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can't come up with a good example right now but can't you imagine a scenario where you see an error message and your first thought is "nice now i know exactly how to fully break the system"
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> security by obsecurity
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i rather not reveal that i am running pyson 2 in my crash logs
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> write a better software chiller xd
18:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fakof abuse admin 5991 muted me -.-
18:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had no bugs
18:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> i mean its better for your programs to be able to reveal error messages to its users
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> you'll know whats going wrong at least
18:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i as the admin of the tool can check the logs
18:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and if there is a bug that can be exploited i want my users to know nothing about it
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> imagine if its not web service kekw
18:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> isnt it possible for you to find out that a channel has the +m flag and just output that for example?
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> if someone wants to break your system theyll do it anyway
18:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well if its not a server and running on the users device then its a different story
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then at least tell your server that *some* error occured
18:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye that sounds good
18:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im just curious if anyone can follow my thought here
18:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how error details can be dangerous
18:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ i had the error in the logs i didnt know what it meant
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> So I build a gaming PC back in 2020 and I am looking to either upgrade my hardware or build a new PC.
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I have some knowledge about this stuff, but I am not in to the market so I am not sure if I should wait for new parts to drop or if the prices are currently too high.
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> 
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> My current build:
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Graphics Card: SAPPHIRE Radeon™ RX 5700 XT NITRO+ 8GB
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Mainbord: MSI MPG B550 GAMING PLUS
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> CPU: RYZEN 5 3600X
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> CPU Cooler: BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro 3
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Ram: 16 GB Corsair Vengeance 3600mhz (XMP Optimized)
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> 
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> My last two builds were both AMD and I am still unsure to this day whats better, if I should maybe try out NVIDIA/INTEL.
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I never had any problems with AMD and I think the prices are pretty fair for what you get, but I still don't understand why the majority of people are on NVIDIA/INTEL builds. Maybe I am lacking information about this topic, but it would be nice to know if I should actually try out NVIDIA/INTEL.
18:15 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> 
18:16 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I would like to upgrade/build a new PC that can handle atleast 260fps @ 1080p in all sorts of games since I have a 240hz Monitor.
18:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 here u go i will do it some day xd https://github.com/discord-irc/irc-websockets/issues/11
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> i jsut don't see anything that you can break in irc-proxy lol
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> nuclear codes or what xd
18:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its more the vps its running on
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> amd is gonna release Zen 5 soon™️ - i am enjoying my current build (even tho it was pretty pricely, given i maxxed it out) - 
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you just want to upgrade, i would absolutely grab another stick of 16gb RAM to get at 32gb, newer games eat that for some reason, the rest still looks good enough tho - are you having fps issues on newer games?
18:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that should not be pwned
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> amd is gonna release Zen 5 soon™️ - i am enjoying my current build (even tho it was pretty pricely, given i maxxed it out, but its full AMD aswell) - 
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you just want to upgrade, i would absolutely grab another stick of 16gb RAM to get at 32gb, newer games eat that for some reason, the rest still looks good enough tho - are you having fps issues on newer games?
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> how can you pwn it via irc-proxy watafak
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> chiller just likes to pwn things
18:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn yes if the error message reveals some log4j kind of situation
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> rest in peace chillers formatted rpi4
18:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> just run it in docker
18:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> docker is not meant for security
18:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i also dislike it
18:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> what is unsafe about docker :o
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> no you just dislike it
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> it fits there perfectly
18:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not designed to be a secure sandbox
18:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yes in reality docker exploits are rare but real
18:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it for sure adds some layer of protection
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> they're real in cases when pwner has access to your machine
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> or your docker container runs with privileges it shouldnt run with
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> and you never lift privileges if you are not working with some specific software
18:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe look into smth like this then: https://kubernetes.io/de/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pods-verwenden
18:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> if security is a concern
18:22 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> My build is still perfectly fine and everything runs flawless, but I have fps problems in some games.
18:22 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Its pretty weird, for example: I have 1000fps in Minecraft (without shaders and texturepack) but only 180-220fps in Valorant even tho I play on lowest possible settings and this is pretty annoying for me.
18:22 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> 
18:22 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Note: I have Windows + Games on a NVME M.2 SSD
18:22 < bridge> <archimede67> /de #pods-verwenden
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah gg german link
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> sry
18:22 < bridge> <archimede67> gg
18:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont speak beerlang
18:22 < bridge> <zhn> valorant just sucks ig xd
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> chiller is prolly the most german of us all
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe look into smth like this then: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/
18:23 < bridge> <archimede67> do you really read technical stuff in german @blaiszephyr
18:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> schnitzel
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> doesn't it require kernel mode malware to run
18:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes :(
18:23 < bridge> <archimede67> wtf
18:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would not use containerization for anything serious
18:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont like its complexity
18:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> not afaik
18:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its full of pain points
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> you will use no error handling xd
18:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> but tbh im not that familiar with containerization in general, reitw could speak hours about that
18:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> chiller review pr
18:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> :simp:  btw
18:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pyjama dragon is alr falling asleep jxsl
18:24 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> @blaiszephyr not sure if you missed it c:
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> i couldn't run valorant only because this kernel mode shit refused to run on my custom windows
18:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> give feedback so I can continue D:
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uff
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have a look 1s
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> @ryumaaaa nvidia has better drivers to go with, windows + nvidia = high fps usually
18:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> i did! lol - you could just check your task-manager and see what is actually bottlenecking - your specs look great so i either assume: the GPU is outdated for valorant | your RAM is getting capped | riot games is a bully
18:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye its fucked either way @jxsl13 i dont like violating golang core ideals
18:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> keep or rename?
18:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uff
18:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lets go full camel?
18:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> DdnetExItem
18:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:27 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Alright, I'll check that out. Thank you :o7:
18:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> Ddnet should be called Ddnet, true
18:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc
18:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> k, imma change it then
18:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xD
18:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Dummydragracenetwork
18:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes.
18:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> gotta focus on reader
18:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> which is more tricky it seems
18:28 < bridge> <zhn> KirbyGameMod
18:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> reader impl
18:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> EndOfFileSymbol
18:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez dodge
18:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> freezenextgeneration
18:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> my next pr is gonna be done without the shift-key now
18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think its time to abandon go
18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it doesnt align with ddnet style guide xd
18:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's time to abandon ddnet
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I mean they explicitly mention "Url" and "appID" being illegal
18:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> doesn't align with Go style guide
18:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
18:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> appID is legal
18:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> Url not
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eh ye "appId" right
18:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and since the heinrich format moment ddnet enforces Url and ClientId
18:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
18:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what PR @jxsl13
18:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i retrained my brain from years of ClientID to ClientId and now you tell me i have to ClientID again? xd
18:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> huffmann repo of chiller
18:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 this is annoying me https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#initialisms
18:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> might have started a holy war
18:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> by accident
18:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
18:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> i go shopping - gl
18:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: rust says the opposite
18:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good ol rust vs go
18:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is rust even that oppiniated?
18:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> time to abandon
18:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> rust
18:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why can't i have just one universal strict guide for style so i never have to think about it again
18:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> why is there not magical AI doing the code formatting and introducing security related bugs at the same time
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> use one formatter
18:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> no*
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and call the main branch MASTER in all git repos
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxax
18:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> master branch doesn't exist, did you mean `main` ahh moment
18:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just let there be one way for everything
18:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> Go does that but whenever people find ground about stuff being unprecise or not easily tonautomate, then people will argue about it forever.
18:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> waste of time
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> Golang authors have very decent taste in code
18:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok fk it lets follow ddnet style and not go
18:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> EOFSymbol would mean that it should be ClientID and MsgID
18:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> changed, don't care
18:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> whatever you prefer.
18:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> just added a little bit of context information
18:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> as the language is opinionated
18:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> will cry to all Go devs about our loss in this small battle.
18:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
18:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:46 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> This is what it looks like when im running Valorant.
18:46 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> FPS ranging from 180-300 - comes to what is happening on my screen obviously.
18:46 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258101563042304080/image.png?ex=6686d1e3&is=66858063&hm=1374a6af1514919d43459811687f2d7b21c8ae5c8083a0eb1fc203e6031f183d&
18:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so ready to merge @jxsl13 ?
18:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> sure
18:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> will continue implementing the Reader in a second PR in order not to make this one too big
18:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, some evil eof lingering somewhere
18:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> D:
18:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xD
18:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had that compile error on a daily basis with MsgID
18:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats why i pushed https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7750
18:50 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> This is what it looks like when im running Valorant.
18:50 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> FPS ranging from 180-300 - comes to what is happening on my screen obviously.
18:50 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> 
18:50 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I am using AMD's replay feature and I have other apps open in the back which I don't want to give up, so I guess im just gonna get another 16GB of Ram and a new CPU.
18:50 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258101563042304080/image.png?ex=6686d1e3&is=66858063&hm=1374a6af1514919d43459811687f2d7b21c8ae5c8083a0eb1fc203e6031f183d&
18:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as long as it is allowed to do both there will be compile errors caused by casing
18:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> pushed
18:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> Go devs are mournin my loss
18:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
18:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> speaking of style guides..
18:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you write js you better use double standard
18:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Flet/doublestandard
19:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> sorry
19:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> but I have double standards
21:06 < bridge> <kekomonter> After a long pause I did this xd
21:06 < bridge> <kekomonter> Greedy meshing in teeworlds

21:20 < bridge> <godly13> Devs are u guys know abt tik tok ddnet
21:20 < bridge> <godly13> where all upload videos abt ddnet
21:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon you awake?
21:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ladies, gentlemen and @learath2 look at that!
21:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258142818757509120/image.png?ex=6686f84f&is=6685a6cf&hm=36322f5c39f5819712b536e1063327fb49c491e1f1f679f69f5a83e9175cff8b&
21:34 < bridge> <patiga> heh nice :D
21:34 < bridge> <patiga> you group together tiles with the same rotation+id?
21:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> can you explain what that is in layman's terms :o?
21:36 < bridge> <kekomonter> This is first version, only tiles with same id, maybe I will add check for flags
21:38 < bridge> <kekomonter> Grouping a lot of triangles (polygons) to this small groups.
21:38 < bridge> <kekomonter> More triangles = more GPU work & more RAM/VRAM usage
21:38 < bridge> <patiga> have you done performance measurements? :)
21:39 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nope, I just checked fps on vulkan and opengl on debug build. Same fps with greedy meshing and without
21:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> Idk why xdd
21:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> is that for rendering purposes in the client to improve fps or something like that?
21:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> ye
21:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm , cool
21:41 < bridge> <patiga> have you tried zooming out far? there you could probably get the biggest performance diff
21:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> kinda reminds me of that shader loading stuff that big games do. might be the same here, just based on the played map?
21:42 < bridge> <kekomonter> Ye, I thought about this, but I'm so lazy for test this rn
21:42 < bridge> <kekomonter> Wdym?
21:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> when starting some graphics intensive games, they always do shader stuff ._. dunno the terms
21:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> which takes ages and is supposed to improve performane, whatsoever
21:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> is this related to that :o?
21:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> could one improve performance based on like the currently loaded map?
21:45 < bridge> <kekomonter> Maybe shaders just compiling or caching? Greedy meshing optimizing mesh, not shaders
21:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> i guess both
21:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, k, I see
21:46 < bridge> <kekomonter> You need just reconnect for cache all meshes for map
21:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's cool
21:49 < bridge> <kekomonter> Hm, if I'll add chromium to teeworlds, this means what I can play teeworlds in teeworlds 🤔
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> Yes I am an agendered blob of slime and I approve of this compiler
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
