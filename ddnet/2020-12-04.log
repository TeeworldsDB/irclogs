00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any way to have saved ghosts for a map play while viewing a demo for that map?
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't think so
05:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my game got the frozen glitch on the main menu
05:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol
05:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess u have to accept the 5 seconds delay or install some beta driver
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it seems I either got lucky on day 2 and getting on the leaderboard is harder than I expected, or there's more competition this year
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> missed it again, by quite a margin
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well as rhe challanges get harder that's when the competitive programmers and golfers shine
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Theirabilitt to solve problems O(1)  is very useful

11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki try day 5 with tensorflow? üòÑ
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> awk: https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/4a.awk
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (but part 2 was much more annoying with awk)
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™  I can't reproduce the Intel GPU problem anymore on Windows laptop, no driver update happened.
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis Could you try in Intel GPU settings -> System -> Energy -> And turn off all power saving stuff
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just wondering if that might help since I had Intel driver problems on Linux with power saving too
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/chat-command-ddracenetwork
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know that the walrus operator in python can't have subscripts to the left? so you can't assign into a list with it...
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After so much discussion and drama and needlessly introducing a new operator, they decided to cripple that too, god forbid someone makes a mistake
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/aoc/blob/master/2020/4/solve.py here is my solution for today, I think it's quite pretty for how awful I'm with python
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, there he is `xiaowuc1` I was wondering when he was going to show up. This guy is always at the top of the leaderboards on all competitive programming challanges
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why this
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if not (m := re.match(r"^\d{9}$", p['pid'])):
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what don't you like about it?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Hello, I am Manuel Franco, you have a donation of $3,100,000.00 USD
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Guess we won't need any more funding for DDNet for a few years
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if not re.match(r"^\d{9}$", p['pid']):
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt this the same
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I was printing the match for debugging at one point, I guess I forgot to clean up
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lately I've had a newfound appreciation of regex, I used to always feel like they would perform badly for some reason but decent implementations of it that don't add silly features actually perform quite well
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't be surprised if a good regex implementation could come very close to the speed of just strcmp if not for vectorization
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust regex is good
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > all searches execute in linear time with respect to the size of the regular expression and search text.
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :giftee_red:
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why didnt u use regex to parse each
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g hgt
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `if not 1920 <= int(p['byr']) <= 2002:`
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm offended
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > let re = Regex::new(r"(\w+):([#\w]+)").unwrap();
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no try-catch and it still worked?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im offended too
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess he got lucky
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 haha, I thought the same üòÑ
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I did parse hgt with regex?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784411664430661681/unknown.png
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean parse each a:b value
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with regex
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [{s[0]:s[1] for s in [t.split(":") for t in p]}
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u used this xd
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why are you offended? I think pythons precedence rules allow that
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 byr can be a invalid integer
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and crash
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur program
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u got lucky with input
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm offended because you didn't check for a valid integer. anywhere
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I don't bother validating aoc inputs
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i got a non number on byr
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh really?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> people get different inputs
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, guess I did get lucky with the input
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ üé≤
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually just don't bother validating the input at all, only when I get a problem I check the input
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the program asked for validation
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> explicitly
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a friend of mine validated the colors by hcl[0] == '#'
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fixed
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnumeric :feelsbadman:
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did isnumeric do to you?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing, python has so many handy methods
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd be nice to see that "split_list" as part of the standard library
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just a more generic str.split
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what would it be?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> List.split
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 make RFC
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or pep
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whathever they call it
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> another friend of mine actually found the trick:
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `file.read().split("\n\n")`
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I considered that too for about a minute
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (for this problem)
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I thought that might be a bit of a hack üòÑ
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did that
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/784414157147078686/unknown.png
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with this i get every in a single line
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nice
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> python has you covered
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just do `.split()` it doesn't care about which whitespace is there
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they're all already on for me
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki my awk solution does that too
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis try turnign them *off*
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah i meant they're already off
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i'll check
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù definition for mutex? I think you can use a semaphore as a mutex yet there are sources that claim the two are different things
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling a mutex is just a binary semaphore
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just read a bit about it some days ago
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and there was a difference
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what i remember, idk if exactly, is that semaphores are used to block parts of a buffer or smth like
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.cs.uni.edu/~diesburg/courses/cs3430_sp18/sessions/s07/s07_semaphores.pdf
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that powerpoint is horrible i think
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-vs-semaphore/
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A semaphore is a generalized mutex. In lieu of single buffer, we can split the 4 KB buffer into four 1 KB buffers (identical resources). A semaphore can be associated with these four buffers. The consumer and producer can work on different buffers at the same time.
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i read this yeah
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only two ‚Äúdifferences‚Äù I can think of are: a) the usecase b) the fact that a semaphore doesn‚Äôt guarantee that only the owner of the ‚Äúlock‚Äù can signal
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > There is an ambiguity between binary semaphore and mutex. We might have come across that a mutex is binary semaphore. But they are not! The purpose of mutex and semaphore are different. May be, due to similarity in their implementation a mutex would be referred as binary semaphore.
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Strictly speaking, a mutex is locking mechanism
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Semaphore is signaling mechanism
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:

17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but not a downtime I think
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, they do get found sometimes
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_bomb_disposal_in_Europe
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Every year, an estimated 2,000 tons of World War II munitions are found in Germany, at times requiring the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents from their homes.[1] In Berlin alone, 1.8 million pieces of ordnance have been defused since 1947.[4] Buried bombs, as well as mortars, land mines and grenades, are often found during construction work or other excavations, or by farmers tilling the land.[5]

17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen well the blockdriver impl resettet your GL version, or did u change that back manually?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that cookie stuff was confusing
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> took me 30 secs to not accept all
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> click the lower button twice. probably harder if you don't speak german
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah did that
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and not conforming AFAIK, rejecting needs to be as simple as accepting)
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i thought so
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ hm, somehow the driver seems not to be blocked
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw, if anyone wants some math puzzles, there's a math advent calendar as well: e.g. https://www.mathekalender.de/index.php?page=problem&problemID=132
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> weird
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> math too hard
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found yesterday's puzzle interesting, but it was also quite hard: https://www.mathekalender.de/index.php?page=problem&problemID=120
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen is gfx_driver_is_blocked 0 ?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> math calendar :poggers:
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The classic math/programming puzzles I used to do was https://projecteuler.net/
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more mathy oriented
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imo
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's a mix. the problems always require a computer
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I heard from a friend that you can skip the last optimization step by using your university's compute cluster
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg

17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remembered my account
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use a pw manager if you don't already üòâ
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 yeah i use firefox one
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but when i did this stuff
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was rly long ago
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see ^^ change the pw ^^
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea xd
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen guess you have to check the impl then, i only used a string from gpuinfo.org to check if it works, since i dont have an intel
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.codewars.com/> is good too
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more for the cool kids i guess

18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had a flight cancelled because of a ww2 bomb last year üò¶
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is not just hard, it's very hard üòõ
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Does map webgl renderer have a repo somewhere I can contribute?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> spent the last hour trying to devise a method to no avail
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro is it not ddnet/tw-webgl?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep, thx
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow sounds really annoying that ppl dont update their systems
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Dow to get https://github.com/ddnet/tw-webgl running? Where does `twdatafile.js` come from?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Do you know to get https://github.com/ddnet/tw-webgl running? Where does `twdatafile.js` come from?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Do you know how to get https://github.com/ddnet/tw-webgl running? Where does `twdatafile.js` come from?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro easts fork seems to have that
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah but it should be all in one repo
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Which one is the up to date version
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well who knows with this stuff üòÑ
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 9 commits ahead, 14 commits behind
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro wanna become maintainer? üòÑ
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like we use the east version, sorry forthe confusion
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Could just reset ddnet/tw-webgl to east's I guess?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> You could fix the clipping of the web version üòÑ
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is buggy
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about using teewebs
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to view maps
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> could be done, same with watching demos
21:01 <+bliblablub> is there any ddnet dev channel?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> this one
21:01 <+bliblablub> ah
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's connect to our discord
21:02 <+bliblablub> ah 0:
21:02 <+bliblablub> is there any Tick event? I'm trying to create a command, which edits a boolean, and if this bool is true it should notify me whenever my tee gets moved
21:04 <+bliblablub> which i can directly access from gameclient.cpp
21:06 <+bliblablub> @here
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are no ticks on the client per se
22:20 <+bliblablub> k, is there any way to get the CGameClient Object from the Dummy?
22:24 <+bliblablub> Ah, in my case i don't even need CGameclient for dummy, i can just get the current pos using m_Snap and i'll just save both client id's
