01:13 <@deen> Saavik says that when ddnet.tw is down you can't join any server because map download just hangs
01:15 <@deen> Ouch, she's right
01:15 <@deen> We really have no timeout?
01:17 < eeeee> thats bad :/
01:17 < eeeee> Learath2: ^ can haz timeout plx?
01:20 <@deen> oh well, easy to fix
01:20 <@deen> what's a reasonable timeout?
01:20 <@deen> oh, i found a timeout for the total time, not the connection process
01:20 <@deen> that should also be limited though, i guess
01:54 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vUGJU
01:54 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 ad151e5 def: Enable timeouts and low speed limits for HTTP downloads
01:54 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 33c0420 def: Don't stop Autoupdater downloads just because they're slow
01:54 <@deen> Does that look ok?
09:37 <@EastByte> 2015-02-08 @EastByte   lets say deen's server is unavailable because of ddos attacks
09:37 <@EastByte> 2015-02-08 @EastByte   then all map requests would slow down
09:37 <@EastByte> [...]
09:37 <@EastByte> 2015-02-08 @hein_rich5991   then maybe that problem should be tackled instead?
09:37 <@EastByte> 2015-02-08 @hein_rich5991   aggressive timeout on the HTTP server e.g.
09:37 <@EastByte> 2015-02-08 Lear_ath2    a good timeout should fix the situation
09:37 <@EastByte> atleast we talked about the timeout^^
10:50 < Learath2> back
10:51 < Learath2> EastByte: we sure did and i do have it on my local copy 
10:51 < Learath2> for some reason i never commit it tho :D
10:54 < Learath2> deen: why dont you let autoupdate timeout ?
11:50 <@deen> Learath2: the autoupdate doesn't block anything, does it?
11:51 <@deen> some file may hang at autoupdate, then the autoupdater should fail, and not continue with the rest of the files
11:53 <@deen> we don't have a fallback for the autoupdater
11:53 < Learath2> well if it never timesout it will just be stuck 
11:54 < Learath2> shouldnt we atleast signify that we failed and they should try later instead of being stuck
11:54 <@deen> and if it times out the DDNet.exe may be updated but a few other files may be missing
11:54 <@deen> what if someone always has a slow connection?
11:54 <@deen> (some people do)
11:54 <@deen> then they can't use the autoupdater
11:55 < Learath2> we dont need such an agressive timeout with the autoupdater tho
11:55 <@deen> the important part is: if one file fails, the autoupdater shouldn't update the exe
12:01 < dmtEE> HOLA
12:01 <@deen> hi
12:01 < dmtEE> has starnight written u an email?
12:02 <@deen> not that I know of
12:02 < dmtEE> hmm he said it like 1,5 weeks ago to me he sent u the sourcecode with all settings
12:03 < dmtEE> should be from starnight94@googlemail.com or something like that
12:03 <@deen> the email title is "Foot Mod (ohne Source)"
12:03 <@deen> can't do anything without the source code
12:03 < dmtEE> just for me as a software noob whats exactly a source code?
12:04 <@deen> the files so I can compile it into a server binary
12:04 <@deen> have to go afk now, bye
12:04 < dmtEE> cucu
12:34 < shorefir1> deen: you ened to sort your fucking mods out
12:35 < shorefir1> deen: welf joining mid argument and mutes me, doesnt even care about whats going on
12:35 < shorefir1> Your servers just get worse and worse
12:35 < shorefir1> Pathetic
12:36 < shorefir1> typical eurofag shit
12:37 < Learath2> this shorefir1 guy seems like a pain in the ass and seems to have problems with every single mod
12:37 < Learath2> now either he is crazy or all the mods are 
12:39 < heinrich5991> I understand why someone muted this shorefie1 guy :)
12:40 < shorefir1> deen: It's funny how I can chill in usa and can for weeks without issue, join ger once and your mods are running fucking rampant 
13:14 <@deen> sigh, shorefire again
13:15 < Learath2> tbh he'd be long gone if the server belonged to me 
13:15 <@deen> You mean ban him?
13:15 < Learath2> yep
13:16 <@deen> dynamic ip anyway, he'd just be writing even more shit
13:16 <@deen> and he's into ddosing
13:16 < Learath2> i see why he still isnt banned
13:18 < Learath2> i hate ddos and i hate how you cant mitigate it without paying ridiculous amounts of money
13:18 <@deen> yep, it's terrible
13:18 <@deen> running ddnet would be much easier without ddos attacks
13:18 <@EastByte> as long as we don't have another nazar or vali it's fine
13:19 <@deen> well, nazar and vali started after I banned them from the block servers iirc
13:19 < Learath2> p2p teeworlds lets make it a thing
13:19 <@deen> Learath2: then all the players get ddosed, nice!
13:20 <@EastByte> why do you even ban them?
13:20 < Learath2> atleast you dont have to deal with ddos :D
13:20 <@deen> long ago, not sure, but i think they were saying shit on the servers. walking around with bots and saying admin can't kick them or they ddos
13:21 <@EastByte> well that's no reason to ban in a block server
13:24 <@EastByte> therefor we need some stealth features^^
13:24 < Learath2> in other news i just noticed i have no knowledge of network related programming
13:24 <@EastByte> Learath2: learn about network related programming!
13:25 <@EastByte> speaking of stealth features, I wanted to test a simple antibot feature
13:25 < Learath2> i've been sitting here contemplating how to implement the simplest protocol of all time for 2 hours now
13:26 <@EastByte> what do you want to do?
13:27 < Learath2> so i have decided i want it to be non blocking and non threaded and thats about it 
13:27 < Learath2> http://www.battleye.com/downloads/BERConProtocol.txt
13:27 < Learath2> trying to implement this in C
13:27 <@EastByte> threaded+non blocking?
13:27 < Learath2> literally consists of 6 packets 
13:28 < Learath2> i think making it threaded will cause me more problems then it solves
13:28 <@EastByte> threading always causes more problems
13:30 <@EastByte> I would rather do it like teeworlds does
13:30 < Learath2> never actually read teeworlds network code 
13:31 <@EastByte> the server has one nonblocking socket and uses select() to wait for packets
13:31 <@EastByte> unless the timeout passes
13:31 < Learath2> the problem is im trying to make a library 
13:31 < Learath2> where would i even select in a library
13:31 <@EastByte> that's more difficult yep
13:33 < Learath2> my latest idea is to have a select like function provided by the library and recv/send wrappers
13:34 <@EastByte> do you want the library to block until it finished?
13:35 <@EastByte> or async
13:36 < Learath2> thinking of making it async
13:36 <@EastByte> would only be a problem if the caller wants to use select() for his purposes aswell
13:37 < Learath2> or just a pump network function that is to be called in the main loop 
13:37 < Learath2> which would send the messages in the queue and recv anything thats waiting
13:38 <@EastByte> I would make a function which returns a fd list which then the caller can pass to select() itself
13:39 < Learath2> what would happen if the caller uses select for his own purposes
13:39 <@EastByte> yep, and you can provide another method next to it
13:42 < Learath2> <@EastByte> would only be a problem if the caller wants to use select() for his purposes aswell
13:42 < Learath2> what would this cause ?
13:44 <@EastByte> you wanted to provide a custom select() in this lib right? should be fine if the caller doesn't use select() itself
13:44 <@EastByte> I mean if he only uses your select() provided in the lib
13:44 < Learath2> well the user wouldnt have the fd to begin with
13:45 <@EastByte> your custom select() can simply add the fds of the lib
13:47 <@EastByte> afk
14:02 <@EastByte> hah and now I'll implement simulated latency feature
14:02 < Learath2> EastByte: simulated latency ?
14:03 < Learath2> and i've decided to completely block as i couldnt figure out how to return the responses to the user
14:05 <@EastByte> Learath2: sending all packets a bit delayed to control the ping
14:05 <@EastByte> so I can easily test all kind of pings on a local server
14:06 <@EastByte> should also add some packetloss
14:06 < Learath2> thats a nice idea
14:53 < heinrich5991> EastByte: I think that's what the tool crapnet is for
14:55 <@EastByte> ah I didn't know what it is for, now I understand
14:57 <@EastByte> anyway, I want to have the possibility to delay per client and server buildin
