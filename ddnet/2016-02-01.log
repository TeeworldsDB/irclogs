14:29 <+Learath2> ah missed greyfox because of this shitty new irc client :P
14:51 <+o_be_one> Learath2: wich one ?
14:51 <+o_be_one> hello all
14:52 <@EastByte> hi
14:52 <@EastByte> it was the greyfoxy greyfox :p
15:02 <+Learath2> was giving hexchat a try
15:02 <+Learath2> its not willing to give me a beep on hilites and has a really small selection of colors so EastBite and Shereef and some other people including Q all hash to green \o/
15:04 <@EastByte> not bad
15:05 <+Learath2> in really big channels you just dont have any way of distinguishing people by color :P
15:18 <+o_be_one> HexChat is good, i use WeeChat since some weeks now
15:18 <+o_be_one> its cool too
15:18 <@EastByte> weechat obviously also only has a few colors because of the console
15:20 <+o_be_one> mmh thats enough, hexchat use same colors
15:20 <+o_be_one> its not really rainbow colors, just 16 colors from IRC no ?
15:21 <@EastByte> well I don't know whether those are exactly the colors used for names
15:22 <+o_be_one> without plugins, it looks like that : http://screen.obeone.fr/sc_16-02-01_09-22.png
15:22 <+o_be_one> better than irssi ahah x)
15:22 <@EastByte> I'm also using weechat
15:22 <@EastByte> oh I'm purple
15:22 <+Learath2> thats quite pretty
15:22 <@EastByte> you are also purple for me
15:23 <+Learath2> im using irssi on my linux box
15:23 <+o_be_one> :D
15:23 <+o_be_one> Learath2: irssi is too basic ... WeeChat is a fork and big enhancement of irssi
15:23 <@EastByte> and also using tmux, good boy
15:23 <+o_be_one> with relay to connect Android APP or webpages or whatever could use it
15:23 <+o_be_one> EastByte: nice, i use WeeChat on a Docker
15:23 <+o_be_one> in Docker*
15:23 <+o_be_one> hosted on a small dedi x)
15:24 <+Learath2> well what do you need from a irc client that irssi cant provide ?
15:25 <+Learath2> the only thing im missing is vertical splits
15:25 <@EastByte> weechat is more up-to-date
15:25 <@EastByte> just look at the code
15:25 <@EastByte> (that was my main reason to switch to weechat)
15:26 <+Learath2> im thinking ill work on a irc client after im done with my current project should be fun :)
15:27 <+o_be_one> ITs an irssi enhancement
15:27 <+o_be_one> base irssi is just too basic :/
15:27 <@EastByte> from what i've seen it's not just an enhancement
15:27 <+o_be_one> with plugins its ok, but why work with plugin when you can get the same enhanced client including all useful irc stuffs ?
15:27 <@EastByte> more like a rewrite on modern standards
15:27 <+o_be_one> oh ok
15:28 <+o_be_one> i've the app in my android now and it works like a charm
15:28 <+o_be_one> im able to use WeeChat like a bnc, connecting with my phone :)
15:28  * EastByte is doing that aswell
15:28 <+o_be_one> ive killed my bnc so (was o_be_two on ZNC)
15:29 <+Learath2> i see where you are coming from but i do believe somethings just dont belong to the client itself
15:30 <@EastByte> that's why you are going to write your own right?
15:30 <+Learath2> \o/
15:30 <@EastByte> o\
15:30 <+Learath2> ill see what i can pull off
15:31 <+o_be_one> nice ^^
15:31 <@EastByte> implementing simple procotols is pretty fun
15:31 <@EastByte> only that gui/userinterface stuff sucks
15:35 <+Learath2> dont think ill implement the protocol myself after the horror stories i heard from fstd :P
16:18 < Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/414
16:44 < fstd> Learath2: what horror stories?
16:45 <+Learath2> eh noone actually following any standart at all mostly :P
16:45 <+Learath2> you already did the protocol part and ill happily just take that
16:46 < fstd> oh you mean IRC
23:02 <+devnull> gg laxa 
23:02 < laxa> huhu :) ?
23:03 < laxa> devnull = imdra ?
23:35 <+devnull> indeed
