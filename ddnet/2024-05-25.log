01:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> mods crush his head to a pulp
02:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sdsds I strongly disagree that ddnet does not moderate enough. It’s the opposite actually. It’s full of abusing admins that enjoy muting and banning and do it whenever they want.
02:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just proofs my point
02:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ye agree
02:42 < bridge> <Ewan> at least in places where the game is popular
02:42 < bridge> <Ewan> usa mods are mostly chill
02:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 omagawd your hint was super helpful once again <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
02:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> turns out i fat fingered -rdynamic only onto the shared object (which is trol because they expose symbols by default) and not the server in the working example
02:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so cmakelist and the verbose make command showed -rdynamic but it was NOT applied on the SERVER
02:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sadly now i am not so sure anymore if i can make it work because that simplified example managed to access ccollision without linking against the entire server code which is a bit more tricky in a real teeworlds codebase because of how interconnected everything is
04:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess the function being local on the server side is the problem. `nm` reports `T` in the working version and `t` in the non hot reloading version (this time i am not using -rdynamic so not sure how it became local -.-)

04:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat did ddnet code base do to make all the big Ts go away?

04:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1716603827.png
04:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm not sure if the t/T is a problem. Since I manage to hot reload the lite version of the shared object in a ddnet server that has the symbol locally

06:50 < bridge> <sedonya> morning
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning
08:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao chillerdragon: imagine wasting few hours of your life for `T`s and `t`s
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> genetic engineering
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1243814474062889002/image.png?ex=6652d7ff&is=6651867f&hm=bb52065e34a947360ef7170f2d0e324e127df12baf7c51bff4e4c138bd301f93&
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> for the most efficient "xp" plant
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that this mc mod where u can grow the best plant by analysing it's properties and then only put the good ones together
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and remove the rest
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i also played that once.. but then it got too overpowered xD
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u gotta grow dragon eggs and win or smth
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should play mc
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> mystical agriculture
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u go sleep to get well
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh i thought the name was differently
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so maybe it's a different mod xD
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> or agricraft
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> im not sure
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> there may be a few like this
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah maybe
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it's agricraft
08:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean ur screenshot says so xd
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> the plants themselves are from whatever mod
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but the genetic engineering is agricraft
08:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cant they even grow diamonds and stuff xD
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> http://2143.christmas/f/K2MH.png
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> im invisible in the game
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> like i even collect xp orbs
08:41 < bridge> <Ewan> as if their clients don't even know that i exist
08:41 < bridge> <Ewan> like their client even shows them collecting xp orbs that i collected
08:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> morning #developer chat enjoyers and others
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i actually sleep in 18 minutes
08:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> morning #developer no lifers and others
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
08:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we stick together
08:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> damn i just woke up XD
08:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> the timezone diff hits hard
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> indeed
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i slept and im way better now
08:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> so proud of you
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> good
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft u playing a modpack?
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> which
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need modern good modpacks
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> eternal
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> with defined progression
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> not modern
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> 3 fps
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like following
08:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i blame amd not releasing zen5
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i have 64gb ram
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> can i assign mc 32
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> sure u can
08:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes
08:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also assign it 64gb
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> im at 12 never had to go higher
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and this is like the most expensive modpack
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u get 3 fps
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> whhy
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> not gc
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> bad coding
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> novice java devs
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> more ram doesn't necessarily mean more fps
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it just means more time until the next (more monumental) lag spike, assuming you're using g1 which is the default garbage collector
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> modern packs use modern java
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> better gc
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yes g1 still default 😃
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> some jvm can only use g1
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doubt it's a gc issue anyway
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ZGC
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> is meant for realtime
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> like mc
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's simply that all mods more and more bloat code into the mod
08:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add
08:49 < bridge> <egyt> Is this Minetest?
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> http://2143.christmas/f/AODx.png
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> does this look like minetest
08:50 < bridge> <egyt> Yes, it does!
08:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> :KEKW:
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks like red hat
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> -XX:+UseZGC -XX:AllocatePrefetchStyle=1 -XX:-ZProactive
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> zgc good for server
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> not client tho
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> u want shenandoah
08:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> lets all drop ddnet and code our own minecraft mod
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd code a ddnet minecraft mod
08:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> minetee is a thing tho
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the wrong direction xD
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mc mod in ddnet
08:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh lord
08:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, what's up?
08:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> ? i was talking to @gumbatw
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he is my slave
08:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> fair enough
08:53 < bridge> <gumbatw> tf
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> submit
08:53 < bridge> <gumbatw> no
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> good for client with ZGenerational
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> only in java 21+
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> iirc new fabric api only supports 20 tho
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just allocate 2TB Ram and never deallocate
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/Mukul1127/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> true
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> clearly u didnt check the stars 🤓
08:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> writing a c program that leaks 2TB of memory any% speedrun
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder
08:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao yea jopsti im stuck on hot reloading how i want it to for way too long now :/ 
08:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and im out of ideas again
08:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly i never truely understand what u r stuck on xD
08:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
08:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it just won't run the new code i compiled and keeps running the old code
08:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unless i do compromises 
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you are sure u unloaded the lib completely?
08:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dlclose() did not fail
08:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> from what i understand its less of a unloading problem actually
09:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> have u tried simply renaming ur lib every time?
09:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the function i want to hot reload from an external so file is also statically linked into the server executable it self
09:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and that seems to take priority
09:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it doesn't even work on first load i guess
09:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and renaming seems like a compromise
09:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean i made it work by renaming the function :D 
09:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it wasnt as nice as i wanted it to be
09:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u kinda have a symbol collision?
09:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it works if i make the shared object not access ccollision from the server
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> #include <cstdlib>
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> #include <cstdio>
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> 
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> int main() {
09:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which i thought is caused by -rdynamic causing troubles with symbol collision
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan>         for(int i = 0; ; i++) {
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan>                 printf("iteration %d\n", i);
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan>                 malloc(1000 * 1000);
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan>                 _sleep(10);
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan>         }
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> }
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just put the static linked function into a module?
09:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but now i somehow managed to get it to work without -rdynamic and it still wont work
09:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats a module?
09:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a cpp namespace
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> c++20 feature
09:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sry i meant namespace
09:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea then i would only need 1 #if #else that could work
09:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so toggle namespace name instead of function name
09:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can i `extern "C"` namespaces? xd
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also put it into a struct
09:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess i can also make the entry point hot manually
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a struct is kinda a namespace too
09:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> structs have no methods
09:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in C
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh
09:04 < bridge> <Ewan> namespace doesn't exist in C
09:04 < bridge> <Ewan> wat
09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why u even want a extern c for a static linked function?
09:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea but i like the idea jopsti
09:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well because the same function that is statically linked is also dynamically linked
09:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it feels like a normal code base where everything is like always
09:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but if you recompile it hot reloads the parts it should hot reload
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes that's why namespaces
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u can do `use namspace chiller`
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u can do `use namespace chiller`
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it looks like before
09:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i will give it a try
09:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds good
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> totally not hacky instead of redesigning your app xDDD
09:06 < bridge> <Ewan> my userspace memory leak program is making all my other apps close
09:06 < bridge> <Ewan> runtime errors
09:06 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
09:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is a bit hacky im sure there is a non hacky way too
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> black screen
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
09:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i take the first way that works flawlessly and has good developer expirience
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply don't use/overload global functions in first place
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> flawless resource allocator
09:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then it would be annoying to maintain jopsti
09:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i want it to just work
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do you think i did for my mod system?
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's a design issue not a maintain issue xd
09:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what im building is not really a mod system
09:08 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just a hot reload for one specific thing xd
09:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if its not compiled in the server statically i depend on external objects at runtime
09:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i don't like tha
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont understand tho why the name of the mod function cannot be `mod_function_name`
09:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it can
09:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then it will be the same on the server side too
09:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unless i #ifdef it
09:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for EVERY function i write
09:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or not depend on ccollision somehow xd
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i no get ur problem dude xD
09:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or not have a real tw server somehow xd
09:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> time to rewrite my nvim config for the 2048 time this month!
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you overload functions of ccollision?
09:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono
09:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just pass it into my shared object
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok u pass collision object into the mod
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the function that takes this object is called `my_mod_tick`
09:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i have ./DDNet-Server who calls ./libtwbl_bottick.so in CCharacter::OnTick to ask the shared object for player inputs
09:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye `Twbl_SampleTick(GameServer()->Collision())` 
09:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it can call to GetTile() and see the map
09:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and now where is the name collision?
09:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but to use the pointer correctly it needs to also link against collision.cpp
09:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the name collision is that sample_bot.cpp is also directly in the server code base
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok it links against collision.cpp & .h
09:13 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so if i `rm ./libtwbl_bottick.so` it should still work
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, they link against the same static lib, which contains collision.cpp and .h
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> continue
09:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where is ur problem xd
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sample_bot, why do u even need it?
09:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a test
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply never call the mod code if no .so was found
09:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono
09:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the .so is only for rare prod updates during runtime and mostly for developer expirience
09:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i want it to not rely on external objects or dlopen() to work
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes understandable, ok
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but to be clear. u have exactly one entry point?
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `mod_tick`
09:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you are really interested i can record you some clips to explain it x
09:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep one entry point
09:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i would have to rename all methods it calls for them to be hot
09:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> afk for a sec
09:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok let me ask differently
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whereever the function name collision is:
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that the function u want to modify for hot reload, and is it: 1. not `mod_tick` and 2. already exists on the executable?
09:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye that func i wanna edit and its one entry point
09:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it calls other functions that i also want to be hot
09:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gimme some minutes ima try to craft a video blog
09:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should i be honest with you?
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. i strongly recommend against what u try. 2. IF u still want to try it like that: cast the original ccollision object to a ccollision object of your mod and never reuse the ccollision stuff from the binary.. so basically have a second ccollision class that is bianry compatible
09:23 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
09:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
09:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then i need to maintain a matching definition of ccollision if i fail to keep it binary compatible i get nasty to debug errors
09:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and its not portable
09:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the idea of this bot lib is that i develop it once and then can yoink it into every mod 
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes but wtf do u expect lmao
09:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thinkt your suggestion with namespaces might work xd
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then don't ever pass the ccollision object in first place
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that alone is already shady af
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> poor chiller
09:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but how does the bot see the map then?
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then u want to be binary compatible
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> give the mod some functions `checktile` explicitly
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and not the ccolision object
09:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then it also needs the map data
09:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you want me to mem copy the entire map on every tick?
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well that is obviously also too hacky xD
09:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mostly expensive
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway thats a different problem
09:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but ye also hacky
09:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant pass checktile without map data
09:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean i made it all work together 
09:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but that was a server that no clients can connect to xd
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u ask me.. whatever u will try with your version will be super annoying to maintain
09:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats also a somewhat crucial feature
09:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> will it?
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
09:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the idea is that it just works
09:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there should be zero maintenance cost
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can pass a "new" checktile function
09:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u just pass in a pointer to collision it picks up the definition from your code and just works
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> checktile_mod
09:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok sure
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is used on host and mod side
09:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how does its implementation look like?
09:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where does it get the map data from?
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well u need to create functions for those too
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> get_width
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> get_height
09:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> get tile
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> access_tile
09:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how does access tile look like?
09:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> get_bot
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it gets an index and returns smth
09:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it would also depend on ccollision? no?
09:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> returns from where
09:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where is the map data
09:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> get_ram
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the map data stays on the host
09:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how does the mod access the host map data?
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depending on what u need u'll have getters for it
09:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on the host?
09:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do i pass those getters into the mod?
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the host makes it visible for the guest
09:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how is that different from ccollision?
09:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats exactly that
09:31 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its getters for the map data
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it sounded like previously u wanted a function to be called that exist on the host and guest, but on the guest it is modified
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye but the guest does not modify collision
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only bottick
09:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which calls collision get tile
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok but why do you need to rely on the host's functions here then anywhere?
09:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because only the host has the map data
09:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the shared object did not load the map file
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i meant it like that:
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `mod_tick` calls `mod_func`
09:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
09:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> [2024-05-25T09:33:28+02:00 ERROR util] crates\settings\src\settings_store.rs:619: invalid type: string "true", expected a boolean
09:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
09:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and `mod_func` is modified, tright?
09:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but mod_func wont be hot
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and `mod_func` is used on the host and guest?
09:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so what u want is, to not export that symbol?
09:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont think so
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the guest only knows about `mod_func` of its own
09:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and host still uses its own version
09:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> server also knows it
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u want to binary patch the host or what
09:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it makes no sense what u want xD
09:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg let me record the video xd
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> a image is worth a thousand codes
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> show a video of a debugger where it jumps into the host instead of mod code
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hate only being able to eat liquid-like food
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u can answer your question yourself
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want meat
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs exactly that symbol is not allowed to be exported
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller just boot discord and come in voice

12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> np
12:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i read that 5 times and I still dont get xd
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you really _want_ to understand it? xd
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's ok to not know every detail
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah u writing a compiler?
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there was smth
12:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was streaming it 😏
12:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i want to know if i use just imul will it be fucked up in some scenarios
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru got an email 😄
12:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ok, maybe addition and subtraction is enough :justatest:
12:55 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> can' reproduce either.  e.g. ` clang++ -std=c++20 -flto=thin main.cpp sqlite.cpp -lsqlite3 -o bla` works ^^ (random example)
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> I'm extremely surprised this insanity works at all. Why are statically linked symbols of your binary ever getting overriden by just a dlopen?
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> is this some bizarre secret ELF feature that I've missed out on somehow?
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> How deeply do you need to understand it? Do you doubt it's correctness? Do you need to know why it's faster? Or do you want to know why register flexibility is good for performance?
13:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i guess ill just use `imul` and if it eventually breaks it will be the time to learn how that stuff actually works
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> If you only need the lower half of the result, it won't ever break
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> Here an imul is used because you are assigning the result into a `uint64_t` discarding the higher 64 bits
13:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to not discard the higher 64 bits?
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> e.g.
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1243886824888209468/image.png?ex=66531b61&is=6651c9e1&hm=c46ef2307aa545d39d5530c975b8fce8e61d4b502420dbeeb6636f073e34bbcc&
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> See how gcc was forced to use mul there?
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> Because imul just wouldn't be correct anymore, since we are using the top 64 bits of the result too (which is inside rdx)
13:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hm...
13:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1243889392347648040/image.png?ex=66531dc5&is=6651cc45&hm=4a26ca69d97a4638d790095149fb64a364f8d3b3bb81b94d7c08ac570b0c6edb&
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> Use O1, this is an implementation detail, since imul is so much more efficient than mul, compilers will usually emit imuls which get optimized down to mul
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> (There is a way to use multiple imuls to do an unsigned full length multiply properly)
13:52 < bridge> <learath2> (though the generated assembly is very insane now that I look at it 😄 so I can understand why it might create some confusion as to why that works)
13:56 < bridge> <learath2> it's not using the trick I thought it was at all, that is an absurd way to calculate that

14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> green = tested?
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> testing is not just using xd
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah cool
14:47 < bridge> <egyt> all of us should free ourselves from non-free software
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> use gentoo

14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:47 < bridge> <egyt> That's not a Minecraft skin, that's a VoxeLibre one
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> why voxellibre doesnt use AGPLv3 but GPLv3
14:48 < bridge> <egyt> I should find a better profile picture though, it's even on my todo list
14:48 < bridge> <egyt> so you could ask
14:49 < bridge> <egyt> also, Trisquel is not a noname distribution of GNU/Linux, it's used by Richard Matthew Stallman himself
14:50 < bridge> <egyt> and, of course, it is endorsed by FSF
14:50 < bridge> <chairn> lol, swap is bigger than / disk
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> as far as i know GPL is only about the code, not recordings of it
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he is right
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> eu laws FORCE you to not give up on copyright
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @egyt for assets i recommend using some CC license
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0BSD is the freeest license
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u have a blog
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> stallman recommends a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

14:56 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> srsly
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:56 < bridge> <egyt> I hate ND with all my soul
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> why so, one thing is about what u write, not docs, etc
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ND is useful for blog/opinions
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can make u look like u said some stuff u didnt
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> wish i remember his article about it
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> uses this license too
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki if ddnet would be AGPL, it would mean ddnet could not have a closed source anti bot system btw
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> fine by me it would also mean kog wouldnt exist
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow xd
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:58 < bridge> <egyt> I believe that to spread the opinion, you need to allow to translate it into different languages, and ND doesn't allow that
15:00 < bridge> <louis> just use google translate
15:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> fair point, but i guess u can add a point with ur email to give permission to translators
15:02 < bridge> <egyt> I would rather use LibreTranslate
15:03 < bridge> <egyt> ND is still cringe in my opinion, because it doesn't allow to make the work a part of another work, like a video
15:04 < bridge> <egyt> ND is still cringe in my opinion, because it doesn't allow to make the work a part of another work, like a video (not talking about remixing, mind you)
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> im only saying use it for a opinion/blog page
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but to each their own
15:05 < bridge> <egyt> That's why I prefer CC0 for most of my "works", so it won't create any copyright trouble
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc, freest freedom is the real freedom

15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> approved open source license
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> but these licenses are never true public domain btw
15:09 < bridge> <egyt> I respect those people who put their stuff under permissive or copyleft licenses (you know, they already made it available for free use, asking even more freedom from them would be kinda shameless), but I prefer PD-like ones, because I don't really want to become a copyright troll
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just 
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > CC0 helps solve this problem by giving creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law.
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> to the extend allowed by law
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> how is it trolling? xD the copyleft ones give rights to end users, they make use of copyright against what it was made for, limiting users rights on X software
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> *stupid law 😬
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but permissive licenses are more dev friendly
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> harder to fuck up
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw most ppl use MIT because they think their project will be used by big corpo name Y and become famous, the truth is they wont and even its used they will get nothing
15:11 < bridge> <egyt> You probably never heard of this concept, did you?
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> giving rights to end users is the best
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know what patent trolling is
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ur not a gpl enjoyer
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sad
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true, many ppl probably think like that... or they simply don't care...
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or they use permissive licenses at work and are happy to not code everything from scratch
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are so many reasons
15:13 < bridge> <egyt> Yeah, wanted to say that right after the Trisquel joke
15:13 < bridge> <louis> its cuz cool university name
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u also a self host enjoyer? https://git.edgarluque.com/explore/repos
15:13 < bridge> <lukron55> is it possible to tunnel a server hosted on my pi through cloudfare?
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs not
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u are rich
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything is possible
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
15:15 < bridge> <lukron55> shame. will just use a vpn on omv
15:18 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> Copyright and utilization rights should be kept apart (which is what the english term ›copyright‹ does not express properly)
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki let's imagine one of your AGPL projects would suddenly get huge interest and u could make big money with it, if u relicense it. otherwise u get nothing. what would you do?
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to bait you obviously
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> This is easy to prove true, so there is no need to change your mind 😄
15:26 < bridge> <egyt> I **look** for CC0 music for my project, not listen to it 24/7
15:26 < bridge> <egyt> Won't close my ears just because there is a radio with a copyrighted song

15:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> veri pog melon
15:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now delete windows
15:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hyporcrite moment

15:28 < bridge> <egyt> (That's a victory)
15:29 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke good nite #developers
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gud knight
15:31 < bridge> <learath2> Why is dragon sleeping at 1530? curious
15:31 < bridge> <egyt> Will tell what the project is when I'll find something at least for a trailer. Also I'll be thankful if you could tell me where to search for CC0 music or even recommend artists ||(I already know about Holizna, and I have listened to every of his albums, except for "Space - Sleep - Meditation", and also I know about FreeMusicArchive)||
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rich as he is, he lives in bali rn
15:32 < bridge> <egyt> Achieved success by being a Free Software developer 👀
15:34 < bridge> <learath2> I have this conspiracy theory that he is secretly selling bots
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> +
17:20 < bridge> <egyt> I thought I foreshadowed myself with translating "demo" as "replay", but it seems like I've rather gaslighted myself, which is even worse. In any case, I passed the 66.(6)% mark. Will report on the amount of translated strings later, I hope. And, to clarify again, I'm doing the translation from scratch, not imrpoving the existing one, so don't be surprised when you will see the only author being me.

17:23 < bridge> <egyt> Well, okay then, not really against this
17:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> keeping history is important in open source projects - thats the joy of contributing in the first place! :P

17:25 < bridge> <egyt> I remembered another reason why I don't like copyleft: if game includes copylefted assets, you will have to make the video available under that copyleft license. And that's the best case scenario, because SuperTuxKart has assets under **GPL**, which means you have to open-source video as well, if I understand it correctly

17:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> GPL means that if you fork or modify it, you have to publish those modifications - discussing, reviewing and/or recording it shouldnt propose an issue IIRC
17:28 < bridge> <patiga> while I'm not sure about this claim, only a mega tiny minority of the internet cares about copyright in videos. note that nearly all games are closed source, and everyone uploads videos of them
17:28 < bridge> <egyt> Including GPL into something makes it GPL too. Not the case for LGPL, though
17:28 < bridge> <egyt> I want to care about copyright, but it's too hard :^(

17:30 < bridge> <egyt> May I at least add something like `EGYT - total overhaul`? 🥺
17:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> i am not allowed to decide that, stating that you modified it 100% within the sourcecode itself seems braggy :P - if you include it in your  commit message in github tho, `git blame` will show that you modified everything
17:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> "total overhaul of translatedfile.txt" as a commit-message for example
17:32 < bridge> <egyt> It probably won't, because there is not too many ways to translate the "Play" button in the main menu, for example
17:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> well then it'll be a total overhaul with only 98% diff, my point still stands :P
17:35 < bridge> <egyt> One string can be translated the same way in two different translations, I mean
17:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> thats a thing for a lot of languages, espacially slavic languages
18:00 < bridge> <rafael8192> Hi Guys
18:00 < bridge> <rafael8192> Can u help me pls with compile?

19:15 < bridge> <godly13> Very need for people like me and turks
19:15 < bridge> <godly13> Im from Ukraine but im live in turkey and i have a lot of problems with ping (85-120 ping all servers)
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> I'll try to find a new hoster for TUR
19:36 < bridge> <godly13> Thx
19:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> What are the chances that Turkish players will ddos it on the first day
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like for all ddnet servers
