00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @heinrich5991 its just that ur screen shakes a lot if ur on a door
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uh really? that shouldn't happen™
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> know a map with an early door?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 4four? (brutal)
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> doubt it can get any earlier xd
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> eventually Caventure IV (dummy) in 2nd part
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> if you prefer doors to be vertical
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with antiping
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it shakes a lot
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its always been like that
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw, would it be possible to display ninja without the sword & particles when someone is in deep and not actually having ninja?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or just in freeze
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or even better, a frozen tee? ^^
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that'd be best, yea
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but there's no way to create overlay on regular tee, right?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> at least so far
03:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I have 47 files named ddnet-info.json.XXXX.tmp in my cfgdirectory. Is not there something wrong with cleaning them up ?
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I have 47 files named ddnet-info.json.XXXX.tmp in my cfgdirectory. Can they be automatically cleaned up by the game or this is my side problem ?
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> most of them (~80%) has size of 0 bytes
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Ok, making it look good will be harder than I thought xD

03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> different scaling for feets kills it too
05:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763235064154554368/unknown.png
05:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> china github experience
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Soreu if we use the full feet/body etc. space?
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or atleast alot
05:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also, if some body parts arent inside, looks good too, imo 😄
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @BannZay just sort by type and delete them, they might be created while debugging or smth, normally they are removed, if the download fails
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> can ddnet-saves.txt remove entry on /load
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay they should be auto-cleared up now, but the old ones you have to delete
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> someone just sent me a demo and i dont have the map
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it wont play and it says map not found
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that a bug
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, the Ultranova demo?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The map was included in in the demo, so it should be downloaded and loaded
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im using ddnet 10.6.2
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tried after removing the map everywhere
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait ill try newer client
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, then it's probably fixed years ago 😄
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ah
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it works with 13.x nvm
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 😅
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby nobo, 13.x is not a newer client 👺
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its newer than what i usually play with
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u dont play with latest
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs macos
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i get better fps with 10.x
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763301093383208980/oBQWZR7.png
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found noby
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> i thought they fixed it with the gfx_highdpi
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that fixed like
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 90% of it
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby tell us where its slower
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk the
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> 10% more fps
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> client
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> xd
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man pinging noby is a hassle, there are like 3 nobys in this server
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> kick the fake nobies
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> f3 kick @noby
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> we debugged and bisected and figured that the highdpi was the main reason that new ddnet was so laggy for me
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and now new ddnet is playable
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i still get higher fps with old for some reason
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> we can redo the bisecting stuff and try to figure out the last little bits that cause fps to decrease
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's kind of expected I think, new renderer is a bit a slower, but usually people don't need 1100 fps intead of 1000 fps
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i figured its not worth it and easier to just play on old client
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well new renderer with opengl i think its faster
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have 500-700 on 10.x, and 300-500 on new ddnet
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it doesnt lag when u zoom
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> zooz
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> when zooming out yes
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont zooz
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> why do you need 700 fps
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> new renderer since the trilinear filtering?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk old ddnet just feels smoother to me
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> 700 hz monitor :justatest:
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no and
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur brain is smooth 😉
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> having higher fps than ur refresh rate is still noticeable
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im pretty sure my monitor is only 60hz but
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can clearly feel the difference between 60 and 300 fps
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> increases the chances that a new frame will be drawn everytime it refreshes for one
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and also affects input delay i think
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u play on 300fps?
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, that's a larger difference than I epxected
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no i play with 500-700
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on ddnet 10
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763302198498426890/Screen_Shot_2020-10-07_at_2.30.19_AM.png

09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that integrated
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wow u have qulity textures off
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk probably
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and ye is that bad?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well its like u play at half resolution
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i play fng
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont need high quality textures
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u can better turn it on and half ur resolution
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that gives more fps
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o_0
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if i make res smaller then it will make the window tiny lol
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i get it
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i play liek this
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763302689743306772/Screen_Shot_2020-10-07_at_2.32.08_AM.png
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> macbar true noby experiencfe
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just sell that mac to some apple fanboy and buy a new pc xd
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> macos really powerfull pc :poggers:
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but its teeworlds
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it shouldnt need a powerful pc
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its ddnet
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe on windows/linux u get more fps
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its more pefect than teeworlds ;D
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet client > tw client ye
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Ryozuki windows sucks, no
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Ryozuki windows sucks, no u
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux then
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> linux good
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> linux then
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i doubt thats relevant
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux good mac bad
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u never know
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if ddnet 10.6.2 gives smooth fps
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then it clearly should work on mac
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ur mac driver sucks
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> even if it would work better on linux
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its irrelevant tho
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz newer versions use more modern stuff
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> shouldnt it support computers with older stuff? xd
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it tries to detect if u can support new stuff
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still strange that opengl 3.0 would remove performance in ddnet 15.0.5
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> new ddnet is certainly playable
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and its not a new problem as of 15.x
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then use 15.x
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👺
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive thought that 10.x gives better fps since a long time
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its fine
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> still 10.x is lighter on resources i think
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and higher fps
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if i never knew of 10.x and just downloded 15 i wouldnt even know and id say nothing
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> since its playable
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, there could be unlimited reasons for this, i believe you, maybe its something small, thats only huge on macos
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye thats why im not rushing to make an issue on github or complain about it here
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because i can just keep using 10.x, or 15.x if i need to, and its good enough lol
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but since someone asked, thats why i play with old client
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 14 and 15 are way better than 12 and the other versions that didnt have option for gfx_highdpi
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that was the main fix
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Jupstar ✪ what does "quality textures" do anyway?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it litterally halfs all texture quality
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait wut
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like width and height
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> when its disabled?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well whats wrong with that?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it looks like u play on half the resolution
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so nothing wrong, just ugly xd
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idc haha
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it looks fine for me
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still halving the resolution would make more sense xd, but obviously only in fullsccreen what u dont use anyway
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cus i wanna see other windows when im playing tw
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and halving resolution =tiny tees
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well but just to be clear, it won't improve performance with ugly textures
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just more ugly without any reason xd
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats the point of that option then
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its removed in newer version 😄
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> xd
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u know why the fps may be lower on newer version?
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u using 15.0.5 then no
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in 15.1 it might decrease by around 2%
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs we made the game look sharper for Full HD
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i 10.6.2
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> honestly idc how it looks
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i just want it to play smooth
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well normally the newer renderer will give better fps, bcs less CPU work
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how to activate newer renderer
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think i already posted my frame times once
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u have a good computer
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its always new renderer since 14.7
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> with thousands of fps on any setting
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ol
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont have a gpu
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the driver isnt optimized for newer opengl
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and tw is an old game and it should be smooth and playable on old computeres
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and tw is an old game and it should be smooth and playable on old computers
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but even a modern intel should outperform on new renderer
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but ddnet is modern and should target the 99% of player
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have 16gb ram and 6 core i7
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wouldnt say i have a bad computer either
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763306433470136350/screenshot_2020-08-14_15-32-56.png
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats my frame graph
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if i turn off framerate cap i get 2500 fps
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but my fans spin super hard so i dont
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u have less fps, but only bcs of throttling?
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> r u trolling dude xd
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no but
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc its less in newer versions
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i fixed the fps calculation
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think id be able to feel the difference between 480 fps and 600 fps
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nor would it affect the cpu usage (if anything, 480 should use less)
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use an external tool and messure without frame cap
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i need some cap
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> otherwise it feels like the laptop is dying lol
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i could cap it higher but
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok but dont do a CPU cap
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only gfx
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if 10.x already supports it
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> gfx_refresh_rate 0
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cl_refresh_rate 480
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do the opposite xD
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> works great for 10.6
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> works good for 15.x too but
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not fair to do that on newer clients
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait ill try it again xd
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i fixed the frame stability
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it a separate thread for gfx now or something
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gfx_refresh_rate 480
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cl_refresh_rate 0
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do dis
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> OK
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i added a new calculation that affects the direct computation when a new frame is rendered
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it feels just as smooth as my old client
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its closer to the cpu fps now
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so thats good
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean why should refresh rate of 480 give 600fps
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> makes no snese
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk lmao
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cus ddnet
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah the refresh_rate things on ddnet are shit
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its using a fuck ton of cpu
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> send help
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my fans spin
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs the main thread does basically everything, except it waits for the GPU
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its unstable to set the cl_refresh_rate
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> should i set both to 480
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u care if fans spin
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are made to spin
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well it will use all CPU power, thats the downside
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because its fking teeworlds
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can set it to 800
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it shouldnt make the fans spin
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should lower the impact
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o k lemme try
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_refresh_rate 800
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gfx_refresh_rate 0
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should be smooth enough
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby do u have a stock cpu fan? getting a good cpu fan makes the fan spin less
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its better at disipating
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he has a laptop
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice joke
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have a macbook
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> laptop
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> normie
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well laptops always spin
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no they dont
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so let it be
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can have 2 copies of ddnet 10.6 open with 0 fans spinning
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and both are smooth
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur smooth
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thx
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, play around with that settings, and u might get the 10.x feeling back
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which settings should i try besides the refresh rate
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i assume some stuff related to the opengl
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if ur cpu is new u can try opengl 3.3, which will also enable chat text buffering and stuff
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> will lead to better frame times
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> define new
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from 2011+
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well try it, if it wont work, it will tell u xd
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think any setting will *work*
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just comes down to which one gives best fps and lowest cpu usage
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (read: lowest fan spinning xd)
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah xd sounds good
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my pc uses 37 watt in teeworlds
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill mess with the settings abit before making more complaints
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with 1440 fps and 1 cpu core 100% all time
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do u measure watt usage?
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just have a meassure tool
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like plug ur pc into it
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like a kill a watt
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i messured idle
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and subtracted the tw watt
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it uses 37watt more
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to be precise
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's a lot
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk i just
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> run this laptop realllly hard with some of the scripts
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well its ok for 2k screen and 1440 fps xd
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't have anything to measure atm, but at idle my laptop used ~7 W and desktop ~15 W
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and id like tw to not work it more than it has to
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my idle is like 50w
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what energy saving motherboard u have wtf xD
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> deen hack
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hackerman
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my motherboard uses most in idle
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my GPU around 6watt
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cpu is probs off, or very low
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ram around 7-10w
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wish i had a gpu
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just don't have many components I think
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :X
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mac things
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lul
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i couldve got a desktop
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u get a desktop dont get a mac xd
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> build it urself
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think building it would be the most cost effective thing
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in usa hardware is soo cheap
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and then id just install linux on it
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arch linux yeah
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why arch
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> debian
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> debian or mint probably
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i use arch
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> debian with kde 😄
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also arch always has latest ddnet package
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> build urself
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with LTO and -o3
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arch aur automates the building
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u get 10% more performance
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u build it urself
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was gonna say that my custom build of ddnet gets lower fps
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have march stuff enabled iirc
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but then i remembered that its probably because of the custom code i added to it
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that wont do alot
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in makepkg config
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :justatest:
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :justatest:
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel and amd too similar xd
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or compilers not good enough
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ you can also add pgo if you want some more %
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i tried
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> pgo?
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only made my executable like 70% smaller
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> profile guided optimizations
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but no fps improvements xd
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> too bad
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but smaller exe also nice actually
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs removed alot of the dynamic library loads
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno what exectly it can do
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe somewhat relevant
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i had someone compile a client based on newest ddnet
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should i change O2 to O3
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763310857584115722/unknown.png
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or not worth
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it gave noticeably horrible fps
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for everyone
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its worth
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> any idea why
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ofast even more
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it will enable fast math
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt notice any bugs with it yet with gcc
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i had someone else compile cus i wanted windows binary
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and there was only a tiny code change that shouldnt have affected anything
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ how to enable that LTO thing
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> -flto
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> might need to be passed to linker too
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ I think we once noticed -Ofast bug during a tournament when a calculation was suddenly off slightly and the map didn't work 😄
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> w h at
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> -Ofast breaks things? xd
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so in ldflags and cxxflags
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby compiled without optimizations?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mmm
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/blob/my_compile/CMakeLists.txt
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can ask him
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think so
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> search for ofast
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably just followed the default procedure for windows compile
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what i tested
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> he said the exe was bigger than usual
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> generally, instead of playing with optimization flags, there is **so much** you can optimize in the code. run it with a profiler on a full server and start optimizing the hot spots
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to do that
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with the client
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> last time i profiled full server i noticed a good 25% of the cpu time was spent in a single function
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have lots of linear or quadratic code that could be logarithmic etc
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah opengl 3.3 also batches particles
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client always renders ALL
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen does the profiler make the server slower?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if u dont see them
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u can profile a full server
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and no that function wasnt my code surprisingly
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki depends on which one you use
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it was snapshot thing i think
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> woah
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it takes way more time to compile
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with o3 and lto
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just lto
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lto takes along time for linking
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm i got lot of warnings too
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i fixed one, just today 😄
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the other is bcs we use ints instead of size_t for everything
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hastebin.com/dazakacixi.typescript
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the warnings
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the odr is fixed 😄
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also the extra blank windows behind the main one
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wierd bug in new ddnet
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think i cheked all warnings, but they are all "ok"
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not in old
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3k fps
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more or less
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not important but
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> weird
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ the good value to cap is gfx right
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> before i had both to 1000
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it matter if this is a power of 2 or something
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the other iwll make ur input and frametimes worse
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763313721866321940/unknown.png
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using core 9
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice 12cores
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well u usually want a multiple of your monitors refresh rate
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got 144hz
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tf
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is this noticeable
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> vs 60
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too much
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant play tw with 60hz
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :pepe:
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive only ever had 60
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it feels super smooth
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rip
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smoother than ur brain
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> U
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can specially notice 144hz on games where u can reach those fps
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i would hope so
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ddnet is one of those
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how much does 144hz monitor cost xd
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they pretty cheap nowerdays
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like 150€ in germany
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so even cheaper in us xd
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 👀
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763314591761301504/unknown.png
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool tool
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `ytop`
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made in rust btw
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ryo rust shill
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i rarely use terminal programs xd
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to search waht shill means
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > someone who helps another person to persuade people to buy something, especially by pretending to be a satisfied customer
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not a pretender
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats what a shill would say
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :banhammer:
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im sure there are good reasons to use the language
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well the idea of rust is nice indeed
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its also a high lvl language compared to c
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ i bet u can do the same stuff
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is being added to linux kernel intree btw
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so ppl will make drivers in rust
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah im ok with it xd
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/hp2rpc/linux_kernel_intree_rust_support/
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its a bad name tho
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no u
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> evokes imagery of old abandoned waterdamaged metal parts
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more of a shiny new language
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the total opposite xd
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rust isnt shiny
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its brown
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its shiny in what it features
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean iron oxide
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im talking about the language
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i cant judge the language because ive never tried it lol
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yee, judge it by it's namesake instead
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> xd
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath is here
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> javascript
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the archenemy of systemd
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet they called it rust because it's compiler nags you almost as much as the rusty old ada compilers
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :lol:
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like compiler nagging to me
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i learn stuff
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u fight against it tho u will lose
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just make everything unsafe
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> problem solved
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4head
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ even unsafe code has guarantees in rust btw
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> once my code was so bad that it crashed the compiler
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does that count as winning
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so unsafe code is safer than C code
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby very common with arcane c++ template magic
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> aw
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I managed to overrun the stack with a recursive template
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It’s important to understand that unsafe doesn’t turn off the borrow checker or disable any other of Rust’s safety checks: if you use a reference in unsafe code, it will still be checked. The unsafe keyword only gives you access to these five features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory safety. You’ll still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block.
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> learath pro compiler hacke
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> learath pro compiler hacker
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like visiting ##c and reading people cite the standard like a bible
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only fun thing
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well there few things i dont like about c++ syntax, but i also dont know how i'd improve them xd
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ template stuff looks rly ugly
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, i think the opposite
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im bad at templates
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe abit ugly but i see why its useful
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially the new c++20 stuff
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> constraints
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh i havent seen
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well modules sound insanly nice tbh
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast if they'll work as i hope xd
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i tested them a bit with clang, but too lazy to test them in bigger projects
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ have u heard about https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur a gpu guy
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the web in the name is misleading tho
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The new c++20 concepts and the template shorthand it brings looks absolutely crisp
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Brings tears of joy to my eyes
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust traits look crispier
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `int foo(auto k, auto k)`
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well make the other argument not k 😄
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :what:
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if only rusts syntax in general didn't look like enchantment table language
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like rust syntax more than modern c++
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how is it different to webgl? @Ryozuki
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> WebGPU is an API that exposes the capabilities of GPU hardware for the Web. The API is designed from the ground up to efficiently map to the Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal native GPU APIs. WebGPU is not related to WebGL and does not explicitly target OpenGL ES.
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use it outside the web
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it doesnt target opengl es explicitly
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it targets dx vulkan metal
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and opengl
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well vulkan sounds good
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever I need to read Rust code I bring out my trusty book. "The Hieroglyphics of the Ancient Egypt" by Aiden Dodson
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most implementations have vulkan first rn
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everything can be emulated in vulkan
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u always come up with weird sentences
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amazing
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gta 5 runs better in linux than windows
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs of the vulkan transition xd
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkan the future
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ when ddnet in vulkan
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> soon ™️
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think someone got Dark Souls running better on linux too, without even vulkan
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet vulkan works better in windows too than opengl
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> actually almost all dx9 games run million times better
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i tested dungeon defenders and some stuff, works just better xD
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vulkan will only amplify our issues with the older toasters
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should rework the graphics so we can have a software backend to fall back to
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Render it the old school way on the CPU 😄
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can make a graphics interface and then implement it on different backends
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it how it is done?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That probably was the idea at the beginning(tm), but most of it has turned into an intertwined mess over the years
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah that would be the plan
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though on toasters, the CPU is also bad
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but multithreading is nice tho
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'd prepare all buffers and then batch stuff
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would even work with 4 core cpus already
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we'd need something akin to the opposite of what nvidia does to simulate the fixed pipeline in newer cards
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 werent u saying smth about a async loop long time ago
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I said many things about async loops, which one are we talking about? 😄
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember now xd
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does c++ have channels for syncronization?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not in the standard :monkalaugh:
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> std::async is already in std::future 😄
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/rusttype
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> freetype implemented natively in rust :poggers:
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> here is to hoping they didn't miss any of the 80 CVEs while re-implementing it
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well they are not implementing freetype
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are making a lib like it
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "RustType is a pure Rust alternative to libraries like FreeType."
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: Should we use harfbuzz to do the text shaping? It's very unlikely any of us would like to do arabic text shaping anytime soon
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> text shaping means how its placed?+
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yeah
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> text placing is a rly complicated stuff xd
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the case of arabic that depends on the previous couple characters and their modifiers
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yes, i think that's the only proper way
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://harfbuzz.github.io/ch03s03.html
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt sound hard
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't very hard, it's just a question of whether we want to link to another library
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, and we need fribidi (or our own implementation of bidi if we don't want to link to GPL code)
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i see harfbuzz
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think ICU has bidi, but that might be overkill
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ICU is massive, isn't it?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> yeah.. but you think there might be a way to strip the data since you only need the bidi part.
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> yeah.. but I think there might be a way to strip the data since you only need the bidi part.
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might aswell use fribidi if we don't mind LGPL
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> by now we have so many libraries, one more won't hurt 😄
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made a new repo github is already using the stupid main instead of master
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> back to master :monkalaugh:
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> imagine being as racist as ryozuki
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't bother trying to excuse yourself, I've already reported you to the authorities
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing: yeah im racist for using master :greenthing:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im BASED so i dont follow the virtue signaling trend
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All my databases are now using the follower leader scheme
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> leaders are oppresive too
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> shit
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best is git itself tells u this when u donth ave a upstream set `git push --set-upstream origin master`
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it creates a master branch
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so github just made more confusion
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i do `git push --mirror`
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already broke all my old motherboards, they all had IDE controllers
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and main gets deleted
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then* i do `git push --mirror`
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I guess I can name my databases original and clone
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clones have rights too
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for @Ryozuki its masterboard
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> primary secondary?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being called a clone is offensive too
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i consider myself original
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess it implies the secondary is secondary to the primary, which isn't really fair
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll have to call all the database servers "replicant" from now on, and I'll be ditching all hierarchical systems, it'll be all replication loops
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have created a monstrosity
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `find /mnt/usb -regextype posix-extended -regex '.*\.(jpg|png|doc|tiff|jpeg|docx|zip|rar|PNG|JPG|DOC|JPEG|mp3|webm|txt|pdf|pem|gif|GIF|key|pptx|ppt)' | sed -e 's#/mnt/usb/##' | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 printf "%q\0" | xargs -i{} -0 echo cp /mnt/usb/{} ./{} | bash -`
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at this mess
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I understand only the regex part, though no idea why you didn't write for example jpg, jpeg, JPG, JPEG next to each other. I guess that's for some optimization?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No I just noticed that there is no way to do case insensitive regex later
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 -iregex
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and find has -print0
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could print0, but then I couldn't easily manipulate it with sed
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sed -z
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> honestly I'm not sure what you're doing there. Copying files from /mnt/usb/ to current dir?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why not just find -exec?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Copying files of interest from /mnt/usb/ preserving the directory structure
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> rsync is much better for that I think
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't exec because these harddisks are from an era when I used windows and was liberal with shitty file/folder names. Like single quotes, double quotes, spaces, double spaces
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just don't know how exec behaves honestly
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the bash - is also for the same reason, I wanted to first print out wtf I was goign to execute 😄
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I looked at rsyncs man page, couldn't really figure out what combination of flags did what I wanted, so I just went to town with a longpipe 😛
16:34 <+ChillerDragonTL> Pls no GPL deen
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fd > find
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chiller is corporate shill confirmed
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all hail GPL
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AGPL better tho
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> BSD
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boo
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> BSD and MIT are not infectuous, so Ryozuki doesn't like them. He wants everyone to think like him
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stallman o/ \o \o \o
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you have a stallman shrine somewhere in your home?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would love too
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jPmnDZ6ab8
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i watch this everyday
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I forgot how slow spinning rust is 😛
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 by spinning u mean compiling?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hard drives
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh uh
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use a m2 ssd :monkalaugh:
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I use ssds everywhere too, which is why I forgot how slow drives with actual spinning platters were 😛
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a hdd too
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to save my anime
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and anime-related stuff :justatest:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are hdd better for long term storage?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc they had around the same expected lifespan nowadays, but didn't look it up in a while
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a bitlocker drive, for which I don't remember the key. It'll forever be a mystery what I was storing on there
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only long term storage device that has ever failed for me was my only ssd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well n=1 is hardly evidence of anything 😄
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I know, only anecdotes)
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just wanted to share my story ^^
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dot so sidetracked, I was supposed to clean up my desk and study
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> instead I'm looking at old pictures
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > iirc they had around the same expected lifespan nowadays, but didn't look it up in a while
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also recently had sth like that happen again
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> made the effort to add the same backup key to every piece of encrypted hdd I have
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and store it somewhere safe
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you should do that too 😉
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is veeery old stuff, I probably had a recovery key on a usb at some point.
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I mean print out
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the same everywhere
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you know where you have to look even 10 years down the road
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's so old that I probably even found that usb, looked at the key and said "Oh, I'm never finding this drive again anyway" and formatted it 😄
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do something similar now, but I have a different recovery key to each drive
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, just make sure you have it in a place where you'll find it
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😉
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> preferably, also after some memory loss
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/792/
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this xkcd lmao
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the end is the best
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found a usb drive with an EFI partition, thought it was a windows install usb or sth, it only has game of thrones S08E03 on it
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really keep the oddest storage devices
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only have a usb and it contains arch linux
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I seem to have a truecrypt volume hidden inside my bitlocker volume
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have no recollection of what events led to this 😛
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turns out I only had old photos on the bitlocker drive, why I'd put them in an encrypted drive, who knows
17:53 <+ChillerDragonTL> Share the pics pls 
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> depends on the type of pics :justatest:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's mostly family pics so I'd rather not share 😛
17:54 <+ChillerDragonTL> It’s hentai confirmed
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :monkalaugh:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See that's where you are wrong, I would share hentai
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> he's not Ryo though
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> wait what
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean not here obviously
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was really expecting to find some good old 144p porn downloaded over dialup

18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #developer is profitable today
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> making emotes should un-afk the tee (I just spammed emotes and it showed the ZZZ-afk emote on me
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> making emotes should un-afk the tee (I just spammed emotes and it showed the ZZZ-afk emote on me)
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i think you can also send messages while "afk" (if you use f1 and the say cmd)
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, only inputs count as non-afk
19:46 <+ChillerDragonTL> I think saavik has a point emotes are a sign of being active 
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> messages too, someone should create an issue for it and it should be fixed
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i think you can also send messages while "afk" (if you use f1 and the say cmd)
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> edit: i wanted to say, that if you change the emote thing, you should change messages, too
20:17 <+Learath2> can browsers thirst for memory ever be quenched?
20:19 <+Learath2> Upon launch it claims a nice 30G chunk of virtual memory, what does it even map into there?
20:20 <+Learath2> firefox that is
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the question is, how much RAM do u have 128gb?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah i never understood why their so hungry, but better trade than removing performance xd
20:24 <+Learath2> 32G
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf xD
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean aslong its unused
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 30g sounds unhealthy xd
20:25 <+Learath2> Yeah, it doesn't use it atleast
20:25 <+Learath2> chromium is also great at this, 15G of virtual memory claimed instantly on launch
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in which way is bad to claim virtual memory?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not, but why would it even think about having such a address space
20:27 <+Learath2> I'm more curious why they are claiming it, as far as I know it doesn't cost anything to map more of it when you need it, atleast not on any platform I can think of
20:28 <+Learath2> They don't seem to be mapping files into those massive address spaces either
20:30 <+Learath2> You know what has a massive virtual memory mapping? ASan, on 64bit it requires a whopping 20tb of virtual memory
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imagine a bug that will try allocating so much, good swapping xd
20:33 <+Learath2> If the kernel wasn't any smarter it would actually try to give out those pages :P
20:33 <+Learath2> ASan really relies on the OS only pretending to give out pages
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be funny to go home from ur work and the next day ur 20tb hdd is just gone
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> are walljumps ever gonna be fixed?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No, since all ranks on walljump maps are not as hard as they were i guess.
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats not a valid reason tho.
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if a fix would make something harder then it shouldnt be fixed
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> there are a lot of maps wich use this feature
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> what fixed
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> it sometimes gives later
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> its kinda random
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you dont get it if you are moving upwards
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> not random
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you think he doesnt know that
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol i didnt know that
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im disappointed
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> same xd
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> but why is that a thing?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <I.K.U> it makes no sense
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if you would get dj by just being at the wall there would be no skill needed
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you still have to move off the wall
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> use jump refill for that
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cuz ddnet tile physics suck
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> with jump refill you dont have to move off the wall
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you do
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but you dont need to touch the wall
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait if u have a 10x10 area of jump refills and ur in the middle do u have inf jumps or no
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i think you have to leave a jump refill tile first
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ironicly in that scenario only a non-jump refill tile refills your jump
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> time to make map full of jump-refills where u need to touch non-jump-refill :greenthing:
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i always dream of making a map with unnecessary complicated ways to make simple gameplay
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> tlike everywhere deepfreeze with undeep next to it for no reason
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> more tiles there are = more harder it looks
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> more tiles there are = harder it looks
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uhm are you sure wall jumps are inconsitent?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are a badly designed mechanic but if you enter them correctly, they should give you a jump always
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea i think its consistent just very wonky
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ that
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> #3034 is there actual afk emote?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3034
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just use ZZZ for it I think
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :zzzz:
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that makes sense then
