01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> which one is the file with ingame commands?
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> such as /rank /teamrank /top5 /teamtop5
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> and so on
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lagar85> u mean this? https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> The chat commands
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> But in the source files
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Of GitHub
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lagar85> oh ok, that has more sense in this channel xD
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lagar85> idk then :/
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddracechat.h and ddracechat.cpp, aswell as gamecontext.h
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> last one , yes ty
04:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> are pull requests accepted by the DDnet team?
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> any idea where gamecontest.h is included throughout the fileS?
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not the last one, it's all 3 btw. The commands callbacks are declared in gamecontext.h, they are implemented in ddracechat.cpp and the commands are registered in ddracechat.h
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is included all over the place, it's the core of the game side of the server
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> I'm interested in the engine of "ConTeamRank
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> I'm interested in the engine of  "ConTeamRank"
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> or the teaamtop5 command
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> most of the magic for those happen in src/game/server/score.cpp
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> I suggested this in the KOG discord, but it should have been here
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> New command for /cmdlist
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> 
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Problem: All /teamrank's are stored in a database regardless of the fact that one player might have one or more scores from the past. Such scores are possible to retrive using a bruteforce aproach. "/teamtop5 i " where i is a number between 1 and the total amount of rank teams scores in said map, to know the max u must do it manually by givin it large numbers and scaling down until you find it. 
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> 
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> For player X to know all of his /teamrank from a specific map he must do it manually so, teamtop5 [1,n+5] until the limit of the 'array'. if the map has 2000 teamscores he must do said comand 2000/5 times.
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> [01:09]
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Proposal: 
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Add a command such as /teamrankall (username) for a user to be able to check all of the scores for said username
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> [01:10]
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> An improvement to /teamrank "username" would be for the increment of more inputs, give it 2 usernames or more and retrive, if there is, the score of said team
04:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds interesting, you should probably create an issue for it before implementing anything so we can all have a bit of input to figure out the most ergonomic user experience
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would definitely be open to a pr that implements a fix to this annoyance
04:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> before all that, I need to reverse engineer the whole sourcecode
04:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> I mean, understanding how teamtop5 is retrived or even teamrank, its most likely all i need, a shortcut if u will, ofc the code won't be efficient
04:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> also the vote for pause or spec a player doesn't do a thing
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> CTRL+SHIFT+D could have a better UI, it's terrible the way it pops up, adding in the setting tab some preferences on what to see and 'where to' see it its quite beneficial.

11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Someone created a milestone, so I guessed I shouldn't release a new version until these are all in: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/milestone/7
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ get to work :monkalaugh:
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most are waiting for new SDL version xD
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #4154 can be removed i guess
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4154
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and someone has to review and merge #4166
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4166
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki your work xd
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nuborn reviewed it already anyway xd

12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah we ended up using a completly different fix anyway
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> libpng gets 1 year soon
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the pr xd
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i click the alst commit in
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3407
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it redirects me to an issue link (404)
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf

13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it redirects me to an issue link (404)
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok happens everywhere xd
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> exactly 1 year ago

13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen if i ever made a better player/ranks viewer would you allow me to connect to the mysqldb via a remote user that only has read only perms?

14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and its bcs of that commit?=
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The error message comes from wayland-scanner, so I guess
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it looks like this commit just changes the order not really any content
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh is that the CMake build?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, ./configure and make
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> strange that this commit causes it, looks like its really just swapping the order
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, maybe not the commit, but it's a wayland error
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe cmake is safer
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since it tells you what packages are missing
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know how to cross-compile with cmake
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I can try
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just use the toolchains we use in ddnet too
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast for windows they work fine
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, figured it out. the wayland-scanner version is so old that it has to be used with < and > instead of params
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe I have to upgrade debian
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sry for trouble xd
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no trouble
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you see https://frame.work ? I might get one if they make ryzen versions
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want arm laptop that is good 😄
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its not empty after 1h use xd
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well the m1 macs are as good as it gets for now, they will get a new gen soon iirc and intel was also scheduled to come out with a hybrid core architecture. So soon we'll have alternatives
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, m1 is nice
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just needs a different brand to ship them 😄
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i dont mean the processor itself
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like an asus laptop just with apples m1
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't think anyone has arm processors strong enough yet and I highly doubt apple wants to sell their ticket to profits for years
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sadly
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @nuborn if #4108 gets merged, do you also want to try to implement the predicitions for that for the next release?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Else it's not that useful is it?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4108
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @Jupstar ✪ yeah, predictions would be a separate pr
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, i dunno how long it takes, thats why i asked if you want to try it for the next release
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> 👀
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I might have something for that this weekend, but if you want to do a release soon I'm also ok with waiting for the next one
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah hard to say when we'll release, but no hurry 😄
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ok^^ either way I think it would perhaps be a good idea to get the extended netobject and prediction in the same release, yes
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> In worst case i'll remove it from milestone, so no hurry 😄
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice to get the protocol extension and it's use in the same patch so we can test and see if the extension is enough or if we want more
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's still impossible to extend further after we have a release without some very ugly workarounds
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats true
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u talking about switch pred?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yeah. I first thought having two different prs would be the cleanest, but I suppose i could just add it to the pr
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> for projectiles/pickups and other things that require the extra extended netobject (switch number, etc)
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can make it a new pr and base it off of the other one if you want
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yeah, I can do that, so it can be tested before the protocol change is merged
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but in worst case rename extension to @v2 and then older clients arent supported anymore xdd
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ew 😛
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> is there any difference between this and normal modern laptop? both have soldered CPU, integrated and nonstandard battery, no board schematics available, proprietary firmware
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> RAM modules, SSDs and WiFi module are still more or less replaceable today
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well they committed to providing board schematics to interested repair shops, they gave out cad files for the chassis so you can print it. At this form factor all their competitors are almost completely integrated
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Microsoft surface comes with glued on chassis. Apple solders their ssds. Dell comes with soldered ram
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> raspberry > propietary hardware laptop
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> true, it's slowly getting worse and worse
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With this one each module is changable, you just don’t get to change the cpu and mainboard
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol that sucks
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> changing the cpu is what i would want most
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially in a laptop
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ideapad rulz
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im anti laptop anyway
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont use any
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cmon, it’s better than anything out there, except for a couple clevo mainboards using downclocked desktop cpus to let you replace them
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’d guess you don’t travel 😛
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ryositter
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont travel outside catalonia
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true laptops suck, but my room sucks too, so its a compromise xd
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i don't travel outside russia too :kek:
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but russia is large af
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe lol nobo
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never went into spain
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im from "spain"
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i refuse to visit this filthy country kek
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I appreciate any move towards a more repairable future. My thinkpad is fairly user serviceable but you need a fair bit of experience messing around with it as there are dozens of screws to get to most things. I like that they made it much easier
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want this for phones
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my battery is slowly dieing
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and fairphone hardware is soo dated
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only trust this https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/systems/?set_language=da
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The day samsung killed replacable batteries was so sad
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> F
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ryf.fsf.org/
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this i mean
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They killed the damn headphone jack to help the bluetooth headphone industry too
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is there any button nokia user?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then they lied about both saying it was for “water resistance”
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aight ima drop the laptop into water
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The S5 had an ip67 rating, with a user replaceable battery and a headphone jack
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah idk why they removed those
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> were so cool
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One word: Capitalism
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s more profitable for the shareholders if you have to throw away your flagship phone after 2 years of use because it’s battery won’t last anymore
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s more profitable for the shareholders if you have to throw away your flagship phone after 2 years of use because its/ battery won’t last anymore
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> apple offers battery replacement, and its not that expensive
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As if anyone is okay with 3-5 business days for a battery replacement
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/888823344718295060/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_18.26.05.png
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are lucky to live near an apple store, you can get it replaced within the day though
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Just use a cheap ass phone in the meanwhile
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So let me get this straight, I pay 90$ out of pocket for a 20$ battery, find another phone to use for 3-5 business days, for something that might not even fix the issues I'm having
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds extremely consumer friendly, if only there was a way for the consumer to just replace the battery themselves. Something like a, uhm what were they called "removable back cover"?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The best part about these battery replacement programs is that the only reason they exist was because apple got caught slowing down older iphones for the consumers "safety"
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Is this the moment you’re realizing we’re living in capitalism?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple offering battery replacements after being threatened by a class action lawsuit is not some redeeming moment for them is my point
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> It is how it is
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn’t have to be 😛
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Alot of things don’t have to be how they are
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> But they are how they are
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Am I not right?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Are you a demotivation trainer? XD
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> im from japan
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> owo
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can simultaneously hold both views you know
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Things are how they are, doesn’t imply we can’t change anything
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I do have multiple views
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You just need to find the balance
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Or you’ll drift down a dark alley
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u see the news about oil companies suing goverments for 10+ billions for climate change laws that lowered their income
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its insane
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the same ppl that destroy the earth ask money from govs
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Its the top 1% of the world that crave the most money
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Its like watching a bad comedy show
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just give co2 a correct price and oil companies die by themself

19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fossil fuel companies are suing governments across the world for more than $18bn | Climate News

19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> None of this can be fixed while we allow government officials to be “lobbied”
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> obviously the sue wont be a success but it costs shitload of time and money for the legal fees
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for the goverment
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which could have been put to other things
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, it is quite shameless to sue after you are given everything you could ever want
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But if hypercapitalists had any shame or humanity we wouldn’t be here anyway 😄
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no comments
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, fairly off-topic as always. Are we any closer to the release? 😛
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> @heinrich5991 the update on finishing if everybody crossed the startline makes my map TeeInvader unfinishable
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I have to update it now
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> can anyone update maps ?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can fix it please submit a new version
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> ok I'll try to do it fast
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any admin can update the map
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh it got released right now toon
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nooo, this will be so painful to replace with everyone playing it :/
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it a fun map?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would u care if ppl are playing
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need to restart servers by hand then
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :admiralMC:
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gtg, food, ping me when you have a fix @Pipou
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> i have a fix
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I'll send it to you
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> tell me when it's done so we can reload the map 😄
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> @Learath2
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pipou finished uploading
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> yeah thanks 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> is it possible to reload the servers?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I mean, with the map on them
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me see

19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AMD + Valve Focusing On P-State / CPPC Driver With Schedutil For Better Linux Efficiency
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > As reported at the start of August, AMD and Valve have been working on Linux CPU performance/frequency scaling improvements with the Steam Deck being one of the leading motivators
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks steam deck
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pipou I think that was all servers
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> oh ok thanks @Learath2 😄
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I map is finished for a long time now, never thought about that update
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can't parse this sentence
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can probably understand the meaning though 😛
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I made the map a long time ago, never thought about that update
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> @heinrich5991 sorry I corrected it 😄
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is github broken?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i cant access commits on PR
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> always says 404
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its really annoying xD
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i clicked on that like 10 times today already
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can still click on files changed
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to view them
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah thx for the tip
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Jupstar ✪ did you add to redo bors r+ because i commented?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, i dunno why the first didnt work
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe github is really buggy rn xD
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess yup
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> useless question: shouldn't we use nullptr instead of NULL?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> personally idc
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we still use 0 as NULL sometimes
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> NULL is defined as nullptr in c++11 anyway
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 0 can be cast to int, which is potientially more dangerous in overloaded functions
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do use nullptr in new code, we just didn't go around replacing it everywhere
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we still use 0 as NULL sometimes
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> NULL is (probably) defined as nullptr in c++11 anyway
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn, i cant push anymore due to token stuff now 😦
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you mean ssh?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> git push
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Logon failed, use ctrl+c to cancel basic credential prompt.

21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeahz
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you need to generate a ssh key
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Use ssh?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can change the remote with git remote set-url origin  git@github.com:Chairn/ddnet.git
