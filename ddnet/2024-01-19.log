02:41 < bridge> <zbeas> @everyone
03:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> teeguesser!! That sounds epic. @murpi good job. When can matrix/irc users play it?
03:51 < bridge> <roman23051972outlook.com> Hi, is there any api for rendering skins?
03:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I think so
03:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There were so many projects I lost track of where the latest shit is
03:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think teeskins had one
03:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Should add such web services to a listing on the wiki @ryozuki
05:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> still nothing
06:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ finally fixed the "user already logged in error" <:poggers2:1008007455936094328> 
06:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705640992.png
06:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh and my production password is totally not 4 letters
07:14 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> You password's `pass` isnt it :gigachad:
07:14 < bridge> <zhn> :greenthing:
07:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can neither confirm nor deny
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lol @gerdoe why ecs?
08:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How does that help and how do you even imagine ecs being a superset of ddnet physics
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The biggest strength of ecs is not being deterministic per frame
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That allows to reorder events etc. And thus allows multithreading
09:03 < bridge> <sedonya> GameServer()->m_pController->Function
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice chiller. Maybe in 200 years I use the chat again
09:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
09:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am using it more since weechat over ssh with 200 ping is no fun
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> me?
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no u
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your head of wiki
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> wiki is everyone
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> edit
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> go
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> im lazy
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> im developing llvm
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :( 
09:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon ive never used ruby. All i know something related to it is that DHH made ruby on rails :justatest:
09:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep you know a lot already
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i give you another fun fact. It feels like any other scripting language such as python but uses ``do`` and ``end`` for scopes
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can do curley too but yeh
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> know u know ruby your welcome
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now*
09:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I dont know pyson xd
09:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> go use ``irb`` as calculator
09:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works like ``node``
09:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am surprised people outside of ruby lands know DHH 
09:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ive heard his takes :justatest:
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but have you seen him race?
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he has 6 seconds on run_blue
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jk i mean this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNQl0x6WS3M
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> average developer
09:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Average dynamically typed language enjoyer
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
09:27 < bridge> <zhn> +struct RescueComponent
09:27 < bridge> <zhn> add all functionality in RescueComponent
09:27 < bridge> <zhn> +BasicTee->AddComponent(new RescueComponent) in DDNetTee constructor
09:27 < bridge> <zhn> or something like that
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg jipsotiti
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i fixed fucking text selection
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> YOU CAN NOW HILITILE LETTERS WITH DA MOUSE
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epic
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705652948.png
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> haters would say websites can do that out of the box
09:29 < bridge> <zhn> chiller who deleted all the terminals on your system
09:29 < bridge> <zhn> you preffered to talk from irs
09:29 < bridge> <zhn> irc
09:29 < bridge> <zhn> preferred*
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use irc via ssh
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i have 200 ping via ssh so typing is pain af
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chat.zillyhuhn.com has bleeding edge anti ping typing is smooth af
09:30 < bridge> <zhn> u use discord via web-browser via your own web-server
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use irc via my own web frontend :D 
09:30 < bridge> <zhn> okey
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> discord stole the design from me
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had it first
09:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon ever tried using discord?
09:31 < bridge> <zhn> u use discord via irc-server via your own web-server via web-browser
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> something like that
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat ye didnt like it
09:31 < bridge> <zhn> @chillerdragon
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn 
09:32 < bridge> <zhn> i was linking your profile
09:32 < bridge> <zhn> pingdragon
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxax
09:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Chillerdragon when use svelte for frontend? üòè
09:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Or solid
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do i look like webdev?
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vanilla all the way
09:32 < bridge> <zhn> pure html+css+js
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bloat enough that i use webpack
09:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon u know htmx?
09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
09:33 < bridge> <zhn> he really thinks using bloatware discord via his own bloatware is something better xd
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That sounds useful anyway ^^
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah I understand what you mean, but ecs over the whole code base doesn't sound trivial
09:33 < bridge> <zhn> yeah Jupstar that's why i asked i final question in issue
09:33 < bridge> <zhn> a*
09:34 < bridge> <zhn> i don't like idea of introducing ecs to existing ddnet codebase xd
09:34 < bridge> <zhn> even in server-side only
09:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon frontend webdev is all about bloat
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah. I guess we don't really have such event registering
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Use wasm and webgpu
09:35 < bridge> <zhn> use the irc wtf
09:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Svelte and solid not that bad
09:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And htmx ofc üòè
09:36 < bridge> <zhn> @chillerdragon you could make web-client for chatting on tw server without loading full tw-client on board instead of irc-proxied discord web-client
09:38 < bridge> <zhn> i just don't get the point of reinventing square-shaped wheel
09:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It feels good when it's urs square shaped wheel
09:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It feels good when it's ur square shaped wheel
09:39 < bridge> <zhn> he could use matrix instead anyway
09:39 < bridge> <zhn> and make his own matrix client xd
09:39 < bridge> <zhn> zillytrix
09:41 < bridge> <zhn> im sorry if im being rude chiller xd
09:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
09:41 < bridge> <zhn> hadn't my meal in a while
09:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust we trust
09:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> friday
09:41 < bridge> <zhn> no
09:41 < bridge> <zhn> its fenec friday
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn i built such tw webchat in verry crappy already years ago. And do plan to build a bit nicer one. But who knows when i find time for that
09:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When i see ur name, i always read it zsh :justatest:
09:42 < bridge> <zhn> read it as zohan
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn yea reinventing is only useful for educational reasons. I don't really like educating my self. I do it because i am convinced my chat platform is the best out there
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its much faster and nicer looking than any other irc/matrix client
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and its selfhosted and customizable since i know the code
09:44 < bridge> <zhn> you can do the same with matrix
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> easy to deploy
09:44 < bridge> <zhn> its literally just a protocol
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no matrix is ass
09:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> irc is much nicer
09:45 < bridge> <zhn> i don't get it anyway
09:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it works so good
09:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im texting with you just fine
09:50 < bridge> <zhn> anyone also too i guess xd
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea so why use matrix
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because in matrix is nothing just fine
10:15 < bridge> <gumbatw> lol i read it as zuhn
10:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wtf. Rename back to gerdoe xd
10:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its gerdoe!?
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
10:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf 
10:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that should be illegal
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ikr
10:47 < bridge> <zhn> bro's still on irc xd
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: ffr, what do you want to learn about programming?
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> e
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont do rust
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ping ryo
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also friday already over time to go for an evening swim :p 
11:15 < bridge> <zhn> lol how did http code affect client
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It downloads skins
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I always ping him, it's more fun with other ppl too. And you as tw unionist should be prepared for being able to code rust
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok hit me
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But ofc you can also ask a vulkan question
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok i have vulkan question
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We can also discuss what modding model is the best
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do i do a graphical game in c without libraries?
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can implement everything that exists as library you own
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Copy and paste whole Linux ecosystem into a single c file
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt there a simple gfx linux api you can call from raw c directly?
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would be beyond funny
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and go start do some opengl and vulkan
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't think so
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i wanna go a gfx game in C wat i do? SDL? glfw? glew etc?
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The GPUs firmwares are often not even open source
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> SDL has a renderer indeed
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> annoying
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Enough to so very simple things
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> self note: dont update ur llvm pr branch because u will have t compile 4000 files again
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> self note: dont update ur llvm pr branch because u will have to compile 4000 files again
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1197851450592735303/image.png?ex=65bcc518&is=65aa5018&hm=c2d1beac24ba3ae23f93da31bd472d447ccd0e7530893b1be8b317c252190f24&
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> :Kill:
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bloat
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> True
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when suckless C compiler
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Disable some backends
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah wait there is TinyCC
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The problem with c isn't the compiler
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only have x86_64 target, and MLIR,clang and lld projects on
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> not even full llvm
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's the build system
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Buy more cores
11:39 < bridge> <devinci24> Hey, can someone tell me what defines an entity in the code?
11:39 < bridge> <devinci24> My question is more about the dragger. If it didn't visually have the "blue laser" that drags you in would it still be considered an entity? Or just a tile that "sucks you in"?
11:39 < bridge> <devinci24> 
11:39 < bridge> <devinci24> And btw are there any "in deep" (even if just a bit) blogs about the code? It's a bit though to understand some of the checks / methods with names alone
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here are pretty much all dev blogs i know about https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development#External_resources
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no is it missing my epic tw net procotol docs? https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need more coffee
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> finally good looking mobile support
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705661356.png
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Aimazing
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Bruh do you really use everything in white design xd
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is your phone not oled
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rest in pixels
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lol
11:54 < bridge> <devinci24> ChillerDragon: Thanks, I think I found some links that might interest me. Sadly I don't think it will answer half of my questions as there's no link about tiles
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep tiles defs need some docs
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mapitems.h character.cpp is where you wanna look at for tiles and maybe collision.cpp if i have to think out of the top of my head
11:55 < bridge> <devinci24> Do you know if you talk about them in your game controller video? might take a look at it x)
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have been successfully procrastinating recording an episode on tiles for years 
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sorry xd
11:56 < bridge> <devinci24> Nah but there's also entities which might be what I really want
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt cover any of that in the video series
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah you mean code files
11:57 < bridge> <devinci24> ehh yes?
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea my entitity xp boils down to creating "plants" that grow shotgun bullets in 2019 and never really finish it :D
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/commit/b1ee7e5ee3fcb5e71ed1209cdb623207cdd9f75a
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> having a clean blog post for that would be really cool indeed
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke bye
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chillerdragon, do you play star dew valley?
12:17 < bridge> <devinci24> Plants that grow sg bullets? Crazy xD
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chillerdragon: do you think that, if I play stardew valley I'm allowed to join the farmer protests?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 what do you want to know about rust?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Today is ffr
12:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I was stumped a couple of days ago by this: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=a1bff247acdeee922c8a05cb9acb68d8
12:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I know the solution now, but it's still pretty tricky IMO
12:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> line 24 compiles, line 26 doesn't. why?
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah I have that too very often
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess this is simply the borrow checker being too annoying?
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't see why the args have to outlive the outer call
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> make a local
12:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but why?
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder why
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe it doesnt take into account its copy?
12:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unrelated to the question, I asked "why?", not "how to fix?"
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u think this is also a bad code itself, u take mut self when u dont need to
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmmm
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh dunno. The question to me would be, is this fixable. So if it's not, then for some reason the scope of arguments does not end. In asm ud fill the arguments beforehand, so I dunno what the blocker should be
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe it does some logic across statements
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> and within the same statement the function arguments are an expression
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is the new borrow checker also not allowing this?
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it evaluates the same statement with that expression
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> vs
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> evaluating a statement with another statement
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is only example code to show a problem
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> Why would it be allowed? Can't have more than one mut borrow
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, this is fixable
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why is line 24 allowed then?
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you know the answer BTW?
12:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I do, but it's unsatisfying
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess simply the process of how the borrow checker evaluates statements?
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think yes
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i explained it
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> .
12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I thihnk your explanation doesn't show why line 24 would be treated differently from line 26
12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> line 24 has a shared reference at the same time as a unique one, line 26 has two unique ones
12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> both is forbidden
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe because it Parsees the function call as functional
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like there is no real self
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u know the answer?
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but it's unsatisfying
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> well tell it xD
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let's move to the answer I guess
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the answer is that line 24 is allowed by https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/borrow_check/two_phase_borrows.html
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah
12:35 < bridge> <learath2> Yes this
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the only reason line 26 is not included is that they didn't want to whitelist this case, too
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> I was trying to find the docs frantically
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because they thought it would be unintuitive
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> I thought it was called a reborrow, not a two phase borrow üòõ
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So it's actually a self made restriction
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Funny
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> Funnily enough it turned out more unintuitive this way üòÑ
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is interesting
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> bookmarked
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and im gonna quiz my coworkers kek
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> credit goes to @patiga for finding this btw
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2094-nll.html
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This was the rfc
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>  pub fn allows_two_phase_borrow(&self) -> bool {
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>         match *self {
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>             BorrowKind::Shared
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>             | BorrowKind::Fake
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>             | BorrowKind::Mut { kind: MutBorrowKind::Default | MutBorrowKind::ClosureCapture } => {
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 false
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>             }
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>             BorrowKind::Mut { kind: MutBorrowKind::TwoPhaseBorrow } => true,
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>         }
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Before that it also wasn't allowed apparently

12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Man, how did u use rust before non lexical lifetimes
12:49 < bridge> <teero777> yo is it worth just predicting the hook for coll checking to avoid smth like https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1197865529285816320
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Looks very annoying xd
12:50 < bridge> <teero777> yo is it worth just predicting the hook for coll checking to avoid smth like https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1197865529285816320 ?
12:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :greenthing:
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
12:52 < bridge> <teero777> Well predict the hook instead of doing line collision?
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The line literally is the hook prediction
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When standing still
12:52 < bridge> <teero777> No it is not xd
12:52 < bridge> <teero777> Yea
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 100%
12:53 < bridge> <teero777> Check showroom
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Without standing it's not possible
12:53 < bridge> <teero777> It sure is lol?
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Depends on what you mean
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is this video from the person that also hooks
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or does he spec smone
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> nah i mean
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> it downloads skins from server on server select?
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @teero777 that the hookline is wrong if u spec someone is bcs it is send as normalized vec2 rounded to int
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's not because the prediction is wrong
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The server literally sends the wrong cursor position
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Vanilla has some weird decisions like that sadly
12:57 < bridge> <teero777> He's not speccing
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then someone introduced a bug
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The hookline is the prediction if u stand still
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And this guy stands still
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't see his cursor tho
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It must be demo or spec
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Both use snapshot info
13:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it happens even without demo or spec :pepeW:
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Your own tee?
13:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This has to be a bug then.. The code for the hookline is literally just call tick a few times
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or its some windows vs Linux inaccuracies or similar
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Floating point
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is not comparable to the video in showroom
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The video in showroom has a hookline color
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u add a bookable block and its green
13:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i also had yellow color when tee was falling xd
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And u still can't hook
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Try on local server and send a video
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can only repeat myself. Hook line is hook prediction.. At least the color u see must be right
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anything else is a bug in either server code or client
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except I'm missing something important here
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Last time I checked hookline code it was simply doing prediction ticks as if the time stands still
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So as if nothing is moving except the hook
13:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it a bug when it shows that i cant hook thru but  its actually possible?
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd in first place only trust the color of the hook line
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The line itself is also just the direction of the hook multiplied by the theoretical length
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This can include FP inaccuracies already
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So put a hookable block and look if it's green
13:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i never used map editor xd
13:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i joined the same server
13:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and when tee falls hook like becomes yellow
13:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but i cant hook thru
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But tbh since the cursor is not real 360¬∞ I'd already be surprised of you can easily reproduce a hook line that doesn't match the color
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This would already surprise me
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With mouse sens 1 it should be easy to reproduce on the same map
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Always noting I talk about your local player
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Demo and spec are a different problem
13:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> idk if its useful anyhow but here u go
13:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1197877798883295302/bug.mp4?ex=65bcdda2&is=65aa68a2&hm=bacf23b5142997fd7c8e2e365ad514ec219d14117009a28ea79f7b3180150edf&
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you compile your own?
13:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Could be optimizations
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just send map name
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can later check
13:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wasteland
13:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and that guy from showroom uses windows
13:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use linux btw üòè
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I also can't judge your video very well on mobile
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe u are moving your cursor for 1 frame
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is the hook color yellow?
13:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
13:33 < bridge> <devinci24> Can someone tell me what is "snap"? A lot of classes implement some method with that name. it is used to send info or something?
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's basically a memory dump of the current game that is send to keep clients in sync
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Snapshot
13:36 < bridge> <devinci24> Yeah okay thanks. I wasn't too sure about it
13:38 < bridge> <cyberfighter> @murpi how 2 play teeguesser? or does it not exist yet lmai
13:41 < bridge> <teero777> @patiga btw what are u up to rn?
13:43 < bridge> <patiga> currently `twsnap`, a rusty and heavily typed snapshot representation shared between Zwelfs twgame and my twgpu. I am currently nearly done with adding compatibility (via conversion) with the ddnet snap format via libtw2
13:44 < bridge> <murpi> Not done yet
13:44 < bridge> <patiga> https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twsnap/-/
13:44 < bridge> <murpi> Getting enough images for the quizzes takes quite a lot of time
13:45 < bridge> <cyberfighter> aw
13:45 < bridge> <patiga> for rendering I need some physics, and we also have some plans with other funky stuff where we need interoperability
13:45 < bridge> <cyberfighter> it would be funny if there was also like difficulty sorting
13:46 < bridge> <patiga> hm seems to be private still xd
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epic
13:46 < bridge> <cyberfighter> or an alternative view in entities
13:46 < bridge> <zhn> no its not
13:46 < bridge> <zhn> just delete `-/` at the end
13:46 < bridge> <zhn> but it was afaik xd
13:46 < bridge> <zhn> checked ddnet-rs week ago
13:46 < bridge> <patiga> nice, works
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So demo viewer ready?
13:47 < bridge> <patiga> well thats where I need physics: dead reckoning and projectiles (coz they also need tunes and stuff)
13:49 < bridge> <patiga> do you have an active project rn? :)
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is the Id generator limited by tw code. Is that how tw generates ids too?
13:55 < bridge> <teero777> is it not automated?
13:55 < bridge> <patiga> I thin that originates from Zwelfs twgame
13:55 < bridge> <teero777> i thought ddnet has map webview?
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh OK. Bcs I see legacy Id etc. Xd
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ddnet  also has a demo viewer on web
13:57 < bridge> <patiga> thats a small compatibility feature. afaik it does not interfer with the uid system
13:57 < bridge> <murpi> How do I not accidentally show the map logo? How do I make sure I actually get a part of the map and not just a blank space of the map?
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It would probably be interesting if twgame is capable of accepting unique integers as IDs
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's the approach I did.. So not divided into player etc
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> just set up some requiremtns. so 
13:58 < bridge> <teero777>  -> dont show anything within spawn tile reach
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> -> atleast x types of block on the screen
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> just set up some requiremtns. so 
13:58 < bridge> <teero777>  -> dont show anything within spawn tile reach
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> -> atleast x dioffrent types of block on the screen
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> just set up some requiremtns. so 
13:59 < bridge> <teero777>  -> dont show anything within spawn tile reach
13:59 < bridge> <teero777>  -> atleast x dioffrent types of block on the screen
13:59 < bridge> <patiga> if that is what you are implying, yea twgame is built to be extendible to more than 64 players with uids
14:00 < bridge> <patiga> right and in twsnap, player character ddnetcharacter ddnetplayer and whatever else existed is merged into a single object
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean for me an entity has a unique Id. No matter the entity type
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
14:01 < bridge> <patiga> hm iirc that is not the case in twgame as of now, @zwelf2 ?
14:04 < bridge> <murpi> 1. Logos aren't necessarily at or near the spawn tile (e.g after noobfilters)
14:04 < bridge> <murpi> 2. this wouldn't work well at all and just makes most quizzes impossible to guess
14:08 < bridge> <devinci24> Logos aren't really an issue imo. On geoguessr you can spawn in front of a very known monument/somewhere where the name of the city it's written. It's not necessarily a bad thing.
14:08 < bridge> <devinci24> And for 2., Couldn't you just take screenshots closer to the center of the map?afaik borders are usually empty but the more you go into the middle the higher is the chance to get some parts (might be wrong, it's a feeling).
14:08 < bridge> <teero777> just set up some requiremtns. so 
14:08 < bridge> <teero777>  -> dont show anything within spawn tile reach
14:08 < bridge> <teero777>  -> atleast x diffrent types of block on the screen
14:09 < bridge> <murpi> A image quiz with the answer literally written on the image is not a problem? lmao
14:09 < bridge> <cyberfighter> :troll:
14:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> LMAO imagine like on google maps where they censor license plates
14:10 < bridge> <devinci24> That's ohw it works on geoguessr ^^ . And by the name of your game it looks like you got inspired out of it
14:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> so logos get censored
14:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> :troll: :troll: :troll:
14:10 < bridge> <devinci24> And it's never been an issue
14:11 < bridge> <devinci24> It can even make it more pleasant as you can get some free guesses, and not only impossible ones where only people who know 10000 maps can answer ^^
14:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Automate it
14:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> consider reading the rest of the chat, chillerdragon
14:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye saw it too now
14:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I do not play it. And what farmer protests?
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lmao. Did you emigrate already
14:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?
14:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> :D
14:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk what you talking about
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah, maybe that is also better
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Enjoy life. Peace out
14:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Enlighten me pls
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Bro is somewhere in asia
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Read German news
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller when speak japanese
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> japanization beam
14:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am not planning to learn any Lange
14:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe Russian
14:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxaxaxaxa rip germans https://www.dw.com/en/germany-farmers-protest-causes-nationwide-disruption/live-67913441
14:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:29 < bridge> <zwelf2> in twgame all non-tee entities have a unique id and all tees have a separate unique id pool
14:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> you didnt realise this is a thing? man you lost your german privileges
14:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I had no idea
14:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This channel is my news
14:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i couldnt get to work for 3 days - was great
14:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> lots of teeworlds!
14:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxa
14:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Holy that‚Äôs intense
14:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> bayern eben
14:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> <@1142119515782643823>: but yea I think stardew valley qualifies. Since this game is clearly also affected by the government planned changes to agriculture
14:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go get your shovel and sit somewhere on a street for 20 hours
14:32 < bridge> <zhn> pay him
14:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: did you know that s√∂der wants the wehrpflicht back
14:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wtf no
14:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I mean wants and something happening is different
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh ok
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did you just ping yourself?
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I actually wanted to ask if u want to play it against me. But since u never played, would be unfair for you
14:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I pinged you
14:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye I nob
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No
14:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And is it pvp game wtf?
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You pinged urself
14:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1197897556416540742/ima_2956a88.png?ex=65bcf009&is=65aa7b09&hm=618a090f4c0d76bd166ba55d4ba96471365435b1d3c18b3545b536320b6ce289&
14:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go ping your self!
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No, but true capitalists battle each other in a economy game
14:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd

14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bridge Moment
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Probably a bug
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Because u pinged the bot
14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Average matrix functionality
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U pinged my matrix acc
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's why
14:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> <@1142119515782643823>: Jupstar ‚ú™ @jupeyy_keks
14:39 < bridge> <Zwelf> https://github.com/mautrix/discord/issues
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xdd
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It even changes the name of the ping afterwards
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now it's zwelf
14:40 < bridge> <Zwelf> if anyone wants to report
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm too lazy
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I guess impossible to fix
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And probably known
14:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> did someone move channels?
14:40 < bridge> <matodor> guys i want to use github as storage for a lot of files (each ~10mb)
14:40 < bridge> <matodor> how i can push their and do not take up local disk space?
14:40 < bridge> <matodor> for example delete from working directory and maybe where from `.git` folder? or create new branch per file, push and delete local branch and branch history?
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs a feature
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs the bot renames
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> They could at least remove the ping
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: can you link the known issue?
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im not browsing their gh now
14:41 < bridge> <Zwelf> ah, thats why
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> complaining is easy, report bugs
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nah it takes time
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i complain that complaining is easy
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs known
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> where do i report that
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :troller:
14:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Use multiple repositories
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: will you send me 10‚Ç¨ if it's not an I report it? üôÇ
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: will you send me 10‚Ç¨ if it's not and I report it? üôÇ
14:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No I‚Äôm poor
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Stfu jospri
14:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Better fix real issues than report non bugs
14:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> For example that element shows I have a new notification at all times -.-
14:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or Ryozukis message empty is
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1197899832115867658/image.png?ex=65bcf227&is=65aa7d27&hm=514932cf9aa193f478bcbd384c362a5e6b10ff40cdf8bcc4b3942bcf8e3e85fa&
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> a sticker
14:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or that the preview of this channel contains a different message than the lastest
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> lol go is such a mess
14:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes go is literally a tracking spy ware by google
14:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Least privacy respecting language eu west
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not as cool as C and not as safe as rust
14:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And weird nil checks
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes rust is better
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> the only thing go has that rust doesnt is the goroutines
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> and gc
14:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye I was told they pog
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> preemptive scheduling
14:51 < bridge> <zhn> i bet someone released gc for rust
14:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
14:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> As a macro
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> no but u cant do some stuff in rust that u can in go
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz go gc and scheduler allow to interrupt the program at places u cant in rust
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz it needs compiler support
14:51 < bridge> <zhn> ah yes
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but rust is better
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> more perf
14:52 < bridge> <zhn> will anyone make a rust runtime to do go-debug xd
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u hear the term debugging the past
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth like that
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> time debugging
14:52 < bridge> <zhn> nope
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_debugging
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://undo.io/products/udb
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://firedbg.sea-ql.org/
14:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> frame \#1
14:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> gdb has you covered
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> gdb cant do this iirc
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rr
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is what you need
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rr_(debugging)
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> does rr work for rust
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know, but I'd guess so
14:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I only need backtrace and old variables frame command can do that in gdb
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since it only uses the linux syscall interface and gdb
14:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What else would you need from the past
14:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I used it to debug ddnet in the past
14:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> stepping back can be quite useful
14:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to see where a function returned, e.g.
14:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Isn‚Äôt that in the backtrace already?
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
14:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah not the return I guess if there are multiple. Just where it called from
14:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I see
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> say a function returns `nullptr`
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you want to figure out why
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with rr, it's simple
14:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye I got it
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> still want to elaborate
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you go past the return, and then just step back once
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay matrix started shuffling messages again
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you see where the function returned
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I go rq
14:57 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> chiller dont be rude, heinrich is explaining stuff to you atm
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye ye I saw his msg
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not necessarily to chillerdragon
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like the explanation
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Made sense
14:57 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> same, sounds cool
14:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Now I rq
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just because I wanted to elaborate
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> never refuse to learn :owo:
14:58 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :brownbear:
14:58 < bridge> <zhn> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless its pyson
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
14:58 < bridge> <zhn> also in go
14:58 < bridge> <zhn> time to do bridge in rust xd
14:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, that project is quite nice
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
14:59 < bridge> <zhn> matterbridge goes strange if you change configurations files in wrong way
14:59 < bridge> <zhn> went at least
14:59 < bridge> <zhn> afair it printed nothing if you messed up config
14:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> didn't change configuration a lot
15:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess I never ran into it
15:05 < bridge> <patiga> ooh, could be neat to track where a repeatedly-propagated error originally comes from in Rust
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, stuff like that

15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u agree
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i personally say peeNgee
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> like in spanish
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
15:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do u know how to pronounce json correctly? üòè
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i say
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> jason
15:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-f4b0G9lo
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> who doesnt pronounce it pe-en-gee? XD
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> jizzon <a:PepeLaugh:951572576046571600>
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-394
15:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> jsml üòè
15:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> go = jo
15:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> because gif = jif
15:36 < bridge> <zhn> hard p hard n and hard g
15:36 < bridge> <zhn> p from project
15:36 < bridge> <zhn> n from nails
15:37 < bridge> <zhn> g from go
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 100% wtf
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ping
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also don't like klang for clang
15:38 < bridge> <zhn> we call it shlang
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gedo for godot
15:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what about malloc :p
15:38 < bridge> <zhn> shmalloc xd
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> m alloc
15:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> sqrt ü§®
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> square root
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont cut it
15:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> sql ? √§skiuel
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ure not in the club :justatest:
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah i hate sequel
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i call it S Q L
15:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :D
15:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> same
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> This is wrong and illegal
16:08 < bridge> <gravitycontained> if you pronounce sql as sequel, you have to pronounce png as pengel
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> more like peneg
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> panic
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> png = panic confirmed
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> Also gif is pronounced with a hard g, not a j
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> give

16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rustls-borrow-checker-p1/
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it is accurate
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tested with mouse sens 1
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all possible angles are either going through or not
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> using steam client
18:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> then its my problems :\
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or i am not able to reproduce it
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean u also tried like 1 minute
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but anyway, i'd say on a local server, where client & server use the same FP calculations, it should as far as i know be accurate
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if not, ofc would be nice to fix it, but i guess it's more an accuracy problem than a missing prediction feature or whatever üòÑ
18:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> then its a feature for me üòè
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's the spirit
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :bluekitty:
18:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have a website with bunch of features :justatest:
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not a bug, it's a feature
18:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have a website with bunch of "features" :justatest:
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet "features"
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> where does CQuad.m_Points[4] // pivot appears to be used?
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> appear*
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in graphics code you mean?
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> anywhere xd
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> i don't think server-side does anything with quads
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it only [4] not [5]? üòÑ
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> ```cpp
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> struct CQuad
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> {
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     CPoint m_aPoints[5];
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     CColor m_aColors[4];
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     CPoint m_aTexcoords[4];
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> 
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     int m_PosEnv;
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     int m_PosEnvOffset;
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> 
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     int m_ColorEnv;
18:18 < bridge> <zhn>     int m_ColorEnvOffset;
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> };```
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> server could be optimized to not use them
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah 5 makes more sense
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its the 4 corners + the mid
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in maplayers it's used for rendering ofc
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u can also simply search all references
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in your IDE
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> yeah that's what i did xd
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> server could be optimized to not load them
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> this one goes brr
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> `void *pID = &pQuad->m_aPoints[4]; // use pivot addr as id`
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah that's fine
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it accesses the 5th point as center
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno why it uses that as ID, but i guess that's bcs of our weird UI code
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> its editor code
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> quad rotates to its center
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> thats why it should be saved xd
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> too much for me to understand from the first look ig
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üïµÔ∏è
22:06 < bridge> <zhn> rearranging furniture xd
